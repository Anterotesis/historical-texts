            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE to the Reader.</head>
            <p>ALtho' I have moſt commonly found the Pretenders to New-Light, and
rare Inventions (ſo common now a-Days) no more but Pretenders;
yet having ſomething of Curioſity, ſhall I call it, or Vanity, to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive
for Truth in ſuch Pretenſions; the noiſe of a New-Light of Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and a New Method of Phyſick Built upon Principles directly contrary to,
and overthrowing all whatſoever has been done by the whole World of Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
could not but excite in me an Attention, and cauſe me to enquire into
the Truth of ſuch a Report. But when I had Read over one or two of thoſe
Books which at length gave occaſion and Matter to the following Diſcourſe
(tho' they contain ſomething, I confeſs very <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncommon) I found nothing
which could give me the leaſt Stomach to another Meal of the ſame, or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
to any New-Diſh, afterwards preſented by the ſame Author. I had
found his Sawce ſowr enough, and the Diſhes Garniſh'd with Oranges and
Lemons; but the Meat it ſelf ſo Raw and Inſipid, I ſet it by as a ſort of ſtuff
I had for ever enough of. But ſometime ſince, converſing with divers Perſons
having little, or no Skill in Medicinal Cookery, and finding them highly
Commend as choiſe Viands, thoſe things which I knew would be but of bad Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion,
and very apt to breed ill Humours: And conſidering that it becomes
an Honeſt and Generous Phyſician, as well to Adviſe what things may preſerve,
or be prejudicial to the Health of his Neighbours, as to heal their Diſeaſes;
<hi>I</hi> begun to think, whether I was not oblig'd in Duty to Mankind, as well to
Diſcover the evil Practice of another, as to labour to act rightly my ſelf. And
foraſmuch as I know, an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonable and Raſh Method of Phyſick, tho' it
hurts not Phyſicians, may more than endanger the Lives and Healths of the
People, tho' not in the Theory, yet in the Practice which is made upon them,
I was perſwaded once more to Read over what I had before been ſated
with, and what farther has been offer'd by the Author of the pretended
New-Method, and to tranſcribe, and make ſome Remarks upon ſome of the
chief Things whereby he endeavours to perſawde the Truth of what he calls
his New-Hypotheſis: Which when I had done, I could not but yet more admire
what it was in this Author, that Perſons of any Literature and Senſe, whether
Young Phyſicians, or Gentlemen found ſo taking; ſomething very <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncommon,
as I ſaid, there is. But what? <gap reason="foreign">

ſaies: Yet which methinks is ſtrangely accounted now-a-days ſo great a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification,
and particularly in a Phyſician, that it can attone for, Yes, and
ſet off, all the Imperfections, and Deformities of bad Language, want of
Reaſon, Reiterated Tautologies, Contradictions and Calumnies, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of a Quack Book, Bill, or Speech, can be guilty of. I was a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie
to think that the Judgment of our Age ſeem'd ſo declin'd it ſuch, and ſuch
Perſons: But yet they might have embrac'd their Nonſenſe, and hugg'd their falſe
<hi>Juno</hi> long enough for me, <hi>Sed quod luditur de corio, imo de vita Humana,</hi>
but that her Embraces I knew, might prove unwholſome to them. Which I
think, will appear in the following Diſcourſe, to all that will but grant that
the Art of Healing is grounded upon Reaſon, and Experimental Philoſophy.
<pb facs="tcp:59081:3"/>
The way of Dialogue I choſe to Write in, I think, will not only be leſs tireſome,
but more eaſie and profitable to my Reader; ſince I have Tranſcrib'd from
my Author Word for Word, all that I take occaſion to Speak too, for the moſt
part under the Perſon of <hi>Acid,</hi> but what farther Excerptions I Reflect upon,
Rehearſed by <hi>Alkali,</hi> you will find noted in Italick Characters, ſo that you
may ſave the Trouble or Charge of turning to his Books, in Reading mine.
Wherein I aſſure you, I have not abuſed him. or alter'd his Senſe in a Tittle,
that I know of, or added, more than ſome few Words of Connexion, and the
entrance of the Diſcourſe, which the Juſteſt Reader, I ſuppoſe, will pardon
as a ſmall Tranſgreſſion againſt the Man that I never ſaw, or owe any more Ill-Will
too, than him that I never heard of, but wiſh him really, as great (if it
were poſſible) as he ſaies he is, and would have us eſteem him. 'Tis one of the
Main Poynts of my Religion, tho' I am a Phyſician, That I ought to be a
Friend to all Men; but I am ſomewhat of the Opinion of <hi>Plautus, Amicum
non caſtigare ob merita, mala noxia imane et facinus,</hi> I think it a
Fault, not to reprove thoſe Errors, even in a Friend, that may be of evil
Conſequence. But here are Errors, that may endanger even the Lives of
better Men than him that I reprehend, if ſo unfortunate as to be entic'd by
the love of ſharp Sawces, &amp; to fall into the Hands of ſo Bold a Medicaſter. The
expoſing af whoſe Faults, I know, may be in ſome reſpect to his Private Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
but the Publick-Good, ought to be eſteem'd greater than the Private-Intereſt
of any Man. <hi>Salus enim populi Suprema lex eſt.</hi> Yet if things
be Weighed in the moſt juſt Ballance, I think it may be found, That I have
ſaid nothing againſt our Doctor, or which, may not be for his real Benefit,
whom I look upon as a Sick-Man, and am ſo far of his own Opinion, as to
think his Diſeaſe cannot be Cured without ſharp Medicines; which tho' he
may as little like in the Swallowing, or Application, as ſome of his Patients
may the Effects of his <hi>Acid</hi>-Doſes, I hope yet it may be for his Health here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
But there are ſo many things in my Author, which are the Breakings
forth of Vicious Humours, I am doubtful whether I ſhall be reckon'd culpable
for giving him ſo many, or ſo few Doſes, and applying my Corroſives to ſo many,
or ſo few of his Sores. I fear you will be weary of ſeeiug him Dreſs'd: Yet I
hope no Phyſician, or Chirurgeon, no, nor Gentleman, or Lady, but may ſee
ſomething worth their while; being if not ſo pleaſant, yet of uſeful Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Therefore I ſhall no longer detain you at the Door of my Lazar-Houſe,
but take you in to hear, and ſee, the Badneſs of my Patient, and what ſort of
Medicines I have Prepared for him. And tho' you will hear him Talk ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Talk like a Mad-Man (his Diſeaſe being much in his Head) and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
thoſe that have done for him, as he has always done, calling all his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
Scoundrels, except Dr. <hi>Tuthil</hi> who got a little into his Favour;
yet you need not fear if you don't come too near him, any more than I do, tho'
I am reſolv'd to handle him cloſely, that if poſſible the poor Young-Man may
have the benefit, and I the Credit of ſo great a Cure. But however it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
I confeſs, I am almoſt aſham'd of Preparing ſo many Remedies for ſo
mean a Patient: But long Bills are Faſhionable, and my medicines given
Gratis.</p>

ALKALI, and ACID.</head>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Al.</speaker>
               <p>WELL met Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> whither are you hurrying ſo
faſt, to ſome Heroe run through the Lungs, or the
Heart?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ac.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhould hardly ſtay to tell you Mr. <hi>Alkali,</hi> but that I am
engag'd to oppoſe you where-ever we meet, you <hi>Principle of Death
and Corruption,</hi> I am always provok'd by you, you have done ſo
much miſchief in the World: And now to your farther reproach,
I have a freſh inſtance of your badneſs, by a Meſſenger from my
Lord <hi>Lazington,</hi> whom you have plagu'd with a fit of the <hi>Gout,</hi> and
that a deſperate one if I come not in time to his aſſiſtance, none
can help him but I, and he thinks it 7 Years e're I come to him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Al.</speaker>
               <p>You are very ſharp Mr. <hi>Acid.</hi> I ſometime ſince heard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that you have reptoach'd me in all Companies, even in
Coffee-Houſes, as well as wrote Books againſt me, but now I find
it true: I am glad I have met with you, to tell you, you have
ſcandalouſly reported divers things of me, which if you can't prove
to my Face, I ſhall not eaſily put up the Injury, nor part with
you willingly without Proof, or Submiſſion. Let my Lord <hi>Lazington</hi>
roar a little, you will be the welcomer when you come; and I
know you can tell how to excuſe your delay; ſome Duke or other
had ſent for you before, and perhaps my Lord will do as well
without you. Let us try whether you can maintain your Charge:
You call me the <hi>Principle of Death and Corruption,</hi> and I hear you
ſay, I am the <hi>cauſe of all Diſeaſes,</hi> and that you alone are the Dr.
that can do any thing conſiderable in the Cure of them, and that
by deſtroying and expelling <hi>Alkali:</hi> And this you make an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis
of, and call it a new one, of your diſcovery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ac.</speaker>
               <p>I am ſo far from denying what I have ſaid againſt <hi>Alkali,</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59081:4"/>
that I continue ſtill to aſſert my Hypotheſis. <hi>That all the</hi> Alkali
<hi>in the Blood is moſt certainly an Excrement in a way of being carried
off by ſome of the Emunctories, and when any of the Emunctories
chance to be ſtopp'd, that the</hi> Alkali <hi>has not room to paſs out, then there
is a Diſeaſe. And the matter of all our Dſtempers is the ſame. And
whereas</hi> Acids <hi>are contrary to</hi> Alkalies <hi>(there being a conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them where-ever they meet) their being given in due proportion,
will leſſen the matter of the Diſtemper, and in time, totally extirpate
it. Similia ſimilibus gaudent, &amp; contraria contrariis curantur.</hi> And I
am ſo abſolutely confirm'd in the truth of my Hypotheſis, that I
am ſure it is not in the power of any one to overthrow it. Nay
the Hypotheſis on which I build, I am ſure is true. And I have in
all my Writings, Truth for my Guide: But the oppoſition I have
met with, hath been almoſt inſupportable. Truth at its firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
never wants Oppoſers. But the New Doctrine I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
has gain'd ſo much Ground, that few Authors in their own
Life-time, have ſcarce ſeen the like. This unwonted and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Encouragement, has fill'd me with a ſenſe of Gratitude,
to me inexpreſſible. Reaſon is the true Touch-ſtone, by which
we ought to Examine every thing, and I have never advanc'd any
thing, till weigh'd in the Ballance of my beſt Reaſon, and yet, leſt
Reaſon ſhould deceive me, and I ſo impoſe on the World; I have
always join'd Experience to it; ſo both being conjoin'd, I could
not well deceive my ſelf, nor lead others into Error. That
Prodigy of Nature. Mrs. <hi>Anne Baynard,</hi> ſaid in my hearing, that,
<hi>Reaſon was that Eternal Standard God Almighty, as a Ray of his own
Image has impreſs'd upon Man, to the election, or diſlike of what may
hurt, or ſuccour him; and where this is rais'd and improv'd, makes
him an Angel, where ſunk and depreſs'd, a groveling Brute.</hi>

               <p>I find your Confidence, Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> as great as I have heard
it reported, which is no Argument to me, that you are in the right;
Confidence and Ignorance being uſually Companions: And I am
the more perſwaded it may be in the power, of ſome one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to overthrow your Hypotheſis. If you were ſure of the
truth of it, I confeſs, it would be impoſſible it ſhould be found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true:
But I ſupopſe you only fancy your ſelf ſure. That you
have Truth for your Guide, I ſuppoſe (if you know what you ſay)
you mean, you have ſome certain Truths, as Rules to guide you to
the invention of others: But perhaps, you may as other fallible
Men, take ſome things for Truths that are not true, or not know
how to uſe them as Rules, if they are ſo. What oppoſition you
have met with I know not, it ſeems it was what you could hardly
bear, I doubt you have thereby confeſs'd, your ſtrength to be but
weak. Why Truth ſhould always have Oppoſers at firſt, I ſee
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59081:4"/>
not, unleſs when it is not clearly demonſtrated, as your Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
(to let you ſuppoſe it true) is not, as you will go near to find,
before we have done. And as for the ground, you ſay your new
Doctrine has gain'd in your (but yet ſhort) life-time, beyond the
Inventions of other Authors, which ſo ſurfeits your Heart with
Joy, I think no body elſe ſees it; for I could never yet meet with
any one Ingenious Man of your Opinion. And if any few un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary
<hi>Tyros,</hi> or Perſon not ſtudious of Nature, have been pleaſed
with your Fancies, I believe, if they will but uſe their Reaſon,
which you ſay is <hi>the Touchſtone of Truth, by which we are to examine
all things;</hi> they will find Reaſon to alter their Opinion, and find
their Maſter <hi>Acid</hi>'s beſt reaſon was but a falſe ballance, and did
indeed deceive him, and that his experience was but miſtaken ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
and ſo impos'd upon the Maſter, and Scholars too.
But that Reaſon is an eternal Standard, I do not ſee; tho' the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Mrs. <hi>Ann Baynard</hi> ſaid ſo: I rather think her and you, too
prodigious Metaphyſitians; For I take Reaſon to be peculiar to
Creatures, and that Creatures and whatever belongs to them are
not Eternal, unleſs in the ſame ſenſe, as an ignorant pretender in
Phyſick in the <hi>Beaux</hi> Language, would be call'd an eternal <hi>Quack.</hi>
Neither can I ſee by any of your reaſonings Reaſon ſo improved
in your ſelf, as to give any body any ground to take you for an
Angel. Mrs. <hi>Ann Baynard</hi> might be a great Wit for ought I know,
and Wit and Beauty in a Woman, might poſſibly make a youngſter
miſtake her even for a Goddeſs, and to be ſaid to be Witty and
Pretty would pleaſe moſt Women, and by pleaſing the Women, a
Doctor may be likely to meet with an Angel ſometimes you know

               <p>The Doctrine I have advanced is ſo directly contrary to
every thing that has been wrote yet, it is enough to ſtartle
any young Man, nay ſome old ones too; but I have ſo enquir'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Diſeaſes, as to be altogether certain of the Truth of my Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,
but not ſo as to make People Immortal, which I believe
ſome expect from me: But let People lay aſide prejudice and ſet
themſelves to make Experiments, I am ſure they will lay aſide
their old Notions, and embrace my new Hypotheſis, and I am mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
certain that my new Doctrine of <hi>Acids</hi> at preſent ſo much
decry'd, will ſoon obtain the publick vogue, carrying a ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
along with it, and ſome People will be ſo enamour'd with
it, as to uſe <hi>Acids</hi> with as much reaſon, as others now uſe the
<hi>Cortex;</hi> which has been brought ſo extravagantly in vogue, that
ſome uſe it in all Diſtempers, and I believe it will in time, be put
into Plaſters to Cure Corns. By this may be ſeen the inſtability
of Humane Nature that is more govern'd by Fancies than by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59081:5"/>
ſo that what is to day condemn'd is to morrow in great
value. But the Doctrine of <hi>Acids</hi> being a thing of Univerſal extent,
it is impoſſible any one ſhould do ſo much miſchief with them, as
with the <hi>Cortex.</hi>

               <p>If your Doctrine is directly contrary to every thing yet
wrote, it is very likely to be contrary to Truth; for doubtleſs there
has been ſome Truth wrote before. But I am not at all ſtartled
at your Doctrine Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> tho' I confeſs, I am neither very young,
nor old. What a Novice, or an Old Dotard may be, I know not;
but if any thing be ſtartling, it is your Impudence, which indeed
ſeems Monſtrous: That a <hi>Muſhroom</hi> in Phyſick ſhould ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
oppoſe all that has been yet wrote by all the Learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
of all Ages, and pretend to have ſo enquir'd into Diſeaſe
ſince Yeſterday, as to be certain that the long Study and Practice
of all other Men gave them nothing but miſtakes; but your little
time has produced abſolute certainty. But truly, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Opinion of your ſelf, I dare ſay no body expects Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
from you. As for prejudice, you would have us lay aſide, I
believe I laid it aſide, for ſome time before you began with the
ſtudy of Pharmacy, and have ever ſince made Experiments, and
I believe, have had more opportunity, as well as time, to carry
on a courſe of experimental Philoſophy, than your ſelf; (not to
diſparage you) yet I cannot lay aſide all my Notions thereby got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and embrace your new Hypotheſis. Your moral Certainty
that it will obtain the Publick Vogue, is no better than to ſay, an
uncertain certainty. Nor is your Doctrine ſelf-evident to any but
Mr. <hi>Acid</hi>'s own ſharp ſelf; whoſe Eyes perhaps are Microſcopes
in compariſon to other Mens. But there is no fear, People will
be enamoured with your Hypotheſis it has ſo ſoure a Countenance.
But the inſtability of Humane Nature, (I confeſs) is ſuch, and ſome
other Men are ſo much govern'd by Fancies as well as you, that
poſſibly <hi>Acids</hi> may be uſed with the like reaſon, and extravagance
as ſome have uſed the <hi>Cortex;</hi> but they will hardly mix them
with Plaiſters. But tho' <hi>Alkalies</hi> ſhould be to day wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
perhaps they may be to morrow in as great value as ever.
And if it be not poſſible to do ſo much miſchief with <hi>Acids,</hi> as
with the <hi>Cortex;</hi> yet I believe, ſome Perſons may find enough done
with them to diſſwade us from uſing them as you would have us:
But I am certain, a confident Empirick may do a great deal of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
with <hi>Acids, Alkalies, Cortex,</hi> or any thing.</p>

               <p>How ſhould People have known your Hypotheſis long

Man God has given Eyes to, till which is done, I cannot but look

and uncommon Arrogancy to aſſert your ſelf the only Wiſe, yea
and honeſt Man pretending to Phyſick; and that you have nothing
ſelfiſh in you, but to leave a Name to Poſterity. Truly methinks,
you are as ſelfiſh as any body: But as for a a Name to Poſterity,
it's pity you ſhould want it, I'll help you, that you may be ſure
to have it, and not for nothing. I wiſh you could have written
in <hi>Latin,</hi> that all the World might have known you. Tho' you
ſay, you want Univerſity-Gloſſes, you are Rhetorical enough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Sir; for you have abundance of Hyperboles, nor want you
other choiſe Foiles to ſet off your Diamonds, nor are your Truths
naked, but ſo dreſs'd up (if you have any) that I cannot ſee the
Faces of them. But you commend your ſelf ſo much, it looks not
like force put upon you; nor do you ſeem ſo meale-mouth'd, or
over modeſt as you ſay you are, but ſpeak roundly enough. It's
pity Truth ſhould ſuffer, or you be oppreſs'd for your Virtue,
Poor young Man: but it may be hoped you will grow ſtronger.
But you have had extraordinary Helps, conſtant Succeſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
Providence has got you Friends, and ſupported you
againſt ſo many Enemies, all the Chirurgeons in the World, and
after the Phyſitians. Has your Fame ſpread ſo largely? Certainly this
muſt be by ſome uncommon Providence, for I cannot find, that

half the Chirurgeons, or Phyſitians in <hi>England</hi> have heard of
you, (but I will endeavour that they may) much leſs all the

Language. But prethee <hi>John</hi> let me hear no more of theſe brags,

               <p>In all Diſeaſes, Phyſicians have unanimouſly agreed, that
<hi>Acids</hi> have abounded; and if to ſuch a Degree, that their <hi>Alkalies</hi>
could not conquer it, then the Patient Dy'd. And as for <hi>Alkalous</hi>
Medicines, I dare be poſitive, they never yet Cured any one Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper;
but frequently have done a great deal of miſchief. If
any ever receiv'd any advantage by them, I dare be burnt. If they
be given in acute Diſeaſes, and Nature be ſtrong, ſhe throws off
the load in ſpight of them; if weak, they add to the load, and
ſhe falls under it. In Chronical Diſeaſes, ſuch as the <hi>Gout,</hi> poor
Mortals are let alone to languiſh under the Diſtemper. But you
may ſay, If my Hypotheſis be true, how have others, miſtaken
Phyſicians, Cur'd Diſeaſes? I anſwer, I own they have Cur'd
ſome Diſeaſes, but they could never tell how: They have given
<hi>Steel, Antimony,</hi> and other Preparations, without enquiring into
the nature of them, ſuppoſing them <hi>Alkalies;</hi> when they at the

               <p>Truly <hi>John,</hi> your Diſcourſe begins to grow nauſeous: You
are not yet Forty Years old, and could you have ſpent Thirty of
them in reading the Writings of Phyſicians, you could not have
read the Tenth part of what they have Writ, much leſs have
known, what ſucceſs they always had in their Practice. And as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
as you are, I believe, I ſhall give you matter of Fact, as well
as Reaſon, enough to convince any modeſt Man, that Diſeaſes
have been Cur'd by <hi>Alkalies,</hi> and when you are convinc'd, I would
counſel you, to burn your Books, rather than your ſelf, as dareing
as you are. And for ſhame forbear to accuſe all Phyſicians at this
rate, either never to have Cur'd Diſeaſes, or now and then to have
done it ignorantly, they knew not how, by giving <hi>Acids</hi> at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.

of our own Nation, or are they leſs Men: You cannot well be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
that ſome of the College you applaud ſo, are Foreigners,
and as deſerving as any of the reſt. Nor have Foreigners impos'd
on Young Phyſicians, more than thoſe of our own Nation, nor
have they been always Men more full of Chymera's, or leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Experiments; as every one acquainted with the
Medical World muſt acknowledg. Nor was Young Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> the
fitteſt Man to undeceive Young Phyſicians; he ſhould have left it
to Older Heads, or have ſtay'd a little longer. Was there none of
the Fathers of the <hi>Noble Society,</hi> whom after you had abuſed in

of the whole World: I ſay, was there none of them that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood

we ſhall find, that Phyſicians have uſed <hi>Acids,</hi> knowing them
to be ſuch, long before you were Born; thinking rightly, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Acids</hi> nor <hi>Alkalies</hi> alone Cure Diſeaſes; but a Phyſician uſing
them all with other things, when, and where he ſees occaſion.
And to convince you, and ſhew you how apt you are to contradict

               <p>It is true. Some few other Phyſitians have uſed <hi>Acids,</hi> but
the aſſiſtance I had from them is inconſiderable as to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Principles, and if I have made any good ſteps, it is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to my own induſtry; for tho' I was not bred at Univerſity,
I have taken as much true pains to inform my ſelf in all parts of
Phyſick, perhaps as any Man ever did: And ſpent as much Money
to qualifie me for the practice of Phyſick as moſt Men, who have
ſpent their time in the Univerſities, and I have had ocular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
for my Money, when as ſome of our Univerſity-Men
have had only the fuſty Notions of Old <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> for theirs. And
tho' I have not ſaid all that is to be ſaid in behalf of my Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,
yet I have ſaid ſo much, that I believe I may boldly ſay,
it is the beſt and cleareſt Hypotheſis now extant, on which the
cure of Diſeaſes may be attempted on greater certainty, than on
any other Publick.</p>

               <speaker>Al.</speaker>
               <p>At one time you ſay, all the Phyſitians in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> of any
buſineſs have uſed <hi>Acids,</hi> now but ſome few; we muſt conclude
either you contradict your ſelf, or elſe the Men of buſineſs, in all
<hi>Chriſtendom</hi> have been but few: But if by Men of buſineſs you mean
ſuch as your ſelf, then I believe indeed they have been but few,
and the aſſiſtance you have had from them, towards the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Principles, has not been great I grant; for your read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
has been little. Yet ſome aſſiſtance I am confident, you have
had; for your Diſcourſes ſmell pretty ſtrong of Dr. <hi>Andre,</hi> of <hi>Acid,</hi>
and <hi>Alkali</hi> Publiſhed in Engliſh, 1689. But when you ſay, you
have taken as much true pains to inform your ſelf in all parts of
Phyſick as any ever did, you cannot be excuſed of Arrogancy;
for we well know, you neither have had the Years, Abilities nor
Opportunity many have had. Beſides you are ſo extraordinarily
accompliſh'd in that one Qualification of a Doctor of Phyſick faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
Language, that it muſt needs have taken up much of your
time to acquire it, and hinder your learning other parts of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
But as for your ſpending as much Money, as moſt who
have been bred at Univerſities, we know very well you never had
it to ſpend. But why could not Univerſity-Men have Ocular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
for their Money as well as you: Or, How come they
to be confin'd to the fuſty Notions of <hi>Ariſtotle?</hi> for want of other
Books? I hope you will ſupply them with freſh Notions for the
future. But you have not ſaid all that ſhould have been ſaid in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59081:8"/>
behalf of your Hypotheſis, that is if it were to be made probable.
Here you are in the right, and I ſhould have perceiv'd it, if you
had not told me ſo. And I grant you believe, or would have us
think your Hypotheſis is the beſt, and cleareſt in Phyſick now
extant to all intents and purpoſes, and you have ſaid as much as
this comes to over and over. 'Twas a thouſand pities <hi>you were
not able rightly to handle it, that it might have proved the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of its kind that ever appear'd on the ſtage of the World.</hi> But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all theſe braggs, and ſtir for a Name to Poſterity (not to talk
of getting a little Money to purchaſe an old Coach for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent)
your <hi>Treacherous Memory</hi> ſo far fail'd you, as to let you ſay,
<hi>you did not pretend to be ſole Author, or firſt broacher of the Doctrine
of</hi> Acids, <hi>it having long ſince been the opinion of ſome of the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Practitioners in the World, and is now embraced by ſome of the
greateſt Men, and moſt happy Practitioners our Age affords, and that
you don't pretend to be ſo great a Man, nor deſerve ſo well of Mankind
as</hi> Helmont, Paracelſus, <hi>&amp;c. who treading out of the common Path,
did not want maligners; therefore why ſhould you who don't pretend to
have arriv'd at thoſe great Perfections they had, take it amiſs to be
abus'd, and evil ſpoken of?</hi> Here you <hi>are over modeſt and meal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouthed.</hi>
For theſe Men were Foreigners, and often uſed <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi>
and were ignorant of your Doctrine, that <hi>Acids</hi> are the cure
of all Diſeaſes, and yet deſerved better of Mankind than you. What
fit of Modeſty is this <hi>John?</hi> 'Tis to be fear'd your cauſe will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

by comparing your ſelf to ſuch great Men; but you have not

               <p>Theſe Men praiſe you at a great rate Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> one thinks
eternal Praiſes your due, another owes his Life to you his <hi>Pagan
Deity,</hi> another is raviſh'd almoſt in reading your luſceous Writings,
and admires your Capacity in promoting Medicine, claps you on the
Back, and bids you deſpiſe your Carpers; But the fourth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does
them all, and ſings you too. I wonder no body did it ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
for you are a Subject enough to inſpire the dulleſt Muſe: But
the Poet might have let us have had his name at length, ſure he
needed not to have been ſhie of owning his Opinion of you any
more than the other Gentlemen; Beſides he might perhaps have
prevented our miſtaking him: For I cannot be perſwaded but
that it was <hi>John Colbatch Junior,</hi> that was the Poet, however I
am ſure that <hi>John Calbatch Junior,</hi> cauſed it to be printed in his
Book, and had he not been a <hi>Junior</hi> it had never been there. To
the Unknown Dr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> is a very odd Epithet on ſo Famous an
Author, it cannot ſure be an Ironie, but hold; <hi>John Colbatch</hi> Jun.
may be very well thought to be unknown to himſelf, otherwiſe he
could never have Publiſhed his own Praiſes at ſo extravagant a rate.
As for his Poetry I ſay, in ſhort it is Poetry, and it is well it is ſo;
for nothing but <hi>Poetica licentia</hi> can excuſe it, it being all fiction:
And perhaps for this reaſon <hi>Tom Saffold</hi> choſe to Publiſh his Bills
in Verſe, knowing the liberty of the Muſes to lie. And now I
mention the Famous <hi>Tom Saffold,</hi> it brings into my mind what a
Friend of Mr. <hi>Acids,</hi> who ſaw what <hi>J. C.</hi> Junior had written
would have added, which was this:

                     <l>Defac'd the Monument of <hi>Saffold</hi>'s Name:</l>
                     <l>Believe him, or his Friend, he merits more</l>
                     <l>Than all the <hi>Saffolds</hi> that have gon before.</l>
                     <l>His rareſt Tincture, and his great Wound-Powder,</l>

                  </q>
But to deal plainly with you Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> this is but playing the
Quack, and leaſt you ſhould take it unkindly if I ſhould handle
him only in rough Proſe, who now comes dreſs'd out ſo finely
in Verſe. I'll give the Quack his Character in the ſame faſhion.
As follows,
<q>
                     <l>A Quack's a Medicaſter, ſetting forth</l>
                     <l>By baſe, unhandſome means his feigned worth,</l>
                     <l>Whether on Saddle, moving Stage he ſit,</l>
                     <l>Boaſting his Remedies, from ſtreet to ſtreet.</l>
                     <l>Whether he keep a Fool to act his part,</l>
                     <l>To draw a concourſe there to Preach his Art.</l>
                     <l>Whether at Coffee-Houſe he does appear</l>
                     <l>At ſuch an Hour, plying for buſineſs there:</l>

                     <l>The Quack's the ſame in differing diſguiſe.</l>

But I long to ſee whether <hi>John Acid</hi> deſerves all his great Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums,

               <p>I confeſs I was bred nn Apothecary, and under a Man
that was not the greateſt Maſter in his Buſineſs; but taking notice
of my Maſter's imperfections, I apply'd my ſelf, for Four Years
of his time, to thoſe things my Maſter could not Teach me in ſome
meaſure; and when I was become a Maſter in <hi>Pharmacy</hi> the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
on which Phyſick is built; I was induc'd to look into the
Body of Phyſick it ſelf; and tho' I dont pretend to abſolute
Maſterſhip, yet I ſhall endeavour to improve my Talent. The
greateſt part of my time I liv'd in <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and tho' I kept an
Apothecaries Shop, my dependance was wholly upon my Practice.
And ſince I ſpeake of my being an Apothecary. I ſhall give the
neceſſary Qualifications of one of that Profeſſion; that you may
judg ſuch a one has made a large ſtep towards being a good Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician.
1. An Apothecary muſt have good acquaintance with the
Vegetable Kingdom, not only to know the Faces of Plants; but
their Natures and manners of Operation on Humane Bodies.
2. He muſt well underſtand the Nature and Operation of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
and Metals, which is not to be attain'd without much Reading
and hard labour in the fire, and 3. of Animal Bodies, amongſt
which is Man, there being ſcarce a part of his whole Body, but
what is ſometime or other to be uſed as a Medicine; but firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
the Apothecaries Skill for its Preparation. The famous
<hi>Etmuller</hi> was not aſham'd to own that he ſerv'd Eight Years to an
Apothecary; yet he became one of the moſt Eminent Phyſicians
in <hi>Europe:</hi> And for ought I know, the loſs of him at that Age he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59081:10"/>
Dy'd, deſerves as much to be lamented as the loſs of any one pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Man, from him ſo much might have been expected.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Al.</speaker>
               <p>One might have gueſs'd you to be an Apothecary, if you
had never told us ſo, you talk ſo like an Apothecary: But I
am ſorry you had no better a Maſter; it had been well you had
met with one that could have taught you a little good Manners;
for truly <hi>John,</hi> you ſhew none in publiſhing your Maſter's imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
But pray you, who taught you for that Four Years you
went ſo far beyond your Maſter's Capacity, as to become a Maſter
your ſelf in <hi>Pharmacy?</hi> Truly I can hardly believe you are a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
in <hi>Pharmacy</hi> yet. For tho' you call your ſelf a Doctor, I am
ſure you talk as if you knew not what <hi>Pharmacy</hi> means, when
you tell us it is the foundation on which <hi>Phyſick</hi> is built. You
have look'd into the Body of Phyſick at a fine rate: But indeed,
you don't talk like an abſolute Maſter, to tell us, That <hi>Pharmacy,</hi>
that is the making of Medicines, is the foundation on which Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
that is Natural Knowledge, is built. Surely <hi>John,</hi> you never
read any Inſtitutions, or if you did, what you read ſlip'd out of
your <hi>treacherous Memory;</hi> but it may be, you would ſpeak with the
Vulgar, while you think with the Learned, and then the ſenſe of
it is, That the making of Medicines, is that upon which Medicine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
is built. But if you would talk with the Doctors, they place Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
or Phyſiology in the firſt place, as the foundation, meaning
the conſideration of Nature it ſelf, in its ſound ſtate, or due order.
Then <hi>Pathology,</hi> the account of its Defects. And thirdly, <hi>Semeiotice,</hi> the
conſideration of the events or iſſues of thoſe Defects. Then <hi>Hygieine</hi>
which teaches to preſerve from thoſe Defects, as much as my be.
And in the Laſt place, comes <hi>Therapuetice,</hi> the method of reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Defects of Nature, and the fitting the Inſtruments for that
purpoſe is <hi>Pharmacy:</hi> So that it is far from the foundation of the
Building. What Practice you built on your foundation of <hi>Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
I know not, or whether your dependance were on that Pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice.
You are very kind in giving us the neceſſary Qualifications of
an Apothecary, you are willing to inform the World, how fit a Man
Mr. Apothecary would be thought to be to make a Doctor of. But
by your Maſterſhip you ſhew in <hi>Pharmacy,</hi> and your acquaintance
with <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> I believe before we have done, it will appear,
you have not made that large ſtride an expert Apothecary has took
towards being a good Phyſician: But I ſhall remark here only, what
acquaintance you have with Animals; eſpecially ſuch an one as
your ſelf, of which you ſay, There is ſcarce a part but is ſometime
or other to be uſed as a Medicine. I believe your Brains would
make an excellent one, but they would hardly yeild one Grain of
ſharpneſs in Diſtillation. And as I ſuppoſe, you would not uſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59081:10"/>
Man's fleſh crude (except in ſome few Diſtempers of Women)
becauſe you ſay it ought to be prepar'd: If the Fire muſt be uſed,
it will produce <hi>Alkalies</hi> copiouſly from both fluids and ſolid parts
of Man's Body; and <hi>Alkalies</hi> acording to your Hypotheſis are the
principle of Death and corruption; and yet all parts of Man's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
are ſometimes to be prepar'd for a Mediaine. You forget your
ſelf ſo oft <hi>John,</hi> I am aſham'd of you. The famous <hi>Etmulier</hi> was a
Foreigner and an aſſerter of <hi>Alkalies</hi> to be good Medicines, and
<hi>Acids</hi> the cauſe of many Diſeaſes: How comes he in ſo much Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
with you here Sir? He ſhould be rather infamous methinks for
his <hi>Fraud or Ignorance;</hi> but you forgive him I ſee for ſake, ſake;
that is, he was an Apothecary, and yeilds you an Argument for
us, thus, <hi>Etmuller</hi> was an Apothecary; and yet became one of the
moſt Famous Phyſicians in <hi>Europe!</hi> one whoſe loſs is much to be
lamented, he might have been ſo uſeful: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> who
was an Apothecary, may nevertheleſs be one of the moſt Famous
Phyſicians in <hi>Europe;</hi> and ſo, much to be priz'd: This is the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
of it. But truly I can ſee no ſuch great hopes of him, he is
ſo apt to forget what ever he ſays and do's; but <hi>a blind man may

my Memory, which is a very taeacherous one, ſo they are not
ſo numerous and exact as I deſign'd them; but yet I was willing
to venture them abroad as they were, for ſome reaſons; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not in the leaſt deſign'd to entertain the Learned, but to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Multitude. I have aim'd at certainty, if I can once ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to that (which I will never reſt till I have done) I care not.
If we could have a publick Laboratory at the Nation's Expence I
ſhould hope to ſee the matter ſooner effected. It coſts the Nation
ſome Hundred thouſand's a Year in Powder and Ball to deſtroy
Mankind: Why not One Thouſand in Experiments to ſave their
Lives? There is a Noble Laboratory already Built at the College
the fitteſt place for ſuch a thing, and the Governing Officers are
Men of Fidelity, and of ſuch Publick Spirits, that they are fit to
be truſted with a greater Summ.</p>

               <speaker>Al.</speaker>
               <p>I think it had been well Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> you had let alone Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
till you could have conſulted Books, as well as your own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
that you might have help'd your <hi>Memory</hi> (which you now
confeſs to be <hi>a very treacherous one,</hi> and ſo ſhew, I have not abus'd
you) for truly your Obſervations are not ſo exact as they ſhould be.
But you had Reaſons to venture them abroad, not to entertain the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59081:11"/>
Learned; but to undeceive the Multitude. What's the meaning
of this Sir, who are the Learned? The <hi>Aſſeyd</hi> Doctors ſuch as your
ſelf, Dr. <hi>Jones,</hi> Dr. <hi>Watſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Baynard?</hi> &amp;c. And are all the reſt the
Multitude? Thoſe perhaps whom you call <hi>Young Phyſicians,</hi> tho' for
Years they may be Old Men. Or, do you mean by the Learned, all
Phyſicians, and by the Multitude all other Men who underſtand no
thing of Phyſick. Theſe laſt you rather ſeem to mean: But
what do you Write to teach them Phyſick? What will become of
the Doctors then? There is Vinegar, Crab-Verjuice, Lemons and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranges
enuough to be had and you tell them, <hi>They can never over Doſe
it, for the Stomach wont fail to reject whatever is to much, and the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
is but a puke or two:</hi> We ſhall have them all turn Doctors,
your method is ſo eaſie. But by undeceiving them, I rather ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
you mean you would convince them that the <hi>Alkali</hi>-Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
are dangerous fellows, or at beſt good for nothing; that they
may Employ you Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> and your Diſciples, if you have any:
There's the knack of it; and I confeſs, there needs not much
exactneſs in putting our Bills to invite thoſe that know nothing of
Nature, or good Senſe; and this conſideration makes me inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to fancy, you may be as ſharp a Fellow in Politicks as <hi>Tom.
Saffold,</hi> who once ſhew'd himſelf more Knave then Fool, when
being told, his Bills were Non-ſenſe; He wittily reply'd, he Liv'd
not by Men of Senſe. And I confeſs Fools are ſooneſt caught.
I applaud you for aiming at Certainty; but if you mean Certainty
in Phyſick, and will never reſt till you arrive to it; I think, I
may ptomiſe the World a perpetual motion on your Credit. A
Publick Laboratory at the Nation's Expence, would be a brave
thing (but that would never make you an infallible Doctor, tho'
you were the Director of it) and a Thouſand a Year; yea, Ten
Thouſand would be better ſpent in ſuch a Deſign to ſave Mens
Lives, than ſome Hundreds of Thouſands to deſtroy Mankind.
But methinks Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> you give the Nation a hard Complement,
aud eſpecially His Majeſty the Supreme Director of our Expences,
to ſay ſo much Money is ſpent to deſtroy Mankind. I don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
any ſuch wicked Deſign; but that you abuſe both King and
People. But we have a Noble Laboratory to our wiſh at the
College, the fitteſt place for ſuch a thing. But <hi>John,</hi> you do not
only beſpatter every body elſe, but you diſgrace the College too,
by begging Money to buy them Coals and Glaſſes, as if they were
either not able to defray the Charges of the deſign themſelves,
or ſo covetous they would not, unleſs the People give Money
to inſtruct them in their Art, as well as pay their Fees for the
effects of it. What the Governing Officers are as to truſt, and
Publick Spirit, I ſhall leave to thoſe that beſt know them. But
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59081:11"/>
indeed <hi>John</hi> I have no hope that thoſe Men who underſtand Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
enough already, will ever be eager in the deſign you
talk of, either with their own, or others Money; and ſubmit it
to your teachings: I could never find them ſo ſolicitous about In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
young Phyſicians as your ſelf Sir; but if they were, I
ſhould ſtill fear a publick Laboratory, as you would direct it,
would rather be a publick Peſt, than a publick Benefit; there
would be ſo much Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and other ſharp
Corroſives made, and given to the Sick, as would deſtroy ten to
one more than Powder and Ball do's: When not one in ten but
ſometimes may want a Doctor; but not one in ten thouſand go's to
the Wars: And theſe things would be ſo much more dangerous;
becauſe (like White-Powder) they would do execution, without
giving a report. For <hi>John</hi> I muſt tell you, I ſtill believe, that
<hi>Acids</hi>-may be the Cauſe of many Diſeaſes; eſpecially in the Hand
of a four Hypothetick: And <hi>Alkalies</hi> may in many caſes be very
good Medicines: And this will go near to be my Opinion, till you
have convinc'd me by good Reaſons, grounded on ſufficient Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
that your new Hypotheſis is any more, than a new
Method of Quacking.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ac.</speaker>
               <p>Every Man may be capable of judging, whether my Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis
is true or falſe, from this eaſie Method. Every Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary's
Boy knows that all <hi>Acids</hi> pour'd on Syrup of <hi>Violets,</hi> or a
ſolution of it, will turn in Red, and as the <hi>Acid</hi> is ſtronger, or
weaker, ſo will the Red colour be: So on the other hand, all
manifeſt <hi>Alkalies,</hi> lixivious or Volatile will turn the Syrup Green,
and as the <hi>Alkali</hi> is ſtronger, or weaker, ſo will the Green Colour
be. Whence I infer if the <hi>Serum</hi> of Blood did turn the Syrup Red,
it would be plain, that the <hi>Serum</hi> did abound with <hi>Acids;</hi> but if
on the other hand it turns the Syrup Green it is more, or
leſs impregned with <hi>Alkalous</hi> Particles. I poſitively aſſert, I
could never find the <hi>Serum</hi> turn the Syrup into any colour but
Green. All manifeſt <hi>Alkalies</hi> thus change the Syrup to a Green.
<hi>Ergo,</hi> If the <hi>Serum</hi> too do's ſo change it, it muſt needs abound
with <hi>Alkalous</hi> Particles. This is an eaſie way of Arguing, and
the plaineſt Demonſtration in the World. And no one that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
under the <hi>Gout,</hi> or any other Diſtemper Chronical, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute;
but will be glad to loſe two or three Ounces of Blood, to
make this Experiment, on which ſo much depends. Every Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
may thus reaſon with himſelf: My Phyſician tells me, my
Blood abounds with <hi>Acids,</hi> and upon that ſcore, gives me <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>
to correct them; but if he ſhould be miſtaken, and my Blood
abound with <hi>Alkalies,</hi> his giving me <hi>Alkalies</hi> will encreaſe the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper:
Therefore ſince I have ſo fair an opportunity, my own
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59081:12"/>
Eyes ſhall be judg, what my Blood abounds with: Whether Dr.
<hi>Colbatch</hi>'s Enemies, being almoſt all the World of Phyſicians, or
he are to be blam'd. If my Blood abound with <hi>Acids,</hi> he ought
to be Kick'd out of the Common-Wealth; if on the other hand,
it abounds with <hi>Alkalies;</hi> he deſerves all the Encouragement in
the World; for diſcovering ſo uſeful and neceſſary a Truth, and
thereby expoſing himſelf to the malice and rage of ſo many. This
Experiment is liable to no Objection, I know of; and by it I can
refer my ſelf to every Gentleman, and from Gentlemen, I ſhall
have Juſtice. Phyſicians have endeavour'd to expoſe me, becauſe
owning me to in the be right; would be owning their own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes:
But by this Experiment, I have appeal'd to more juſt Judges.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Al.</speaker>
               <p>You being to talk like a Philoſopher, and a Logician too;
now Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> I hope, that I ſhall have ſome Work, and that we
ſhall leave Playing: And I am very glad, I am capable of judging
of your Hypotheſis, by your own conceſſion, ſince you ſay, every
Man is ſo: And I hope, ſome Men will be capable of judging
of what I ſhall ſay to it; tho' perhaps, every Apothecary's Boy
may not: For in ſome places they do not teach them for the firſt
thing, the change of colours in Syrup of <hi>Violets,</hi> by <hi>Acids</hi> and <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</hi>
But I ſhall appeal to Phyſicians, and Gentlemen too, if Men
of Senſe. Gentlemen you know, are many of them, troubled
with the <hi>Gout;</hi> and I remember you have told us, <hi>Tbat all that
are afflicted with the</hi> Gout, <hi>are Men of Senſe; for you never met with
one Block-head that was troubled with it.</hi> This is good Logick, could
we ſuppoſe, you had met with all the Men troubled with the
<hi>Gout.</hi> But I ſhall love <hi>Alkalies</hi> the better for this trick: For if
all that are troubled with the <hi>Gout,</hi> are Men of Senſe, and all that
are troubled with the <hi>Gout</hi> abound with <hi>Alkalies</hi> (as you have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd)
it looks ſomething like an Argument that Men abounding
with <hi>Alkalies,</hi> are Men of Sense; and then on the contrary, Men
abounding with <hi>Acids,</hi> are likely to be Block-heads; and I ſhould
always be afraid of an <hi>Acid</hi> Doctor, not only leaſt he ſhould be an
Aſs himſelf, but leaſt he ſhould make me a Fool too, by deſtroying
the <hi>Alkali</hi> in my Blood; which gives me more happineſs in a ſenſible
Underſtanding, than infelicity in the ſence of a Gouty Paroxyſme.
But tho' I appeal to Gentlemen, as well as Phyſicians; I ſhall not
like, you ſo far diſgrace my Profeſſion, as to ſuppoſe, Gentlemen
better Judges in Phyſical matters, than Phyſycians themſelves:
Should I do ſo, I ſhould ſhew my ſelf no wiſer, than the Barreſter
who woulld be judg'd by his Clients, whether he pleaded Law, or
no. I will not accuſe Phyſicians, as either leſs Wiſe, or leſs
Juſt, than Gentlemen; however Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> or other Gentlemen
may take it: But aſſert their Education for the generality, in all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59081:12"/>
reſpects equal to, if not exceeding Gentlemen; and if their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complſhments
in Phyſical Knowledge be not greater, it is a great
ſhame, and Gentlemen are unwiſe in uſing them. But let us come
to the reaſon of your Hypotheſis. All <hi>Alkalies</hi> turn Syrup of <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets</hi>
Green, Tarbox the Blood abounds with Alkalous particles.
This is an eaſie way of argueing; but truly your Argument is far
from a Demonſtration; you are out in your Logick here, and
have not prov'd the Point. For unleſs you could have made a
regular Category, and have ſaid, Whatever turns Syrup of <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets</hi>
Green, is an <hi>Alkali.</hi> But <hi>Serum</hi> of Blood turns Syrup of
<hi>Violets</hi> Green; therefore it is an <hi>Alkali,</hi> or abounds with <hi>Alkali:</hi>
and then have prov'd your Major: It will not follow, that
the <hi>Serum</hi> abounds with <hi>Alkali:</hi> For tho' all <hi>Alkalies</hi> will turn
Syrup of <hi>Violets</hi> Green; yet it wants to be prov'd
that whatſoever turns it Green, is an <hi>Alkali, or that nothing but
Alkali will do ſo:</hi> Which I am ſure, you will never be able to do,
but by denying ſome of your aſſertions; as may appear before we
have done. But I grant, that the Blood abounds with <hi>Alkalous</hi>
particles; if by abounding, you mean only that it yields, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a great deal of <hi>Alkali,</hi> and not that it has always too much.
And what then Mr. <hi>Acid?</hi> You don't deſerve all the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the World for this neceſſary Diſcovery; becauſe truely,
it is none of your Diſcovery; being well known, long before you
were born, to your Maſter <hi>Helmont,</hi> and a great many more Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Men; yea, I dare ſay, all that at preſent deſerve the
Name of Phyſicians, knew it before you ever ſaw Blood Diſtill'd,
or knew it would yield a Salt, or that Serum would turn Syrup
of <hi>Violets</hi> Green. But you have diſcover'd one thing indeed, in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
this your Diſcovery, that is your ſelf, unacquainted with the
World of Phyſicians, or arrogant and fooliſh in publiſhing that, as
your Invention, which was generally known, long before you
knew any thing of Phyſick. And truly <hi>John,</hi> you deſerve to be
laugh'd at and hiſs'd, if not kick'd out of the Company of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
for this Diſcovery. But to the Argument, 'Tis true,
the Blood abounds with <hi>Alkali,</hi> whoever diſcover'd the truth of
it. What then, do's it follow, that the Blood's abounding with
<hi>Alkalies,</hi> is the Cauſe of all Diſeaſes? Not at all. For, if it
abound with <hi>Alkalies,</hi> I ſay, it ſhould do ſo, as it naturally does
in Perſons moſt healthy; and it no way follows, that the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of that which ought to abound; is the Cauſe of Diſeaſes:
But the want of the due quantity of that which ought to abound;
or the abounding of that which ſhould not, or do's not naturally
abound, is much more likely to be the Cauſe of a Diſeaſe. It is
well known to thoſe Phyſicians who have (as they ought) been
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59081:13"/>
exercis'd in Experimental Phyloſophy, that Man's Body by a Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotechinal
Examination yields a great quantity of Volatile, Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Salt; but the quantity of it is much exceeded by the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts;
yea, even by one of them, <hi>viz.</hi> Water, the abundance
of which, a Hypothetick Brain, might as well have fancy'd the
cauſe, not only of a <hi>Dropſy;</hi> but of all other Diſeaſes; there being
more of it to be carry'd off by Perſpiration, than of any other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
It is beyond all doubt, that the Particles conſtituting the
Humane Frame, are of different Figures and Sizes, and have
their determinate Proportions, as to quantity; from whence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
the different appearances of the Parts in their Natural
Shapes and Conſtitutions; as alſo the different qualities of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
Products from one, and another of them. But for a Man
to ſay, That the abounding of any one of theſe (tho' by abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he mean one of them is too much in quantity) is the Cauſe
of all Diſeaſes; looks ſo unlike a Philoſopher, or even a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Man, that I admire any one fond of a Reputation, ſhould be
guilty of ſuch a folly, as either to aſſert it, or believe it! It is
evident to all Men, that in any ſort, ſtudy the Nature of Bodies,
that a due Proportion of the component Parts is requiſite to the
proper Conſtitution of a Compound Body. And if a Body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
but of two ſorts of Particles: For inſtance, <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>
(ſuppoſing them themſelves to be ſimple Bodies) in all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
as there ought to be a certain Proportion; the abounding of
one, as well as of the other, would make an undue Conſtitution,
or Diſeaſe. But the Body of Man, conſiſts not wholly of <hi>Acid</hi>
and <hi>Alkalous</hi> Particles; ſo that one of theſe two muſt needs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
to make a Diſproportion; but of divers others, either
Natural Conſtituents, or Artificial Products: And that it ſhould
be ſaid, that but one of theſe can poſſibly abound, is without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
colour of Reaſon; when not only our Food, which encreaſes
and maintains the bulk of our Bodies, is ſo different, abounding
now with one, then with another ſort of Particles Homogeneous
to thoſe our Bodies conſiſt of; but alſo the various Excrements
to be Egeſted, may be now one, then another retain'd, or too
haſtily carry'd off, and ſo cauſe a diſproportion; and what the
proportion ought to be between theſe divers Particles, I doubt,
will be found a matter too hard for a better Philoſopher than
Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> certainly to determine. Moreover, the Body of Man
is to be conſider'd as conſiſting of ſolid and fluid Parts, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and contained; beſides which, there is in Man <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>Impetum faciens,</hi> and as we conſider Diſeaſes, with relation to this
threefold Diviſion; the fancy of <hi>Alkalies</hi> abounding to be the cauſe
of all Diſeases, will ſtill appear more groundleſs, too narrow and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59081:13"/>
inſufficient. In the ſolid Parts, there is to be conſider'd, their
undue Conformation; too little, or too great, too narrow, or too
wide in proportion to one another; and ſo their unequal ſtrength,
their being too hard or too ſoft, ſolid or poreous; with many
unperceiv'd Solutions of Continuity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from which, divers
Diſeaſes, on divers occaſions, may proceed; and all which, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
Conformations, unequal ſtrengths or breaches, cannot be
ſuppos'd ſo different and contrary, to proceed from the ſingle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
of <hi>Alkalies</hi> in the Blood. For inſtance, a large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate
Liver, ſmall Lungs, narrow Veins, Cartilaginous
<hi>Aorta,</hi> ſingle Kidney, inward imperceptible Breaches, are impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to be accounted for, from the abounding of <hi>Alkali.</hi> 2. The
Liquors or Contents of the Body may be too thick, or too thin;
moved too faſt, or retarded too much, Extravaſated, or Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
in ſome Veſſel or other; of which contrary Effects, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
of <hi>Alkalies</hi> onely, cannot be always either the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional
or formal Cauſe. 3. As to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>
or <hi>Archeus</hi> of <hi>Helmont;</hi> becauſe ſome more thinking Heads, than
Mr. <hi>Acid's</hi> ſour one, have thought it too abſtruſe or ſubtil a Notion:
I ſhall firſt tell you plainly, what I mean by it, leaving others to
determine, whether <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Helmont</hi> meant the ſame. By
the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> I mean the Soul, or Mind of Man in its extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Appetities: And that nothing elſe ought to be underſtood,
by that of Man which is conſider'd as an Agent; but his Mind is
apparent from This, (which all conſiderate Metaphyſicians muſt
acknowledge as a Truth) That there is no Being we have any
Idea of, but Mind and Body; the one being Active, the other
Paſſive: And tho' all created Minds may ſuffer, as well as do; yet
all Body is univerſally un-active, and can do nothing. Tho' this
Notion may ſeem a Paradox to ſome, I ſhall ſay no more of it
here, than what relates to my preſent purpoſe; becauſe I may
have occaſion to ſpeak farther of it, if I live to finiſh a Diſcourſe I
have for ſome time ſpent ſome thoughts upon, <hi>Of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oot of Diſeaſes,
and their Cure in Humane Nature.</hi> But to return to the buſineſs in
Hand, It is apparent, that the exorbitant Deſire or violent action of
the Will of Man; is that which often produces ſuch an alteration
in his Body, as when perceiv'd becomes a Diſeaſe. For inſtance,
the Blood is too much retarded, or accelarated in its courſe, as
well as the more ſubtile Liquors variouſly diſordered; from
whence proceed divers ill Effects, which cannot be thought to
proceed from the Production of too much <hi>Alkali,</hi> or retarding its
ſuppoſed neceſſary Evacuation in a Moment. The unſatisfy'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
in its moſt ſudden Diſappointments, cannot be thought to be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59081:14"/>
ſo great a Chymiſt, as to produce in an inſtant a greater quantiyt
of <hi>Alkali</hi> Salt than the Body can bear, or ſo ſoon ſeparate the
<hi>Acid</hi> that ſhould attemper it; but is rather to be thought, to
produce its Effects in a more ſubtil way. The force of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
and Deſire upon the Body, is very well known, tho' the
way of working thoſe various Effects is little underſtood: But I
ſhall conſider it no farther here, than in relation to <hi>Alkali,</hi> which
is with no colour of Reaſon to be thought either the Cauſe of
thoſe Mental Diſorder, or the inſtrument of the Effects produc'd
thereby. But to come a little cloſer to the Term of abounding
either of <hi>Alkali</hi> or <hi>Acid,</hi> in the liquid or ſolid Parts: When may
either be ſaid to abound, ſo as to be likely to be the Cauſe of a
Diſeaſe? I anſwer, When there is too much of the one or the
other. And how ſhall we know that? May Gentlemen ſay (for
we will appeal to Gentlemen; yea, and Ladies too, if they will
Read us: Poor Men and Phyſicians we ſhall get but little by;
tho' they ſhould think us Skilful Doctors.) I muſt tell you, Sirs
and Madams, there ought to be ſome Conſideration of the due
Proportion, before we talk of abounding; and it is certain, That
there is abundantly more <hi>Alkali</hi> in, or produc'd from the Blood
and other Parts of Man's Body than <hi>Acid,</hi> and ought to be ſo in a
ſound Man, as we have ſeen Demonſtrated by abundance of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments.
The proportion of <hi>Alkali</hi> to <hi>Acid,</hi> we need not
ſcruple to ſuppoſe, no leſs than as twenty to one, when we have
found the <hi>Alkali</hi> to the <hi>Salſum</hi> as ſeventeen to one: But we will
not pretend to aſcertain the Proportions; it being a very difficult
matter to find them. But we will ſuppoſe, twenty to one, or but
ten to one if you pleaſe, to ſhew you that your Doctor <hi>John</hi>
has talk'd like an Aſs-ey'd Doctor to you. For if there ought to
be but one part of <hi>Acid</hi> to ten of <hi>Alkali,</hi> and there be juſt that
proportion; neither can be ſaid to abound, or thought to cauſe
a Diſeaſe: But if there be two, or more parts of <hi>Acid</hi> to ten of
<hi>Alkali,</hi> the <hi>Acid</hi> muſt be ſaid to abound, or be too much, not the
<hi>Alkali.</hi> And as for the little Trick <hi>John</hi> has ſhew'd you with Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup
of <hi>Violets,</hi> at the expence of two or three Ounces of your
Blood (which in ſome Caſes ought not to be ſpar'd.) I think, I
ſhould undervalue your Parts, if I ſhould ſuppoſe, you can't ſee
thro' the Juggle and make an Objection, where your Doctor ſays
he can ſee none. For tho' <hi>Acid</hi> greatly abound, or be a deal too
much; yet the <hi>Serum</hi> will not turn Syrup of <hi>Violets</hi> Red, unleſs
there were more <hi>Acid</hi> then <hi>Alkali.</hi> And ſuch a quantity of <hi>Acid</hi>
(if it were poſſible, in a Living Humane Body) would be a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
too great, for either an <hi>Acid</hi> or an <hi>Alkali</hi>-Doctor ever to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59081:14"/>
reduce. And that you may ſatisfie your own Eyes, and judge
whether Doctor <hi>Acid,</hi> or all the Phyſicians in the World, ought to
be Kick'd out of the Common-wealth; without the trouble, and
ſometimes hazard of loſing two, or three Ounces of your Blood.
Take Syrup of <hi>Violets,</hi> and drop into it a quantity of an Alkalous
Spirit: and you will find it preſently turn Green, and then take an
<hi>Acid,</hi> and drop but a little in, and you ſhall not find it turn Red;
but drop in till you have over-power'd the <hi>Alkali,</hi> it will turn
Red; then drop in again of the <hi>Alkali,</hi> and as ſoon as you have
over-power'd the <hi>Acid,</hi> it will turn Green again. By this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
you may be rationally perſwaded, there may be too much

there is enough to turn the Syrup Greeen.</p>

               <p>The Phyſicians of our own Age, more particularly of our
Nation, and among them (moſt eſpecially of our College) have
made greater Diſcoveries in the Anatomy of the ſolid Parts, than
ever were made before; but as for the fluids, wherein the Cauſe and
Seat of Diſeases lurk, they have in a great meaſure been neglected:
But the College abounds with Men of ſuch large Capacities, that if
once they ſet about the Work, I doubt not, but they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it. Being Skill'd in the Anatomy of the ſolid Parts. A Noble
Qualification! Enables a Man to talk finely; but do's not in the
leaſt enable him to Cure Diſeaſes. For it's an exact skill in the
Anatomy of the Juices, that makes a Man a good Phyſician. And
I have made it the buſineſs of my Life, to underſtand rightly the
the Juices of Humane Bodies in their Natural and Morbid States;
and by that means have been capable of doing more than other
People; and I tell you, that the Blood has never any <hi>Acid</hi> in it;
but when People are in a perfect ſtate of Health: Nay, I tell you,
the Blood can't over-abound with <hi>Acids,</hi> neither in a Morbid nor
Healthy State: For tho' manifeſt <hi>Acids,</hi> are things the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
much more covets and delights in, than any thing beſides:
When ſhe is loaded with more than the Body has occaſion for,
ſhe won't fail of rejecting them by Vomit; which may be experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd
by an over large Draught of Vinegar; but altho it can't
over-doe; yet it is very defective in conveying a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
into it, thro' its own fault, or the Phyſicians. But the Blood
of Diſeaſed Perſons has more <hi>Alkali,</hi> than that of the Healthy;
as in Fits of the <hi>Gout,</hi> it abounds with <hi>Alkalous</hi> Particles, more than
in Health as ſix to four, or five and a half, or as five to four; which
you will find in my Book of Blood, where my Experiments are as
clear Demonſtrations of my Hypotheſis, as what is given by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59081:15"/>
Mathematicians. So in the Small-Pox and in Scorbutick Perſons
it does appear by many Tryals, that the Blood of ſuch Perſons
does more abound with Alkalous Particles, than that of ſound
People, and a Sick Perſon's <hi>Serum</hi> will turn Syrup of <hi>Violets</hi> Green
ſooner than a well Perſon's. And if Phyſicians would Critically
Analize the Blood in all Diſtempers, I believe, thereby the Cauſe
of all Diſeaſes would be certainly known.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> you are very laviſh of your praiſes where you
place your favour; I wonder the College who have ſo great a
ſhare of them, are not ſufeited. They have made more Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
in the Anatomy of the ſolid Parts, you ſay, than ever was
made before. What Diſcoveries have they made I pray you?
Wherein have they out-done others, either of the foregoing Age,
or Foreigners of this? What improvements have they made in the
Anatomy of the ſolid Parts? You know perhaps, but you won't
tell us: and 'tis no matter, whether it be any thing or nothing.
For being skil'd in the Anatomy of the ſolid Parts is <hi>a Noble Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>
you ſay: But how do's it Ennoble a Man? Why, onely
enables him to talk finely; but do's not in the leaſt enable him
to Cure Diſeaſes. It is an exact Skill in the Anatomy of the Juices,
that makes a Man a good Phyſician; which Anatomy has been
neglected even by our College. What is the inference of this?
Why, our College have a Noble Qualification of Talking finely;
but not in the leaſt an ability to Cure Diſeaſes. Pray you Sir, what
are the People the better for the Colleges Ability to Talk finely;
if they have none to Cure Diſeaſes. No, but they are Men of
large Capacities! Capable of perfecting the Anatomy of the
Juices too, if they would but once ſet about the Work. But
when that will be, who knows? They underſtand Philoſophy
enough already (tho' their Friend <hi>John</hi> ſays no) and while they
are in that Opinion, they will hardly learn more. While they
think the Anatomy of the ſolid Parts is enough for them; they
will never ſet about the Anatomy of the Fluids by Mr. <hi>Acid</hi>'s Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:
And ſo for ought we know, they are like to remain
Phyſicians <hi>in Verbo</hi> only; Fine Talkers. But Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> is the
only Phyſician <hi>in Re,</hi> indeed, amongſt them. 'Twas great Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in them to take you into the College Sir, that they might
have one real Phyſician to actuate the reſt; that they might not
be a Body without a Soul: You know <hi>Acid is the Soul of the
World.</hi> And an Aſs-Ey'd Doctor may as well be the Soul of the
College. I can hardly think, they would ſo readily have given
you a Licence; but that they expected you would do ſomething
for them, they could not do for themſelves; run down the
<hi>Badger,</hi> catch the <hi>Salmon,</hi> or ſome other piece of Difficulty.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59081:15"/>
You, who have made it the Buſineſs of your Life, to underſtand
rightly the Juices of Humane Bodies in their Natural and Morbid
States; by that means have been capable of doing more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
People (if you ſay true) more than all the reſt of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.
But you are a Particle of the College, and what you do;
is the doing of the College. 'Tis well they have you, that they
may not only be ſaid to do ſomething; but more than other
People; tho' not in the whole, yet in one part of them, <hi>viz.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Acid.</hi> But truly <hi>John,</hi> your crying down the Skill in the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy
of the ſolid Parts, is but a dull way of excuſing your Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
therein, and you do but as Block-heads commonly do,
cry down as uſeleſs, all Knowledg they themſelves have not; that
Fools may think them Wiſe enough. But I muſt tell you <hi>John,</hi>
and the Gentlemen too, That the Skill in the Anatomy of the
Solids, is ſo far neceſſary, that the Anatomy of the Juices ſignifies
little to a Phyſician without it. The Animal Oeconomy can never
be well underſtood in its due Order and Defects, by one that
knows nothing of the Structure of the Parts. For inſtance, tho'
I knew the Gall to be of ſuch, and ſuch, a Nature and Quality,
and by a Pyrotechnical Analyſis, to yield ſuch, and ſuch different
Bodies, or Sets of Particles: What am I the wiſer, as a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
unleſs I know where this, thus qualify'd Liquor, is ſeparated
and diſcharg'd? How otherwiſe, can I determine of the Uſe,
or Defects of this Liquor? So likewiſe as to the other Liquors of
the Body: How can I know their Motions, Secretions and Uſes,
unleſs I know which way they paſs, and where ſeparated? Was
the Famous <hi>Harvey,</hi> or <hi>Servetus</hi> before him, nothing the better for
being aware of the ways of the circular Motion of the Blood, but
only that they could Talk finely. Fye <hi>John,</hi> you don't talk like a
Light in Phyſick, much leſs in Chirurgery. I muſt tell you, if
you had been skill'd in the Anatomy of the ſolid Parts; you
would not only have talk'd more finely; but more truly than you
do, as we ſhall ſee in a Material inſtance before we have done.
And as you have fooliſhly confeſs'd your Ignorance in the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of the ſolid Parts (a ſhame to any Phyſician, eſpecially to one
that Writes himſelf of the Noble College) ſo I believe, I ſhall
find you ignorant of the Anatomy of the Fluids too; and that it
will appear, you have not done more than other People in any
thing, but Impudent Boaſting! You tell me, that the Blood
has never any <hi>Acid</hi> in it, but when People are in a perfect ſtate
of Health; and that it can't ſuper-abound, neither in a Morbid,
nor Healthy ſtate: For tho' the Stomach covets <hi>Acids</hi> more than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing elſe, ſhe will not fail to reject what's more than enough,
by Vomit; but tho' ſhe can't over-doe, yet ſhe's very defective
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59081:16"/>
through her own, or the Phyſician's fault. You are a cunning
Man! Of a ſhe Stomach. You once told us, <hi>That all Perſons have
ſome degree of Sickneſs.</hi> Now that the Blood has never any <hi>Acid</hi> in
it, but in a perfect ſtate of Health. But I anſwer, If all Perſons
have ſome degree of Sickneſs; then none are in perfect Health;
and if none are in perfect Health, according to you, none have
any <hi>Acid</hi> in their Blood. Yet again you tell us, <hi>That Leanneſs is
for want of enough</hi> Acid <hi>in the Blood, and Fat is nothing but a concrete
of</hi> Acid <hi>and oily Parts; and over-much Fatneſs, if it may be call'd a
Diſeaſe, is caus'd by</hi> Acids. What a miſery it is for a Man to
have a <hi>Treacherous Memory;</hi> ſo to contradict himſelf. If Fat be a
concrete of <hi>Acid</hi> and Oily Parts, wherever there is Fat there is
<hi>Acid;</hi> but there's Fat in Perſons under many Diſeaſes: I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
a Body, before now, that Dy'd of another Diſeaſe than
Fatneſs, that cut two or three Inches in Fat upon the <hi>Abdomen:</hi>
And Fatneſs in ſome, is Diſeaſe enough; and if your
Doctrine were true, nothing could be more proper than
<hi>Alkalies</hi> to Cure it. But farther Sir, If there be never any
<hi>Acid</hi> in the Blood; but in <hi>a</hi> State of perfect Health: How
can <hi>Acids</hi> Cure the Diſeaſes of the Blood: <hi>Mortifie and Expel
the luxriant Alcalous Particles, reduce the ſerum to fluidity, make
the too thick Blood thin, and the too thin Blood thick,</hi> The
Miracles of <hi>Acids! That he that can ſhew how this can be,
what</hi> Acids <hi>taken in the Latitude can do, muſt be as Wiſe as</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<hi>the Wiſeſt Man that ever was, or ſhall be.</hi> Yet you tell us,
<hi>That</hi> Acids <hi>produce theſe different things, by being differently ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with other things, but</hi> Acid <hi>is the ſoul of them.</hi> And ſo <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
is not the Wiſeſt Man, for you are as Wiſe as he. But tho' I
believe there has been, or may be, one Man at leaſt Wiſer than
<hi>Solomon,</hi> and you too Sir, I much queſtion whether he would be
cunning enough to tell, how all theſe fine things come to paſs,
which you ſay are done in the Blood of Diſeaſed Perſons by
<hi>Acids,</hi> if as you ſay, there never comes any <hi>Acid</hi> there, but in a
ſtate of perfect Health; or how he could make it appear, that
the ſtomack ſo unerringly rejects to a grain, whatever of its belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Acid</hi> is too much to be convey'd into the Blood, and yet is
fooliſhly defective in letting in enough. But to leave theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
to their Author, and to perſwade you (at leaſt the
Gentlemen, who are ſuch impartial Judges) that there is even
too much <hi>Acid</hi> in the Blood in many Diſeaſes, I might firſt give
you a Hundred Authorities from Famous and Learned Authors,
but that Authority is nothing to you, who have cry'd down all
the Phyſitians in the World. Yet methinks the judgment of ſome
of them might be of ſome weight with you, eſpecially thoſe you
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59081:16"/>
have commended, and perhaps the Gentlemen may believe them
as ſoon as you. Your Brother <hi>Etmuller</hi> aſſerts <hi>Acids</hi> in the
Blood as the cauſe of many Diſeaſes: It would be endleſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite

Which, leaſt you ſhould complain of <hi>Heathen-Greek,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Non
poteſt legi;</hi> I will give you in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> thus: For thereis in Man
Bitter and Salt, and Sweet and Acid, and Aſtringent and Humid, and
others innumerable; having all Kinds of Faculties abundance
and Strength. Theſe indeed, being mix'd and contemper'd with
one another, are neither apparent, nor hurt a Man: But when
either of theſe is ſeparated, and is of it ſelf; then it is apparent
and hurts a Man. And again, ſays he, of our Food, Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
things are diſagreeing and hurt a Man being taken in; each
of theſe is ſomething Bitter and Intemperate, or Salt or <hi>Acid,</hi> or
ſomething elſe intemperate and ſtrong; and for this Cauſe we are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59081:17"/>
troubl'd by them, as alſo by thoſe things which are ſeparated out
of the Body. And a little after, ſays he, If the ſweet Juice is chang'd
to another Form, not by mixture; but being of it ſelf what it
was before, Bitter, or Salt, or Aſtringent, or Acid; but the <hi>Acid</hi>
Juice is diſagreeing, the reſt being for the moſt part profitable,
but the Sweet Juice of all is moſt agreeing. But if the Judgment
of theſe Famous Men, be not enough; let me reaſon with you
a little farther my ſelf. How can Diſeaſes if caus'd by <hi>Alkali</hi>
(as you ſay) be Cur'd by <hi>Acids,</hi> but by <hi>Acids</hi> coming into the
Blood. Muſt not there be ſome time for their Operation there,
before they can mortifie and expel the Abundant <hi>Alkali,</hi> ſo as that
<hi>Acid</hi> muſt be in the Blood, while the Perſon is yet Diſeas'd?
Or, do's <hi>Alkali</hi> leap out at one Door as afrighted, ſeeing <hi>Acid</hi>
with his ſour Face coming in at another? Are your Cures all ſo
ſudden? No <hi>John,</hi> I ſuppoſe not. But altho' there were no <hi>Acid</hi>-Doctor
to convey ſour Liquors into the Blood; yet I ſay, there
may be <hi>Acid,</hi> and that too much, in the Blood of a Diſeas'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
as the cauſe of his Diſeaſe. It's undoubted among Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
that the Health of the Body, very much conſiſts in the due
Temper and Conſiſtence of the Blood, and other Liquors of the
Body, that they be neither too thick nor too thin. If they be
too thick, they cannot puſs freely through the ſmall Veſſels,
and circulate through the <hi>Aanaſtomoſes</hi> of the Arteries and Veins,
but ſtick and cauſe Obſtructions; whence ariſe Swellings and
Pains, by diſtention of the Parts, and the Liquors ſtagnating;
get a fermentavive Motion, and ſo corrupt and corrode the ſolid
Parts, and produce Ulcers: But if the Obſtruction be ſooner
open'd, and the Coagulated Parts be carry'd along again into the
Maſs of Blood; it is thereby retarded in its motion, before the
Particles can be ſeparated; from whence may proceed divers Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.
Now it's certain, that <hi>Acids</hi> coagulate and thicken the
Blood, and other Juices of the Body, as any one may ſee by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a little <hi>Acid</hi> Liquor, as Oyl of <hi>Vitrol,</hi> ſp. of <hi>Niter,</hi> Oyl of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi>
&amp;c. with a little Blood, or <hi>Serum:</hi> The <hi>Acids</hi> turning the
<hi>Serum</hi> into thick white Corruption, and the Red part into a tough
black Matter. So <hi>Acid</hi> Liquors injected into the Veins of Animals
kill them by coagulating their Blood: When on the other Hand,
<hi>Alkalous</hi> Liquors make the Blood more thin and florid, on which
account it cannot be thought, by any Body that has his Senſes,
that when the Blood is too thick, or coagulated, 'its caus'd by
<hi>Alkalies,</hi> and not by <hi>Acids.</hi> You ſaid Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> that <hi>Whoever ſhou'd
take upon them to Anſwer any thing you have ſaid, unleſs they back their
Arguments with Experiments, you ſhould take no notice of them.</hi> But tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sir, you have not back'd your Aſſertion. <hi>That</hi> Acids <hi>make the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59081:18"/>
Blood thin when too thick</hi> with Experiments. I would counſel the
Gentlemen to do it for you, and they will ſee how friendly your
<hi>Acids</hi> are to the Blood. Beſides, that there's too much <hi>Acid</hi> in
the Blood, in ſome Diſeaſes, may fairly be argu'd, <hi>a Juvantibus
&amp; laedentibus.</hi> It being commonly ſeen, that Perſons afflicted with
ſome Diſeaſes, are very much hurt and the Symptoms exaſperated
by the uſe of <hi>Acids,</hi> as <hi>Hypocondriacks, Hyſterical</hi> and <hi>Scorbutick</hi>
Perſons; thoſe afflicted with divers kinds of Ulcers and that have
Iſſues: On the contrary Reliev'd, Eas'd and Heal'd by <hi>Alkalies;</hi>
as is well known to Phyſicians and Chirurgeons. Farther, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
you, becauſe <hi>by all the ways you could yet contrive, you have
not been able to procure one Grain of pure</hi> Acid <hi>from the Blood either of
Healthy, or Sick People.</hi> I'll teach you. From the Blood of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Diſeas'd or Healthy Perſons, as alſo from their Urine which
is ſeparated, from thence you may get a <hi>Sal ſalſum,</hi> like Sea-Salt,
which you ſay, is an <hi>Acid;</hi> but I ſay, yields an <hi>Acid</hi> by Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and from Fleſh and Blood, as well as from Urine, may be
got the <hi>Phoſphorus,</hi> which is an Oyl coagulated into an open Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,
by an <hi>Acid;</hi> which <hi>Acid</hi> may be as eaſily ſeparated, as the
<hi>Acid</hi> is from common <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which is eaiſe enough, tho' you
ſay, '<hi>tis no eaſie matter to do it.</hi> And from Urine, an excrement
of the Blood, beſides <hi>Phoſphorus,</hi> I have made a perfect burning
Sulphur, without any addition of any Body that could yield it, or
help to compoſe it; which Sulphur would make good Matches,
and might be Diſtill'd into Oyl of Sulphur, <hi>per Campanam</hi> as eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as any other Sulphur; and <hi>every thing is diſſolv'd,</hi> you ſay, <hi>into
that of which it was made.</hi> But I ſay, not by every ſort of Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
But that in a common Diſtillation of Blood, by ſuch a
Diſtiller as your ſelf, there's no <hi>Acid</hi> produc'd, is eaſie to anſwer,
by an Experiment or two. For inſtance, I will take an <hi>Alkali,</hi> and
mix with it a conſiderable quantity of an <hi>Acid,</hi> and you ſhall
Diſtill them, and ſhall not get one Grain of <hi>Acid;</hi> but an <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>
Liquor. Again, I will take an <hi>Alkali,</hi> and mix an <hi>Acid</hi> with
it, and you ſhall Diſtill them, and ſhall not get one Grain of <hi>Acid;</hi>
but they ſhall both unite, and both come over in a Liquor, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an <hi>Alkali,</hi> nor <hi>Acid</hi> but a <hi>ſalſum.</hi> Again, I will take an <hi>Alkali,</hi>
and mix an <hi>Acid</hi> with it, and you ſhall Diſtill them, and ſhall get
neither <hi>Acid, Alkali</hi> nor <hi>Salſum;</hi> but a burning Oyl. Which things, if
you are a Chymiſt, as you profeſs, you can't be Ignorant of. From
which Experiments, it may eaſily be believ'd, that tho' there may
be a ſmall quantity of <hi>Acid,</hi> actually in the Blood, yea, a large
quantity in compariſon of what there ſhould be; yet the <hi>Alkali</hi>
far exceeding it; the <hi>Acid</hi> may be ſo far alter'd by the Fire,
or lock'd up with the <hi>Alkali,</hi> as to come over as an <hi>Alkali,</hi> or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59081:18"/>
remain a <hi>Salſum?</hi> And though a mere <hi>Salſum</hi> cannot truly
be ſaid to be either an <hi>Acid,</hi> or an <hi>Alkali,</hi> or have an affect
as either, Whatever ſeparations or alterations the Fire, may
make from it, or upon it; yet it is certain that the Natural
or Artificial Conjunction of an <hi>Acid</hi> with an <hi>Alkali,</hi> does make a
<hi>Salſum,</hi> and nothing is more common, than to have the Blood
apparantly Salt, even to the taſte, in many Caſes, in ſome more,
ſome leſs; which <hi>Salſum</hi> (tho' the <hi>Acid</hi> that is coagulated with
the <hi>Alkali</hi> were not ſeparate in the Body firſt, and ſo capable of
hurting) is very likely as a <hi>Salſum,</hi> to be the Cauſe of divers Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes,
when it too much abounds; which we may eaſily believe,
from this Conſideration, That it's well known, that the Eating
too much common Salt, is the Cauſe of many Diſorders. As
for inſtance <hi>Seamen</hi> (as you confeſs) <hi>who live upon Salt-meat, and
Salt-fiſh, are more troubled with the Scurvey than others,</hi> not as you
ſay, <hi>becauſe they eat more Fleſh and Fiſh (which abound with Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
parts) than others:</hi> For others that cat as much Fleſh and
Fiſh, and that freſh too, are not ſo much troubled with it, but
becauſe their Fleſh and Fiſh is more Salt, and is alſo kept longer,
whereby the Spiritous and Volatile parts are exhal'd, and ſo yield
a groſſer Chyle. Nor as you ſay, <hi>That the moiſt Air hinders per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration;</hi>
For it is well known, That Men at Sea generally eat
more, and void fewer Excrements of the Belly, than at Land,
and conſequently perſpire more. Nor is the <hi>Sea-Salt carry'd off
all by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> it being to be found in a greater or leſſer quantity in
the Blood, and other Liquors of the Body. Nor can <hi>Sea Salt,
and any</hi> Alkali <hi>make a Sal Armoniack,</hi> as you tell us, either in the
Body, or by a Pyrothechnical Conjunction; unleſs the Sea-Salt
be firſt an <hi>Acid,</hi> as I have found by experience, and any body
may ſee that will try to make a <hi>Sal Armoniack.</hi> And tho' the Air at,
Sea ſhould hinder ſweat, as you ſay, yet it furthers Perſpiration;
whereby the <hi>Alkalies</hi> if they could do any hurt, may be carry'd
off, if that be ſuppos'd the courſe they ought to go. And that
we perſpire more when we don't ſweat, than when we do (tho'
it may ſeem ſtrange to ſome) might be urg'd by divers Reaſons,
if it were neceſſary, and may be try'd by Staticks. How an <hi>Acid</hi>
Spirit ſhould be Diſtill'd from Sea-Salt while in the Blood, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Liquors of the Body, I confeſs I ſee not, but I know by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Experience, that there's often ſeparated, or produc'd in the
Stomach, a Praternatural <hi>Acid,</hi> a kind of Vinegar, from things
taken in, that are fermentable into Vinegar; as Sugar, Honey,
Bread, ſtrong Liquors; which tho' in their firſt ingeſted Form,
could not be truly call'd <hi>Acids,</hi> yet become very ſtrong ones, and
if they were <hi>Acids</hi> grow ſtronger. Beſides, every one knows,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59081:19"/>
that we Eat and Drink things already ſour, both which we know,
are not always rejected by Vomit (as Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> ſaies) But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
there's a more ſtrict Guard for keeping the <hi>Acids</hi> out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the Blood, <hi>viz,</hi> the Gall pouring out its forces upon them in the
ſmall Guts; yet it's very probable that ſome <hi>Acid</hi> Particles more
than ſhould ſo do, may paſs this Watch, and get in with the
Chyle into the Veins; of which Enemy, we are after aware, by the
diſturbance made in the Vital Oeconomy, which Phyſicians of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

would be found in divers Ulcers, tho' Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s fate, is enough
to diſcourage one from Taſting. But you ſay, the Blood of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed
Perſons contains or yields more <hi>Alkali,</hi> than that of Sound
Perſons. I anſwer, It's a more difficult thing than you, or any other
young Chymiſt would imagine, exactly to find the quantity of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali</hi>-Salt in a parcel of Blood. To ſeparate the Volatile-Salt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the Phlegm, and from the Oyl, and both of them from the
<hi>Caput mort.</hi> will be found too hard a Task for an older Work-man
than your ſelf. The difficulty of giveing an exact account of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59081:19"/>
contents of a parcel of Blood, will appear from divers Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Blood is a Body that will ſwell up as it drys, ſo that the top
of the matter will have leſs Heat than the bottom, and retain
ſome of the Volatile Parts; ſo that if you don't take it out and
Diſtil part of it again in another Retort, you will not get all, and
notwithſtanding all the care poſſible, ſome of the Volatile parts
will be loſt in working; ſo that the moſt wary Artiſt, do what
he can, will not be able to ſay, Here's all the <hi>Alkali,</hi> or Oyl, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in ſo much Blood. But there will be ſtill greater Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in giving the true Contents in divers parcels of Blood; for if
you ſhould take a Pound, or any other quantity of Blood, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
it into equal parts, and Diſtil one half in one Retort, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in another, the products would not be the ſame. For the
different degrees of Fire that might happen, different time of
Diſtilling, and taking off, and ſeparating the Phlegm, Oyl, and
Salt, the different cloſeneſs of Luteing, yea, the very ſhapes and
ſizes of the Retorts and Receivers, would almoſt in inevitably
cauſe different Products. Farther, the Bloods of divers Perſons,
tho' all in Health, or of one healthy Perſon, took at divers times,
would as much differ in the Products, as that of the Diſeas'd and
Healthy, as well as vary upon other Tryals. As I have ſeen the
Sweat of a Perſon in perfect Health, turn Syrup of <hi>Violets</hi> Green
readily, when the very <hi>ichor</hi> and corruption in the puſtles of the
<hi>Small-Pox,</hi> would hardly alter its colour into a diſcernable Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
So the Blood of the ſame Diſeas'd Perſon, taken at one time
or ſtate of the Diſeaſe, would as much differ from that taken at
another time, as either of them would from a Sound Perſon's;
having ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs <hi>Serum.</hi> So that I muſt
tell you, you have not been a Chymiſt long enough, to deſerve
Credit, ſince it appears you have not yet Learn'd to ſpeak modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and wyrily; but confidently give us, from ſmall and odd quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of Blood (the more difficut, to be exact in) ſo many Drachms,
Scruples, and Grains as the certain Contents of Phlegm, Salt, Oyl,
and <hi>Caput mort.</hi> from which exact account the ſagacious Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>
excus'd himſelf: And no expert Chymiſt will readily pretend
to give. But you Sir, pretend to give us the true Proportion of
<hi>Alkalies</hi> in a Gouty Man's Blood, and a well Man's; when you
have Diſtill'd perhaps but two or three well Men's Blood, and
one or two Gouty Men's Blood. Do you not think the Bloods of
Gouty Men differ, as well as the Bloods of well Men? Let us
have the products of a Pound of Blood, from one hundred well
Men's Bloods, or ſo many ſick Men's Bloods; and if they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
the ſame, then you may do ſomething toward perſwading
us to harken to you: Or if you can tell us the exact proportion

Perſon afflicted with the Stone in the Bladder Nine Months,
and deſpaired of a Cure, all common means being uſed in vain,
was at laſt prevail'd with to ſend for me, and to try what I could
do for her: Upon <hi>Monday</hi> Morning ſhe began to take my Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
and on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Night, I Examin'd her Water, and found
ſome ſmall pieces of Stones in it, and Taſteing the Water, I could
diſcern the Taſte of the Medicines, as vigorous as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were taken: On <hi>Thurſday</hi> Morning ſhe ſent to acquaint
me, ſhe was perfectly well; and viſiting her, I found ſhe had
voided a ſtone an Inch and half and a quarter long, three Inches
and a half round. I could add ſeveral inſtances of this nature;
but theſe two I think ſufficient, and plain Demonſtrations that
there are ſuch Veſſels. Nay, I don't queſtion, but ſuddenly to
make it appear by ocular Demonſtration. Secondly, Thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who abound with Acidity in their Stomachs are Lean, becauſe
the ſolid Food, being over attenuated, is made capable of paſſing
thro' theſe Veſſels, and the groſſer is convey'd to the Guts; and
having but few Nutritious Particles, Leanneſs muſt needs follow:
And as I ſaid, that Leanneſs is for want of <hi>Acid</hi> in the Blood, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that Fat is nothing but a concrete of <hi>Acid,</hi> and Oily Parts:
When the Blood is deſtitute of <hi>Acids,</hi> and abounds with <hi>Alkalies,</hi>
as it doth with all People who have too much <hi>Acid</hi> in their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs,
the Blood deſtitute of <hi>Acids</hi> to coagulate the Oyl, there
can be no Fat produced: And that already generated, having its
<hi>Acid</hi> mortify'd by <hi>Alkalies,</hi> looſes its conſiſtence, and is turned
into a thin Oyl, and when the Oyl is gone, the <hi>Alkalies</hi> prey on
the Muſcles, Nerves, and Fibers, and cauſe general Diſorders.
Thirdly, Thoſe troubled with Acidity in the Stomach, are Coſtive,
becauſe the more thin Parts are carry'd off by the Urinary Veſſels.
But it may be objected, How comes it to paſs that <hi>Steel</hi> which is
an <hi>Acid</hi> Cures <hi>Atrophies,</hi> and does not exaſperate them, by increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Acidity in the Stomach. I anſwer, <hi>Steel</hi> cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
into the Blood before it be turn'd into <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and therefore
it is neceſſary to give it unprepar'd to People of <hi>Acid</hi> Stomachs:
By in the <hi>Acid</hi> is ſo embody'd that it can't paſs thro' the Urinary
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59081:23"/>
Veſſels, and is hindred from attenuating the Chyle, and ſo being
mix'd with the Chyle, they are together conveyed into the ſmall
Guts, and ſo on to the Blood, where by its Styptick Acidity it
confirms the texture of the Blood, and mortifies the <hi>Alkalous</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</p>

               <p>That few People are troubled with Acidity in their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs,

produce too much Acidity in the Stomachs of many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
but of thoſe that ſeldom uſe ſuch ſitting, but live the moſt
ſtirring Lives, I have known more three to one, troubled with
ſour Stomachs, than of thoſe that uſe little Exerciſe. The <hi>Saliva</hi>
which you account the ferment of the Stomach, I have ſhew'd is
not an <hi>Acid</hi> in its natural State; and tho' from the ſmall quantity
of <hi>Salſum</hi> got from it, an <hi>Acid</hi> may be Diſtill'd; yet in the
Stomach, it acts not as an <hi>Acid,</hi> and ſo it cannot change the Food
into Acidity, by being too long retain'd in the Stomach, for want
of Exerciſe: But when there's any <hi>Acid</hi> in the Stomach, 'tis as I
have ſaid, from things ingeſted, conſiſting of divers Particles apt

                  </gap>d ſo, becauſe by this Acidity, (which you ſay, ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
into the Blood) the Food is attenuated, and converted into
a thin Subſtance; and ſo by the preſſure of the Liver ſqueez'd
thro' certain Veffels, which paſs from the bottom of the Stomach
to the Kidneys, and ſo is carry'd off by Urine. I ſay, you ſhou'd
firſt be ſure that there are ſuch Veſſels; which you can never be,
but by being skill'd in the Anatomy of the Solid Parts, and ſo hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>a Qualification to talk finely:</hi> For to talk truely of things
ſeen with ones own Eyes, is the fineſt talk that can be in Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
You ſhould not have built ſo great a Superſtructure, on a
Foundation you have no Knowledge of: But had better have
ſtay'd a little, till you had given an Occular Demonſtration of theſe
Veſſels; ſince you believe, you ſhall ſo ſuddenly be able to do it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and when you had found them, you might have Talk'd more fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For your two Obſervations, and <hi>Doleus</hi>'s to help you, are
not ſufficient and plain Demonſtrations, as you ſay. Let us conſider
both your Author's and your own Arguments. <hi>Doleus</hi> does but
ſuppoſe there may be ſuch a Paſſage thro' the <hi>Omentum</hi> to the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys;
but to ſtrengthen his ſuppoſition, he tells us, thoſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
that have no Caul, make no Water: He ſhou'd have ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:59081:23"/>
thoſe Animals, but have no Caul, have no Kidneys: And if that
had been true, it might have look'd like an Argument that they
do not Piſs: But if there are Animals that have no Caul, and
yet have Kidneys, as Birds have: what uſe are they for, if not
to ſeparate ſome ſerous matter from the Blood? and tho' they do
not Piſs in the manner, as ſome Animals do, being more dry and
perſpiring much; yet there is, as is well known, a paſſage from
their Reins, into the common paſſage of the thicker Excrements.
In his Diſſection of Animals firſt gorged with Water, and finding
the Veſſels of the Caul turgid; he ſhou'd have certify'd himſelf,
that thoſe Veſſels were turgid with the Water that was reciev'd
into the Stomach, and have ſeen that he could preſs it out of the

who took your Medicines on <hi>Monday</hi> Morning, which you Taſted
on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Night in her Urine, and was well by <hi>Thurſday</hi> Morning:
I don't queſtion, tho' you give no more than theſe two, but
that you could give us a Hundred more ſuch Stories: But if we
ſuopoſe, theſe matters of Fact true, I ſay, the ſpeedieſt of your
Cures is not ſo ſudden, as to make it neceſſary to conclude, that
the Medicines could not go a longer March, and thro' more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files
than if they be ſuppos'd to paſs by the way of the <hi>Lacteal</hi>-Veins.
Almoſt every one's Experience, will certifie them of more
ſudden Effects of things taken into the Body, in the remoteſt Parts
from the Stomach. When we are faint and weak by Faſting,
and take Meat and Drink, we ſoon feel a ſenſible Refreſhment and
Strength throughout the whole Body, and thoſe that take too
much Vinous Liquors, in a very ſhort time, will feel the Effects there
of in their very Finger-ends. Beſides its well known, that divers
things taken into the Stomach, will in half an Hours time produce
their Effects in the very Skin, cauſing copious Sweats. And what's
more, I my ſelf, have Experienc'd that the mere Taſting a thing,
has in a few Minutes time wrought by Sweat, Vomiting and Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Nay, ſome things apply'd outwardly, will very ſoon both
Purge and Vomit; the Particles of which can't be communicated
to the Stomach, but by a longer way than from the Stomach to
the Kidneys by the <hi>Lacteals.</hi> And as for the Taſting of things in
the Urine; I ſay, you never Taſted any of your <hi>Acids</hi> there: But
whatever you might Taſte in the Urine, it's no Argument of your
ſhort paſſage: The Taſte of things is oft found remaining, where
they muſt be ſuppos'd to have paſs'd the <hi>Lacteals.</hi> Every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Woman
knows it by Experience, that Crow Gerlick will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be very ſtrongly Taſted in her Cow's-Milk, but will hardly ever
be loſt in the Cheeſe made thereof. As for the total deſtruction of
things, you talk of; there's no ſuch thing in Nature. And as to
your fancy, that thoſe troubled with ſour Stomachs, make Water
often, and much; I in my ſelf Experience the contrary, being
commonly troubled with too much Acidity, if I Drink any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
quantity of Fermented Liquors, and yet I have ſeldom
met with any but will Piſs once, or twice, before I have any ſuch
motion; neither do I find my ſelf make more Water, when trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59081:25"/>
with a ſour Stomach, than at other times. Nor are <hi>Acids</hi> ſo
apt to attenuate the Nutritious Parts of our Food: Every one
that knows how to make a Poſſet can tell you, that the more Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive
part of Milk, is curdled, and hardened by <hi>Acieds:</hi>
And our Chyle it ſelf is of the Nature of Milk. As for
leanneſs, that it is cauſed by want of <hi>Acid</hi> in the Blood to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulate
the Oyl, it is but your fancy. If you had examin'd
Fat by the Fire, or any way whereby you may judg of it, you
would not have found it more <hi>Acid</hi> than Fleſh or Blood, but have
found it paſt your Art to ſeparate it into an <hi>Acid</hi> and an Oyl; nor
did you ever take <hi>Acid</hi> and Oyl mixed with a great deal of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and coagulate them into Fat by ſuch a heat, as that of our
Body. You may indeed coagulate Oyl into Brimſtone by an <hi>Acid,</hi>
but you muſt uſe ſuch a heat, as cannot be ſuppoſed in the body
of an Animal, and your <hi>Acid</hi> muſt be ſtronger, and your Oyl
more undivided than they can be ſuppos'd to be while diluted,
and mixed with the aqueous, and <hi>Alkalous</hi> Liquors of the Body.
If you had underſtood Sope-making, you might have ſeen Oyl
and Greeſe coagulated, and hardned by ſtrong boyling with fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Alkalies</hi> inſtead of being made thin, and you ſhould have try'd
whether Volatile <hi>Alkalies</hi> would turn Fat into a thin Oyl, before
you had ſo poſitively aſſerted it: For it is well known on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that Vinegar is given with ſucceſs to thoſe that are too fat:
An example of which, ſee <hi>Cattieri,</hi> Obj. 13. p. 44. in a Military
Man that was very fat, who by continual uſe of Vinegar,
decreaſed eighty ſeven Pounds. As for the coſtiveneſs of thoſe
troubled with ſour Stomachs, I alſo experienced the contrary,
being ſeldom or never coſtive eſpeciolly when troubled with too
much Acidity in my Stomach. But we come to your own raiſed
Objection: How can Steel, an <hi>Acid,</hi> cure <hi>Atrophies,</hi> and not rather
exaſperate them by encreaſing Acidity in the Stomach? Here
Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> you had given us ſome of your deep thoughts in a rare
diſcovery, that Steel has that excellent property to carry the
preternatural <hi>Acid</hi> of the Stomach into the Blood, there to do
fine feats: But we muſt take it upon your word, for you have
not proved by any Experiment, that Steel thus uſhers the <hi>Acid</hi>
in through the <hi>Lacteal</hi> Veins, which would without its aſſiſtance,
have been let down at the inviſible trap-doors in the bottom of
the Stomach. You ſuppoſe the <hi>Acid</hi> too groſs, when turn'd into
Vitriol to paſs thoſe fine outlets, which I confeſs are ſo fine,
that I could never ſee them; but <hi>Vitriol</hi> I know when diſſolved
(and it cannot be ſuppoſed long in a coagulated form in the
Stomach) will paſs very fine filters, and inſinuate itſelf through
the pores of Veſſels, that will hold divers other Liquors:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59081:26"/>
And here is another Myſtery ſtill, that one <hi>Acid</hi> is diſſolved by,
and coagulated with another. But the truth of the matter
ſpoils all your diſcovery, which is that Steel by all tryals is found
to be an <hi>Alkali,</hi> fermenting with, and abſorbing <hi>Acids,</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
hindring them where ever they go together with it from
having the effects of <hi>Acids.</hi> And a far better reaſon of the good
effects of Steel, where it is found a beneficial Remedy, is that as
an <hi>Alkali,</hi> it abſorbs the <hi>Acids</hi> in the Stomach and Bowels, and
ſo hinders them from doing miſchief, either there, or in any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
receſſes, paſſing any way into the Blood, or urinary Veſſels,
ſheathing their offenſive poynts, carries them off with itſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Excrements of the Belly. But farther, to ſhew how
repugnant your fancies are to reaſon, and themſelves, you ſhall
ſuppoſe your Urinary Veſſels from the Stomach to the Kidneys,
and that <hi>Acids</hi> have the power of attenuating things, and paſſing
that way: Then according to your Doctrine we can't ſuppoſe
them to take any other courſe, this being the readieſt way, and
how freely ſoever you give your <hi>Acid</hi> Medicines, they will be
ſtill preternatural <hi>Acids</hi> in the Stomach, (and wo be to the Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
they uſe but little Exerciſe) and you can never hope to do
any thing in the Blood with them, they paſſing all off by Urine,
with the attenuated nutritive Juice, and leave occaſion for Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies;
and all Diſeaſes you ſuppoſe coming from the abounding
of <hi>Alkalies,</hi> and want of <hi>Acids</hi> in the Blood, unleſs Nature knows
your <hi>Acids</hi> from others, or that they are embodied, as you ſay,
by Steel, or ſome other <hi>Alkali,</hi> and then in truth <hi>actum eſt de
Acido;</hi> ſince there is no fire in the Blood, (if thoſe <hi>Vitriols</hi> or other
embodied <hi>Acids</hi> ever come there) capable to diſtil Oyl of <hi>Vitriol</hi>
or ſeparate the <hi>Acid</hi> from thoſe other <hi>Alkalies</hi> it is embodied
with. But if ſome part of your <hi>Acid</hi> ſhould ſcape falling through
the holes at the bottom of the Stomach, and run along for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
uncoagulated into the Guts, there will ſtill be a difficulty
for it to paſs into the Lacteals from the Bile; if it be not defect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
or the <hi>Acid</hi> too much in quantity: This guard ſallying forth
into the ſmall Guts, being the moſt <hi>Alkalous</hi> Liquor of the whole

if by Excrement, you mean ſomething ſeparated, and rejected

the <hi>Saliva, Mucus, Succus Nervoſus, &amp; Semen,</hi> all which have their
ſpecial and proper ends towards the conſervation, or propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Body. That the Gaul cannot be rationally ſuppoſed to be
an Excrement in the proper ſenſe, is apparent from the manner and
way of its ſeparation. The Liver the largeſt Bowel in the Body,
having no other aſſignable uſe, but the ſecretion of this Liquor,
which is ejected moſt commonly into the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> rarely into
the <hi>Jejunum,</hi> and there mixed with the Chyle, as all that are skill'd
in the Anatomy of the ſolid Parts know. But it cannot well
be thought, that a meer Excrement ſhould be thus diſcharged
into the boſome of the nutritious Juice, being the moſt <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>
matter in the whole Body, and ſo according to Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi>
the moſt Pernicious: But on the contrary, this Liquor diſcharg'd
into the Chyle, ſo ſoon after its egreſs from the Stomach, is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
there for the hinderance of too much Acidity, from paſſing
thro' the <hi>Lacteals</hi> into the Blood; which appears from the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the Nature of this Liquor, which by Diſtillation yields
a volatile <hi>Alkalous,</hi> in the <hi>Caput Mort.</hi> a <hi>Lixivious</hi>-Salt running in
the Air, which I have not found in any of the Liquid, or Solid
Parts of the Body beſides, except the Dung, which has a fixed
Salt ſomewhat like it, but not ſo ſtrong: Whence I conclude, it
has ſome <hi>Acids</hi> mix'd with it carry'd down by the Gall: With
theſe Salts, the Gall yields alſo a <hi>Faetid</hi> Oyl, as other Animal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
do, but the Particles of this Liquor, as mix'd together in
their Natural State, make ſuch a Compound as is preſently thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
or coagulated by <hi>Acids,</hi> more, or leſs, as the <hi>Acid</hi> is ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or weaker, into a clammy glutinous Matter, whereby the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
<hi>Acid</hi> Patticles, that are ſometimes contain'd in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
are inviſcated and hamper'd, and ſo in great meaſure hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
from paſſing into the <hi>Lacteal</hi>-Veins. But I could never ſee
the Gall make any ſuch efferveſcency with <hi>Acids,</hi> as ſome Authors
talk of; tho' I have Try'd all ſorts of <hi>Acids,</hi> and many kinds of
Galls: And as it is it ſelf coagulated by manifeſt <hi>Acids,</hi> ſo it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the temperate <hi>Lacteal</hi> juice from being ſo ſoon coagulated;
as is ſeen in this, that Milk into which, a few Drops of Gall are
put, will ſtand in its due conſiſtence un-coagulated, when Milk
alone will be turn'd and ſour'd: So that the proper uſe of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59081:27"/>
Gall, ſeems to me, to be for the attemperating the Nutritious-Juice,
and ſo in the <hi>Duodenum, Jejunum &amp; Ileum,</hi> is a great friend,
tho' detain'd in the Body, will play the Devil, you ſay. By being
detain'd, I ſuppoſe, you mean not duly ſeparated from the Blood,
and diſcharg'd into the Chyle. To which, I anſwer, Its remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Blood is not ſo bad, but its abſence from the <hi>Offl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Chyle, is as great an evil to the Animal Oeconomy; in
which a proportionable and harmonious mixture, is that in which
Health conſiſteth: In which, the Wiſdom of the Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is ſeen, that all the Parts, and Particles in the <hi>Hydraluico-pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi>
Engine the Body, are ſo order'd, that they help, and are
again helped by one another; as here there's proviſion made for
ſeparating the Particles that make up the <hi>Bilious</hi>-Juice e'er they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in the Blood, and when they are Ejected, they become as
uſeful to prevent another ſort of Particles paſſing into the Blood,
which wou'd be as hurtful there, as their detentation in it wou'd
be prejudicial. And there are not ſeen more evil Effects from the
Gall's retention in the Veins, than from its abſence in the Guts.

our Lives are nothing but a Flame, or Fire of the ſame Nature with

that commonly uſed, or very analogous to it, I think is plain. Its
the Nature of common Fire, to conſume whatever is a proper

which are Aſhes and Soot. The Body of Man would ſoon be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd,

and what would become of what we Eat and Drink, I can't under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand;

where Air can't come at him, he immediately Expires, as is well
known to Miners. Heat and Warmth are the conſtant Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants
of Fire, and that there's Heat and Warmth in the Body

                  </gap>rrence of ſome of the greateſt Men the World has afforded,
that the Life of Man is a Flame. The <hi>Phoſphorus,</hi> which is as
much Fire as any thing we know, is a true Animal Fire, to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
from all Animal Subſtances; and if it did not actually exiſt
in them, how can it be Extracted from them I know not: It is an
<hi>Acid</hi> Sulpherous Subſtance, and the <hi>Pabulum</hi> of Animal Fires, is a
Sulpherous <hi>Acid:</hi> Common Sulphur, Tallow, Pitch, do abound with
Sulphur, &amp; are inflammable; yet from none of theſe is by any known
Artifice the leaſt Phoſphorus, or any thing like it attainable. Upon
the ſtroaking of Cats in the dark, flaſhes of fire will follow. This
gentle ſtroaking can never cauſe ſo violent a motion, as you
make Fire to be, unleſs it were actually in the Animal. I confeſs
Fire is a ſubſtance conſtantly in motion, and a brisk motion, yet
all brisk motion is not Fire: But I know ſeveral fluids the more
briskly moved the colder; as a River is always colder where the
Current is moſt ſwift. And which is none of the leaſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to prove our Life is a Flame; let a Man be ſeizſed with a
Feaver, or any Diſtemper attended with a total loſs of Appetite,
the Fat will firſt be conſumed, and a Corpulent Man ſoon
brought to a Skeleton, when the evacuations of Urine and Stool
are leſs than in Health: Which could not be, unleſs there were
a Flame to cauſe that Conſumption. There is a difference in ſome
reſpects between Animal and Culinary Fire, in many they agree.
Neither will burn without due acceſs of Air; both cauſe warmth:
Neither can ſubſiſt without a ſupply of Sulphurous <hi>Acid</hi> Particles,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59081:28"/>
but Animal Fire (ſo I call <hi>Phoſphorus)</hi> immerg'd in Water, and
taken out will retain its properties without being applied to other
enkindled Bodies: This common Fire will not do. Now where
ever there is a Fire or Flame, eſpecially when ſupplied with

<hi>Alkali</hi> found in Animals is the Excrement of their Fire, and all
the Excrements of Animals are <hi>Alkalous.</hi> As for the Blood, the
Volatile <hi>Alkali</hi> to be obtain'd from it is only the Excrementious
part of it, or rather of the vital Flame, or of its <hi>Pabulum,</hi> in a
way of being carried off by ſome of the Emunctories, which if it

ſay, thoſe great Men, and you, ſhould have had ſome certain
notion of Fire, and firſt have told us what it is. For to tell us
that the Life of Man is a Fire, and not tell us what Fire is, is
all one, as to tell us, That the Life of Man is a ſomething, you
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59081:28"/>
know not what. But that this ſomething, may not continue like
the Philoſopher's undetermin'd Matter, and ſo all that is ſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
uncertain; let us conſider, what it is that is properly
call'd Fire. I ſay therefore, <hi>1ſt.</hi> That Fire is ſomething in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Nature, <hi>2dly.</hi> That Bodily Nature, is nothing but Matter
conſiſting of Particles of all Figures and Sizes. <hi>3dly.</hi> Theſe Particles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as they have different Figures and Sizes, are capable of different
degrees and manners of Motion. <hi>4thly.</hi> That all the different
Ideas, or Perceptions we have of Bodies, are cauſed by means of
the different Figures, and Motions of the Particles. <hi>5th.</hi> That there
is no ſort of Particles, of what Figure, or Size ſoever, that mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on that account of Figure and Size, can Properly be call'd
Fire; ſo that the old Notion of Fire's being an Element of any
thing, is falſe. <hi>6th.</hi> But to the Being of Fire, there's requir'd a
certain degree and manner of Motion, of ſuch Particles, that as
to Figure and Size, are capable thereof. <hi>7th.</hi> That theſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
muſt have ſuch a degree and manner of Motion, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
on our Bodies, the two Senſations of Light, if not at too
great a diſtance, and Heat, if no hindering Medium interpoſe.
<hi>8th.</hi> To the production of which Senſations, a certain quantity of
Matter, fit for ſuch Motion, and actually ſo mov'd, is requiſite to
come together. 9, That thoſe Particles are more readily excited
to, and longer continued in this degree and manner of Motion,
in ſome Bodies, commonly call'd Fewel, than in others. <hi>10th.</hi> That
they more or leſs ſeparate the Parts, or ſpoil the Form of ſuch
Bodies. <hi>11th.</hi> To aſſert poſitively this, or that to be the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Size and Figure, or determinate degree and manner of Motion,
of Fire making Particles, would be too great a preſumption;
becauſe they are too ſmall to be Objects of Sight; yet we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them rigid and inflexible Particles, mov'd moſt briskly to
and fro, becauſe they break and ſeparate many Compounds, and
when apply'd too near our Bodies, occaſion the moſt diſpleaſing
Senſation of Burning; but at a convenient diſtance, pleaſe us by
juſtling againſt us more ſmooth and flexible Bodies. Theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
if well conſider'd, I think, may give us ſome determinate
Notion of Fire: There's never any Fire, but where there is a
brisk Motion; and you grant me, that all brisk Motion is not Fire,
but ſuch a Motion as I have deſcrib'd; and no other that I know
of, will determine the matter ſo, as that we may not ſay, every
Motion is Fire, or no motion is Fire. Now Fire, as I have ſaid, being
a congeries of a quantity of ſubtil, rigid and inflexible Parts ſo mov'd,
as to cauſe the ſenſations of Heat and Light, and if too near the
Body that of Burning, there can be no ſuch thing found in the Body
of Man. But let us conſider your own Arguments, you uſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59081:29"/>
us of the Exiſtence of a Fire, or Flame in the Blood. The
Nature of common Fire, ſay you, is to conſume its proper <hi>Pabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi>
or Fewel, and to leave Aſhes and Soot as its Excrements,
which you appeal to Chymiſts are <hi>Alkalies.</hi> The Body of Man
would be conſumed, unleſs ſupply'd with proper Food (fewel you
mean for the Fire) and how this could be, and what ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of all we Eat and Daink, unleſs there were a Fire in us to
conſume it, you don't know, and the <hi>Alkali</hi> found in Animals, is
the Excrement of their Fire. I anſwer, that change wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
combuſtible Bodies by Fire, and what alteration is made on
our Food in the Body, is vaſtly different, and neither is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummption
in the vulgar ſenſe, not one Particle of Matter being
to be rationally thought to be deſtroy'd. But real Fire by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Motion ſeparates the Parts of many compound Bodies, both
the combuſtible and incombuſtible ones. Thoſe Bodies we call
combuſtible, abound more or leſs, with Oily Parts, which are as it
were the <hi>Vehicle</hi> of the <hi>Igneous:</hi> But there are few of thoſe Bodies
but are compounded of other kinds of Parts, beſides <hi>Oleous,</hi>
which in the hurry are ſeparated from one another, and not only
ſo, but ſometimes alter'd, either broken into ſmaler Parts, or by
ſtrikeing together, are connected one with an other otherwiſe than
they were in the natural compound; whence new reſulting Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
or artificial compounds ariſe, ſuch as Soot, and ſix'd <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi>
being ſeparable again. Now which of theſe ſeparated Bodies,
ſhould rather be call'd an Excrement (if the fancy of calling any
of them ſo muſt be allow'd) is merely Arbitrary: In moſt of them
Water is the greateſt quantity, of that which is caſt out as moſt
unfit for the continuance of this hurry, and ſo might rather be
call'd the Excrement. The <hi>Acid</hi> and Volatile <hi>Alkalious</hi> Bodies are
carry'd off next, and the Oyl it ſelf, tho' commonly alter'd, is
moſt of it ſeparated before the Fire goes quite out; the fix'd <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali,</hi>
and thoſe portions of Oyl, and <hi>Acid,</hi> that ſtick in it to make
it ſuch, abiding in the Earth laſt with the <hi>Igneous</hi> particles. Now
whatever, is done here, is done by a violent ſeparation, and ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together of the Parts of Matter. But what alterations of things
are made in the Body, are made by the gentle Motions of Natural
ferments, and ſeparations by peculiar Strainers of the curiouſly
compos'd Organical Frame, wherein there's no ſuch degree and
manner of Motion, as can properly be call'd Fire. As for the
Conſumption of the Body, you ſay, would ſoon be, if there were
not a ſupply by Food; I anſwer, The forbearance of Food,
would not conſume the Body, but the Organical Frame of it,
yea, and Blood, both containing a great quantity of Oyl, will re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>main
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59081:29"/>
unconſum'd in ſpight of Hunger. And the Fat, which you
ſay, is firſt conſum'd in Feavers and Diſeaſes where there's a total
loſs of Appetite is carry'd off, not becauſe it is combuſtible, and
ſo Burnt away; but becauſe its apt to be attenuated, and does not
ſo firmly adhere as other Parts. The Evacuations by Stool and
Urine, muſt needs be little, when the Appetite is loſt, and little
Eat: But at all times, its well known, the Evacuations by the
Pores, are the greateſt. And as for what we Eat and Drink, tho'
you can't tell what ſhould become of it, if there were not a Fire
to conſume it: Yet any one that is led more by Conſideration and
Experiment, than Fancy, may as eaſily give an account of the
waſte of it, as of wearing out a Coat, or a pair of Shooes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſuppoſing ſome Fire or other that Burns them to pieces. The
Food is firſt ſomewhat ſeparated by Chewing, then in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
by a gentle Heat, and Motion, and probably by ſome ſort
of Fermentation; the things we Eat, moſt of them being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
thereof, if kept in a moderate Heat, and ſufficient Moyſture,
even out of the Body: Then in the ſmall Guts there is a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made, and great part is carry'd down, and rejected as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements,
which Coals, (if you pleaſe,) you may catch as hot as
ever they were without Burning your Fingers. That part that is
not thus rejected is <hi>Percolated</hi> into the <hi>Lacteal</hi> Veins, which convey
it into the <hi>Ductus Chyliferus,</hi> and ſo into the Blood, for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
the Parts, both Liquid and Solid; the <hi>Serous</hi> part being but
the <hi>Vehicle</hi> for the more ſolid, and the <hi>Globules</hi> of the Blood. Whilſt
a Man grows, the different Particles of this Nutritive-Juice, as they
are fit ſome for one thing, ſome for another, adhere, and are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Parts of the Body, and ſo encreaſe its Bulk; thoſe
Parts that are more thin, and fluid, add to and increaſe the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
of the Body, out of which, great part is ſeparated by Urine.
When a Man has done growing, there is no need of addition,
but only of a ſupply of as much as dayly waſtes, which conſidering
the Poreouſneſs of the Body in all Parts, and the continual natural,
and voluntary Motions thereof, for the feveral Works of Life, can't
eaſily be ſuppos'd to be little, tho' we can find no <hi>Focus</hi> for a Fire
to conſume us. It's very well known that Labouring Men, and
that in Cold-Weather, have better Stomachs, and Eat more, than
thoſe that live Idlely, tho' kept hotter than the Laborious; which
may well be thought to proceed from their uſing more Motion,
whereby the Particles of Food are carry'd about more ſwiftly and
at length work'd out, and this all done merely by rubbing, where
there is no Fire, which you ſay, rejects as Excrements Soot and
Aſhes, the one of which may be farther ſeparated into Volatile
Salt, and Oyl, the other into Earth and fix'd <hi>Alkali,</hi> either of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59081:30"/>
which you may call an Excrement of the other, as you love
or hate, this or that: But you are fallen out with <hi>Alkali, &amp; ſtercus
humanum, offends your ſqueemiſh ſtomach, ergo, Alkali Merda eſt, Alkali</hi>
is the Excrement. Which I think, as good a Reaſon as any
you have given. But yet whatever analogy may be in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of combuſtibles by common-Fire, and of our Food
by any thing in the Body, there is this vaſt difference; In this
there is no Soot nor Aſhes made of what we Eat and Drink,
much leſs of the Air, The other Fewel as you call it, which we
breath in. Here neither the Flame, not the Coal will Burn you,
enkindle the moſt combuſtible Matter, or give you any Light.
And tho' a Volatile <hi>Alkali</hi> and an Oyl, ſomething like what may
be got from Soot, may be ſeparated from the Liquid, or Solid
Parts of the Body, they muſt firſt be wrought upon by a common
and greater Fire, than any is in the Blood: And tho' from the
Gall, and Dung may alſo be ſeparated a ſmall quantity of fix'd Salt,
they muſt firſt be expos'd to a real and violent Fire, and ſo muſt
the other Parts, before there can be produc'd any thing that may
be call'd Aſhes from them. Common Fire, you ſay, can't ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
without Air, and the like you affirm of the Life of Man; ſo
they muſt be both Fires. I anſwer, Tho' both require Air; yet
not for the ſame Reaſon. The Air is an Elaſtick or Springey
Body, capable of being expanded, or contracted, and in its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion
by Heat, or the Motion of the <hi>Igneous</hi> Particles (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
when ever a quantity of them, ſufficient to produce the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
can be connected) I ſay in its expanſion, or the receeding of its
Parts from the place where the Fire is begun, it carries off the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the combuſtible Matter, that are ſeparated, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
no longer combuſtible, and ſo there's more room for
the <hi>Igneous</hi> Particles to move on; as is evidently ſeen in Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Furnaces, where the ſtrength of the Fire, depends on the
quick carrying off the Smoak, which is done by a ſtream of
Air paſſing thro' the Bodies in combuſtion, and carrying off thoſe
Particles that would hinder the Motion of the <hi>Igneous</hi> Bodies: The
Air where the Fire is being rarify'd, that below being more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd,
expands it ſelf into the place where is moſt room, and
other Air ſucceeds it, (the Air being more dilated the higher it is)
the more compreſs'd Air ſtill paſſing that way; ſo ſtill the ſtronger
the Fire, the ſtronger the Draught of Air, and the faſter the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Parts that would hinder the motion of the <hi>Igneous</hi> Bodies are
removed. But the Life of Man requires Air, not to blow a Fire,
carry off Soot, or diſplace Aſhes, much leſs as a Fewel for a
Fire; but beſides many other Ends and Uſes, chiefly to continue
and cary on the Circulation of the Blood: Which I take to be done
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59081:30"/>
after this manner, The Air by its Elaſtick Property, ruſhing into the
Lungs, upon the dilation of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> expands them, and thereby
ſets the <hi>Sanguiferous</hi> Veſſels free and right for the paſſage of the
Blood out of the right Ventricle of the Heart into the <hi>Vena Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſa,</hi>
at the riſe of which, there are Valves to hinder its paſſage
back again; this Veſſel and the <hi>Arteria venoſa</hi> by their <hi>Anaſtomoſes</hi>
being fill'd with Blood, the Thorax is again contracted, the Air
preſſed out, and the Lungs fall together; whereby the Blood-Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
are preſſed: But the foreſaid Valves hindring its going back,
it is drove into the Left Ventricle of the Heart, whence it cannot
return into the Lungs, by reaſon other Valves hindering it; the
Thorax being again dilated, and the Lungs by the Air ruſhing in
expanded, and the Veſſels, whoſe Blood was preſſed out into the
Left Ventricle of the Heart, again free; the Blood flows into them
again from the Right Ventricle, by which filling and emptying of
the Veſſels of the Lungs, the Blood is as it were pump'd and
carried along in its Circulation: And is there as it were ground,
its adhering Globules ſeparated, and divided from one another,
its Heterogeneous Particles more exactly mix'd, and ſo is attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
and made more capable of paſſing the ſmalleſt Veſſels thro'
the whole Body. So that the principal reaſon, why a Man can't
live long without Air, is becauſe the Blood can't otherwiſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
through the Lungs which way it muſt go; which evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appears from the conſideration of a Child unborn, who lives
divers Months without reſpiration, the Blood being carried on
by the force of the Circulation of the Mothers Blood through the
<hi>Foramen Ovale,</hi> from the Right to the Left Ventricle of the Heart;
which is ſtop'd when the Child is born, and becomes a diſtinct,
and ſeparate Animal, needing a force of its own to carry on the
Circulation. The reaſon why Perſons are often kill'd in Mines,
is not becauſe there is no Air, it being impoſſible almoſt to keep
it out, but that they ſometimes breath in with the Air Arſenical,
Sulphurous, or other noxious Fumes, of which one would think
a <hi>Profeſs'd Chymiſt</hi> could not be ignorant: But you may ſoon try;
the Fumes of <hi>Antimony, Arſnick,</hi> or the beloved Sulphurous <hi>Acid,</hi>
ſteaming from enkindled Brimſtone drawn into your Lungs, will
in a little time be found no good Fewel for your ſuppoſed <hi>Bioly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chnium.</hi>
As to your Argument from Heat and Warmth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants
of Fire, and in the Body of Man. I Anſwer, Heat is
moſt certainly the concomitant of Fire, and alſo brisk Motion, but
as you confeſs all brisk Motion is not Fire; ſo I ſay, all Heat and
Warmth is not Fire, and the briskeſt Motion in the Body of Man,
either in Health or Sickneſs, is not brisk enough to make a real
Fire in the weakeſt degree. And tho' you can't ſee how Heat
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59081:31"/>
and Warmth could be ſuſtain'd without a Fire; you may as well
ſay, you can't ſee how a Man can walk unleſs he be running.
Warmth, Heat, and Fire it ſelf, is nothing but meer Motion in
ſeveral degrees and manners, and wherever there is motion there
is ſome degree of Warmth, tho' we may not perceive it, for
there is no ſuch thing as abſolute cold unleſs where all things are
in abſolute reſt, which place would be hard to find. Whatever
Heat, or Warmth is cauſed in Fluids, is cauſed by mere Motion,
even where they are ſet over a Fire, but the nature of watry
Bodies, ſuch as the Liquors in Man, will not admit a real Fire or
Flame to be mixed with, and continue in them; and tho' by
Motion they may be brought to a Heat inconſiſtent with the Life
of the Body; yet this very Motion is not Fire. But doubtleſs
the Heat in Man's Body is cauſed by ſome kind of Motion, and
probably a fermentative one; the Blood and other Liquors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
divers ſalts and Oily particles may well be thought ſo to
move together, as to cauſe the greateſt Heat in the Body of
Man. I confeſs a meer Oyl, and ſome very ſtrong <hi>Acid</hi> Spirits, will
by their mixture be enkindled into a real Flame, but there never
is nor can be ſuch a mixture flow in the Veins of a living Man;
ſo there is never Heat enough to enkindle the moſt inflammable
Bodies. You may take <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> without any fear of its being
ſet on fire in your Belly, which tho' as little Heat would enkindle,
yet not immerg'd in a watry Liquor, or without the ſufficient
acceſs of Air; for which very reaſon there can be no Fire in the
Blood. And <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> it ſelf, tho' ſo apt to be enkindled, I have
known lie for a Month, and might have done as long as one
would, in a Glaſs ſeal'd up without any Water, or the Air ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
and not at all take Fire. The continuance of our Heat
is very eaſily conceived to be by a continual ſupply of <hi>Saline,</hi>
and <hi>Oleous Particles</hi> apt to joſtle againſt one another in a watry
Liquor, and move ſufficiently to keep us warm. We know that
divers Liquors mix'd together, will cauſe a Heat, even where
there is nothing inflammable in either of them. It has been found
by experience, that the heat of hot Springs proceeds from a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Bed where are Salts of divers natures, which the Water
coming to diſſolves, and ſo their Motion produces the Heat, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like that, produced by pouring Water upon Lime, which
I think no Man in his Wits can aſcribe to a Fire or Flame in the
Water. That you ſay ſome Fluids the brisker moved are the
colder, is your miſtake; that a River is not coldeſt in the current
appears from this, that the Current is not ſo ſoon froze; and tho'
the wind by its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tion cauſes the ſenſe of cold, yet it is not merely
by its Motion, but becauſe the Particles moving ſtraight on in a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59081:31"/>
line hinder the hurrying Motion, which is the formal cauſe of
heat, of the Sun Beams, which luminous Particles while diſpers'd
and ſeperate have not force enough to cauſe the effect of Fire,
or burning; yet when collected, and bundled up in the <hi>Focus</hi>
of a Burning-glaſs, are in a poſture to cauſe that ſenſation, when
an Inch diſtant from the <hi>Focus</hi> they have not ſuch an united
force. As to your maxim, <hi>There is no Smoak but there is ſome Fire,</hi>
I anſwer, the ſteams of our Bodies are not Smoak, nor if you
could catch them, would they have a Grain of Soot, but are
very little beſides Water, as I could ſhew any body by a method
whereby one may collect, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight Ounces,
or more of Sweat from a Man at any time: And Water we all
know is rarified, and carried up by a very ſmall heat, as is ſeen
in the coldeſt Weather, and the Water rarified by the Sun, will
appear ſomewhat like ſmoak. As for the <hi>Phoſphorus,</hi> it is not an
Animal Fire, or any Fire at all till enkindled; when ſet on fire
nothing burns fiercer, or burns out ſooner, otherwiſe it is but
a very inflammable Sulphur, or Fuel apt to take fire, being not ſo
much as ſenſibly warm till enkindled. And to the difference you
fancy between this Animal Fire, as you call it, and the common:
I Anſwer, <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> will not have the properties of Fire after
immerſion, or before, unleſs its Particles are excited by ſufficient
Motion; and ſo will other Combuſtible Bodies be enkindled by
ſufficient Motion after Immerſion, yea ſome incombuſtable Bodies
as a Flint, and a Steel by a brisk Friction will give fire, or a piece
of Iron by vigorous hammering light a Match, never the leſs for
being immerg'd. But Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> were his <hi>Biolychnium</hi> under Water
but one Week would never burn again, without a miracle, or the
application of ſome enkindled matter. Farther, <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> may eaſily
be ſuppoſed to be extracted from Animal Subſtances without being
thought to be actually in them, and tho' I grant that it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially
in them, I deny that it was formally: For the Particles
that compoſe this Artificial Compound were diſpers'd, and mix'd
with others, and ſo compoſed no ſuch Body, but are brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by Art, and ſtuck to one another, and then are in that
ſtate call'd <hi>Phoſphorus,</hi> and may be ſeparated again as eaſily, and
then are not <hi>Phoſphorus.</hi> As Glaſs of <hi>Antimony,</hi> or Lead was not
really Glaſs in thoſe Bodies before the Operation of the Fire, but
made by it, and they may be reduced again to <hi>Antimony,</hi> and
Lead, as they were before, and then are no Glaſs. Yea ſome
products of Art were not ſo much as materially, as to their
whole, in the matter wrought upon by the Fire, as <hi>Zink</hi> Lead,
and ſome other Bodies ſome way operated on without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
will not only give Bodies of quite another form, but will
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59081:32"/>
be increaſed in weight conſiderablely. <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> is an <hi>Acido-Sulphurous</hi>
Subſtance you ſay, I ſay rather an <hi>Acido-oleous;</hi> for
<hi>Sulphur</hi> is a Body compounded of an <hi>Acid,</hi> and an Oyl, and to
ſay <hi>Acido-Sulphurous</hi> is allone, as to ſay, <hi>Acido Acido-Oleous.</hi> And
if the <hi>Pabulum</hi> of Animal Fires were a Sulphurous <hi>Acid,</hi> and
<hi>Phoſphorus</hi> a Sulphurous <hi>Acid,</hi> it will follow only, that <hi>Phoſphorus</hi>
may be a <hi>Pabulum</hi> for Animal Fires (were there any) and not
the Animal Fire it ſelf. Common <hi>Sulphur, Tallow, Pitch,</hi> abound
with <hi>Sulphur,</hi> you ſay; That is <hi>Sulphur</hi> abounds with <hi>Sulphur,</hi>
and is inflammable: A Wit! Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> abounds with Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> and
is ſour; this is deep! <hi>Tallow</hi> and <hi>Pitch</hi> abound with <hi>Brimſtone</hi> too
you fancy, but I'm ſure you never got any <hi>Brimſtone</hi> from them,
nor can there be any got without the Addition of an <hi>Acid,</hi> if then.
But whether there can be any <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> made of theſe? I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
yield, there cannot by any Artifice known to Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> but
there are very many things done by Artifice unknown to him.
But you ſaid Sir, a little before, that <hi>Phoſporus</hi> might be got from
all Animal Subſtances; yet now it cannot be got from <hi>Tallow,
&amp;c.</hi> by any Artifice; but you forgot again, that <hi>Tallow</hi> is an
Animal Subſtance; it ſlip'd your memory, being a greaſy body.
Upon ſtroaking of Cats in the dark, flaſhes of Fire will follow,
you ſay. Your Puſs perhaps may ſerve you to ſtrike Fire with,
but it will only prove a <hi>Ignis fatui,</hi> which no Wiſe Man
would call a Fire, or think actually in the Animal as its Vital
Principle, any more than the ſhining of a dead and ſtinking
Whiting, or of a piece of rotten Wood can be thought their life,
or a real Fire. For tho' in theſe there is a light; yet there is
wanting the other qualification a burning Heat, as your Aſſertions
Sir, commonly want two things, without which conjunct they
cannot be more than uncertain Fancies, <hi>viz.</hi> Experiment and
Reaſon, whereby you ſhould have examined the Nature and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties

               <p>The Principles of mix'd Bodie; I take to be <hi>Acid</hi> and
<hi>Sulphur,</hi> as the Vital Active ones; <hi>Alkali</hi> the Principle of Death,
and Corruption: There being ſince the Fall a Principle of Death
in oppoſition to that of Life implanted in our Natures, and not
only in our Natures, but in the Natures of every thing elſe for
our ſakes. [God ſaid to <hi>Adam, Curſed be the ground for thy ſake,</hi>
&amp;c. I confeſs, many of our Age will Laugh and Ridicule me for
having recourſe to Sacred Writ, eſpecially the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
which they look upon as a kind of Romance: But let them Laugh
on. If there were not a Principle of Death within us, how is it
poſſible for a Man one Hour to be in a good ſtate of Health, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59081:32"/>
the very next Expiring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then there is Water and Earth, the two
paſſive Principles: And from theſe I can more eaſily account for
the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in natural Bodies, than from the five old ones, Salt,
Sulphur, and Mercury, Water, and Earth, or any other Principles
broach'd in the World.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Al.</speaker>
               <p>By Principles, I ſuppoſe, you mean the ſame as ſome others
do by Elements, <hi>viz.</hi> Simple Bodies, of which, all Compounds
are ſuppos'd to conſiſt, and into which, they may at laſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd.
To which, I anſwer, That neither theſe Five Things
you call Principles, and would have us believe New, and rather
of your Invention, than of Doctor <hi>Andre</hi>'s, nor the Five old ones
(as you call them, between which and yours there is but little
difference) are indeed, the Elements, or Principles of Compound
Bodies, and ſo ſufficient to ſolve their <hi>Phaenomena</hi>'s: Which may
appear by a little Conſideration. But in the firſt place, I ſhall
obſerve, that your diviſion of Principles into Active and Paſſive,
is not good, or allowable any farther, than as a compliance with an
improper and vulgar way of ſpeaking: For in ſtrict Speech, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be ſaid to do, or be Active, but what has a Will, and
thoſe Bodies by which we receive the ſtrongeſt impreſſions on our
Senſes, and have thence been call'd Active, have indeed no more
Will than the other, that's none at all: To be figured, and mov'd
(which is all that belongs to Body) in what manner ſoever, is not
to Will. As for Earth, I ſhall next obſerve, That, that which you
call Earth, is not that which is properly call'd the Earth: Your
Earth or <hi>Caput Mort.</hi> being as different almoſt, as the Bodies in
which it's found, and conſequently not ſimple, but it ſelf a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.
That which is properly call'd the Earth, is the Quick-Sand,
of which and Water, this Globe chiefly conſiſts; it being
the Baſis of other Bodies, and ſeems to be a Body conſiſting of
<hi>Homogeneal</hi> Particles. And as to the Water that is mov'd thro'
the <hi>interſtices</hi> of theſe Sands, and is found in the Pores of many
Bodies, and the Air that alſo ruſheth into all Porous Bodies,
where it can have paſſage, and compaſſeth them about; they are as
it were the <hi>Vehicles</hi> of groſſer Bodies, themſelves probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of their peculiar ſimilar Particles, and are not to be thought
Elements of other Bodies. For inſtance, Wood though it is Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and ſome of its Pores hold Air, ſome Water; yet they are
not to be call'd Elements of the Wood, any more than Water
running in a Leaden-Pipe, or Air within the Walls of a Houſe,
are to be called Elements of Lead, or of the Houſe.
The Air, and Water, I ſay, are the <hi>Vehicles</hi> of the Particles of
Compound, and changeable Bodies, carrying them to and fro, in
the Production of all the changes we ſee them undergo. But to
come to your ſuppos'd Principles, they will appear not to be the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59081:33"/>
Principles or Elements of Compound Bodies, from theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
Firſt, Whatever are ſuppos'd as Elements, or
Principles of mix'd Bodies ought ſome way or other to be
prov'd really, and actually to Exiſt in the Compounds as Parts of
them. 2. They ought to be unchangeable, and conſequently
ſimple Bodies themſelves. As to the firſt, I ſay, theſe Bodies you
call Principles, are not, nor ever were (that we know of) prov'd
ſo much as likely to Exiſt in, and make up ſome mix'd Bodies, or
us Principles to be in any. For inſtance, Gold is a Body in which
you cannot demonſtrate, that there is one Grain of <hi>Acid,</hi> or Oyl,
or of <hi>Alkali</hi>-Salt, no nor of Water, or of <hi>Caput Mort.</hi> ſo far it is
from being to be thought a Compound of your Five Principles.
But I remember, you have aſſerted, <hi>That Gold is nothing but a pure
Acid and Sulphur,</hi> which you ſaid, <hi>has been made appear, by ſome of
the moſt ſtrict enquirers into Nature's Secrets.</hi> But who thoſe were
you won't tell us: But upon this ſuppoſition, your Five Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are excuſed here. <hi>And the more Acid with Sulphur, any thing
has. the more perfect it is,</hi> you ſay. By Sulphur, I ſuppoſe, you
mean an inflammable Subſtance, and according to this Fancy, <hi>Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi>
which is all <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> would be as perfect as Gold, and
perfecter too, for I'm ſure, you never ſaw any thing inflammable,
or <hi>Acid</hi> in Gold. But the reaſon of this your Opinion, I ſuppoſe,
is this, you have a very great kindneſs for <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and
as much for Gold; therefore Gold is <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Sulphur.</hi> Again, you
ſhall take Chryſtal, Talk, Diamonds, Pearls, Mercury, Silver, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other Bodies, I might name, and your ſtrict enquirers into
Nature, Dr. <hi>Andre,</hi> and all to help you, ſhall not be able to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
any two of your Principles from them. Again, many of thoſe
Bodies from which ſome, or moſt, of thoſe your Principles are
got, may not without ſufficient ground, be thought not actually
to contain them ſuch as they are produc'd, but that they are New
Products, not as to Matter, but as to Form; reſulting from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations
of more ſimple Particles united together by the violence of
the Fire. As for <hi>Acids,</hi> we well know, there are apparent ones,
Naturally in ſome Bodies, Animal and Vegetable, and from others,
produc'd by Art; but even from thoſe Bodies, I can eaſily get an
<hi>Alkali</hi> inſtead of an <hi>Acid,</hi> when I pleaſe, without any addition,
merely by the different ways of Working. For inſtance, I will
take a quantity of a Green Herb, and divide it into two parts, from
one half I will get an <hi>Acid</hi> Liquor, from the other half a Volatile
<hi>Alkalous</hi> Salt, merely by Diſtillation. So likewiſe, I will get a
large quantity of fix'd <hi>Alkali,</hi> and none or very little Volatile
<hi>Alkali,</hi> or a larger quantity of volatile <hi>Alkali,</hi> and little or
no fix'd, which I pleaſe, from the ſame Herb, without any
addition, merely by the different ways of Operating. From
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59081:33"/>
theſe and many other Conſiderations of Things well known to
Chymiſts, it's highly probable, theſe Bodies are rather Products
made by Combinations and Alterations, than the ſimple Elements
of Bodies. And your aſſerting, That <hi>if Alkali were the product of
Fire, the Caput Mort. burnt again, would produce more Alkali,</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
weak: For the <hi>Caput Mort.</hi> has not the matter left whereof to
make it. 2. Principles ought to be unchangeable, or elſe they
cannot be ſuppoſed to be ſimple Bodies, but <hi>Acid, Alkali,</hi> Oyl are
changeable. As for an <hi>Acid,</hi> I can change it into an Oyl, or into
an <hi>Alkali.</hi> Oyl I can change into an <hi>Acid,</hi> and into Oyl again,
or into an <hi>Alkali. Alkali,</hi> I can change into an <hi>Acid,</hi> and
then that <hi>Acid,</hi> into an <hi>Alkali</hi> again. Which things are ſo well
known to all that deſerve the name of Chymiſts, I need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the Proceſſes; and as for thoſe that don't underſtand Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
it is beſides my purpoſe, here to teach them. But as for
you Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> tho' you may think your ſelf uncapable of being
Tranſmuted into an <hi>Alkali</hi>-Doctor, becauſe <hi>The making Acids Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and Alkalies Acids, is contrary to your Experience, or the producing
Alkalies or Acids out of thoſe Bodies, in which they did not Exiſt:</hi> I
can ſhew you ſuch an Experiment at any time, and then you are
oblig'd upon your Word, <hi>to own your ſelf my humble Servant.</hi> As
to the Accounting for the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Natural Bodies from <hi>Acid,
Sulphur, Alkali,</hi> &amp;c. they will ſoon appear too narrow, and inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
(eſpecially if we could take them for ſimple Bodies) to any
Conſiderate Perſon that does not ſerve an Hypotheſis. I challenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Man for inſtance to give me a reaſon of the following <hi>Phaenomona,</hi>
from the mixture of any of your Principles. Firſt in Vegitable,
or Animal Poyſons, how a very ſmall quantity of matter, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
not the hundredth part of a Grain ſhould have ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
various, and ſuddain effects from any mixture of <hi>Acid, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali,</hi>
Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When theſe in themſelves may be took ſeparate,
yea or conjunct, however we can joyn them again in conſiderable
quantities without any harm. What Hypothetick could ever make
a mixture of <hi>Acid, Alkali,</hi> Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to have the effects of <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
or of a Cathartick Drugg, that I have known work ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
as to bring a Man exceeding weak, by only holding it in
his Mouth a Minute or two, and ſo ſpitting it out. The ſame
may be ſaid of <hi>Specificks,</hi> of which Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> himſelf in a little
fit of conſideration, has own'd, <hi>There are many that are niether</hi>
Alkalies <hi>nor</hi> Acids, <hi>yet ſeldom fail of curing Diſtempers. Should he
deny the Doctrine of Specifiks,</hi> ſays he, <hi>he ſhould deny matter of fact,
which he promiſes never to do, till he is totally deprived of his Reaſon:</hi>
And gives us ſome Inſtances of the Operations of <hi>Specificks,</hi> which
cannot be ſuppoſed to proceed from their being <hi>Acids</hi> or <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</hi>
Another Inſtance wherein theſe Principles will be found
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59081:34"/>
ſhort, is the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Magnetiſm; to name one thing, Take
a Load-ſtone and rub one end of a poiſed Needle on the North
Pole of the Stone, you will find that Point will be attracted to
the ſame Pole when ever it is brought near it: But offer the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end of the Needle to that ſame Pole, it will be driven from
the Stone as much as the other rub'd end is attracted; but force
the end that is driven off, to the North Pole of the Stone, and
keep it there ſome time, it will be attracted as much as it was
driven away before, and the end that was firſt attracted will be
driven away. Now here can be no conceivable alteration of the
proportions of <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alkali,</hi> or any other of your ſuppoſed
Principles in ſo ſhort a time, by the bare contract of the Needle
and Load-ſtone, and this done at pleaſure, without the leaſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of the texture of the Needle or Load-ſtone. Again the
gravity of Gold can no way be accounted for, by ſuppoſing it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
howſoever of your Principles; this Mettal being heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than either of them, more than as twenty to three, ſo far is
it from conſiſting of meet <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Aſs-Ey'd</hi> aſſeydly
aſſerts; The heavieſt <hi>Acid</hi> commonly known being lighter than
this Metal about eighteen times, and <hi>Sulphur</hi> not much heavier.
Now it is impoſſible that two light Bodies ſhould compoſe a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
one. I might recite many other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in Bodies no way
to be accounted for by theſe ſuppoſed Principles; as in Colours in
the Rain-bow, in the priſme and even permanent ones, as in the
foremention'd Metal, which cannot receive its colour from things
which on the account of their lightneſs, can be no Ingredients of
it. I might alſo demand the reaſon of ſounds, their Harmonies
or Diſcords; but I ſhould tempt our Hypothetick Oracles in vain.
But I think I have more reaſon to conclude, that the <hi>Phaenomena</hi>
of Bodily Nature, or the different Ideas we receive from Bodies
depend upon, or reſult from a far greater difference, and variety
of Figures, Sizes, Textures, and Motions of the Particles of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
created at the beginning, of all Sorts and Sizes to us innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
From the Adheſions and Combinations of ſometimes more,
ſometimes fewer of theſe Simple Particles, all the varieties of mix'd
Bodies reſult. Where there are Particles together, whoſe Figures
are more or leſs apt for Motion, there is a Body more or leſs flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id.
Where the Particles hang together, and are more or leſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt
for motion, there is a Body more or leſs ſolid. Where are
fewer of the Simple Particles, there is a Body leſs compounded.
Where there are more ſorts of differing Particles, there the Body
is more compounded. Where there is a congeries of Particles
of one Figure, there is a Simple Body; as probably the Particles
of Air and Water may be, tho they do not touch one another
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59081:34"/>
exactly, or reſt together, and ſo are porous and fluid, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of receiving other Bodies into their Pores. And perhaps ſome
other Bodies, whoſe Particles firmly adhere, and ſo are call'd So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
may alſo conſiſt of ſimilar Particles. This innumerable varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is large enough to make all the moſt odd properties of Bodies.
The Diviſions and Combinations of theſe Simple Particles by Art
(tho' perhaps ſeldom or never divided into ſets Similar or Simple)
is that whereby all the Artificial new reſulting Bodies are made.
But a ſingle Particle, let it be of what Figure or ſize it will, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſuppoſed capable to be divided; becauſe it conſiſts of
pure Matter continuous, and not of Parts meerly contiguous; and
ſo there is no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> or room for any other Body to come in
to divide it, as there is between the contiguous parts of Matter.
And tho' the leaſt Particle in Nature might be ſuppoſed Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically
or Imaginarily diviſible; yet really and Phyſically the
greateſt Particle cannot be ſo thought; tho' ſome inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aſſert a Phyſical infinite Diviſibility. I ſhould her leave your
Principles to their Maſter; with theſe few Conſiderations, but that
poor <hi>Alkali</hi> is ſo abuſed by you, there needs a word or two here
to be ſpoken for him. And I muſt tell you, it is from meer
ſpite and ill-will, and no reaſon, that you ſay, he is the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Death and Corruption, and created ſince the Fall in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to Life. I muſt oppoſe <hi>Moſes</hi> to you, who tells us (and
he had it written by the Finger of God) That, <hi>in ſix days God
made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is,</hi> Exod.

Creature of God) <hi>And God ſaw every thing that he had made, and
behold it was very good,</hi> Gen. 1. 31. <hi>Adam was fleſh and bones,</hi> Gen.
2. 23. made within the Six Days, and had no part of his Body made
ſince; becauſe all things were made within that term, and ſo muſt
have his <hi>Alkali</hi> in him before the Fall, as well as it was in other
things, tho' not as you ſay in every thing elſe, either then, or
now, which you would not have aſſerted had you not had a
<hi>Treacherous Memory:</hi> For you before denied it to be in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible
yellow ſubſtance you love as well as Lemons and
Oranges, which you ſay conſiſts only of <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> tho' it

Cultivation when more uſeful things muſt be planted with labour,
and toyl, and Man turn'd out of Paradice, muſt no longer enjoy
the Fruits of God's immediate planting. But if the Curſe muſt

But however let the Earth be Curſed for thy ſake, be to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,

ſeek not Death in the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror

pleaſure in the Deſtruction of the Living, for he hath created all
things in their being, and the Generations of the World Salutary,
and there is not in them a Medicament of Deſtruction. From the
Fountain of Goodneſs nothing evil can be ſuppos'd to come. But
may be ſome may Laugh and Ridicule me for having recourſe to
Sacred Writ, eſpecially the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which all thoſe
look upon as a kind of <hi>Romance,</hi> who <hi>Suppoſe Dr.</hi> Burnet's <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
true,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> ſees no <hi>reaſon to doubt of.</hi> But for my
part I confeſs, I believe <hi>Moſes</hi> a better Philoſopher, and a Truer
Theoriſt, than either the pretended, or real Author of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59081:35"/>
Hypotheſis. <hi>If</hi> Moſes <hi>underſtood the Myſteries of Nature as
well as any Man, and was guided by an Infallible Spirit,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Acid</hi>
once ſaid, how is it that he can ſee no reaſon to doubt of that
which contradicts him. But Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> can't ſee how a Man can
be in a good ſtate of Health one hour, and the next expiring,
without ſuppoſing a Principle of Death within us. I Anſwer, <hi>his
Memory is treacherous;</hi> one while he ſays, <hi>All Perſons have ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Sickneſs:</hi> Now he talks of Perſons being in a good ſtate of
Health: At another time, <hi>When he conſiders the ſtructure of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
of what multitudes of minute Parts they are compoſed, inſtead
of being ſurprized at our being ſick ſo often, he is almoſt amazed to
think that we are ever well.</hi> So ſay I, Man's Body is a delicate
piece of Mechaniſm, conſiſting of a multitude of ſmall and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Veſſels, bound up in a thin porous Skin, conſiſting moſtly of
ſoft and tender Matter: Man's Mind is a fooliſh and violent
Agent, oft forcing this curious Engine to that it is not ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for; and it is no wonder to ſee a Man now well, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
expiring by the exceſs of Eating and Drinking, of the Paſſions
of the Mind, or other Forces upon Nature, which doubtleſs
would have deſtroy'd even <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, could they have
been, where was no culpable defect in Wiſdom and Goodneſs;
without ſuppoſing a Principle of Death. As Chriſt himſelf in
whom there was no Sin, was found capable of Bodily Miſeries,
and a Violent Death. Swords and Piſtols, and other the inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Man's Cruelty, are not the only things, whereby a Man's
Life may be deſtroy'd in a ſhort time, but the moſt innocent
and wholſome Food abuſed, and taken in exceſs, even Bread,
in which ſome reckon ſo much <hi>Acid,</hi> will ſoon do the buſineſs.
As I once knew a Woman by eating Bread very freely, got ſuch
a Diſtemper, that broke out in large Boils in many parts of her
Body hardly eſcaping with Life. And I think I may affirm, that
where one Perſon dies by the abuſe of the Creature <hi>Alkali,</hi> there
are ten that loſe their Lives by your beloved Principles <hi>Acid</hi> and
<hi>Sulphur,</hi> or Oyl, in the one inſtance of exceſſive, and unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
drinking of Vinous Liquors. And I believe no Man of any
conſiderable Reaſon and Experience, but by Obſervation may
find, that tho' <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alkali</hi> are both good Creatures, ordain'd
for their proper Uſes and Benefits to Man; yet <hi>Acid</hi> things in their
abuſe are more frequently, and ſtrongly penricious to the Vital
Oeconomy.</p>

could ſo ſoon Putrefie; nay, it were impoſſible they ſhou'd. For
<hi>Acids</hi> can't undergo Putrefaction. And the more perfect, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
any Vegitable is, the greater quantity of <hi>Acidum</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi>
it affords, and the leſs of excrementious <hi>Alkali: Alkalies</hi> preſently
cauſe Rottenneſs and Putrefaction in Animal Subſtances, as may
be ſeen in making of Glovers Leather: Mr. <hi>Yardly</hi> a Glover of
<hi>Worceſter,</hi> the moſt Ingenious Man, perhaps, that ever was of his
Trade, he being (which is very ſtrange for a Man of ſo Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
a mean Trade) a curious Phyloſopher; tells me, that in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Leather, they firſt throw their Skins into a Pit fill'd with a
ſtrong <hi>Alkalious lixivium,</hi> which makes them in a manner Rotten:
After they make a ſtrong <hi>Acid</hi> Solution, into which they throw
their almoſt rotten Skins, which again reduces them to their
Texture; nay, makes them firmer than they were at firſt.
From whence it may be naturally inferr'd, that <hi>Alkalies</hi> break
the Texture, and deſtroy the parts of Animal Subſtances, and
moderate <hi>Acids</hi> preſerve them, and reſtore them to their Tone
and Texture, when they are before ſpoiled by <hi>Alkalies.</hi> Nay,
<hi>Alkali</hi> is the onely deſtroyer of all Bodies, and what brings
them to a ſtate of Putrefaction and Corruption. Again, <hi>Acids</hi>
ſuppreſs Fermentation. <hi>Alkalies</hi> excite Fermentation, in fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
Liquors, as is too well known by the Brewers of this
Town. <hi>Alkalies</hi> are the cauſe of all Praeternatural Heats in
the Body. <hi>Acetum</hi> is good in Inflamations, <hi>Eriſypelas,</hi> &amp;c. And
<hi>Acids</hi> are the only things that quench Thirſt. Oyl of <hi>Vitriol</hi> is
one of the beſt Medicines known, in continual Feavers. <hi>Acids</hi>
are the moſt Effectual things in the World to eaſe Pains, and if
Pain be cauſed by <hi>Acids,</hi> it is by giving them in too ſmall
a quantity. <hi>Sal Alkali</hi> is Cauſtick, and burns the Skin. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
given without being diluted with an <hi>Aqueous,</hi> Vehicle
cauſes Vomiting, and depraves the Appetite and deſtroys it,
<hi>Alkalies</hi> conveyed into the Blood, by breaking its <hi>Globules,</hi>
and deſtroying its Texture, cauſe <hi>Scorbutes, Rumatiſmes, Sciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca's,
Conſumpſions, Gouts, Palſies,</hi> or ſome other Chronical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.
An Ingenious Perſon, not long ſince, who had formerly
embraced the Doctrine of <hi>Acids,</hi> was willing to try what Effects
the Transfuſion of <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alkalous</hi> Liquors into the Veins of
a Dog would produce: And the Oyl of <hi>Sulphur</hi> injected into
the Veins of one Dog made him brisk and lively, and hungry,
inſtead of diſordering him, Oyl of <hi>Tartar</hi> on the contrary, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
into another Dog's Veins, made him dull, and in a few
Days he dyed,</p>

               <speaker>Al.</speaker>
               <p>How <hi>Acids</hi> hinder Putrefaction in Animal Subſtances, any
one may ſee by eaſie Experiments; Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> or Spirit of
<hi>Nitre.</hi> pour'd upon the red part of Blood, preſently turns it into
a black Corruption, and the <hi>Serum</hi> into a white purulent Matter:
So Leather, Bladder, Fleſh, Tendons, Skin, have their Texture
deſtroy'd by theſe <hi>Acids,</hi> and are Rotted and turn'd into a puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Matter; yea, the very Bones are diſſolv'd by <hi>Acid</hi> Liquors:
So far are <hi>Acids</hi> from hindering the diſſolution of the Texture of
Animal Subſtances; much leſs will they do the Miracle of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
things already Putrefy'd, from Putrefaction, and ſo, being
ſuch great Medicines. And as inconſiderate, have you ſhewn your
ſelf Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> in aſſerting all Diſeaſes to proceed from ſome ſort
of Putrefaction of the Fluids of our Bodies: For if there be ever
any ſuch thing as Putrefaction in the Juices of the Body, it can't
be reckon'd the Cauſe from whence a Diſeaſe proceeds; but
the Effect or Product of the Diſeaſe: But there are many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
where there has not been one Rational Argument, or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Experiment given to perſwade a Putrefaction of Humours, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
ſo call'd, ſo much as an Effect. The difficulty of conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Dead Bodies impoſſible to be Putrefy'd, if full of <hi>Acids;</hi> is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Mr. <hi>Acid:</hi> Others know very well, that even thoſe Animals
that abound ſo much with <hi>Acid,</hi> that in Diſtillation, they will
yield one half of their weight of a ſtrong <hi>Acid</hi> Liquor, will not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
Putrefie, and that as ſoon, or ſooner, than ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
abounding with <hi>Alkali.</hi> And that a Man's Body may be kept
without Putrifaction, or Stench a Thouſand Years, without the
help of <hi>Acids:</hi> Yea, <hi>Alkalies</hi> themſelves, we know, are great
Preſervatives of Fleſh and Blood, if uſed in due quantity, from
Corruption and Stench: As the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> tells you,
in his Book <hi>Of Humane Blood,</hi> pag. 142. Where twelve Drachms
of Blood, were put up with two Drachms of Spirit of Blood, and
was thereby preſerv'd a Year, of a florid colour, almoſt totally
Fluid, had no ill Scent, or any ſign of Putrefaction, and it
would no doubt, have preſerv'd it much longer. In which Book,
he alſo gives an account, of divers conſiderable good Effects of
the uſe of the Spirit of Humane Blood, as a Medicine, inwardly
and outwardly, in inſtances too long here to be recited; and tells
you, <hi>pag. 206.</hi> That Volatile <hi>Alkalies</hi> in general, had been proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perouſly
uſed in Phyſick in <hi>England,</hi> ſince the Year 1656. about
which time, he had the good Fortune, to contribute ſo to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them, as to bring them by degrees into requeſt, and ſees
ſmall cauſe to doubt, but that they would be more generally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd,
and employ'd. The Judgment of which every way
Learned Perſon, can hardly be oppos'd to a young <hi>Medicaſter,</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:59081:37"/>
without diminiſhing him. The truth of whoſe Narratives, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fact, known to him, are beyond queſtion, to any that
knew him, as I not only well did, but was either an Aſſiſtant, or
Beholder in the making thoſe Experiments, that are the ſubſtance
of that Uſeful Book <hi>of Humane Blood.</hi> To this may be added, the
method of Preſerving Dead Bodies of Dr. <hi>Gabriel Clauder,</hi> recited
in the <hi>Memorials for the Ingenious, Oct. 30. 1882.</hi> Which is with
a <hi>Lixivium</hi> of <hi>Oak</hi> Aſhes, and <hi>Sal armoniack,</hi> in which, both a
fix'd and volatile <hi>Alkali,</hi> are conjoin'd, and found to go beyond
moſt former Methods of Embalming. And tho' <hi>Acid</hi> Salts and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
won't undergo a proper Putrefaction; yet Vegetables, that
yield moſt of <hi>Acid,</hi> and Oyl in Diſtillation, will Rot as ſoon, or
ſooner than ſome others: Yea, Crabbs, Oranges, and Lemons,
every Boy knows, will Rot ſooner than ſome Apples that are not
ſour, and many of thoſe Vegetables that yield moſt <hi>Acid,</hi> by burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will yield the greateſt quantity of fix'd <hi>Alkali;</hi> which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
is as far from being capable of Putrefaction as any <hi>Acid,</hi> or of
Rotting the Coal in which it lies; tho' it has loſt the ſuppos'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<hi>Acid.</hi> But the chief ground of your Belief, that <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>
will preſently Rot and Putrefie Animal Subſtances; I find, is a
ſtory you heard (but could not well remember) from your curious
Philoſopher and Country-Man, Mr. <hi>Yardly</hi> the Glover of <hi>Worceſter,</hi>
who may be a good Glover, for ought I know; but I'm ſure,
you have not learn'd Dreſſing of Leather of him (whether it be
his fault or yours) any better than you did <hi>Pharmacy</hi> of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
the Apothecary. As for Philoſophy, whether the Glover or
you be the Maſter, I know not, but probably he might teach you
the Four Years, you out-did the Apothecary; but I believe you
are both Philoſophers of the ſame Pitch. But as to Leather-Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
the ſtrong <hi>Lixivium</hi> you talk of (to help your Memory) I tell
you is <hi>Lime,</hi> which is not uſed to Rot the Skins, in order to make
them the ſtronger (the Glover knows better) but to get off the
Wool, or Hair. And tho' by letting the Skins lie in the Lime-Pit
too long, they may poſſibly be ſpoiled beyond the recovery of
all the <hi>Acids</hi> in the World; yet we all know, that Lime-Water is
but a mild <hi>Alkali,</hi> and a Medicine of great uſe in Chirurgery, and
is ſo far from having any cauſtick, or violent Effect, on Living Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
that it may be ſafely, and to good purpoſe uſed even in <hi>Oph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalmicks,</hi>
being a mild Remedy not ſo much as making the Eye,
that moſt ſenſible Part, to ſmart; and not only ſo, but may
be uſed to good purpoſe inwardly in ſome Diſtempers, without any
fear of rotting one's Belly, or making Leather of it; tho' you give
an <hi>Acid</hi> afterwards. But what you take for the <hi>Acid</hi> Solution,
I am not certain, whether the infuſion of Bran they uſe, or the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59081:37"/>
                  <hi>Allum</hi>-Water. The firſt we know becomes very ſour, and if the
Skins lie in it too long, will indeed rot and ſpoil them beyond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery;
but the <hi>Allum</hi> is not an <hi>Acid,</hi> as you may find by its turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Syrup of <hi>Violets</hi> Green, which it will ſoon do; nor has it
any of the Effects of an <hi>Acid:</hi> For tho' an <hi>Acid</hi> Spirit may be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd
from it, there's no ſuch heat in Dreſſing of Leather, as can
ſeparate the <hi>Acid</hi> from the Chalkey Subſtance, with which it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſaturated, and made uncapable of having any operation as
an <hi>Acid</hi> upon the Skins. But <hi>Allum</hi> is uſed in making of Leather,
on the account of its Aſtringency to make the Skins more compact,
and the <hi>Acid</hi> before uſed, is waſh'd out, and not left in the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as a Preſervative againſt Corruption, which every Body
may eaſily try, and ſee ſoon brought upon Leather, by even a
mild <hi>Acid;</hi> ſo far is your Inference from being Rational, or grounded
upon Experiment, That <hi>Alkalies</hi> break and deſtroy Animal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances:
But <hi>Acids</hi> do the Miracles of reducing them when rotted
and ſpoil'd, <hi>a priviatione ad habitum,</hi> or from Rottenneſs to Integrity.
And let me ask you here Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> if you are <hi>Mentis compos,</hi> if all <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies</hi>
break the Texture, and deſtroy the Parts of Animal Subſtances;
How does the Bladder, the Veins, the <hi>Veſica Fellis,</hi> &amp;c. hold out
forty, fifty, ſixty, ſeventy Years, againſt this Corrupter in Sickneſs,
and in Health, and come to be found ſtrong, and entire after
Death? And how do the Bones that have no <hi>Acid,</hi> but abound with
<hi>Alkali,</hi> remain ſo firm, and entire; when the Coffins made of Oak,
or the more reſinous Fir with all their <hi>Acids</hi> and Oyl, are rotten
and conſum'd? But what follows, That <hi>Alkali</hi> is the onely De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer
of all Bodies, and that which brings them to a State of
Putrefaction, and Corruption, is ſo Extravagant, one might ſuſpect
you delirious; but I would ask you, if out of your Paroxyſme,
did you ever ſee Gold, Silver, Stones, Sand, to which <hi>Alkali</hi>
is ſtrictly bound in <hi>Glaſs, Mercury,</hi> and a Thouſand other Bodies I
might name, deſtroy'd and brought to a State of Putrefaction by
<hi>Alkalies?</hi> Could you prove your Words, you would perſwade us,
that <hi>Alkali</hi> is the univerſal Diſſolvent, and that Fire deſtroyeth
nothing. Well but another miſchief of <hi>Alkali</hi> is it excites Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in fermentable Liquors: I tell you 'tis well it will do ſo, and
that the Brewers know it; for we ſhould have but bad Drink without
Fermentation: But I know, you are no Maſter-Brewer, any more
than a Maſter in Leather-Dreſſing; if you were, you would know,
you could have no Vinegar without Fermentation, and that no
Liquors can Ferment, but thoſe wherein are Materially both <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li</hi>
and <hi>Acid,</hi> and that all Fermentable Liquors, at length turn <hi>Acid.
Alkalies</hi>
again, ſay you, are the cauſe of all Praeternatural Heats;
I anſwer, not till they meet with <hi>Acids,</hi> which may as well be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59081:38"/>
ſaid, to be the cauſe of the Heat excited between them, as the
<hi>Alkalies.</hi> Vinegar may be good in Inflammations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo may
<hi>Alkalies,</hi> ſay I, which I have uſed with good ſucceſs in the <hi>Eriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelas.</hi>
Neither are <hi>Acids</hi> the only things will quench Thirſt: For
Water is the only thing Nature requires, to allay a Natural
Thirſt, which is nothing but the ſenſe of the <hi>Latex</hi> being deficient;
and Thirſt in Diſeaſes, is ſooner allay'd by <hi>Nitre,</hi> or ſome other
neutral Salts, than by all your <hi>Acids.</hi> Oyl of <hi>Vitriol</hi> may be the
beſt Medicine in continual Feavers, you know, in the World, I
will grant; but I know a better, and it is an <hi>Alkali,</hi> and ſuch an
one, as you ne'er ſaw. As for eaſing Pain by <hi>Acids,</hi> let any one
try on a <hi>Cancer,</hi> or other painful Sore, or on a Wound: You may
try your Tincture, as you call it, but try it on your own Fleſh, and
you will ſoon be convinc'd of the contrary, and the more you uſe
the worſe; unleſs you mortifie the Part, then indeed, the pain is ſo
far over, as the Mortification goes. But as to inward Medicines, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Body knows, a little <hi>Opium,</hi> will do more in eaſing Pain, than
a large quantity of <hi>Acid;</hi> if it were true, That <hi>Acid</hi> would eaſe
Pain, and <hi>Opium</hi> does not eaſe Pain by any Acidity in it, as is eaſily
demonſtrable. But I have found by long Experience, on my ſelf, and
others, That <hi>Alkalies,</hi> in ſome Caſes, are more powerful to eaſe
Pain, than almoſt any thing elſe; as in the Tooth-Ach, which I have
been often troubled with. Strong fix'd <hi>Alkalies,</hi> every Body knows,
apply'd alone to the Skin, are Cauſtick, and ſo are <hi>Acids,</hi> as Oyl of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,</hi>
Butyr of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and the <hi>Lunar</hi> Cauſtick. But no <hi>Alkalies</hi>
are to be taken inwardly without being Diluted with an <hi>Aqueous Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle;</hi>
being too keen for the Parts they are to paſs: So are <hi>Acids,</hi>
which without being given in a <hi>Vehicle</hi> that mitigates them, will
even corrode the Mouth, <hi>Pharynx</hi> and Stomach; and both <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi>
and <hi>Acid,</hi> imoderately and unduely given, will deprave the
Stomach. For I have known thoſe troubled with ſour Stomachs,
yet want an Appetite, as well as a good Digeſtion. That you ſay,
<hi>Alkalies</hi> being convey'd into the Blood, and breaking its <hi>Globules,</hi>
cauſe <hi>Scorbutes, Rheumatiſmes,</hi> &amp;c. is but mere fancy (if it be ſo
much) without ground: For you ne'er ſaw, or heard of any of
thoſe Diſeaſes, caus'd by giving <hi>Alkalies.</hi> As for the injection of
Oyl of <hi>Sulphur</hi> into the Veins of a Dog, making him brisk and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and Oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> into the other Dog's Veins, making him
heavy, and at laſt killing him: You warily conceal who the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Perſon was; but we have the ſame Story in <hi>Etmuller</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<hi>de Chirurgia Infuſoria,</hi> Cap. 10. And he was a more Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious
Perſon, than to embrace the Doctrine of <hi>Acids,</hi> or <hi>Alkalies</hi>
either, or any ſuch little Hypothetick fancy of a <hi>Tyro,</hi> and Dy'd
too long agoe, to be one of your Diſciples; as you would willingly
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59081:38"/>
have us believe, the Ingenious Perſon to be. But he does not
tell you, that he made the Experiment himſelf, but relating the
pernicious Effects of the Infuſion of Spirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> from <hi>Fracaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi>
he ſubjoins that of Oyl of <hi>Sulphur</hi> not killing, but ſeeming to
make the Dog hungry. And this Relation, ſays he, may ſeem
ſtrange, to him that conſiders the great affinity of Oyl of <hi>Sulphur</hi>
and Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> that they ſhould produce ſuch different Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects:
But being animated, and aſſiſted by a certain Friend, I made
the Experiment, and injected <hi>
                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j.</hi> of Oyl of <hi>Sulphur per Camp.</hi> in <hi>℥j.</hi>
of Water, and having made a convenient <hi>Ligature,</hi> let the Dog
looſe; from whence he ſoon began to have a ſhort Breath, and to
be troubled with <hi>Convulſions,</hi> eſpecially of his Mouth, with a great
deal of Froth, which continu'd till he was as it were ſtrangl'd,
and ſo Dy'd in half an Hour's time, a great deal of thin red Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
flowing out of his Mouth, when he was Dead, with a great
deal of Froth ſwimming upon it. He gives a particular Account of
what various Diſorders were found in Diſſecting him, too long here
to Relate; but he concludes thus, It ſeems that the Blood by the
injection of the <hi>Acid</hi> of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> being made thick, unfit for Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
ſtagnated in the Lungs, and there by the Motion of the
Air was turn'd into Froth, and Red <hi>Serum,</hi> and being driven on
into the ſmaller Arteries, and thence into the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> nothing
could Circulate through the Lungs; from whence the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and
greater Branches of the Arteries were found empty. So far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
is the Account of this Experiment he made himſelf, from
what he had, as a Relation, which we may therefore queſtion.
But as for Oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> whereby another Dog was Kill'd, not
mentioning the quantity injected; he tells us, the Blood was
made very Red, and more Fluid, than uſual: From whence
ſaies he, it appears, that too much coagu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ation of the Blood, like
as too much Diſſolution of it, does Kill. He alſo gives an Account of
the Injection of <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> and Sp. of <hi>Nitre;</hi> both which ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Kill, Coagulating the Blood: And from all which, every Man
that can reaſon, may certainly conclude, that the thinning of the
Blood by <hi>Alkalies</hi> can't be the Cauſe of of all Diſeaſes. And
you Mr. <hi>Alkali,</hi> as ſharp as you would ſeem, I believe, will find
it yet more difficult ſtill, to make your fancy of <hi>Alkali's</hi> being
the Cauſe of all Diſeaſes, appear but a little likely; if you come
in particular to conſider, ſome of the Maladies, common to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature: For which I will prick up my Ears.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ac.</speaker>
               <p>The firſt thing I begin with, is the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> that fatal
Diſtemper to Three Kingdoms, and even to all <hi>Europe</hi> in that by
the means of it, God was pleaſed to deprive us of a Princeſs whoſe
worth was ſuch, as a ſufficient value can never be ſet upon it, or Loſs
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59081:39"/>
ſufficiently Lamented. 'Tis the common Practice of Nurſes, and
the generality of Practitioners, as ſoon as they perceive the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
of this Diſtemper, to give <hi>Gaſcoin's,</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Kent</hi>'s <hi>Lapis
de Goa,</hi> or ſome other Teſtaceous Powders, known <hi>Alkalies:</hi> The
one Party to drive the malignity from the Heart, in which it's
impoſſible for any malignity to lodg, more than in any other Part,
by reaſon the Blood moves at leaſt tentimes faſter through the Heart,
than any other Part, the Lungs excepted: For the Cavities being
large no Stagnation is to be feared; but if any where, it is in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
Parts, where the Blood moves ſlowly. The ſecond ſort, give
them to correct the Acidity, they ſuppoſe to be in the Blood. Now
I could never hear of any one, that by Analizeing the Blood in
the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> could find the leaſt footſteps of <hi>Acidity</hi> (as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hinted) but on the contrary, it appears after many tryals,
That the Blood of ſuch Perſons, does more abound with <hi>Alkalous</hi>
Particles than that of ſound People: So in this Caſe, the giving of
<hi>Alkalies</hi> muſt be ſuperfluous, if not highly pernicious. The
Cauſes of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> with moſt other Feavers, and acute
Diſeaſes, I ſuppoſe to be from a quantity of ſuch Particles, being
ſome way or other admitted into the Blood, which being Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous,
or of a quite different Texture from that of the Blood,
and ſo not capable of being mixed with it, cauſes a hurry and
diſorder. Now a <hi>Feaver</hi> always preceeds the eruption of the
Puſtles, and when the Heterogeneous Particles are thrown out to
the ſurface, then the <hi>Feaver</hi> ceaſes. Now to aſſiſt Nature in
throwing out theſe Heterogeneous Particles, which they pretend,
are hindred by <hi>Acids</hi> in the Blood, they give Teſtaceous Powders,
and other <hi>Diaphoreticks,</hi> which ſeldom fail of their intention, of
throwing out large quantities of Puſtles, more than Nature is able
to bring to maturity, and if ſhedoes chance to Cope with them, is
the only occaſion of ſpoiling ſo many Angelick Faces, we every
Day obſerve. But that is not all, but by <hi>Alkalies</hi> the <hi>Globules</hi> of
the Blood are broken; when as the Excrementitious <hi>Serum</hi> only,
ought to be ſeparated, according to the Rules of Nature, and not
the leaſt Drop of Blood, when in its Natural State, and its <hi>Globules</hi>
unbroken. But by the means of <hi>Alkalies</hi> the Globules being
broken, are made capable of being receiv'd into the cutaneous
Glands, which is the occaſion of the purple Spots in the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi>
and <hi>Feavers,</hi> which ne'er fail of being the certain Prognoſticators
of Death. But this is not all, thoſe broken <hi>Globules</hi> getting into
the <hi>Maeanders</hi> of the Brain, hinder the motion of the Animal Spirits
through the Nerves, and cauſe <hi>Deliriums,</hi> and all thoſe fatal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
of the Brain too frequently ſeen: Likewiſe the Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
capable of being contained in its proper Channel, is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of violent Bleedings, bloody-Urine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> None of the beſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59081:39"/>
Symptoms. Beſides, by their <hi>Diaphoretick</hi> quality they waſte the
<hi>Serum</hi> that there is not ſufficient left to ſupply and bring to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
the Puſtles, thoſe Medicines alone had thrown out: So about
the <hi>9th. 11th.</hi> or <hi>13th.</hi> Day, the Puſtles fall, and the <hi>Acrid</hi> Matter
being abſorb'd into the Veins, Cauſes <hi>Secondary Feavers,</hi> of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Conſequence: The <hi>Small Pox</hi> requires the giving as few Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
as any Diſeaſe whatſoever, unleſs in extraordinary Caſes:
Yet the Eye of a careful Phyſician, is as convenient as in any. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
I have heard ſome complain, ſuch a Doctor had ſo many
Fees, and yet never Wrot a Bill: But let me tell them, in many Caſes,
eſpecially in this, the Phyſician deſerves his Fees better for not
Writting at all, than for ſo doing. In this Diſtemper, <hi>Acids</hi> are the
things skilfully and timely given, which I have ſeen not only by
my own, but other Great Men's Practice, to be the onely ſafe,
effectual, and never erring Medicines. And why ſhould we fly to
<hi>Acids</hi> Chymically prepar'd, when Nature has provided Oranges and
Lemons, Citrons and Limes, which anſwer our intentions? For in
Five Hundred, at leaſt Patients I have had, of all Qualities to do
with in this Diſtemper, where I have been call'd in the beginning,
I don't know, that I have had one that has Dy'd, or been Disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur'd:
Nay, ſome that have been brought into ill Cirumſtances
by <hi>Alkalies,</hi> I have retriev'd from the Jaws of Death by proper
<hi>Acids.</hi> To allay the hurry of the Blood, and to confirm its Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I give Juice of Oranges, Lemons, Limes in Barley-water, or
Small-Beer, acidulated with Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> Vinegar, or Verjuice
Poſſet-Drink: If the Brain be diſturb'd, and the Patient Delirious,
I find it abſolutely neceſſary, to let Blood in good quantities, and
uſe more powerful <hi>Acids,</hi> which ſets all to rights. So the method
I take in the Cure of this Diſeaſe, being according to Nature's
Dictates, is ſhort and eaſie: It being in the Cure of this Diſeaſe,
as in the accounting for the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature; they that go
upon feweſt Principles, generally Diſcover moſt of her Secrets,
and can give the beſt Account of them.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Small Pox</hi> has been Fatal to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Princes, more than
once; tho' not ſo much in it ſelf, as through the ill Practice of
Ignorant, or worſe Phyſicians: But that God ſhou'd be pleas'd
with any Evil, be the Cauſe, or Sender of Diſeaſes, or the Taker
away of any ſuch Good, whereby Obedience to his Laws, might
be promoted; I think, cannot be believ'd, but by inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Sinners, looking on God, as if he were like themſelves. If I
did believe, that the Sickneſs of him that is Sick, and the Death
of him that Dies, were the poſitive Will of God, I think, I ſhou'd
be wicked, as well as fooliſh, in endeavouring to Heal. But it's
common with Phyſicians, when through their Ignorance, Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59081:40"/>
or other fault the Patient Dies, injuriouſly to ſay, God
took them away, and dareingly to lay their own faults upon their
Maker. As for Nurſes giving Teſtaceous Powders to drive Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
from the Heart, I have nothing to ſay, towards their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:
'Tis Phyſicians buſineſs to look to them, that they
onely obey their Directions, and do their proper Office: Nurſes
know not what Malignity is, and you need not prove to them,
that there can't be Malignity in the Heart, any more than any where
elſe, or ſo likely, as in the Extremities. But the Reaſon you give,
tho' it might ſerve Nurſes (who may believe any thing) if you
offer it to Phyſicians, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Blood moves ten times faſter
through the Heart, than any other Part (but the Lungs) ſhews
your great Ignorance and inconſiderateneſs. If you but count
the Pulſes of your Heart and Wriſt, you will ſoon find your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake:
And if the Blood ſhou'd move faſter through the Heart
(as you fancy) than through other Parts, it Circulation could not
continue, the Fountain being empty'd faſter, than again ſupply'd.
As for the uſe of thoſe Powders, you call Teſtaceous, by Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
whom you honourably place, Second to Nurſes, and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
Third to your ſelf, I think, none of them ſo fooliſh, as to
give them to correct <hi>Acidity</hi> in the Blood, any otherwiſe, than by
<hi>Abſorbing</hi> it in the Stomach. [And Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> himſelf once told
us, <hi>That none pretend Crab's-Eyes, Pearl, Corral,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to be uſeful
any farther, than to abſorb</hi> Acids <hi>in the Stomach,</hi> where we know,
and you grant, it is ſometimes too much,] and ſo hindring a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of <hi>Acid</hi> in the Veins: Where tho' you could never find any,
I have told you the Reaſon before, and how it's Demonſtrated,
that there is an <hi>Acid</hi> in the Blood. I have alſo anſwer'd already,
your Aſſertion that the Blood of Perſons in the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> abounds
more with <hi>Alkali,</hi> than the Blood of Sound Perſons: To which,
I farther add, this Obſervation, That I have ſeen the Sweat and
<hi>Serum</hi> of a ſound Perſon, turn Syrup of <hi>Violets</hi> Green readily;
when the very <hi>Ichor</hi> and Corruption in the Puſtles of the <hi>Small
Pox,</hi> would hardly diſcolour it: On which account it appears,
there was not ſo much <hi>Alkali,</hi> or ſo little <hi>Acid,</hi> as in the Sound
Perſons. And contrary to your Accuſation of <hi>Alkalies,</hi> as pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
I ſay, I have never found the giving of <hi>Alkalies</hi> in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
in the leaſt hurtful, but very beneficial, if duly given;
and I have uſed <hi>Alkalies</hi> here, more than any other Medicines,
and never had one Patient Dye, or Deform'd, in two Seven Years
Practice. But if the Cauſe of this Diſeaſe, and of moſt <hi>Feavers,</hi>
as you affirm, be from Particles admitted into the Blood, which
are of ſo Heterogeneous, or different a Texture from that of the
Blood, as that they are not capable of mixing with it; then it will
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59081:40"/>
certainly follow, that theſe <hi>Morbifick</hi> Particles in thoſe Diſeaſes,
are not <hi>Alkalies; Alkealies</hi> being Homogeneal to, mixable with,
and requiſite in making up the Natural and ſound Texture of the
Blood: There being no Blood from whence they may not be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in great quantity, and the <hi>Globules,</hi> or Red part of the Blood
yields a greater proportion of <hi>Alkali,</hi> than the <hi>Serum.</hi> And thus
you have unwarily thrown down, what you had Built before.
But here is another Cramper, <hi>viz.</hi> How any Particles that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of being mix'd with the Blood, ſhou'd (as you ſay) be
admitted into it, and flow with it: None but your ſharp ſight can
ſee this. As for the hurry of the Blood, or <hi>Feaver,</hi> Caus'd as
you ſay. by thoſe unmixable Particles, being mix'd with it. I ſay,
firſt it's certain. That Blood naturally contains, or yields abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more <hi>Alkali</hi> than <hi>Acid:</hi> Now the <hi>Alkali</hi> alone cannot be put
into a hurry, or fermentative Motion, and ſo grow too Hot, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will the ſmslleſt quantity of <hi>Acid,</hi> cauſe it ſo to do; but more
<hi>Acid</hi> added may produce a greater Heat; as any Body may ſee, by
mixing <hi>Acids</hi> and <hi>Alkalies.</hi> Now theſe <hi>Acids</hi> (which probably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
are a tenth to the <hi>Alkali)</hi> being ſubdued, and having loſt their
Force by being coagulated with the <hi>Alkali,</hi> ſtick in the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
here and there, and cauſe little Inflammations, and at length
Suppurate, which when they are once thus fix'd, the <hi>Feaver</hi>
ceaſes. Now to aſſiſt Nature in Precipitateing, and ſubduing
theſe <hi>Acids,</hi> rather than ſome unknown, unmixable Particles; the
moſt Rational, and Experienced Phyſicians have given Teſtaceous
Powders, and other <hi>Abſorbents</hi> to hinder <hi>a</hi> ſupply of them from the
Stomach, the chief <hi>Officine</hi> of Praeternatural <hi>Acids,</hi> and alſo vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
penetrating, and <hi>Diaphoretick Alkalies</hi> to help to ſubdue them
already too abundant in the Blood. Which things, as you (ſhall I
ſay ingenuouſly or unwillingly) confeſs ſeldom fail of their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of throwing out plentifully the <hi>Morbifick</hi> Matter which
Nature is more able to bear, and bring to maturity in Puſtles in the
Skin than to Cope with in the Blood, there detain'd through the
weakneſs of Nature wanting help, or by <hi>Acids</hi> given hindering
the Eruption. And tho' in groſs Bodies (which you your ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckon
have always more <hi>Acid,</hi> having more Fat) the large quantity
thrown out to the Skin, oft ſpoils thoſe Angelick Faces, you ſeem ſo
tender of, to get the Ladies Favor; yet the not coming forth of this
<hi>Morbifick</hi> Matter, often makes a greator ſpoil of the whole Bodies
of thoſe Angels, laying their Beauty in the Duſt. But as few Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
chuſe rather to Die with a ſmooth Face, than Live with a
rough one; ſo it's the Phyſician's part, rather to take care of Life,
than Beauty: And it had been well it had been ſo in the Caſe of
that Princeſs, whoſe inward Form, tranſcended that of her Face;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59081:41"/>
whoſe fair Soul, wou'd have been Conſpicuous thro' a rougher
Skin, and no leſs uſeful; had not her Life been thrown out, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of the <hi>Morbifick</hi> matter. As for the breaking of the <hi>Globules</hi> of
the Blood you talk ſo much of; it is mere fancy, grounded upon no
Experiment. The attenuation of the Blood made by <hi>Alkalies,</hi> as
alſo by the working of the Lungs, is not to be thought a breaking
of the <hi>Globules;</hi> but rather a ſeparation of them from adhering
together, whereby they are more equally mix'd with the <hi>Serum:</hi>
Thence alſo the Blood becomes more florid, the ſurfaces of thoſe
little round Bodies, when more disjoin'd, being capable of reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more Light. Nor is the Extravaſation of the Blood, at any
time, to be attributed to the breaking of the <hi>Globules,</hi> and making
them ſmall enough to paſs out of the Veſſels, which at the ſame
time ſufficiently contain the <hi>Serum,</hi> whoſe Particles are perhaps a
Thouſand times ſmaller than the <hi>Globules,</hi> tho' you ſhou'd ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
every one broken into Twenty pieces: But rather from ſome
breach of the ſmall Veſſels, from ſome Corroſion, or other vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
either from without, or from the rapid Motion of the Blood.
Neither is the ſtoppage of the Animal Spirits, from what cauſe
ſoever, to be thought to produce Deliriums, and ſuch like Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes:
But on the contrary, their over ſwift Motion from too great
Heat. The ſtoppage of the Nerves, if there be any ſuch thing
is more like to cauſe <hi>Palſies, Lethargies, Apoplexies,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Serum</hi>
is not waſted too much by <hi>Alkalies,</hi> or other <hi>Diaphoreticks,</hi> if given
with Diſcretion; and ſo adminiſter'd, they prevent the falling of the
Puſtles, and return of the <hi>Morbifick</hi> Matter. As to the few Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
you ſay, the <hi>Small Pox</hi> requires, I readily agree that it
requires fewer than are commonly given, and ſo do all other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes:
For the giving of many Medicines, as is the Cuſtom of
Preſcribers, is a Practice wherein the Phyſician will for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
uncertain, whether he do good, or none, or harm, and by
what: The Judgment, and Care of a Phyſician in this Diſeaſe, I
agree, is alſo neceſſary, and the Patient had better hire ſome
Practitioners, eſpecially ſowr Doctors, to do nothing, than to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
and hinder Nature in throwing on the <hi>Morbifick</hi> matter, by
large and improper Preſcriptions. As for <hi>Acids</hi> being the onely
ſafe, effectual, and never failing Medicines, as you ſay, you have
ſeen by your own, and other Great Men's Practice: I muſt tell
you, tho' you reckon your ſelf among Great Men, That many Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
Greater in all commendable Greatneſs, than you, or any other
of your great Crabb-Tree-Heads, have had better ſucceſs in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Opinion and Practice. I my ſelf can aſſure you, that <hi>Alkalies</hi>
are Medicines, in this diſtemper a Judicious Phyſician can hardly
want. For as the Ebullition, and Expulſion are not to be too much
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59081:41"/>
promoted, or haſtily carryed on; ſo when they are too ſlow, they
ought to be excited, and haſtened, which may well be done
by volatile <hi>Alkalous</hi> Medicines. A Judicious Phyſician will not
give <hi>Alkalies,</hi> or <hi>Acids</hi> he knows not why, only becauſe they are
<hi>Alkalies,</hi> or <hi>Acids,</hi> or follow always one Intention, the retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the motion of Nature, or allaying the hurry, as you do
Great Sir, with your Oranges and Lemons, Crabbs and Limes,
which tho' they ate milder, than ſome Chymical <hi>Acids;</hi> yet a
drop or two of Oyl of <hi>Vitriol</hi> in an <hi>Aqueous</hi> Vehicle may be a
milder <hi>Acid</hi> than the Juice of Oranges or Lemons taken alone.
As for your boaſt, that in Five hundred Patients in this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of all Qualities, <hi>viz.</hi> Emperours, Kings, Dukes, Earls, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Tinkers, Coblers, and their Conſorts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to whom you
have ſold your Lemons, and Oranges, not one died, or was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured;
you may as well be believed as the Quack, who ſaid in
his Bills, amongſt other Brags, that he had been Counſellor to
the Counſellors of Twenty Chriſtian Kings: When there are not
ſo many in the World. Nor have you ever had a quarter ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Patients ſick of this Diſtemper. And you might have told us
of retrieving from the Belly of Death, as well as from the Jaws
thereof, ſince <hi>you believe People expect you ſhould make them Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</hi>
But truly it's unlikely you ſhou'd do ſuch Miracles, eſpecially
in this Diſeaſe, when you endeavour nothing but to hinder the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Nature, or to allay the hurry, as you call it, which truly is
not a method according to Natures Dictate's: Short it is indeed,
and may be a ſhort way to the Grave, and eaſie it is, for the
Doctor to give always the ſame things; but often very uneaſie for
the Patient. But if thoſe that go upon the feweſt Principles in
diſcovering Nature's <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> diſcover moſt of her Secrets, and
can give the beſt Account of them, as you ſay, then thoſe that
have but two Principles, as Figure and Motion, <hi>Alkali</hi> and <hi>Acid,
Acid</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> are like to outgo you Sir, for you creep upon
Five Legs. As for your abſolute neceſſity of Letting Blood in
good quantities, where the Patient is Delirious, and the Brain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed,
it's abſolutely Dangerous, and were well let alone for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Sedatives, for it oft proves pernicious in this Diſtemper: As
in the Caſe of the beſt Princeſs <hi>England</hi> ever had: Neither <hi>Alkali,</hi>
nor <hi>Acid,</hi> was ſo effectual towards terminating the Diſeaſe, as the
Officious Lance, weakning, and diſturbing the Motion of Nature.
But methinks we have been long on this Diſeaſe, What ſhall we
have next.</p>

               <speaker>Ac.</speaker>
               <p>I come to the <hi>Scurvey,</hi> where I expect the cry of all Mankind
will be againſt me, what ſay they, is there no <hi>Acidity</hi> in the Blood,
the occaſion of thoſe breakings out of Scabs, Pimples, Botches,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59081:42"/>
and of wandring Pains? Have Patience, and I will make it appear
thoſe Symptoms come from <hi>Lixivious Alkalous</hi> Particles, and Firſt, it
appears, That the Blood of <hi>Scorbutick</hi> Perſons, has more volatile <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali,</hi>
than that of Sound Perſons, beſides, a quantity of <hi>lixivious</hi>
fix'd <hi>Alkali,</hi> which I could never find in Sound Perſon's Blood.
Another Argument is, that I have been told that Seamen having
had the <hi>Scurvey</hi> in long <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Voyages, Landing at <hi>Cadis,</hi> have
by Eating of Lemons and Oranges, been ſoon perfectly Cured:
But in theſe Cold Countries, we are forced ſometimes to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to more powerful <hi>Acids:</hi> Some object that more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
ſaltneſs is found in the Blood of <hi>Scorbuticks,</hi> which they take
to be an <hi>Acidity,</hi> but inſtead of <hi>Acidity,</hi> if they will enquire, they
will find it to be a <hi>Lixivious Alkalous</hi> one. And here I ſhall inſert
a Preparation of <hi>Antimony,</hi> I have found of extrrordinary uſe in
inveterate <hi>Scurveys. Take White Fowers of Antimony ℥viij. vol. ſp. of
Tartar <abbr>lb</abbr>ij. digeſt 14 Days, decant it, then Diſtill off half the Liquor,
and keep the remains for uſe.</hi> The Spirit of <hi>Tartar</hi> is made thus,
<hi>Ren: Tartar <abbr>lb</abbr>xx. Diſtill it in an Iron-Pot with a Moor's-Head, with a
large Worm fitted to a Tub of Water: Diſtill by degrees as long as any
thing will come over, take out the Caput Mort. Calcine it to Greyneſs,
put <abbr>lb</abbr>iij. of it into a Cucurbit, pour on it the Spirit freed from the
Oyl, draw off half, with a moderate Fire, pour out the remains as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs:
put <abbr>lb</abbr>ij. more of the Caput Mort. on which pour the Spirit drawn
off, and with a gentle Fire draw off half, which keep for uſe.</hi> It is a
Noble volatile Spirit, and as Noble a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> as I have met with.
Of the Tincture, I give Four, Six, Eight, or Ten Drops, Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Evening, in a ſtrong Decoction, or infuſion of <hi>Juniper.</hi>
Berries half a Pint. This anſwers every thing ſaid of a true
<hi>Panacaea.</hi>

               <p>If the cry of all Mankind be againſt your Opinion of the
<hi>Scurvey,</hi> it is no good ſign you are in the right; for we know
your capacity too well, to believe you wiſer than all Men. And
you have never yet made it appear, that the Blood of any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed
Perſons abounds with <hi>Alkalies,</hi> more than that of the ſound
People. You have not made ſufficient tryals, nor been aware
of the difficulties of finding the true Quantities of the Products
of Blood, nor have you demonſtrated, That there is any thing
Lexivious in the Blood of Scorbuticks. A <hi>Salſum</hi> more or leſs
may be found in the Blood of both ſick and healthy Perſons,
and probably more in the Blood of thoſe that have the <hi>Scurvey;</hi>
which poſſibly a Man of haſty concluſions (as Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> ſo oft
ſhews himſelf to be) may take it for an <hi>Alkali;</hi> becauſe it will
turn Syrup of <hi>Violets</hi> green, as common Salt, and ſome other
<hi>Salſums</hi> will do, and for a Lixivious, or fixed one; becauſe it
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59081:42"/>
does not riſe eaſily in the Fire. But if you knew how to work,
you would find an <hi>Acid</hi> Spirit come from it in Diſtillation, as
from ſome other things you take to be <hi>Alkalies.</hi> But a Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Salt, as you have acknowledged, is the Product of Fire,
and the Fire in the Blood is nothing but a hot fancy, that
makes no aſhes. But you muſt make uſe of another Fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you can get any fixed Salt, or Volatile either out of the
Blood. But if you could produce ſuch a reſulting body as
a fixed <hi>Alkali,</hi> by burning the Blood, or other parts of a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick,
or other Diſeaſed Perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it would not prove, That an
<hi>Acid,</hi> was not actually therein before, or that this <hi>Alkali</hi> was:
For I have never found a Lixivious Salt, ſo ſtrong and copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in any Animal Subſtance, as where there was a manifeſt
and plentiful <hi>Acid;</hi> nor will any other Subſtance as far as I
have obſerved, yield ſo much fixed <hi>Alkali</hi> in burning, as
thoſe that otherwiſe, give moſt <hi>Acid</hi> and Oyl. As for your
Scorbutick Seamen cured at <hi>Cadis</hi> (if the Story be true) it
may be more rationally thought they were recoverd by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Freſh Meat, and drinking Generous Wine, than by
Oranges and Lemons, unleſs they had been the only things
they fed upon. Your preparation of <hi>Antimony,</hi> you ſay, you
have found of ſuch extraordinary uſe in inveterate <hi>Scurveys,</hi>
ſhews your Ignorance in Chymiſtry, and argues againſt you,
doing all that a true <hi>Panacaea</hi> can be ſaid to do, if any one can be
ſo all-believing as to credit you, when <hi>no one Acid</hi> (as you have
ſometime ſaid) will do ſo: <hi>For what</hi> Acid <hi>will cure an acute Diſeaſe,
will not Cure a Chronick; Volatile</hi> Acids <hi>being moſt effectual in Acute
Diſeaſes, fixed ones in Chronick,</hi> [to which I muſt tell you by the by,
that you never ſaw a fixed <hi>Acid</hi> in your life] but your <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caea</hi>
does all things, and yet if made according to your Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is no <hi>Acid:</hi> For tho' the <hi>Tartar</hi> by Diſtillation yeilds an
<hi>Acid</hi> Liquor, yet the pouring it on the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling
off but half twice the fixed <hi>Alkali</hi> retains the <hi>Acid,</hi> and
ſends up only a Phlegmatick Liquor, which is a very poor
<hi>Menſiruum;</hi> the greateſt Vertue remaining behind, tho' Mr.
<hi>Chymiſt</hi> throws it away as uſeleſs: But as your Liquor may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſome Particles of the Flowers of <hi>Antimony</hi> when digeſted
together, ſo as it is Vomitive, it may do ſomething on
that account, but not as an <hi>Acid;</hi> the Vomitive qualitiy of
<hi>Antimony</hi> depending on ſomething elſe; but giving it with
half a Pint of the Decoction, or infuſion of <hi>Juniper-Berries,</hi>
ſpoils the credit of the other things; the <hi>Juniper-Berries</hi> juſtly
claiming the greateſt ſhare in the Cure, if it do one. But
what ſhall we have next? What ſay you to the <hi>Gout?</hi>

               <p>It has been conſtantly handed down from Generation to
Generation, that the <hi>Gout</hi> is a Diſtemper not to be cured, and in
ſpight of the noiſe the laſt Age has made of Experimental Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
no Man ever went out of the common Road, to try
whether that were true or falſe: But now it do's evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear that the <hi>Gout</hi> is not ſuch a Fury, but that it may
with eaſe be overcome by proper and powerful <hi>Acids.</hi> Now
if my Predeceſſors have been ſo notoriouſly Ignorant, as to the
Cauſe and Cure of common Diſtempers, it is not unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to believe they have been ſo in others: Nay, they have
been ſo. And the reaſon why People have hitherto in vain
attempted the Cure of the <hi>Gout,</hi> has been from their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
againſt <hi>Acids,</hi> which only can do ſervice. What would not
People give to ſave their Lives, and be free from pain? Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians
as the caſe ſtands can do neither with any certainty;
but by making multitudes of Experiments upon the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I can lay down, the caſe may be altered. If People were
once ſatisfied, That the abounding of <hi>Alkalies</hi> is the cauſe of
the <hi>Gout,</hi> it follows that <hi>Acids</hi> are the only proper things to
correct it. That the <hi>Gout</hi> is cauſed by <hi>Alkalies,</hi> may appear
from the Chalky ſubſtance generated in the extreme Parts,
which is generated in the time of the Fit only, and is a Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Homogeneal Particles, Particles of one determinate Figure,
by reaſon the Fire won't totally deſtroy its texture; which
were it a Body compos'd of Particles of different Sizes and
Figures (which are what we Chymiſts call Heterogeneous ones)
the Fire would deſtroy it. And that they are <hi>Alkalous,</hi> none I
ſuppoſe will diſpute, they anſwering all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that
moſt known <hi>Alkalies</hi> will do, <hi>viz.</hi> cauſe an Ebullition with
<hi>Acids,</hi> and when calcin'd turn Syrup of <hi>Violets</hi> green, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
(tho' not always) will do it without. I take notice few
People are troubled with the <hi>Gout,</hi> but thoſe who drink much
Wine, or other generous Liquors, abounding with Vinous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:
Theſe Spirits meeting with Volatile <hi>Alkalous</hi> Salts, by
means of the Salt the Vinous Spirit is coagulated into what <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
calls <hi>Offa Alba,</hi> which not being capable of moving through
the ſmall Veſſels, cauſes Obſtructions and Pains, and by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Terreſtrious Particles, is turned into the Chalky Subſtance,
I cannot agree with thoſe Gentlemen, who aſſert all Pain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from a Solution of Continuity. I don't argue, that there
is no Pain prooceeds from a Solution of Unity, but there are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Pains where the Union is entire, as in a blow with a blunt
thing. But I lay it down as a poſitive Aſſertion, that all Pain
is cauſed by a Stagnation of Juices, cauſing a Compreſſion of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59081:43"/>
                  <hi>Membranes:</hi> But as the Stagnation is greater or leſſer, and as the
Stagnating Matter is more or leſs <hi>Acrimonious,</hi> ſo is the Pain great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or leſs, but there is no Pain in any part without Stagnation.
People have more reaſon to believe there is a Solution of Unity
in the <hi>Palſie,</hi> where there is a viſible Conſumption, tho' there,
they are altogether void of Senſation. The Medicines I uſe are
few, and moſtly well-known, but never uſed in the manner I
have done: The general Baſis of them is the ſame, they being
all <hi>Acids;</hi> and my Medicines will put no force upon Nature, have
no hazard, but ſtrengthen all the Parts. I have given as clear

which has hitherto been vainly attempted, but my method will
as certainly Cure the <hi>Gout,</hi> as the <hi>Cortex, Agues,</hi> or <hi>Opium</hi> make

               <p>I cannot forbear to tell you Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> there has not been
a more Ignorant Calumniator of all Phyſicians, or Confident Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
of one little Quack, than You; perpetually ſhewing us, that
you have neither Read others, nor known your ſelf. All the
Phyſicians of the World, from generation to generation, have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
the <hi>Gout</hi> incurable, and tho' the laſt Age hath made a noiſe
of Experimental Philoſophy; yet to ſpight them, no Man would
go out of the common Road, to try whether that were true, or
falſe. <hi>Till Colbatch roſe,</hi> who hath made it appear, that the <hi>Gout</hi>
is not ſuch a Fury, but it may be overcome by powerful <hi>Acids.
Colbach</hi>'s Predeceſſors have been notoriouſly Ignorant of the Cauſe
and Cure of common Diſeaſes; much more of the <hi>Gout,</hi> or elſe
<hi>Colbatch</hi> has been notoriouſly ignorant and abuſive of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.
For every Body acquainted with Authors, knows there's
not one of any Note, but has Writ more Learnedly and Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
of this, and other Diſeaſes; and whoſe Obſervations of
Cure, are abundantly more Credible than Mr. <hi>Acid</hi>'s, whom we
can prove a Lyar, by his own Words. <hi>For he</hi> has acknowledg'd
his Maſter <hi>Helmont to deſerve better, of the World, and to be a
greater Man than himſelf.</hi> Yet he among the reſt, his Scholar
<hi>John</hi> ſaith, hath affirm'd the <hi>Gout</hi> incurable, and been ignorant
of the Cauſe and Cure of common Diſeaſes. But <hi>Helmont</hi> hath
aſſerted the <hi>Gout</hi> Curable, and profeſſeth himſelf Maſter of a
Medicine, <hi>viz. Arcanum Coralinum of Paracelſus,</hi> which radically
Cures that <hi>Gout,</hi> and many other Diſeaſes, and it is not an <hi>Acid</hi>
neither, being a fixed Medicine. And <hi>Paracelſus</hi> before him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

as <hi>Helmont,</hi> that had no prejudice againſt either <hi>Acids</hi> or <hi>Alkalies.</hi>
That nothing but <hi>Acids</hi> can do any ſervice in the <hi>Gout,</hi> is an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

<hi>Colbatch</hi>'s Foundation, which may be long a doing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Sirs, if you are Wiſe, come to their Maſter himſelf, he can
do both, if you can believe him, and be ſure to pay him well for
his Lilly, White Vinegar. it may be a great while e'er many of
the People call'd Phyſitians come to be ſatisfied, that the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Alkalies</hi> is the cauſe of the <hi>Gout;</hi> but if they were, it will
not follow on your Hypotheſis, that <hi>Acids</hi> are the onely proper
Correctors of it. We will ſuppoſe, that in the <hi>Gout,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Diſeaſe, there is too much <hi>Alkali</hi> in the Blood: What is to be
done? Why, it ought to be carry'd off by the <hi>Emunctories,</hi> ſay you.
By what means? By <hi>Acids</hi> ſay you. How can <hi>Acids</hi> do it? Why,
they are contrary to <hi>Alkalies,</hi> ſay you, and fight them where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they meet, conquer them, and make them quit the Field.
No ſay I, 'tis a miſtake, they are not contraries, or Enemies, but as
good Friends as any old Sweet-hearts, ſeparated againſt their wills.
They rejoice when they meet fall a Dancing till they are hot again,
&amp; when tired they lie down together in mutual and cloſe embraces,
and are ſo wedded by the Law of Nature, that they will not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorc'd,
unleſs one of them can be tempted to Adultrey; then indeed
the other does not beat, but leave its Companion with diſdain.
Your Maſter <hi>Helmont</hi> tells you. There are no contraries in Nature
(he means Bodily Nature) but contrariety is only in Wills: And
he gives you good Reaſon, for what he ſays: But could <hi>Alkalies</hi>
and <hi>Acids,</hi> any way be ſaid to be contrary, What then? It don't
follow, that one muſt needs thruſt the other out of Doors; and
if they did, one would think the <hi>Deſtroyer of all Things,</hi> being too
much for the other, muſt thruſt it out: What is ſtronger than
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59081:44"/>
                  <hi>Death.</hi> But experience tells us, that whereever they meet, they
ſo combine that they are both harder to be drove out, than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them ſingle. You have an inſtance in <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi>
made of the <hi>Acid</hi> Spirit of <hi>Salt,</hi> and Volatile <hi>Alkali</hi> of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine;</hi>
which <hi>Alkali</hi> alone is ſo Subtil and Diſſipable, that it will fly
with the leaſt heat, and is hardly kept without waſting, except
with well fitted Glaſs-ſtopples; but combin'd with Spirit of <hi>Salt,</hi>
they are coagulated together into a Body, that will be kept open
without any loſs of Subſtance, if urg'd with heat will indeed fly
but together, and that not without a conſiderably ſtrong Fire.
But if the Volatile <hi>Alkali</hi> be united with ſome <hi>Acid</hi> that is not
coagulable into a Body, it will nevertheleſs be rendred leſs Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
requiring a greater Fire to raiſe it, than it did alone. Now
if <hi>Alkalies</hi> and <hi>Acids</hi> can be thought to meet ſo copiouſly in the
Blood, as to make what you call a Conflict, but I with better
reaſon term a Dance or Playing together, and produce an ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Heat; that Heat may deſerve the name of a <hi>Feaver,</hi>
and be a diſturbance in the Vital <hi>Oeconomy</hi> equally, whether it be
a Dance, or a Fight, if there be too much of the Sport; and
theſe two Bodies combin'd, eſpecially if the <hi>Acid</hi> be of any
conſiderable quantity, will be leſs apt to be carried off by Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration,
than the one of them ever ſo abundant. But if there
cannnot be ſo much <hi>Acid</hi> pour'd in, as to make an Efferveſcence
and Coagulation with the <hi>Alkali,</hi> which is in Sikneſs, and ought to
be in Health abundantly more than the <hi>Acid</hi> can be; yet the <hi>Acid</hi>
may have this effect, as to thicken, and hinder the motion of, the
Blood, and thereby render it more unapt to diſcharge the <hi>Alkali;</hi> if
we ſuppoſe it ought to be diſcharged. And that <hi>Acids</hi> do coagulate
and thicken the Blood, we have often ſeen upon tryal with Oyl
of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> as well as Oyl of <hi>Vitriol:</hi> So far is <hi>Acid</hi> from being the
thing, much leſs the only thing that can diſcharge, and drive out
your fancied noxious, and to be diſcharged <hi>Alkali.</hi> And tho'
<hi>Acid</hi> may be proper enough in ſome Diſeaſes, where the Blood is
too thin and moveable to thicken it; yet in ſuch Diſeaſes as <hi>Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys,
Rehumatiſms</hi> and <hi>Gout,</hi> where the Blood is already too thick,
and apt to Coagulate, and ſtick in the ſmall Veſſels; the making
it thicker by <hi>Acids</hi> muſt needs be improper, contrary to all Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of Cure. The Chalkey ſubſtance generated in the Fits
of the <hi>Gout,</hi> does not prove the Diſeaſe cauſed by <hi>Alkalies</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than by <hi>Acids:</hi> For <hi>Alkalous Salts</hi> when in ſolution, are not
Coagulated alone, but by meeting with <hi>Acids;</hi> except by evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the humidity they are diſſolved in, which can't be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
here. Neither is the <hi>Creta</hi> a Salt, and were it as you ſay
produced of the Volatile Salt of the Blood and Homogeneal, it
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59081:45"/>
muſt be all Salt. But you never ſaw a Salt inſipid, or a Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
one conſtant in the Fire, as you ſay this matter is. Nor are
all Bodies conſiſting of Particles of different Sizes, and Figures
(which is what you are ſo kind as to tell us you Chymiſts mean
by Heterogeneous) totally deſtroy'd by the Fire, as you may ſee
in Bricks, Bones, Glaſs, Metals and a Thouſand things. But
the Podagrick Matter, as <hi>Kerking</hi> tells us, <hi>Spicileg</hi> Obj. 28. by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation
yields a Spirit of a middle nature, between Spirit of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>
and Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniak</hi> more <hi>Acid</hi> than one, and more
mild than the other, and an Oyl very like Oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> leaving
a fixed Salt in the <hi>Caput Mort.</hi> much like Salt of <hi>Tartar:</hi> Where
are your Homogeneal Particles Sir? But the abounding of <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi>
right or wrong you will have it, is the cauſe of the <hi>Gout.</hi> But
how I pray you Sir, after what manner? Why, few are troubled
with the <hi>Gout,</hi> ſay you, but thoſe that drink Vinous Liquors; and
ſo the Blood abounding with Vinous Spirits, theſe Vinous Spirits
meeting with Volatile <hi>Alkalous</hi> Salts, are by the <hi>Alkali</hi> Coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into what <hi>Helmont</hi> calls <hi>Offa Alba;</hi> which not being capable
of moving thro' the ſmall Veſſels cauſes Obſtructions and Pains,
and by the addition of Terreſtrious Particles, is turned into a
Chalkey Subſtance. Now <hi>John</hi> I have caught you, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come off your Contradiction, but by begging Pardon on the
account of your <hi>very Treacherous Memory.</hi> The Chalkey Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
was but now a collection of Homogeneal Particles (that is,
Particles of one determinate Figure, as you pleaſed to Engliſh it
for us) but now it is a Compound of a Vinous Spirit, an <hi>Alkali.</hi>
Salt, with an addition of an Earthy Matter. This is the reſult of <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of Experiments</hi> no doubt; theſe are <hi>Grounds to build your
Practice upon, whereby you are able to do more than other People,</hi>
that is, than all the Phyſicians of all Ages. But I muſt tell you
for all that, that you grosſly miſtake <hi>Offa Alba,</hi> not knowing what
it is. But I tell you, it is not a Coagulation of a Vinous Spirit,
but a Precipitation of the Urinous Salt out of its Phlegm, by the
affuſion of the Vinous Spirit; but unleſs the Vinous and Urinous
Spirits be both ſtrong it will not do; nor will all Urinous Spirits
make the <hi>Offa Alba.</hi> The reaſon of this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> where it
ſucceeds is this, The Volatile Salt not being Soluble in ſtrong
Spirit of Wine, and having but little Phlegm of its own, more
than what will diſſolve it, the Vinous Spirits being apt to
mix with that Phlegm, fills its Pores, and ſo it lets fall the
Salt. But it's impoſſible to find a Livings Man's Blood ſo
ſtrongly <hi>Alkalous,</hi> as that there ſhould be but juſt enough
<hi>Latex</hi> to diſſolve the Salt: Nor were it poſſible, can there be
added Vinous Liqours in quantity, and ſtrength enough to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59081:45"/>
make ſuch a Coagulation. We Phyſitians all know, Mr. <hi>Chymiſt,</hi>
that the Blood never abounds ſo much with <hi>Alkalous</hi> Salt, as to
make ſo much as a weak Spirit, nor can the Spirit of the Wines
we drink, be ſeparated from the Phlegm in our Bellies, nor can
we drink Vinous Spirits ſtrong enough to Coagulate an <hi>Alkalous</hi>
Spirit. Moreover, this <hi>Offa Alba</hi> which <hi>Helmont</hi> talks of, is ſo
very Subtil and Volatile, that it would eaſily find paſſage, and
be carried off through the ſmalleſt Pores by a gentle Heat, and
would be ſo far from Coagulating into a Chalkey Subſtance, as that
it is a good Medicine to thin the Blood, and hinder Coagulations;
as alſo very beneficially uſed externally in pains, of the <hi>Gout</hi> it
ſelf. As for Rain tho' you grant ſome Pain, may proceed from
a Solution of Continuity; yet you can't agree with thoſe that
ſay, all Pains do: But there are violent Pains where the Union
is entire as in a Blow with a blunt thing. Truly Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> you are
a Man of a blunt Underſtanding, for all you have a ſharp Name,
or elſe you would eaſily perceive, that in any Blow that is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
there is a violent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preſſure made upon the ſmall Veſſels which
burſts them, and forces the Blood out of them; which is the
cauſe of the Blackneſs often following Blows, and there can be
no Extravaſation without aſolution of Unity more or leſs. So
all violent diſtentions, all Corroding Matters make Solutions of
Unity, breaking ſome of the ſmall Fibers, at which we have the
Senſation of Pain. But your poſitive Aſſertion, that all Pain is
cauſed by a Stagnation of Humours, and thence a Compreſſion
of the <hi>Membranes</hi> muſt be excuſed as a fault of <hi>a very Treacherous
Memory:</hi> Some Pains come from Solution of Unity you grant,
and yet preſently ſay you, all Pains proceed from a Compreſſion
of the <hi>Membranes.</hi> Truely Doctor, I ſhould be afraid to truſt
my Life and Health with a Man of ſuch Brain; I ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
he would forget to morrow, and Preſcribe contrary to
to day's Preſcription. But I will ask you a Queſtion or two,
becauſe you are very ſharp at a preſent thought. Are there no
Pains but in <hi>Membranes?</hi> And does not a Stagation and Flux
of Blood into a Part, cauſe the Swelling and Diſtention of
one Part as much as the Compreſſion of another? And does not
Diſtenſion, as well as Corroding Acrimonious Particles break the
Fibers? And are not Wounds both Inci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Stagnation? If you cannot ſay no, and ſnew us better Reaſon
than you have done yet, we ſhall hardly be of your opinion, That
all Pain proceeds from Compreſſion of <hi>Membranes.</hi> As for <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralyſis,</hi>
tho' it ſounds ſomething of Solution; yet ſuppoſing you
do not much inſiſt upon the meer <hi>Greek</hi> of it, we will deny it

to be a Solution of Continuity, and rather take it to be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation
of the proper and natural Tenſion of the Inſtruments of

without Vanity I may ſay, I have Cured more true Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
in the ſpace of one Year, than any Phyſician in <hi>England</hi>
has done. My reaſon for the uſe of <hi>Acids,</hi> and diſuſe of <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>
here, are as follow. The Globules of the Blood by being
mixed with a great quantity of <hi>Acrid, Alcalous,</hi> Lixivial Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
are broken and confuſedly mixed with the <hi>Serum,</hi> and ſo
admitted with it into the ſmall Glands of the Lungs, and not
being capable of being diſcharged cauſe <hi>Inflammations</hi> and <hi>Hectick
Feavers.</hi> Now by <hi>Alkalies</hi> the extravaſated <hi>Globules</hi> are not
thrown out, but the Blood made worſe, and by <hi>Balſamicks</hi> the
Puſtules from the extravaſated <hi>Globules</hi> are brought to ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
whence come Ulceration, and he muſt ſhew himſelf an
Artiſt indeed that can heal ſuch Ulcers. Now proper <hi>Acids</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given in due time confirm the texture of the Blood, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the <hi>Serum</hi> into Fluidity; by which the <hi>Feaver</hi> and <hi>Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
are taken off; the extravaſated <hi>Globules</hi> by a thin <hi>Serum;</hi>
and the motion of the Part carried off; and ſo the Puſtules diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear.
But how comes it to paſs that the broken <hi>Globules</hi> are
admitted along with the <hi>Serum</hi> into the Glands of ſeveral Parts,
and yet cannot by the ſame reaſon be carryed off? I Anſwer,
the broken <hi>Globules</hi> juſt coming out of the extremities of the
Arteries are hot, and their ſides lax, and ſo capable of being
compreſſed, but admitted into the Glands; the motion of the
<hi>Serum</hi> being ſlow they ſoon grow cool and firm, and from the
different Figure of thoſe broken <hi>Globules,</hi> from the Pores the
<hi>Serum</hi> paſſes, they are not ſuffered to paſs; ſo being without
motion they corrupt, whence are the Simptoms. Now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm

Write, Boaſt as great Experience, and promiſe, That he wou'd
Cure thoſe, whom all Men in the World had left off, as Incurable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
From a ſtate of Dying, to that of perfect Health, is a great Change;
eſpecially to one who has affirm'd, That, <hi>none are in perfect Health:</hi>
But I ſuppoſe, you would have as well ſaid from a ſtate of Death,
to perfect Health, if you could have hoped for Credence. If you
had ſaid, you had Cured as <hi>many</hi> of <hi>Conſumptions, viz.</hi> Ulcerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Lungs, as any Phyſitian in <hi>England,</hi> ſuch a Year; you
might poſſibly have been believed: But to ſay, you Cured <hi>more,</hi>
implyes, you Cured ſome. But you are witneſs for your ſelf Sir.
And that an Ulceration of the Lungs, is peculiar to <hi>England,</hi> is a
fancy peculiar to Mr. <hi>Acid.</hi> And that there are not divers <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions,</hi>
where there is no Ulceration, is his ſingle Opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But as to your Reaſon for the uſe of <hi>Acids,</hi> and diſuſe of <hi>Alkalies,
viz.</hi> That the <hi>Globules</hi> of the Blood are broken, by acrid <hi>Alkalous
Lixivial</hi> Particles, and ſo admitted into the Glands, with the <hi>Serum,</hi>
and not being capable of being carry'd off with the <hi>Serum;</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Cold and hard, cauſe Inflammations, and being ſuppurated
Ulcerations; is a mere incoherent Fancy: <hi>Not being in the leaſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
with me, being not confirm'd by well Atteſted,</hi> or any <hi>Experiments.</hi>
You never ſaw the broken <hi>Globules</hi> you talk ſo of, but in your
Wild Imagination, and can't aſſure us, into what Figures they are
ſevered; how differing from the Pores they cannot paſs with the
<hi>Serum</hi> whilſt broken thus into leſſer pieces; but can, when once uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
again, and confirm'd by <hi>Acids.</hi> The Puſtles you fancy in the
Lungs, you never made appear, or felt the broken <hi>Globules</hi> there
cold and hard, or heard the <hi>Biolychnium</hi> (that keeps them <hi>lax</hi> and
ſoft, or if you pleaſe, in flux) hiſs, quench'd in the cool extravaſated
<hi>Serum</hi> of the Lungs. Beſides, you muſt ſuppoſe, That this Diſeaſe
is ſtill procured by Phyſitians, whenever caus'd by means of <hi>Lixivial</hi>
Particles: For as we told you before, there can be no <hi>Lixivial</hi>
Salt in the Blood; it being a product of real, yea, common Fire.
And ſtill one wou'd think, That if the <hi>Globules</hi> of the Blood can
be broken by <hi>Alkalies,</hi> they might be broken ſtill by more into
leſſer Parts, and ſo paſs out by the <hi>Diaphoretick</hi> power of <hi>Alkalies;</hi>
rather than when confirm'd again by <hi>Acids.</hi> That <hi>Balamicks</hi> Cauſe
Suppuration, is contrary to the common Experience of all Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
who know they hinder Corruption. When the Lungs are
Ulcerated he muſt be an Artiſt indeed, that can heal ſuch Ulcers:
True, And it's ſuch a piece of Art, I believe, an <hi>Acid</hi> Doctor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
perform'd, tho' he himſelf may Boaſt ſuch Cures: 'Tis no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59081:47"/>
thing for Quacks, to perſwade their Patients, if they have
but a Cough, and Spit a little, that they have a <hi>Conſumption,</hi> their
Lungs are corrupted, ulcerated, and waſted; with as great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
as if they could ſee through them: When the Patient is
well again, a mighty Cure is Brag'd of: And who can then diſprove
it? but he that ſees an impoſſibility in the thing. That <hi>Acids</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the Texture of the Blood, and make the <hi>Serum</hi> thin; is ſo
far from Truth, that they do the contrary, as any one may ſee
by Tryal, and find, That Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> ſaies any thing merely for his
Hypotheſis ſake, without the leaſt Reaſon, or Experience. As
for <hi>Riverius</hi>'s Curing a confirm'd <hi>Phthiſes</hi> with Conſerve of <hi>Roſes</hi>
Acidulated, the matter is to be queſtioned, eſpecially, whether
Oyl of <hi>Sulphur</hi> were the onely thing uſed with benefit; if <hi>Riverius</hi>
ever ſaid ſo: For you could not tell us where. And the Man
that <hi>Helmont</hi> adviſed Oyl of <hi>Sulphur</hi> to, might have Liv'd as long
and healthy, without that trivial thing, as he calls it, for ought
you, or <hi>Helmont</hi> either knew, who charg'd him not to exceed
two Drops, being ſenſible of the danger of taking too much of
ſo keen an <hi>Acid. Acids,</hi> or any thing elſe, being ſuppos'd
Preſervatives, does not conclude. That they muſt be Curatives:
For Food. Air, Exerciſe, Content. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Preſervatives; but
none will therefore expect to Cure all Diſeaſes by them. But Mr.
<hi>Acid</hi> is reſolved upon the Fancy. That <hi>Acids</hi> do all Things, confirm
the Blood, and make it thin if thick, or thick if thin. or what he
pleaſes. But how this is done, Mr. <hi>Acid muſt be Wiſer than</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>to tell:</hi> But what ſay you to <hi>Rheumatiſms?</hi>

               <p>This is another Diſtemper ſaid to proceed from <hi>Acids,</hi> but
falſly: For here having analiz'd the Blood by the Fire, I have
found it abound more with <hi>Alkalous</hi> Particles, than that of ſound
Perſons, from which alone it may be inferr'd, That it proceeds
not from <hi>Acids,</hi> but from <hi>Alkalies.</hi> But it may be objected,
Whence comes the ſizyneſs and viſcoſity of the <hi>Serum,</hi> if not from
<hi>Acids?</hi> Every Body that knows what <hi>Hart's Horn</hi> is, knows that
the reaſon of its making Gelly, is from its abounding with Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<hi>Alkalous</hi>-Salts: For the ſame reaſon, Calves-Feet and <hi>Iſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs</hi>
make Gellies. And if the <hi>Viſcoſity</hi> of the Blood can be taken
off, this Diſtemper vaniſhes: But this is not to be done by
<hi>Alkalies;</hi> but by proper <hi>Acids,</hi> ſuch as the foremention'd Tincture
of <hi>Antimony</hi> and <hi>Chalybeats.</hi> But People will ſay, I have caught
my ſelf in a Trap, when I bring <hi>Chalybeates</hi> in as <hi>Acids;</hi> when all
own them to be <hi>Alkalies;</hi> inaſmuch as Fileings of Iron will
make as great an <hi>Efferveſcence</hi> with all ſorts of <hi>Acids,</hi> as any of the
<hi>Alkalies.</hi> From this difficulty, I ſhall endeavour to extricate my
ſelf, and to prove, That Iron or Steel till it be converted into
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59081:48"/>
                  <hi>Vitriol</hi> (and every Body will allow <hi>Vitriol</hi> to be an <hi>Acid)</hi> can't act upon
the Blood and <hi>Serum</hi> to cauſe an alteration, nor any way enter into
the Veins and Arteries: Skillful Practitioners before they give
<hi>Steel</hi>-Medicines, ask their Patients, Whether they have any <hi>Acidity</hi>
in their Stomachs (where I allow <hi>Acids</hi> ſometimes abound exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly)
and if they are ſenſible of any <hi>Acidity</hi> there; then they give
<hi>Iron</hi> without any Preparation, which by the <hi>Acid</hi> in the Stomach,
is turn'd into <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and ſo made capable of being carry'd into
the Blood: Whereas had it been before ſatiated by Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
it had had no Effect at all: If there be no <hi>Acidity</hi> in the
Stomach, it is carry'd off by Stool, and not admitted into the Blood.
And moſt of the Preparations of <hi>Steel,</hi> I know of, good for any
thing, are made by <hi>Acids,</hi> which turn it into <hi>Vitriol:</hi> But <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>
do ſo lock up the Body of <hi>Iron,</hi> as to make it unfit to be taken
as a Medicine. The Preparations of <hi>Mars</hi> I generally uſe, are
that which goes by the Name of Doctor <hi>Willis,</hi> and that which
follows, <hi>R. Fileings of Mars <abbr>lb</abbr>iſs. ſal Armoniack, <abbr>lb</abbr>ij. pulveriſe and

a Crucible and keep it almoſt Red Hot an Hour, when cold make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

in anſwer to the Objection, That <hi>Steel</hi> can't be an <hi>Acid,</hi> becauſe it
makes an <hi>Efferveſcence</hi> with <hi>Acids:</hi> I ſay, all <hi>Sulphurs</hi> mix'd with
<hi>Acids,</hi> will cauſe an <hi>Efferveſcence</hi> and ſome of them take Eire:
And that all Metals are full of <hi>Sulphurs</hi> is paſt Diſpute; and from
this way of arguing, <hi>Sulphur</hi> muſt be an <hi>Alkali.</hi> But beſides the
Preparations of <hi>Steel,</hi> I have oft uſed <hi>Cinnaber</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> or
common <hi>Cinnaber</hi> with good Succeſs, mix'd with <hi>Gum Guajacum</hi>
in confirm'd <hi>Rheumatiſmes</hi> and <hi>Sciaticaes.</hi> I did believe <hi>Cinnaber</hi>
to be an <hi>Alkali,</hi> but I find by a peculiar management, a large

               <p>As to your Aſſertion, That the Blood of <hi>Rheumaticks,</hi> in
Analizeing it is found to abound more with <hi>Alkali</hi> than that of
Sound Perſons, I have anſwer'd you before. I ſhall only add your
own Confeſſion about Analizeing the Blood, <hi>That it wou'd be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
inpoſſble for any private Man to make a ſufficient number of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
requiſite.</hi> And we find in the Experiments you have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
the World with, you have Analiz'd the Blood of but one
Healthy Perſon, when you ought to have try'd rather an Hundred
Sound Perſon's Bloods firſt, and have ſeen the difference of their
Products, and have made your Tryals in large and equal quantities,
and not ſuch little odd parcels as you have done; if you would be
at any certainty. As for your Reaſon of the <hi>Viſcoſity</hi> of the Blood
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59081:48"/>
in <hi>Rheumatiſmes:</hi> I Anſwer, Every Body that knows what vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<hi>Alkalies</hi> are, knows, That they have not only nothing of <hi>Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſity</hi>
in them themſelves, but alſo render the Blood and <hi>Serum</hi>
thin. And you make a mighty noiſe, how <hi>Alkalies</hi> break the
<hi>Globules</hi> of the Blood; but if you had any Conſideration, you
wou'd not think, diviſion into ſmaller Parts, is the way to thicken.
But perhaps <hi>Alkali</hi> is ſuch a bad thing as to thicken, and make
thin both, according as there may be Miſchief done: Being the
Deſtroyer or Executioner of all things, has more ways of Killing
than one; As <hi>Acids</hi> will thicken and make thin, when you wou'd
have them. But as for <hi>Hart's-Horn, Iſing-glaſs,</hi> Calves-Feer, if it
be from <hi>Alkalies</hi> that they make Gellies: Why, don't other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Subſtances abounding as much, and more with <hi>Alkali</hi> make
Gellies as well as theſe? And why do Vegitables (that you ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
moſt with <hi>Acids)</hi> make Gellies, as well as <hi>Hart's-Horn,</hi> &amp;c.
as we ſee in <hi>Mallow-Roots, Comfrey, Quince-Seeds,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſity</hi>
of the Blood is to be taken off by proper <hi>Acids,</hi> you ſay:
But I have ſaid enough already of the contrary Effects of <hi>Acids,</hi> to
ſhew your Miſtake in this Opinion, and Ignorance in relation to
your Tincture of <hi>Antimony:</hi> But as for <hi>Chalybeats,</hi> People may well
ſay you have caught your ſelf in a Trap, by bringing in <hi>Chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beats</hi>
as <hi>Acids;</hi> for every Phyſician knows, That Metals, eſpecially
<hi>Iron,</hi> blunt and Abſord <hi>Acids</hi> making an <hi>Efferveſcence</hi> with them,
and are diſſolv'd by them. But let us ſee how you get out of
this Trap? Why <hi>Iron</hi> ſay you (as you told us once before) can't
act upon the Blood and <hi>Serum,</hi> nor enter the Veins and Arteries,
till turn'd into <hi>Vitriol.</hi> How prove you this Sir, that Iron won't
be admitted into the Blood till turn'd into <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and that it
will then? It is only becauſe you fancy ſo, for you have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſhew'd us by any good Experiment, that Iron either unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
or turned into <hi>Vitriol</hi> will paſs into the Blood. But if
<hi>your ſqueemiſh temper</hi> would have ſuffer'd you to meddle with the
Subject, you might have took a <hi>T</hi>—<hi>d,</hi> and a like quantity of
Blood from ſome of your Patients under a Steel-courſe: Firſt of
unprepared Iron, then of Iron prepared with ſome of your No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Acid Menſtruums;</hi> from one of a ſowr Stomach; from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without a ſowr Stomach, and have got ſome body that
knows how to reduce Mettals to aſſiſt you (your wonderous
Friend Mr. <hi>Stringer,</hi> ſure would not have denied his help) and
when you had ſeen which way the Iron goes, you might have
been confidently poſitive, or modeſtly ſilent, or have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that Phyſicians do not give Iron ſuppoſing it will paſs into
the Blood, but to abſorb <hi>Acids</hi> in the Stomach and Bowels, and
to hinder them from paſſing into the Blood, which if they were
z<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59081:49"/>
turned into <hi>Vitriol</hi> by ſowr Stomachs (which I believe has not
been proved) and ſo neceſſarily carried into the Blood, and
could act there as <hi>Acids,</hi> would fruſtrate the Phyſicians intention,
who only aimes at cutting off a ſupply of <hi>Acid</hi> from the Stomach
the grand <hi>Officine</hi> thereof. But ſuppoſe Iron either unprepared,
or turned into <hi>Vitriol,</hi> will or will not paſs into the Blood, What's
this towards proving Iron an <hi>Acid?</hi> Why Iron may be turned
into <hi>Vitriol</hi> by an <hi>Acid?</hi> Tarbox, Iron is an <hi>Acid:</hi> Here's Logick
for you Sirs: Or, the <hi>Acid</hi> in <hi>Vitriol</hi> is an <hi>Acid,</hi> therefore the
<hi>Alkali</hi> in <hi>Vitriol</hi> is an <hi>Acid.</hi> You might as well ſay, the Volatile
Salt of Urine is an <hi>Acid,</hi> becauſe the Spirit of Salt which is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied,
and coagulated with it in <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> while ſeparate
was an <hi>Acid.</hi> But ſay you, every Body allows <hi>Vitriol</hi> the whole
Compound to be an <hi>Acid;</hi> and therefore you infer, that Iron one
of the Ingredients is an <hi>Acid.</hi> I Anſwer, Neither is the Premiſs
alow'd, nor your Conſequence Natural. I deny <hi>Vitriol</hi> the whole
Compound to be an <hi>Acid,</hi> it being but a Neuter, and the <hi>Acid</hi> in
it never acts as an <hi>Acid</hi> in this form; being abſorb'd, ſheath'd,
and ſpoil'd of its <hi>Acid</hi> force (the Compound being but a <hi>Salſum)</hi>
till ſeparated again, which cannot be but by a Fire great enough
to calcine an Aſſ-eyed Chymiſt's Bones. As for your Argument,
That Steel may be an <hi>Acid,</hi> tho' it makes an efferveſcence with
<hi>Acids;</hi> becauſe all <hi>Sulphurs</hi> mixed with <hi>Acids</hi> will do the like: I
ſay, that all but Ignorant <hi>Tyros</hi> know the contrary; that no <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs</hi>
properly ſo call'd, <hi>viz. Brimſtones</hi> will make an efferveſcence
with <hi>Acids,</hi> or be eaſily touched by them. Some Oyls indeed
will grow hot, and make an efferveſcence with ſome <hi>Acids</hi> even
to a Flame, but not all with all, as is well known. But as for
Metals. I tell you, you never ſaw a <hi>Brimſtone,</hi> much leſs an Oyl
extracted, or ſeparated from them in your Life; tho' 'tis paſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute
with you, and ſo we need not argue <hi>Sulphur</hi> to be an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali:</hi>
But we cannot think it an <hi>Acid</hi> unleſs we deny our Senſes,
much leſs are thoſe Oyls that will grow hot with <hi>Acids</hi> to be
thought ſo. But I think you have caught your ſelf in another
Trap, by allowing <hi>Acids</hi> ſometimes to abound exorbitantly in the
Stomach, which exorbitant abundance of <hi>Acids</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed
a Diſorder or Diſeaſe (as you elſewhere confeſſed) as well as
exorbitant <hi>Alkali,</hi> and ſo all Diſeaſes are not from too much
<hi>Alkali.</hi> But I believe there is never more exorbitant <hi>Acid</hi> in
the Stomach or any where elſe, than in the Patient, who is ſo
unhappy as to fall into the hands of Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> who tho' he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
<hi>The Heart-burn cauſed by</hi> Acids, yet <hi>abſorbents are far
from being uſeful in this caſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>but the Heart-burn is as often
cured by</hi> Acids; <hi>ſuch as Oyl of</hi> Vitriol Dulc. <hi>&amp;c. as by</hi> Alkalies.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59081:49"/>
Here's that which hangs together finely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>All Diſeaſes are cauſed
by</hi> Alkalies, <hi>yet ſome by</hi> Acids <hi>as the Heart-burn, and too much fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi>
yet Alkalies <hi>are far from being uſefull, but the Heart-burn is as
often Cured by</hi> Acids, <hi>ſuch as Oyl of</hi> Vitriol, <hi>as by</hi> Alkalies; that
is not oftener than by <hi>Alkalies</hi> which Cure it ſometimes, tho'
they are far from being uſeful: So in this Diſeaſe, if you come
to Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> you muſt be Cured by that which does it no oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
than that which is far from being uſeful. Truely every ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Man will think <hi>Acids</hi> ſo far from being uſeful to Cure a
Diſeaſe from too much Acidity, that he will account it no leſs
than <hi>Ignem oleo extinguere.</hi> Wo be to your Patients, Here Sir you
will make the <hi>Biolychnium</hi> Blaze. But truely, I muſt tell you, Theſe
Contradictions can't be the faults of a <hi>Treacherous Memory,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the want of Wit. Well, as to <hi>Mars,</hi> again all the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of it you know good for any thing are made by <hi>Acids.</hi>
That may be I confeſs, if the Peſtle and Mortar are <hi>Acid Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums;</hi>
but I tell you <hi>John</hi> I know good Preparations of <hi>Mars</hi>
not made by <hi>Acids,</hi> and yet the Body of <hi>Mars</hi> open'd more than
by any of your great <hi>Acid Menſtruums.</hi> But if no preparations
of <hi>Mars</hi> were good for any thing but thoſe made with <hi>Acids,</hi>
why do you uſe others, and ſo trap your ſelf again? That which
you give us the proceſs of is not made by an <hi>Acid; Sal Armoniack</hi>
being no ſuch thing, but a Compoſition of Sea-Salt and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
<hi>Alkali</hi> of Urine; the Sea-Salt it ſelf being no <hi>Acid</hi> while
in this form, or till altered by a ſtrong Fire. You have
ſometime confeſſed, that <hi>ſome Preparations of Steel and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
given as Alkalies, did you great ſervice; but ſince you have
well examined them, you find them moſt Noble</hi> Acids. Sure your
Tryals have been very unhapy to lead you into Miſtakes,
or you have forgot your Rule, <hi>That whatſoever in Diſtillation yields
a greater quantity of Alkali, is an Alkali, et Vice Verſa;</hi> or I believe,
it wou'd not do here; for you may Diſtill <hi>Steel,</hi> and Twenty
things more, long enough before you can get either <hi>Acid</hi> or <hi>Alkali</hi>
to come over: Nor could you prove by this Rule, That <hi>Cinnaber</hi>
is an <hi>Acid,</hi> which you ſo mightily commend in this, and other
Caſes, and ſay you, can ſpeak <hi>Ten times more than</hi> Hoffman <hi>in its
Praiſes;</hi> tho' he Wrote a Treatiſe of it, which I believe you can a
Hundred times more, but your Credit will be a Hundred times
leſs. But I muſt tell you, That <hi>Cinnaber</hi> is ſo far from being an
<hi>Acid,</hi> that if Analiz'd a <abbr>lb</abbr> will yield ℥xiij, or more of running
<hi>Mercury,</hi> one of the greateſt <hi>Abſorbers</hi> of <hi>Acids</hi> in the World, and
the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Sulphur,</hi> is not an <hi>Acid;</hi> but a Compound of an
<hi>Acid</hi> and an <hi>Oyl;</hi> whereby it is ſo ſheath'd and entangl'd, that it
can't act as an <hi>Acid,</hi> nor be ſet at liberty ſo to do, but by a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59081:50"/>
Fire, You never found a larger quantity of <hi>Acid</hi> got from <hi>Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
than what may be got from the <hi>Sulphur</hi> that goes into the
Compound, which is ſo much leſs than the <hi>Mercury.</hi> And now
<hi>John,</hi> conſidering your continuing Ignorance of the Medicines
you uſe, I think I may ſay truly of you, as you ſay falſly of all Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians;
if you Cure Diſeaſes it is by <hi>chance, as a blind Man may
catch a Hare,</hi> giving ſome tolerable Medicines as <hi>Acids,</hi> when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they are <hi>Alkalies;</hi> ſeeming uncapable to judg, or make fair
Tryals; ſince your Brain is turn'd in the Production of your ſowr

(like a true <hi>Bethlehemite)</hi> whatever is good is <hi>Acid,</hi> and
whatever is bad is <hi>Alkali</hi> with you: Your Tongue ſo ſtrongly

over-power them, and give you their genuine Taſtes. And I
don't queſtion if you let me know farther of the Medicine you
preſcribe, and let Men in their Senſes be Judges, I ſhall find you
miſtaken in other things beſides <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Cinnaber,</hi> and ſhall be
forced to reckon you with one of theſe two Quacks, he that gave
every Patient the Receipt that came uppermoſt in his Budget,

<hi>Mercury,</hi> Cure without <hi>Mercury,</hi> great is the Danger of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
&amp;c. when he himſelf. gave even crude <hi>Mercury</hi> in his Pills,
envying (as it is like) other Perſons the profit of uſeing it. Here's

diſcloſe your ſelf. But ſince you have ſaid ſo much, I hope
you will let us ſee Tranſmutation, and convince the Unbelievers.
But whatever you may perſwade us about the Tranſmutation of
Metals, I doubt we ſhall never ſee Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> Tranſmuted into a

And tho' you tell us the different Operation of Metals

Men in <hi>England</hi> that know ſo much of Mettals, as to reduce
them dexterouſly out of their Oars, and perhaps not two (ſetting

theſe Bodies. But Sir, if you have ſuch a large Knowledg, poſſibly you
may have the <hi>Alkaheſt</hi> too, and when you talk of <hi>Alkalies</hi> being ſo
univerſal a Deſtroyer, you make us fancy it may be made of that;

                  <hi>Arſenick</hi> is the higheſt, and moſt exalted <hi>Alkali,</hi> as Oyl of
<hi>Vitriol</hi> is the moſt exalted <hi>Acid.</hi> As for the external uſe of <hi>Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick.</hi>
I know nothing experimentally, but being a thing of perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
conſequence inwardly taken, I ſuppoſe it can have no very
friendly operation externally apply'd. Internally taken, it cauſeth
Vomitings, Convulſions of the Stomach, cold Sweats, Palpitations
of the Heart, Swoonings, violent Thirſt; and ſeems to be a direct
enemy to Life; which it fails not ſoon to deſtroy: All which Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
it will not fail to have, given in never ſo ſmall a quantity.
And thoſe People who have been ſo vain, as to pretend to correct
the poyſonous quality of <hi>Arſenick,</hi> ſo as to convert it into a good,
and ſafe Medicine; have attempted it only by the means of <hi>Acid</hi>
Salts: as <hi>Sea-ſalt, Niter, Tartar, Vitriol,</hi> &amp;c. wherein I cannot tell
whether any man has been ſo happy as to ſucceed. To prove
<hi>Arſenick</hi> to be an <hi>Alkali,</hi> and as ſuch the cauſe of thoſe dreadful
Symptoms attending thoſe that take it; I give you this Relation.
A certain Young-woman taking a large quantity of <hi>Arſenick,</hi> was
immediately attended with all the moſt violent Symptoms imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable:
A Doctor gave her large quantities of <hi>Salad-oyl,</hi> the uſual
Remedy, without the leaſt abating the Symptoms; upon which he
gave her the <hi>Juice of Lemons</hi> plentifully, which ſoon took off thoſe
direful Symptoms; tho the operation of the <hi>Acid</hi> might be impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the quantity of the Oyl ſhe had taken before.</p>

unleſs moſt volatile, or moſt ſtrong. But as for <hi>Arſenick,</hi> it is far
from being the moſt volatile or ſtrongeſt <hi>Alkali;</hi> neither is <hi>Oyl of
Vitriol</hi> the moſt volatile or ſtrongeſt <hi>Acid.</hi> But whatever <hi>Arſenick</hi>
is, it will not produce its effects in the ſmalleſt quantity, having
been given as a Medicine, a grain or two in ſome caſes. Neither
have all thoſe People who you ſay have been ſo vain as to attempt
to correct it, done it by <hi>Acid Salts.</hi> For I my ſelf have a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
from it, wherein is not a grain of any kind of Salt, which I
can give to the quantity of a ſcruple, or more, to good purpoſe,
in ſome caſes; giving Nature no ſuch diſturbance as is common in
the uſe of many vulgar Medicines. And outwardly I have uſed
Preparations of it, doing in ſome caſes what I could never do with
any thing elſe; never ſeeing any ill effects of it. But that <hi>Arſenick</hi>
is an <hi>Alkali,</hi> and produces its evil effects as ſuch, is but your Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,

is ſuch a ſlight one as you uſually give for other things. A Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

cured. And a Perſon in <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> I am told, has cured ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
by the ſame method. Common Salt, I allow, will excite Thirſt
not <hi>quatenus Acid;</hi> for Spirit of Salt will take it off: But I aſſure
you, I have ſtumbled more at this thing of Common Salt's exciting
Thirſt, than any thing elſe beſides, and therefore have ſpar'd no
Coſt to find the Reaſon; but at laſt, after much Labour and
Sweat, I found there was no Salt but had more or leſs of a damn'd
thing call'd <hi>Bittern</hi> mix'd with it. Now this <hi>Bittern</hi> is the moſt
corroding fix'd <hi>Alkali</hi> in nature; and tho it be inconſiderable in
quantity, in reſpect of the <hi>Acid,</hi> yet it will fix it ſelf on the Parts
after the <hi>Acid</hi> of the Salt is all diſſolved, and ſo excite Thirſt.</p>

               <p>It is ſo far from being allow'd by all, that <hi>Sea-Salt</hi> is an
<hi>Acid,</hi> that I know none that can taſte will allow it, except you
Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> who are either reſolved to deny your Senſes to ſerve
your Hypothetick Fancy, or have ſo us'd your Mouth to <hi>Acids,</hi>
you can taſte nothing elſe; as Perſons in ſome Diſtempers
taſte every thing bitter. But let the healthy Country-man taſte
it, and I will engage he will not ſay 'tis ſowr. That it may be by
the Fire changed into a ſowr Liquor, is no better an Argument,
that it is now ſowr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than that Sugar, becauſe it may be turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Vinegar, is Vinegar; or into an <hi>Alkali,</hi> is an <hi>Alkali</hi> already; or
that an Aſs-ey'd Doctor is a wiſe man, becauſe poſſibly he may learn
Wit. It is not true, that thoſe that eat Fleſh can't live without
Salt: for not only divers kinds of Animals that live wholly on Fleſh
eat no Salt, but abundance of People in <hi>North-America,</hi> who live
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59081:53"/>
very healthy, and ſtrong, and moſtly upon Fleſh, have no Salt a tall;
as <hi>Hennipen</hi> tells us in his late account of thoſe Parts, and I don't
queſtion but we might do the ſame were we accuſtom'd to it,
without hurting our ſelves by <hi>Alkali.</hi> Neither do we uſe Salt to
lock up <hi>Alkali</hi> in Fleſh, which it will not do; <hi>Sea-Salt</hi> no way
uniting with, or retaining volatile <hi>Alkalies,</hi> except it is firſt turn'd
into on <hi>Acid</hi> Spirit; as you may eaſily ſee, either by diſtilling <hi>Salt-meat,
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> or <hi>Sea-Salt,</hi> and a volatile <hi>Alkali</hi> mix'd together.
But we uſe Salt to preſerve and reliſh our Meat, neither of which
would be done by its <hi>Acid</hi> Spirit. Nor can the <hi>Longevity</hi> of the
<hi>Antediluvians</hi> be aſcrib'd to their living upon Vegetables, much leſs
from an <hi>Acid</hi> in them, when all Vegetables that are commonly ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
turn into an <hi>Alkalous</hi> Chyle. And if living upon Vegetables
would ſo much conduce to long Life, why have not ſome in our
time, who would eat nothing elſe, lived longer, or at leaſt more
healthy, than others? And tho you, not doubting of <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,
can't imagine what they would have done for Salt before
the Flood, yet I and others, not doubting of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Hypotheſis,
can very well imagine, That they might have had Salt to reliſh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
ſorts of Vegetables, as well as for other uſes, from the Sea,
from Fountains, or from the Rock the original of that uſeful Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
As for the Cure of Perſons bit by mad Dogs, by dipping; it
cannot be well thought to depend upon the Saltneſs of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
much leſs on the ſuppoſed <hi>Acidity</hi> of the Salt: If it did, why
would not the drinking Salt-water, or Spirit of Salt, or waſhing
with them, rather do the Cure; which has not been found ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.
But the reaſon of this, is more rationally thought to lie
in the blotting out and deſtroying, or preventing the Idea of
Rage, by the contrary Idea of Fear impreſs'd upon the Spirits of
the Perſons bit. Which is apparent from the manner of dipping,
as I have had the Account from Perſons dip'd; which is till the
Perſon has an apprehenſion or fear of being drowned: Therefore
they dip ſome twice, ſome thrice, more or leſs, as they find them
fearful, or courageous. On the ſame account, dipping might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
Urine, and ſo do ſomething towards curing the Dropſy. And
I believe the inducing a contrary Idea, would be a more effectual
way of curing other ſorts of Madneſs, than any of the common
Methods; if Phyſicians would give themſelves to conſider of, and
put in practice the ſeveral ways, and means by which it might be
done. I agree with you, That Salt does not excite Thirſt <hi>quatenus
Acid;</hi> becauſe that would be to do it <hi>quatenus</hi> what it is not; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
does it do it <hi>quatenus Alkali.</hi> And tho it has coſt you ſo
much Money and Sweat, to reſolve this ſtumbling Queſtion, you
muſt ſtumble, and Sweat again, or remain under a Miſtake. For
the Damn'd thing <hi>Bittern</hi> (to repeat your Beauiſh Expreſſion) is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59081:54"/>
not where, and what you ſuppoſe it: Firſt it is not in all Salt;
for it is that which will not ſhoot with the Salt into regular Grains,
and if Boyl'd up, will not continue in a dry Form, but runs into a
Liquour in the open Air. Therefore that Salt that is ſhot into its
proper Chryſtals and keeps dry, has no <hi>Bittern.</hi> But if this won't
do, Diſtill your Salt into an <hi>Acid</hi> Spirit, and then you will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
there is no fix'd <hi>Alkali</hi> in it: Turn this Spirit into Salt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
the ſame in quantity and Quality (as every Chymiſt knows
how) and this Salt ſhall make you as Thirſty, as any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salt. Secondly <hi>Bittern</hi> it ſelf is not the moſt corroding fix'd.-<hi>Alkali</hi>
in Nature, for tho' it will turn Syrup of <hi>Violets</hi> Green (as
<hi>Allum</hi> alſo doth) more readily than Common-Salt; yet it is not
corroding as an <hi>Alkali,</hi> as any one may Try by Taſting it, and the
mildeſt fix'd <hi>Alkali,</hi> and they will find a difference, much more
between this and the moſt Corroding ones: Nor is it a fix'd <hi>Alkali,</hi>
for it will riſe in the Fire, and come over good Spirit of Salt, even
<hi>per<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſe</hi> without any addition of Earth, leaving nothing behind but
a white inſipid Earth, which will not ſo much as make an <hi>Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcence</hi>
with <hi>Acids;</hi> Neither will <hi>Bittern</hi> fix it ſelf on the Parts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Salt is diſſolved, for it's diſſolved much ſooner than Salt it
ſelf. Thus you ſee Sir, by a little Skill in Chymiſtry your Damn'd
fix'd <hi>Alkali</hi> is become a Bleſſed Volatile <hi>Acid.</hi> But <hi>Bittern</hi> in its
Natural Form juſt Boyl'd up into a dry Form is but a <hi>Salſum,</hi> not
fermenting with <hi>Acids</hi> much more than Common-Salt will, and
may be taken in as large a quantity as Common-Salt, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
no more Thirſt than that does. But you are ſuch a Slave to
your Hypotheſis, that every ill Effect muſt needs be attributed to
an <hi>Alkali,</hi> even as far as to make Poyſons <hi>Mortiferous</hi> merely as
<hi>Alkalies;</hi> as you have Aſſerted in <hi>Arſenick.</hi> And I hear, alſo you
have the ſame Opinion in Animal Poyſons, as that of the Viper,
which if it be an <hi>Alkali,</hi> and therefore a Poyſon, I ſhou'd think,
a far more exalted one than <hi>Arſenick,</hi> and Damn'd one than <hi>Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,</hi>
performing its violent Effects in far leſs quantity. What ſay
you is it your Opinion?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ac.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, And for a farther Confirmation of my Doctrine of
<hi>Acids,</hi> you have the Cure of one Mr. <hi>Phillipſon,</hi> that ſhew'd a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of Rarities, who was Bitten by a Viper, and Cured in a
few Days by <hi>Acids:</hi> Which Cure, conſidering the Symptoms
(which were as ſevere as poſſible) I may without vanity ſay, There
has not been a more Extraordinary Cure wrought in ſo ſhort a time.
Now if the Poyſon of the Viper did conſiſt in a volatile <hi>Acid,</hi> as
ſome wou'd make us believe, How is it poſſible the Symptoms could
be taken off by giving <hi>Acids,</hi> and that in ſuch large quantities?
Nay, had it been <hi>Acid,</hi> it's reaſonable to think the Symptoms would
have been Aggravated. So in a Relation Dr. <hi>Stubbs</hi> gives a Perſon
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59081:54"/>
Bitten by an <hi>Adder,</hi> was Cured by the <hi>Mixtura ſiimplex</hi> a Noble
<hi>Acid.</hi> And <hi>Lemery</hi> in his <hi>Courſe of Chymiſtry,</hi> confeſſes, That
the Viper does more abound with Volatile <hi>(Alkalous)</hi> Salts, than
moſt other Creatures; by reaſon of the cloſeneſs of the <hi>Cutaneous</hi>
Pores hindering Preſpiration, and that their Poyſon conſiſts in
an Emiſſion of a very great quantity of Volatile-Salts at the time
of their being enrag'd. But then to ſquare with the Vulgar Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he tells us, Thoſe Volatile <hi>Alkalous</hi> Salts are inſtantaneouſly
at the time of their Emiſſion, during the time of the Viper's ſhort
Rage, turn'd into <hi>Acids</hi> of the moſt Volatile Nature; which is ſuch
<hi>Jargon,</hi> the Tranſmutation of Metals to thoſe that are its greateſt
Enemies, is a Jeſt to it. <hi>Charas</hi> alſo gives us an Account of a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Bitten at his Houſe, who after all the pother that he makes
about his Volatile Salt of Vipers, was Cured not without great
Hazard and Trouble, by the intermixture of many other Medicines
and thoſe even <hi>Acids,</hi> as <hi>Treacle</hi>-Water, <hi>Citrons;</hi> but thoſe <hi>Acids</hi>
could not be ſo effectual, by reaſon of the <hi>Alkalies</hi> given him.</p>

               <p>The Recovery of Mr. <hi>Phillipſon</hi> was not ſo ſpeedy, nor
what you did towards it ſo apparently Effectual, as to give you
juſt occaſion to Brag of ſo great a Cure: Nay, you cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
prove to your ſelf, or others, That what you did, did the
Cure, and that other things did nothing towards it; yea, or that
he would not have been well as ſoon, or ſooner without any of
your <hi>Acids.</hi> The Patient himſelf ſaid, He could not tell whether
he had any benefit by what you gave him. But I am ſure, had
he had ſome more proper Things, or even the Viper-Man for his
Doctor, he might have been well ſooner than he was. But let
us ſuppoſe the beſt we can of what you did, and take what you
borrow from Dr. <hi>Stubbs,</hi> and <hi>Charas</hi> together; you do not make
an Argument out of all ſufficient to make a Conſiderate Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the Poyſon of Vipers conſiſts in an <hi>Alkali.</hi> Suppoſe
you did do the Man ſome little good, and Dr. <hi>Stubb</hi>'s <hi>Mixtura
ſimplex</hi> were an <hi>Acid</hi> (which if it were that of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> I deny,
being but a <hi>Salſum)</hi> and <hi>Charas</hi>'s <hi>Alkalies,</hi> were not ſo ſoon Effectual
on the <hi>German;</hi> but wanting Patience and larger Doſes, they gave
ſome <hi>Acids,</hi> I ſay ſuppoſe that the <hi>Acids</hi> did ſome good, it will
not follow, That the Venom of Vipers is an <hi>Alkali.</hi> For if an
<hi>Acid</hi> has done ſome things towards the Cure of the Bite, in one
or two Caſes, you can't deny but that <hi>Alkalies</hi> have done it in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
For tho' in ſome Caſes <hi>Acids</hi> were uſed, they were not uſed
alone, and ſo could not certainly demand the Credit of the Cure.
But you have many Caſes, where the Volatile Salt uſed without
<hi>Acids</hi> Cured. Can it be ſuppos'd Volatile <hi>Alkali</hi> Salts did the
Cure, if the Poyſon were nothing but a Volatile <hi>Alkali?</hi> Or, did
you ever ſee any Volatile <hi>Alkali</hi> in ſo little (yea or in a large) quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59081:55"/>
put into a Wound, and produce ſuch dire Effects? No, the
Infuſion of Volatile <hi>Alkali</hi> in an Hundred times the quantity into
the Veins will not do it, or ſo much as cauſe a Diſorder. Can the
Poyſon of Vipers conſiſt in a Volatile <hi>Alkali,</hi> and their whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
abound therewith, and yet their Fleſh be wholſome Food? No
ſurely. Can the Poyſon of Vipers conſiſt in an <hi>Alkali,</hi> and yet
be Cured by an <hi>Alkali?</hi> And that even by an outward Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
As I my ſelf have ſeen in the following Experiments I ſome
Years ago was Aſſiſtant in the making of, at the Honourable
Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s, which were made upon Pullets and Pigeons, thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
We pluck'd the Feathers off the Breaſt of one of them, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Viper when he was enrag'd, we cauſed him to Bite; letting
the Fowl go, he Dy'd in three or four Hours. Then we took ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her
and caus'd him to be Bitten in like manner, by an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
Viper, and apply'd the Viper-Stone to the Wound, which
not only prevented Death, but all the dire Sypmtoms the other
Fowl Dy'd with; which Stone being taken off after ſome time,
the Wound was Healed by ordinary means. Now this Stone is
an <hi>Arid</hi>-Body, making an Efferveſcence with <hi>Acids,</hi> which could
not have ſuch great Effects in the Biting of Vipers, if the Poyſon
were an <hi>Alkali,</hi> and to be deſtroy'd by an <hi>Acid.</hi> But tho' the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Viper can't Rationally be thought to be an <hi>Alkali;</hi> yet
neither do I think this Poyſon conſiſts in an <hi>Acid.</hi> Thoſe Perſons
that have ventured to Taſte the Liquor in the Viper's Gums, tell
us nothing of any Acidity, or Alkalous Taſte, nor give us any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
to confirm their Opinion of its being an <hi>Acid.</hi> Nor do
we ſee ſuch Mortal Effects of ſo ſmall quantities of either <hi>Acid,</hi> or
<hi>Alkali</hi> in Wounds. But this Poyſon doubtleſs does conſiſt in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> than any of theſe manifeſt Qualities. The Ingenious
<hi>Lemery,</hi> I confeſs, is of the Opinion that the Poyſon, of the Viper
is an <hi>Acid;</hi> but he (nor no Mortal I believe) has any ſuch <hi>Jargon</hi>
as you falſly accuſe him of, who is a Man capable of Teaching you
<hi>Pharmacy</hi> this Seven Years yet. To ſhew how groſly you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed
him, I will recite his Words in this matter: I conceive, ſays
he, what they call the Venom of Vipers, conſiſts only in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of <hi>Acid</hi> Volatile Salts, which the Animal throws out when it
Bites, and theſe Salts paſſing into the Veins and Arteries, coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the Blood and hinder its Circulation, and the courſe of the
Animal Spirits, even as it happens when an <hi>Acid</hi> Liquor is Syring'd
into a Vein, which may be ſufficient to explicate all the Accidents
which happen upon the Biteing. And afterwards ſaies he, The
difference between the Effects of an <hi>Acid</hi> Liquor ſyring'd into the
Veins, and thoſe of the Venom of Vipers is this, an <hi>Acid</hi> Liquor
being immediaiely infus'd into a large Veſſel fixes all the Blood of
a ſudden, and cauſes ſtrong <hi>Convulſions,</hi> which are follow'd ſhortly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59081:55"/>
with Death: Whereas the <hi>Acid</hi> Salts that flow from the Viper
when he Bites, do not Work ſo quickly; their Acidity being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
not ſo ſtrong as that of an <hi>Acid</hi> Liquor, and have long pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſage
into the Maſs of Blood: And there's one Circumſtance, adds
he, which makes my Application ſtill more probable, That the
beſt Remedics uſed for ſuch as are Wounded by Vipers, are thoſe
that deſtroy <hi>Acids,</hi> and diſſolve the Coagulation of the Blood, as
Volatile <hi>Alkali</hi>-Salts drawn from Animals. But to underſtand this
more fully, continues he, it's fit to conſider ſeveral things, Firſt,
Vipers are more fill'd with Volatile Salts than other Animals, and
ſo not think it ſtrange that they throw out much of it in their
wrath. Secondly, Tho' theſe Salts turn <hi>Alkalies</hi> by Diſtillation,
they are <hi>Acids</hi> in their own Nature, before the Fire works upon
them, as I have ſaid when I ſpoke of the Principles. Thirdly, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
are covered with a cloſe compact Skin; ſo that the Salts they
contain do Circulate and Subtilize much better, and do Evaporate
leſs than other Animals. Fourthly, The ſhape of the Viper being
long, ſtraight, and round, like a ſmall Gun, the Salts they throw
out in the Biting are driven with much more violence, than if they
came from a more open place. Fifthly, The two long Teeth of
the Viper being ſtraight and ſharp, make deep Wounds, but which
ſhut up ſo quickly, the <hi>Acid</hi>-Salts which enter, have no paſſage to
come out. But it may be Objected farther, ſaies he, If the Venom
of Vipers proceed from their Volatile Salts, then the Salt of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
ſhou'd increaſe, rather than Cure the Malady. Anſwer, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
Salts which flow from Living Vipers, and enter the Fleſh by
the Bite, are very different from thoſe drawn by the Fire from
Dead ones, which are taken at the Mouth, the firſt are Naturally
pointed, <hi>Acid,</hi> and Coaglating; the others have been blunted by
the Fire, and rendred Poreous, are <hi>Alkalies,</hi> very Rarifying, or
Diſſolving, ſo are qualifyed to break and deſtroy the firſt. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
The Volatile Salt of Vipers taken at the Mouth, has another
determination then that which enters the Fleſh, and ſo produces
different Effect; not being forc'd in its Motion, ſpreads every where,
and diſſolves the Coagulum the other had made in the Blood. Thus
much I have Tranſcribed, not for the ſake of <hi>Lemery's</hi> Opinion,
ſeeing no ground to believe the Viper abounds with <hi>Acid</hi> Salts, but
out of love to Juſtice, that it may be ſeen how the Abuſer of all
his Betters, has abuſed this Author in particular. But I have one
thing more comes into my Mind to tell you of, Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> ſince we
are Talking of Wounding, which is that I have heard, you have
formerly Boaſted great Things in Chirurgery, and have Wrot a

the other External, which I did not think fit to make pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
But here lies my Misfortune common to all thoſe who make
new Diſcoveries; a great many believe the Truth of what I ſaid,
that my Medicines will perform what I promiſed; but amongſt
thoſe who believe matter of Fact, many ſay, This Man was not
the Author, others, that they have the ſame Medicines. I very
well know it's the Nature of moſt Men not to allow any Perſon the

                  </gap> Methods of Chirurgeons in the
Cure of Wounds, wherein they hinder and oppreſs Nature in her
regular Operations, let a Wound be made where it will, and how,
whether by Cutting, or Contuſion, it matters not, the Nutritious
juice is brought immediately to the extremities of the wounded
Veſſels. Now all the Medicines made uſe of in the common Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Chirurgery relax the divide Fibers, that they can't
retain the Nutritious Matter, but let it paſs into the Wound, where
by the ſame Medicines it's turned into the Subſtance commoly call'd

and the Fermenting Particles fret the Fibers, cauſe Inflmma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

only are occaſion'd all thoſe ill Symptoms that attend
Wounds) to which it's apply'd, or into which it's receiv'd. The
truth of which, the nature of a <hi>Feaver</hi> is ſufficient to confirm,
which is in the Terms of many great Men nothing but a <hi>Nixus Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae</hi>
to throw off its Enemy. And a Late Learned Author in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of Intermitting <hi>Feavers,</hi> the only Rational Piece in my Opinion
that ever was Writ upon that ſubject, plainly makes it appear, That
the Seat of <hi>Agues</hi> is in the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Brain, from whence at
certain Periods of time, the Matter is thrown off by the Nerves to
all the Parts of the Body, which cauſes the coldneſs; this Matter
afterwards received into the Blood by the Capillary Veins being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to it, puts it into a violent motion, which ceaſes
not till the matter is thrown off by the Pores. Now after the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons
have generated Matter (tho' many times inſtead thereof
they cauſe Mortifications) they then uſe mundifying Medicines,
and when Nature is oppreſſed, leave her to do her own work. This
is their practice in External Wounds, but what is to be expected
where the Lungs, Liver, Guts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are wounded? Here they own
their Medicines inſufficient, and if any ſo wounded chance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
they count it almoſt miraculous. But I leave it to every
Man's judgment which method is beſt to be confided in, either
that where ſcarce one in ten miſcarieth as in mine, or where
not one in ten recovers as in the Common Method of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons:
Beſides there remains another thing, that is when any large
Blood-Veſſel is wounded how to ſtop the Flux of the Blood
which they can't do without actual, or potential Cauteries, whoſe
inconveniences every body knows; and ſtrict bandage often cauſing
Mortifications. But the methods I uſe are ſhort and eaſie, thus; I
make a ſolution of my Powder in Water, or for want of it in
Urine, and ſqueeſe or inject with a Syring into the Wound if it
be deep, then cloſe the Wound, and if large, ſtich it up and lay
a Pledget upon it. If any large Artery be cut, I hold the Pledget
cloſe with my Hand till the Flux of Blood ceaſes which will be
in a ſmall time; then bind it on with an eaſie ligature, and give
my Tincture in Wine. Now to prove my Medicines agreeable to
the nature of Humane Bodies, and of that Juice by which I conjecture
the Body is nouriſhed, and more efficacious than the Medicines uſed
by Chirurgeons, the following Arguments will evince. 1. They
never cauſe Pain unleſs juſt at the Application, and that very little
more than would be cauſed by-Spring Water. 2. No Pain after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
3. If there has been Pain before, it has been taken off in
a ſhort time. 4. There has never been any <hi>Feavers</hi> be the Wound
external or internal. 5. All inciſed Wounds are cured if timely
uſed in a few days time, without Suppuration: Gun-ſhot Wounds
in fleſhy parts are cured after the ſame manner, only require longer
time. And by my Medicines moſt wounds within the Cavity of
the Body may be cured with all the eaſe imaginable. For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

               <p>Hold Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> let your Experiments alone now, you
may tell them to the Phyſicians and Chirurgeons that were in
<hi>Flanders</hi> with you, and ſaw them made. <hi>Seeing is believing,</hi> they
ſay: But I who have not ſeen ſhall hardly believe you did any
Miracles, or that all contain'd in your <hi>Novum Lumen Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi>
is true. Becauſe I know your pair of Medicines, not capable
to perfom ſuch Wonders: The very appearance of which <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nums,</hi>
is enough to Extinguiſh your <hi>Novum Lumen,</hi> Your Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59081:57"/>
of the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> as you falſly and fooliſhly call your
Internal Medicine, and your Powder, are not your Invention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but Originally <hi>Rebel</hi>'s, I might ſay, every Bodies: The one
being nothing but Spirit of <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Dantzick Vitriol</hi> Twelve
Parts mix'd with Spirit of Wine Eight Parts: And the other
nothing but <hi>Roman Vitriol</hi> Calcin'd to Whiteneſs, which you
Colour'd with a little Dragon's Blood: And we know how you
come by theſe Secrets: Theſe are the great Medicines you
would ſo fain ſteal the Honour of being thought the Inventer oft<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Theſe are your fire-new Medicines! The Birth of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains!
And leaſt you ſhou'd deny this (being given to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty)
any one that underſtands any thing of Chymiſtry, may
know your Tincture (as you call it) if not by Sight and Taſte,
by bare Diſtillation. And as for your Powder, let them Diſſolve
it in Water, the Dragon's-Blood (if you ſtill Colour it) will
not Diſſolve, but may be ſeparated, and put upon a hot Plate,
is known by the Smell: Let them put ſome Urinous Spirit to
the Powder, it will preſently diſcover the <hi>Copper</hi> by its Blew
Colour, and every Body knows by the Taſte, that it's a <hi>Vitriol.</hi>
And now let People judg, whether a little <hi>Roman Vitriol</hi> be ſo
ſtrange a Diſcovery beyond all hitherto known in Chirurgery? Or
whether all Chirurgeons have been ignorant thereof? Whether
<hi>Vitriol</hi> will Cure all Curable Wounds inwardly, and outwardly,
with more ſpeed and ſafety than any thing elſe? If it would, there
are better <hi>Vitriols</hi> to be had than this you falſly call, your Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Whether <hi>Copper</hi> Corroded by an <hi>Acid,</hi> with its fretting
Aſtringency be likely to Cure all ſorts of Wounds without Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration,
and yet is the beſt Digeſtive in the World. This is
like <hi>Acids</hi> making Thick, Thin, Purging, Vomiting, Binding,
Looſening, and every thing; becauſe it is <hi>Acid,</hi> and you are in
love with it. <hi>Roman Vitriol</hi> Digeſts, yet hinders Digeſtion; but
only while a Secret in Mr. <hi>Acid</hi>'s Hand, if you can believe him.

Anſwer, Your Digeſtion-hindering Digeſtive as well as others,
and the reſt of the Things you cry out againſt, may be Injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Procraſtinate Cure, where Fools or Knaves act inſtead
of Chirurgions: But in the Hands of Experienced Artiſts,
all theſe are neceſſary ſometimes; but when, and where, you
are not a capable Judg. Let a Wound be made where, and
how it matters not, ſay you. Here you ſhew your Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
for Chirurgeons to Laugh at: They well know the
place and manner of the Wound, much alters the Indications of
Cure. That all the Medicines made uſe of in the common Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods

before ever Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> was heard of, I my ſelf have healed
Wounds, and that in the Joynts, without Pain, Soreneſs or
Corruption, by Medicines that might be taken inwardly in
conſiderable Doſes. But <hi>Roman Vitriol,</hi> or any ſort of Corroſion
of Copper with common <hi>Acids</hi> will cauſe Pain, and Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Wounds, and thence <hi>Feavers.</hi> Let any body try it
on himſelf, and he will be ſatisfied. Now what will cauſe
Pains and <hi>Feavers,</hi> muſt needs be of a Heterogeneous Nature,
and I <hi>poſitively believe,</hi> that it was from your Medicine, that your
Patients in <hi>Flanders</hi> had ſo many ill Symptoms. Nature ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
tho' in vain to caſt out the extraneous body of Corroded
Copper, far more miſchievous than Lead or Iron, with which
Soldiers more mercifully wound one another. That a <hi>Feaver</hi> is
<hi>Nixus Naturae</hi> to throw off its enemy might perhaps be believed
as a great fancy of Great Men, if they could tell us who <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
is. The Late Learned Author of the Treatiſe of Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Feavers,</hi> if what you ſay be true, ſeems to be a Man of
great Brain, and the Seat of <hi>Agues</hi> by him diſcover'd, a Witty
Invention: I wiſh you had named him, that I might have ſeen
alſo what he makes the matter of theſe <hi>Feavers.</hi> I fancy they
muſt be Maggots, who every time they diſcharge their Bellies
after repaſt, drop down their Excrements through the Nerves,
which being of an <hi>Alkalous</hi> Nature diſolved in the <hi>aqucous</hi> Vehicle
of the <hi>Succus Nervoſus</hi> cauſes cold, but being received into the
Blood, and Heterogeneous to its <hi>Acid,</hi> cauſes a Fermentation and
Heat, till the Excrementitious <hi>Alkali</hi> is caſt out by the Pores.
But as for the Chirurgeons when they have generated Matter;
then, for want of <hi>Roman Vitriol</hi> they mundifie, and ſo leave Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
oppreſſed. <hi>Roman Vitriol</hi> prevents all, and helps all, but I
believe Mr. <hi>Acid</hi>'s direction, I would ſay his Word is the chief
thing in the buſineſs. Another Man uſing it will do or tell of
no Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>acles. But what is to be expected in the Wounds of the
Lungs, Liver, Guts? Why here a recovery is counted a Miracle
by the Ignorant Chirurgeons, who know nothing of the new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
<hi>Roman Vitriol.</hi> But let any Man judg which method is
beſt, that which depends upon <hi>Roman Vitriol</hi> alone, uſed alike
in all differences of Wonds, or that which relies on all ſorts of
Medicines in the Hands of Artiſts: Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> ſays in the firſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
not one in ten miſcaries, in the laſt not one in ten reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
I muſt tell you Sir, you have not proved by <hi>Evident and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59081:58"/>
well atteſted Experiments,</hi> you ever cured any one Wounded in
thoſe Parts; ſo far are you from curing Nine in Ten. If you
could have done what you pretended, I can never believe you
would have left your famous Practice. As for ſtopping of Blood,
you know well where your <hi>Vitriol</hi> has failed, but let any one that
has a mind to be ſatisfied of its Vertue try it. But you abuſe
others to ſay, they can't ſtop Blood without actual or potential
Cauteries Actual Cauteries are ſeldom uſed, or any potential
greater than calcined <hi>Roman Vitriol.</hi> But we know better things,
Medicines that may be taken inwardly, they are ſo mild and
wholſom, that will ſtop Blood with much more eaſe, ſpeed ſafety,
and heal far better when that is done, than your calcin'd <hi>Vitriol;</hi>
tho' we never thought fit to Quack with them. Beſides every
Chirurgeon who deſerves the Name, can ſtop Blood in many
caſes without any Medicines at all. That your Medicines are as
agreeing to the Nature of Human Bodies, and the juice by which
they are nouriſhed as Copper is to Fleſh, and Oyl of <hi>Vitriol</hi> to
Blood; I readily grant, but that they are indeed friendly, your
Practice has not proved, we have only your bare Aſſertions,
ask the Marqueſs of <hi>Carmarthen</hi> elſe. That your <hi>Vitriol</hi> never
cauſes much more Pain than Spring-Water in the Application,
nor any afterwards, takes off former Pain in a little time, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
no <hi>Feaver,</hi> Cures all inciſed Wounds in a few days without

whoever will try how ſweet. Secondly, Why durſt you not go
into <hi>Flanders</hi> again? And why did you quit your pretenſions to
Chirurgery, and take another method of Quacking; leaving
your firſt new Light, to go out like an <hi>Ignis Fatui,</hi> and rub your
Cat for another, You began to ſee at the Seige of <hi>Namur,</hi> that
your Chirurgical ſham would not take, and therefore had <hi>ſome
reaſon</hi> for another <hi>Eſſay.</hi> You found the Practice of Chirurgery
too plain, and ſenſible a work to deceive Mankind in. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
part of Medicine is more abſtruſe, and you may tell Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
they have a Fire in their Hearts, which is fed by <hi>Acids,</hi> long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

you would fain be thought, and a Light to the World;
but I don't Queſtion, but by that time what has been ſaid, is well
conſider'd, you will ſee your ſelf but a falling Star, which appears
but in a very little part of his Paſſage to the Earth. And now Mr.
<hi>Acid</hi> you may go home and think: And if poſſibly you can be
perſwaded to become Conſiderate and Modeſt, and what you have
Fooliſhly ſaid, and done can yet be retriev'd, you will acknowledg
me, as I am, no Enemy, but a Friend; tho' I have blunted the
