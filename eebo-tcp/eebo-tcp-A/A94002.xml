            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE STRANGE MONSTER OR News from Nottingham-ſhire.</head>
            <p>THat Monſters and Prodigious births have been frequent in each Age none that are wiſe will deny though ſome are ſuch nullifidians as not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing which they do not ſee with their own eyes, and ſuch perſons we may perceive are the moſt eaſy to be deceived in any thing they ſee which is above their vulger apprehenſion; thus when they ſee thoſe whom we call Juglers or <hi>Hocus Pocus</hi> do rare feats by ſlight of hand, they preſently count it <hi>Witch-craft</hi> or <hi>conjuration,</hi> nor can they by any Arguments be beaten out of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; like the ſilly <hi>Indians</hi> who when they had heard ſome <hi>Europians</hi> to play on Bag-pipes, would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded but that they were living Creatures, nay though
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:154079:3"/>
they were permitted to touch and handle them, others wonder as much at things which come by the courſe of Nature, as the change of the Moon the Tides, &amp;c. theſe are thus ſet forth by the Poet,</p>
            <q>
               <l>The vulgar ſort too much unconſtant be</l>
               <l>Nothing ſeems ſtrange to them but conſtancy.</l>
            </q>
            <p>This which we are about to relate is a thing well known for truth and atteſted by ſeveral perſons of quality, and which in ſhort (that I may not detain you too long with a preludium) was as followeth.</p>
            <p>At a place called <hi>Graſly</hi> in <hi>Nottingham-ſhire,</hi> three miles from the Town of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> about the latter end of <hi>April</hi> laſt, this preſent year of our Lord one thouſand ſix hundred ſixty and eight. A certain woman an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of that place fell in Travail, and after three days ſpace of time, (in which interim ſhe indured great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and exceſſive pangs not to be utter'd, and can only be expreſſed by imagination) at laſt ſhe was delivered of a moſt ſtrange and uncouth Monſter, to the great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and aſtoniſhment of all the beholders then preſent; for it was quite different from all other Children, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in theſe ſix ſeveral reſpects.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt its head was long and ſharp, proportioned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the faſhion of a Sugar loaf, quite contrary to other peoples heads which are round and circular, except a ſort of people we read of who live next to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulph which people when their Children are very young bind
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:154079:3"/>
their heads ſtrait with ſplinters, and ſo continuing it by degrees make it ſo mallable that it grows in the ſhape of a Sugar-loaf, which they take to be a very great grace unto them, and an adding much to the perfection of their beauty.</p>
            <p>2. In the Second place it had no Noſe at all, which all people account a comely Noſe to be the greateſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the face, and ſo by the rules of contraryes the want thereof muſt needs be the greateſt deformity.</p>
            <p>3. The third circumſtance wherein it was remarkable, was that it had eyes like a fiſh, nothing comparable to thoſe of other Children.</p>
            <p>4 It had eight fingers upon each hand, but that vvhich was moſt admirable, was that each finger was interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the other with plates of fleſh, and grew together like the feet of a Gooſe.</p>
            <p>5. It had two Ears long and ponderous, hanging down like to the Ears of a Hound.</p>
            <p>6. And Laſtly, all along down the Back of it was long black hair quite contrary to humane Nature.</p>
            <p>The birth of this Child was a great aſtoniſhment to all the Women there preſent, who beheld the ſame with much admiration, amongſt others then preſent was the Wife of one Mr. <hi>J.</hi> a ſilk ſtocking Weaver of the ſame Town, who related all the circumſtances thereof to her Husband, which he communicated to ſome of his friends in <hi>London,</hi> with a deſire the ſame ſhould be committed to the Preſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:154079:4"/>Now that ſuch like things have been frequent in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, we could inſtance in ſeveral examples, how that the womb hath been fruitful of prodigious births, as well as ſuch which have been the ordinary production of nature.</p>
            <p>To begin firſt with <hi>Margaret</hi> ſiſter to <hi>Floris</hi> the fourth Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> this Lady had three hundred ſixty five Children at one birth, juſt ſo many as there are days in the year; they were about the bigneſs of Mice, being half Males, half Females, and the odde one an Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrodite; They were Chriſtned by the Biſhop of that place in two Baſons, the males named <hi>John,</hi> the females <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Baſons are ſtill hanged up in the Church as a teſtimonial to poſterity of the truth of the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>But we ſhall not need to inſtance Forraign Countries our own Iſland can furniſh us with plentiful examples of the ſame nature, of which we ſhall relate ſome few, as we finde them recorded in our Engliſh Chronicles</p>
            <p>In the time of King <hi>John,</hi> ar <hi>Maidſtone</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Monſter was born, which Monſter had a head like an Aſs, a belly like a man, and all other parts much differing from any other Creature.</p>
            <p>In King <hi>Henry</hi> the thirds time a Child was born in the Iſle of Wight who at eighteen years old was ſcarce three foot high, and therefore brought to the Queen, who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him about with her as a monſter in nature.</p>

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:154079:6"/>In his time alſo a Childe was born in <hi>Kent</hi> who at two years old cured all diſeaſes, which childe I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not as a Monſter, but rather as a Miracle in nature.</p>
            <p>In the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth were very many prodigious births, as you may read in <hi>Stows</hi> Annals, and Sir <hi>Richard Bakers</hi> Chronicle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> the third in the ſixth year of the reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth at <hi>Middleton Stony</hi> eleven miles from <hi>Oxford</hi> a woman brought forth a Childe which had two perfect bodies from the Navell upwards, the legs for both the bodies grew out at the midſt where the bodies joyned, and had but one iſſue for the excrements of them both; they lived eighteen days and were women Children.</p>
            <p>In the third year of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> a man Childe was born at <hi>Chicheſter</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> having Arms and Legs like to an Anatomy, the breaſt and belly mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous big, about the neck a great coller of fleſh and skin, growing like the ruffe of a ſhirt.</p>
            <p>In the twenty third of her reign, at the Town of <hi>Walſham</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> a Childe of eleven years old named <hi>William Withers</hi> lay in a trance for the ſpace of ten days without any ſuſtenance; and at the laſt coming to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he uttered to the ſtanders by many ſtrange ſpeeches, enveighing againſt pride covetouſneſs, coldneſs of charity and other enormous crimes, which though I report not as of a Monſter, yet may it be recorded for a great wonder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:154079:7"/>
               <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1613. The eighth year of the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> on the 17 of <hi>April</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Standiſh</hi> in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire,</hi> a Maiden Child was born, having four Legs, four Arms, two Bellies joyned to one Back, one Head with two Faces, the one before, the other behind, like the picture of <hi>Janus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will conclude all with a later example of one here in <hi>London,</hi> who in theſe late times of Libertiſm, when the different opinions of Religion made many to be of no Religion, he at that time (ſeeing ſuch a confuſion of ſects among thoſe who called themſelves Chriſtians) turned Jew, refuſing according to the Levitical Law, to taſte of any Swines fleſh, it pleaſed God not long after he had a Child born with Hair and Briſtles like to a Hog; which wrought ſo upon him, that he ſoon after altered his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, turned Chriſtian; and (as I hear) is now a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herer to the Romiſh perſwaſion.</p>
            <p>Many other examples could we produce, but theſe we think may be ſufficient for this purpoſe; I ſhall only add this, that the Reader will not look with the ſame eyes (as the Fanaticks do) upon ſuch monſtrous births, accounting them Prodigies, and certain Foretellers of great miſchiefs infallibly to enſue, ſince we ſee that all ages have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the like or more ſtrange births, but let every one la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to break off his own ſins by repentance, and then we ſhall not need to fear any calamity which ſuch prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious births may ſeem to ſignifie.</p>
