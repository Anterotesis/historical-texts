            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and have their riſe from

when I can love my wife, my

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61215:7"/>

both direct and limit him;

the conſcience of a lawful

grief, and what ever other
affection; for we cannot derive
our joy from God, if we place
it upon any ſinful thing, or
if we exceed in the meaſure of
things allowed; we cannot
fetch our fear from Heaven,
if it be cowardly, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,

It is not from the root, that

it; neither is it here by any

               <p>It is a feeling and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
expreſſion that the
Apoſtle gives of a Chriſtian,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 18.</note>
That <hi>he looks not on the things
which are ſeen;</hi> not that his
eyes are ſo dim as old <hi>Iſaacs,</hi>
that he cannot diſcern them,
or that his inward ſenſes are
ſo ſtupified, that he cannot
judg of their true value: but
that, taking an exact view of
theſe earthly things, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries
ſo much vanity in them,
as that he findes them not
worthy to be lookt at with
the full bent of his deſires;
like as it is not the meer ſight
of a ſtrange beauty that is
forbidden (for a man may as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61215:17"/>
well look upon a fair face, as
upon a good picture) but a
ſetled and fixed aſpect, that
feeds the eye, and draws the
heart to a ſinful concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence:
Thus doth not the
Chriſtian look upon the
things that are ſeen, as making
them the full ſcope, and aym
of his deſires and affections:
So far he takes notice of
them, as to make his beſt
(that is, lawful and moderate)
uſe of them; not ſo, as to
make them the chief object
of his contemplation, the
main drift of his cares. It is
well obſerved by S. <hi>Baſil,</hi>
that as there are two contrary
ways, the broad, and the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
ſo there are two guides,
as contrary, <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Faith:
Senſe</hi> preſents to us the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61215:18"/>
delights of this world,
on the one ſide; on the other,
the preſent afflictions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions
that attend a good
profeſſion: <hi>Faith</hi> lays before
us the glorious things of a
future life, and the endleſs
miſeries and torments abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for ſinful ſouls in the
world to come: Now, it is not
for every one to deny al credit
to his ſenſe, alluring him with
all preſent, and viſible plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and diſcouraging him
with the terror &amp; pain of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and viſible afflictions, and
to yield himſelf hood-winkt,
to be led by Faith, forepromi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
onely better things afar
off, and foreadmoniſhing him
of dangers, future and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Faith onely is that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical
vertue, which makes a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61215:18"/>
man with an holy contempt
to overlook all the pleaſing
baits of the world, and with
a brave courage and fortitude
to deſpiſe all the menaces,
and painful inflictions of his
preſent fury: This works our
eyes, not to look upon the
things which we cannot but
ſee, the preſent ſhews of the
world, whether alluring, or
terrifying: Had <hi>Lot</hi> but lookt
back on <hi>Sodom;</hi> the pleaſant
plain of <hi>Sodom,</hi> that lay like
the Garden of God behinde
his back, he had never eſcaped
into the mountain: Had the
glorious <hi>Protomartyr</hi> fixed his
eyes onely upon his perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
his heart could not but
have failed, to ſee the fire in
their faces, the ſparkling of
their eyes, the grinding of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61215:19"/>
their teeth, the bending of
their brows, the ſtopping of
their ears, their furious run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon him, their violent
halings and draggings; and
laſtly, a whole volly of ſtones
diſcharged mortally upon
him; he had been utterly
daunted with ſuch an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity
of death: But he, as
not ſeeing any of this pomp,
and oſtentation of horror,
looks up ſtedfaſtly to Heaven,
and there ſees (that which
might well make him blinde
to all other viſible objects)
the Heavens open, and Jeſus
ſtanding at the right hand of
God; and upon this ſight, he
ſhut up his eyes, and ſlept.
The true Chriſtian then, hath
with holy <hi>Job,</hi> made a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with his eyes, not to look
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61215:19"/>
upon, either the cruel inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the raging world with
fear and dejectedneſs, or on
the tempting vanities of the
world with amorous glances;
but with a ſober and conſtant
reſolution entertains the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of both kindes. Very
juſtly did <hi>Tertullian</hi> jeer that
Heathen Philoſopher, who
pulled out his eyes to avoyd
concupiſcence; and can tell
him, that a Chriſtian can hold
his eyes, and yet behold Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
unbewitched; and can be at
once open-eyed to nature, and
blinde to luſt: and what the
Apoſtle ſaid of the Uſe, he
can practiſe of the ſight of the
world, and earthly objects; he
can ſo behold them, as if he
beheld them not. How oft
have we, in a deep ſtudy fixed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61215:20"/>
our eyes upon that, which we,
the while thought not upon,
neither perceived that we
ſaw? So doth the Chriſtian

                  <hi>Aaron</hi> had made

not ſo much in that they were

that they were enwrapped in

we are guilty to our ſelves of
our Spiritual deformity: As
then we are bodily naked,

from the eye: if we have

nothing of ours is ſeen, but
Chriſt is all in all, to us; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

<hi>David</hi> went out, as one that
would have the ſorrow of his

this apparel of ours do but
keep us from a blaſt, or a
ſhowre? it is ſo far from
ſafeguarding the ſoul, that it
many times wounds it, and
that to the death. It was one
of the main quarrels againſt
the rich glutton, that he was
every day clothed in purple,
and byſs: How many ſouls

bodies had been ever either
naked,<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 19.</note> or clad with hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth?

done, we are (it may be) no

unhandſome creatures, and
contemptible in thoſe eyes
from whom we deſired moſt
approbation; <hi>Jezebel,</hi> for all

we can not wear, and not be

we cannot ask. The dumb

yea laſtly, which is the great

he gives us againſt our asking;
our ignorance ſues againſt our

things, he will not ſuffer our

God will not own this latter;

               <p>True knowledg cauſeth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
and deſire; For the will
follows the underſtanding;
whatſoever that apprehends
to be good for us, the affective
part inclines to it: No man
can have any regard to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
good: If an hungry
man did not know that food
would refreſh and nouriſh
him, or the thirſty that drink
would ſatisfie him, or the
naked that fire would warm
him, or the ſick that Phyſick
would recover him; none of
theſe would affect theſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors:
And according to our
apprehenſion of the goodneſs
and uſe of theſe helps, ſo is
our appetite towards them:
For the object of the will is a
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:61215:129"/>
known good, either true, or
appearing ſo: And if our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
can tell us of ſome
that can ſay, with her in the
Poet; I ſee and approve bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
things, but follow the
worſe: It is not for that evil,
as evil, (much leſs as worſe)
can fall into the will; but,
that their appetite over-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
them to a miſconceit of a
particular good; ſo as, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
in a generality, they
do confuſedly aſſent to the
goodneſs of ſome holy act, or
object, yet upon the preſent
occaſion, (here and now, as the
School ſpeaketh) their ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
appetite hath prevailed to
draw them to a perſwaſion,
that this pleaſure, or that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
is worthy to be imbraced:
Like as our firſt parents had a
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:61215:129"/>
general apprehenſion that it
was good to obey all the
commands of their Creator;
but when it came to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
fruit; now their eye,
and their ear, and their heart
tell them, it is good for them,
both for pleaſure, and for the
gain of knowledg, to taſte of
that forbidden tree: So then,
the miſcarriage is not in that
they affect that which they
think not to be good; but in
that they think that to be
good which is not; for alaſs,
for one true good there are
many ſeeming, which delude
the ſoul with a fair ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance:
As a man in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
eſteems ſilver above
braſs, but when he meets
with a ruſty piece of ſilver,
and a cleer piece of braſs, he
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:61215:130"/>
chooſes rather the clear braſs
then the ſilver defaced with
ruſt: Surely, it is our ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
that is guilty of our
cool neglect of our ſpiritual
good; if we did know how
ſweet the Lord is, in his ſure
promiſes, in his unfailing
mercies, we could not but
long after him, and remain
unſatisfied till we finde him
ours: would God be pleaſed

for as it puffes up a man above

not they, then, the ſame God;

Can they imagine it leſs then
inſolent to attribute more to
their own private opinion,
then to the conſtant judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

ſucceſſions of Generations?
Can they ſuppoſe themſelves
in their ſingle capacity

(though neither Prophets,

Surely, if the hand of pride

never deſire to be acquainted

as they ſeem, thou ſeeſt them

hid from the eyes of men, all
things lie open and diſplaid

baffled at home; <hi>The heart of
man is deceitful above all

None but thoſe piercing eyes
of thine can diſcover all the
windings and turnings of that
intricate piece. What would
it avail me, O Lord, to mock
the eyes of all the world with
a ſemblance of holineſs, whilſt
thou ſhouldſt ſee me falſe and
filthy? Should I be cenſured
by a world of men, when I
am ſecretly allowed by thee,
I could contemn it, yea glory
in their unjuſt reproach; But

open, and diſſect this cloſe
heart of mine; ſearch every

and if thou findeſt any ill
blood there, let it out; and if
thou findeſt any hollowneſs,
fill it up; and ſo work upon it,
that it may be approved of
