            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat hath introduced the Cuſtom, I cannot tell, whether the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Favour and Indulgence that Drammatique Poetry hath found amongſt perſons of the greateſt Wit and Honour; or the over-much Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of thoſe of our Scribling Tribe, who are willing to aſſume to our ſelves the utmoſt liberty any will give us, or we can with any modeſty pretend to; But ſo it is, that of late, nothing of this kind, though never ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, appears in Publique, without ſome Great and Illuſtrious Name fixt before it; like a Gigantique Statue at the Portal of
<pb facs="tcp:48255:3"/>
ſome trirling Building; Whether they deſign by it, that the mighty Name to whom their little Follies are conſecrated, ſhould like the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of Saints, work Miracles on the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Critiques of our Age, make 'um diſtruſt their own underſtandings, and have an Impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Faith in every little Prieſt of <hi>Apollo,</hi> I cannot reſolve; But ſince it is grown a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, I ſhall not be ſo much a <hi>Fanatick</hi> as not to conform to it; or rather ſhall approve my ſelf one, in Conforming to a Cuſtome againſt my Judgement, for intereſt ſake; None of my Fraternity ever having more occaſion to creep under the ſhelter of ſome Noble Patronage than my ſelf. For, firſt, <hi>(my Lord)</hi> this unworthy Poem, which I humbly proſtrate here at your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> feet, was the Off-ſpring of many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, raw, indigeſted and Immature thoughts, pen'd in a crow'd and hurry of buſineſs and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; interrupted and diſorder'd by many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate, not to ſay inſolent affairs, of a quite different nature; and laſtly, the firſt-born of this kind that my thoughts ever laboured with to perfection. And though I will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb facs="tcp:48255:3"/>
here to reflect any thing upon Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whoſe uſual misfortune is (if the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome be true) not to inherit all the Wit, as well as all the Eſtate, but leave that as a thread-bare portion to the Cadels; yet I will be bold to affirm it true in theſe matters; and I think the experience of all that ever attempted any thing in this kind will ſecond me. The firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born of ſome moſt Florid, and after moſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful wits, having been ſo rude and unſhapen, as that they have been kept like witleſs Elder Brothers, out of company, for fear of ſhaming their Parents. And though others have been more fortunate in their early Productions, yet few but have had thoſe Slips from their Prune, which their riper thoughts either were, or at leaſt had reaſon to be aſhamed of. And now <hi>(my Lord)</hi> I have told you the faults of this Play, give me leave alſo to tell you the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of it (for thoſe two commonly go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.) It had the misfortune to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world in a time, when the Dog-ſtar was near his Reign, and my Judges ſat in a hot Bath, rather than a Theatre, and were doubly
<pb facs="tcp:48255:4"/>
perſecuted, by the heat of the weather, and the impertinence of the Poet; and which was the worſt miſhap; when the moſt candid, as well as the moſt Illuſtrious Judges (I mean the Court) were abſent, and (excepting the preſence of ſome Great and Noble perſons) this unhappy Poem left (for the moſt part) to the mercy of a common Audience; in which unguarded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition it might well expect to receive ſome wounds, and ſo it did; though much fewer than either I expected, yet ſuch, as it deſerved; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will ſurvive or no, I know not, nor am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at; if it will not, then it gives me good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to Apologize for this Dedcaition, and to tell <hi>your Lordſhip,</hi> that it receiving its firſt Life and Being in the World from <hi>your Lordſhips</hi> favour, and now dying in the corporeal part of it, <hi>(I</hi> mean the action) the Spiritual and Survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving part of it, ought like its Parent the Soul, <hi>to return to him that gave it.</hi> And if <hi>I</hi> may have leave from our rigid Religioniſts, to proſecute the Metaphor, as in that abſtracted State, the Soul is infinitely more happy han in any it could attain to whilſt immerſed in fleſh &amp; blood; ſo <hi>(my Lord)</hi> to have any the leaſt reſidence in
<pb facs="tcp:48255:4"/>
               <hi>your Lordſhips</hi> thoughts, will be a ſtate of more felicity and honour, than any this Poem, whilſt embodied in action, could arrive to by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate or general Applauſe of the Wits of the World. But now <hi>I</hi> am fallen upon the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of <hi>your Lordſhip, I</hi> am plunged me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks into a vaſt Ocean, where <hi>I</hi> have nothing to determinate my ſight, but a bright and Serene Sky full of light, at a vaſt diſtance from me, and as vaſt a height above me, and no ſhore but that from whence I came, and to which <hi>I</hi> muſt retire again, to take a ſafe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant proſpect of that which <hi>I</hi> can neither fathom, nor deſcribe. It is indeed the common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Dedications, to ſtuff their Epiſtles full of <hi>Panegyricks,</hi> not perhaps ſo much to deſcribe their Patrons, who ſometimes are as obſcure as themſelves, as to ſhew their own skill in writing Characters and Eſſayes: But the caſe is not the ſame with me; and what may be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable enough with them, would be abſurd in me; and I ſhould fall into the impertinence of thoſe that would write large Encomiums on the Sun, who certainly commends himſelf to us by his own light and influence, much better than any man can do by his wit. Not ſo ſay any thing
<pb facs="tcp:48255:5"/>
               <hi>(my Lord)</hi> of the Souldier, and Stateſman in you, which have rendred you both Known and Famous to all the valiant and politique part of Mankind; that of your Poetry is a large Theme, in which perhaps I could expatiate with more ſucceſs than on any of the former; yet I ſhall not dare to do it for want of Art; and if I could take <hi>your Lordſhips</hi> heighth, I ſhould but diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the vaſt diſtance <hi>I</hi> am ſcituate in from ſo bright an Orb; as Navigators that take the heighth of the Sun, only to find what Degree of Latitude themſelves are in. If there be any part of the World ſo obſcure as not to have heard <hi>your Lordſhips</hi> Fame in that, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpects, <hi>I</hi> ſhall refer them to a Character of <hi>your Lordſhip;</hi> not to the praiſes and applauſes of the world in general, nor the <hi>Panegyricks</hi> of leſſer Pens, which have alwayes waited on the Tryumphs of yours, as the common Souldiers in the <hi>Roman Tryumphs did on their Generals;</hi> but to the incomparable iſſues of your own thoughts, wherein they will ſee not only a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>your Lordſhip,</hi> but of the preſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd Genius of <hi>England,</hi> which by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>your Lordſhip,</hi> and many Sublime Wits in other Arts, begins to be as famous in
<pb facs="tcp:48255:5"/>
Arts, <hi>as formerly it was in Arms;</hi> witneſſe thoſe new Academies and Societies Erected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſtus for <hi>Philoſophical Commerce,</hi> and the improvement of <hi>Language, Wit, and Arts;</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities which Forreigne Vertuoſoes would have engroſſed to themſelves, and till of late de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to be the native growth of this (now in all reſpects) moſt happy, and moſt fertile Iſland. It is from <hi>your Lordſhips</hi> Pen, that <hi>Solyman</hi> may be truly ſtiled Magnificent, and you have made him ſucceed to the Civility and Gallantry of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as well as to their <hi>Empire;</hi> nor was <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtapha</hi> ever ſo much the hopes of his <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nation,</hi> as in his Image and the generous Character you have given him, <hi>he is the delight of England,</hi> who weep the Fate, not of <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> but of Murder'd Vertue. And indeed what Pen but <hi>your Lordſhips</hi> could have refined and ſoftned a Story ſo Barbarous, and made a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo remote from Friendſhip, Honour, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, walk diſguiſed in the Higheſt Characters of them all? It is <hi>your Lordſhips</hi> Pen that hath aſſiſted <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth in a ſecond conqueſt of <hi>France,</hi> and in the nobleſt Characters of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Love, and Friendſhip, hath made the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wit and Language as tryumphant as
<pb facs="tcp:48255:6"/>
their Arms: nor could a ſtory acted with ſo much glory and ſucceſs, be attempted by any Pen beneath <hi>your Lordſhip's.</hi> In fine, it is <hi>your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> that hath Charmed up the Ghoſts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Noble <hi>Heroes,</hi> who otherwiſe would have lain unlamented in their Tombs; And they have walked on the Stage in Brighter Shapes than ever they lived, and have been conducted to their Fates, with more ſorrow of the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, then perhaps they had when they dyed. And all this <hi>your Lordſhip</hi> hath done, not in the pleaſure of Shade, Eaſe, and Retirement, and with the Advantages and Aſſiſtances that meaner Spirits are forced to make uſe of for their Compoſitions; but they are only the Sallyes of your Pen, and that during the uneaſie intervals which pain ſometimes borrows from State Affairs; and what a fit of the Gout ſnatches from the uſe and benefit, <hi>your Lordſhip</hi> takes care to employ to the delight and pleaſure of the World; and if <hi>your Lordſhip</hi> can do all this, upon the rack of pain, and with ſome glances of your thoughts, whil'ſt the reſt like ſcattered Rayes of Light, are diſperſed on various Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; what would you do with all the Freedom and Eaſe of other men, and with the united
<pb facs="tcp:48255:6"/>
force of your Soul? But I am ſinking again out of my depth, and muſt retreat once more to that ſhore from whence I am inſenſibly wandred; I mean <hi>(my Lord)</hi> to the conſideration of my ſelf, and of this worthleſs Preſent which I make to <hi>your Lordſhip:</hi> Which <hi>(my Lord)</hi> I cannot but look with much contempt upon, as being conſcious to my ſelf, in what haſt and confuſion it was compoſed, and of what <hi>ex-tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> thoughts the greateſt part of it conſiſts: Nor ſhould I have preſumed to have uſher'd it into the world, under ſo great a Patronage, had not I firſt obtained your leave. And now I hope <hi>your Lordſhip,</hi> that at the hearing of it whil'ſt it was in looſe ſheets, was pleaſed to forgive the faults of the Poem, will now in this addreſs pardon thoſe of the Author, whoſe chief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is not to gain the name of Poet, Author, Wit, or Critick, but that of</p>
