         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>YOu know (good Reader) if a man have a pretious
Iewel, hee will bee exceeding carefull to keep it from
any tash. True religion is more pretious then the most
pretious jewel, it should be the breath of our nosthrils, and the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oy of our hearts. Wee finde that in all ages the preservation
of religion in puritie hath beene dearer to the godly then their
very lives. As the preservation of religion in puritie hath been
maintained, so hath the restauration to puritie beene purchased
with the bloud of Martyres, and grievous troubles of many
confessors. The reformation of the Church within this realm
was not obtained without the martyrdome of some, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of the lives and estates of many other of our worthie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours.
The temple was throughly built, and the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
brought foorth, with the acclamation of other reformed
Churches, (the Church of England, which as <hi>Bucerus</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in histime, standeth in the midst betwixt the Romane and
reformed, only excepted) crying <hi>Grace grace</hi> unto it. No
where was the doctrine sounder, the divine worship purer,
the government fitter for the building of Gods house. But of
late yeares the doctrine is leavened with Arminianisme and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie,
the worship of God defiled with superstition and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
the joint government of Pastors in presbyteries, synodall
and generall assemblies, with subordination of presbyteries to
synods, and synods to generall assemblies, is changed into ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall
oligarchie: So that it may bee observed in our times to
bee true, which was noted by <hi>Aventinus,</hi> to have beene done
among the Popes in his time, that the same deedes are at one
time branded with the mark of superstition; and at another
time set out with the glorious title of pietie, at one time attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to <hi>Antichrist,</hi> at another time to Christ: at one time judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
tyrannicall and unjust, at another time just and righteous.
That which before we rejected as superstitious or idolatrous,
is now called truely religious: that which before was called
Antichristian and tyrannicall, is receaved now as ancient, and
Apostolicall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7886:3"/>
Is it not lamentable to see that government which maintained
the kingdome of Antichrist in former times, and with much
paines thrown foorth, to bee reestablished. Some idle mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
deserting their owne particular flocks, have taken upon
them to bee diocesan pastors, the principall and only pastors of
all the congregations within an whole diocie, to plant and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
Ministers without consent of presbyteries, to stay their
proceedings against hainous offenders, to sit as Princes amongst
priests at their diocesan synods, to suspend and deprive Ministers
by the power of the high Commission, without the consent of
any lawfull, let bee pretended assemblie of the Church, to fine,
confine, imprison Ministers, or other professours, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the estates, to sit in the Checker, Counsell, Session, and
to bear offices of estate, to vote in Parliament in name of the
Church, without consent of the Church, many of the Ministrie
repyning, and none consenting, but upon conditions and cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which are not regarded, to send Commissioners to Court,
as directed from the Clergie or Church, who return with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
in favours of Papists, or for advancement of their estate:
is not the office of Deane, and election of bishops by deane
and chapter, rejected as Popish by our generall assemblies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
again, without consent of the Church, or so much as a
pretended assemblie? Are not the best qualified exspectants
debarred from entrie to the Ministrie, unlesse they subscrive
such articles as the pretended bishops have devised, and others
obtruded upon congregations to their great grief. Ministers
are troubled by them with the acts of pretended assemblies,
whereas themselves transgresse the acts of many laudable assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie.
Ministers are become dissolute, and erroneus doctrine is
taught without controlement. We have cause to fear ere it be
long, that sound and faithfull Ministers shall become as rare as
wedges of gold.</p>
            <p>Consider further, that soone after the government was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
idolatrous, superstitious, and ridiculous ceremonies were
introduced into the worship of GOD with the five famous arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
of which we are now to treat. Moe are intended in the


<pb facs="tcp:7886:3"/>
cannos lately <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>blished, and yet moe expected with the liturgle
not yet printed: neither can wee look for an end, till the whole
worship of God be defiled. And yet these ceremonies are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
commended as ancient, or slighted as matters indifferent.</p>
            <p>It is called in question, if not altogether denyed, whether
the Pope bee the great Antichrist or not: the possibilitie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
with Rome is maintained, and to this end errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
points of doctrine delivered in publick, or defended in

               </gap>ivate, or our differences from the Romish church slighted
as not fundamentall. Bookes of this kinde are printed
with priviledge in our neighbour church, and in private
commended by such amongst us, as apprehend the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of this course to bee the easiest way to preferment.
Doctor <hi>Francis White</hi> in his treatise of the Sabbath ranketh
among the traditions of the church, the baptisme of infants, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
observation of the Lords day, the administration of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme,
and the Lords supper in publick assemblies and congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
the deliverie of the elements of the holy communion
in both kindes, the service of the church in a known language.

               </gap>ar the burning of our owne house, when our
neighbours house is in fire? Have wee not greater cause to
fear and bestirre our selves, when the fire hath seased upon the
thack of our own house, and poysonable errours are vented
amongst our selves,</p>
            <p>Do wee then complain without iust cause, or for matters of
no importance? The reconcilers cry <hi>peace, peace,</hi> but mean to
peace, till wee bee at peace with Rome. The Prelates charge
us with shisme and sedition, but they mean to peace without
peaceable possession of their places, and obedience to their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.
They call us shismaticks, and yet cannot endure gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
assemblies, the ordinarie remedie of division and shismes,
as was acknowledged by the Kings Commissioners, and such as
were acquainted with his Maiesties minde at Linlithgow, <hi>anno</hi>
1606. To what end was it enacted with their owne consent at


<pb facs="tcp:7886:4"/>
Glasgow, 1610. that those who were called bishops, should be
lyable to the triall and censure of the generall assemblie, for
their office and benefice, life and conversation, if we have not
yearly or set generall assemblies, to try them, or censure us, if
we shall be found guiltie of shisme. Grievances presented by
Ministers to parliam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nts, which should be the chief sanctuaries
of refuge to all distressed subiects, are suppressed, and not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to be read in publick before the Estates: yea lawes are
made in parliament concerning matters Ecclesiasticall, without
the knowledge or consent of the generall assemblie, and acts
of pretended assemblies are ratified, sometime made worse with
omissions, additions, alterations. We want our assemblies
to direct commissioners with articles, grievances, and petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to parliaments, conventions, court and counsell, and to
treat of all the affaires of the Church: what wonder is it then
that all be out of frame?</p>
            <p>But wee are still charged with frowardnesse, that wee ever
except against assemblies when wee have them. So did the
Ubiquitars the Theologues in the Palatinat, <hi>Synodum appellatis,</hi>
said they, <hi>&amp; synodum detrectatis.</hi> The Theologues answered
in their admonition, <hi>Hinc istae lachrymae, quod synodum ejusmodi
vellent, qualem principibus praescripscrunt, in qui ipsi fuissent accusato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
ipsi judices, ipsi saltarent, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ent.</hi> So do wee answere to our Prelats, if they will
suffer no assemblies, but such as they themselves overrule at
pleasure, they can not pretend desire of peace. Wee call for
no other assemblies then such as shall bee constitute according
to the order agreed upon with his Majesties owne consent, in
the generall assembly holden, <hi>anno</hi> 1598, such as shall have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
to conveen yearly, or at set times, and to treat of all
affaires belonging to the Church, such as shall have free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in their proceedings. It were dangerous to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
every meeting, which claimeth to it self the name and
authoritie of a generall assemblie.</p>
            <p>Can wee acknowledge that convention at Perth, <hi>anno</hi> 1618.

drawn to that meeting to give their voice. Some modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of presbyteries being the bishops substituts, were admitted
without commission. No Baron ought to vote according to
the act made at <hi>Dundie, anno</hi> 1598, but one out of the bounds of
a presbyterie having commission. But a number were present at
this assemblie, being only required by his Majesties missives'
and their voices were numbred with the rest Some minister<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were the Kings pensioners, or looked for augmentation of sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends,
or were threatned in privat by their diocesan bishop with
deposition, or were circumveened with promises, that they
should not be urged with practice. Necessitie of yeelding was
urged, under no lesse danger then of the wrath of authoritie,

at the receaving of the elements is noted up among the

ministration of the Sacraments. By the order of Geneva
was meant the order which was observed in the English
Church at Geneva, where Master <hi>Knox</hi> had beene of late
Minister, which order is called in the first booke of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
<hi>The order of Geneva,</hi> and <hi>The book of Common order.</hi>
This order, as I have already said, is set downe before
the Psalmes in meeter. In the assembly holden <hi>anno</hi>

the Psalmes, which is a renewing of the former act.
In the Parliament holden the yeare 1567 it was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that whosoever refused to participate of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as they were then publikely administred in this


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7886:7"/>
reformed Church, were not to be reputed members of
this Church. An act was likewise made concerning the
Kings oath to be given at his coronation to maintain the
religion then professed, and in speciall the due and right
administration of the Sacraments then receaved. This
act concerning the Kings oath was ratified again by acts
of Parliament in the yeare 1581, and againe in the yeare
1592. In the yeare 1572 it was ordained by act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that such as did not communicate, and partake of
the Sacraments as they were then truly ministred in the
Church of Scotland, if they continue obstinate and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient,
shall be reputed infamous, and unable to sit or
stand in judgement, persue, bear office, &amp;c. When in the
second confession of faith, which is commonly called the
Kings confession, we professe that we detest the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Roman Antichrist added to the ministration
of the Sacraments, we professe we detest kneeling in the
act of receaving the sacramentall elements of bread and
wine.</p>
               <p>The order of celebrating the Lords supper, which
hath beene receaved and observed since the beginning of
reformation, and acknowledged both by generall assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
and Parliaments, to be the due and right order, was
perverted by a number of noble men, Barons, Ministers,
and pretended Bishops conveened at Perth, in the yeare
1618, either having no lawfull commission, or terrified
with threats, or corrupted one way or other. They in
their full and pretended assembly to please King <hi>James,</hi>
made this act following, as it is extant among the acts of
Parliament:</p>
               <p>Since we are commanded by God himself, that when we come
to worship him, wee fall downe and kneel before the Lord our


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7886:7"/>
Maker, and considering withall, that there is no part of divine
worship more heavenly and spirituall, then is the holy recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the blessed body and bloud of our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ: Like as the most humble and reverent gesture of

               <p>This act, if the lying parenthesis were culled out,
which is insert onely to deceave, may passe among Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
and Lutherans. It is untrue that all memory of by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past
superstition is past, and untrue that the abuse of
kneeling among the papists was the onely occasion that
moved our first reformers to make choice of sitting, but
the paterne of the first supper at the institution was the
chiefe cause. And therefore they not only rejected knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
but also standing and taking in passing by, as wee

of their hands they sate downe to the first course of
the paschall supper to eat the paschall lambe with the
unleavened bread, then they rose againe to the washing
of their feet. Thereafter they sate downe againe to the
second course of the paschall supper, and did eat of a sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
made of sowre hearbs, which they dipped in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
liquour as thick as mustard. This second course
was a part of the paschall supper, <note place="margin">Scaliger de emendat temporum lib. 6.</note> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> and others
of the learned prove out of the Jewish writers, and not
their common and vulgar supper. <hi>M. P.</hi> yeeldeth to this,
because the paschall supper was a sufficient meal of it
selfe, and therefore they needed no other supper. It is
clear that they sate howbeit not upright, yet leaning on
their elbowes at the paschall supper. <hi>Scaliger</hi> citeth out

sitting at the eating of the paschall supper. The Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
likewise make mention, that after they rose, and
Christ had washed their feet, they sate downe againe.
Now while they were eating after this sitting downe to
the second course of the paschall supper, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
while they were yet sitting, Christ took bread,

the evangelicall supper, <hi>Matth. 26. 26. Mark.</hi> 14.
22. Yea the very close or conclusion of the second
course, or whole paschall supper was changed by Christ
into the evangelicall supper. <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> relate that
Christ tooke the cup after supper. The consecrating,
breaking, and eating of the bread had interveened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the second course and the taking up of the cup.
Therefore they might well say, <hi>After supper he tooke
the cup.</hi> Yea they might have said also after supper hee
tooke the bread, to wit after both the first and second

cited in this and the chapter following. The Naucratits
after they had supplicated upon their knees, sate downe
againe upon their feasting beds, as Atheneus reporteth.</p>
                  <p>We prove also by collection from some circumstances, <note place="margin">That Christ and his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples sat.</note>
and the forme of the celebration, that they sat. They nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
stood nor kneeled. Therefore they sate. They stood
not, for the beds upon which they sate leaning on their
elbowes, were so neer to the tables, that they might reach
to it, so that they could not easily stand betwixt. It were
ridiculous to alledge that they stood upon the beds. <note place="margin">Iohn 14. 31</note> And
Christ when he had ended, sayeth to them, <hi>Arise, let us

to them, <hi>Arise.</hi> It may bee gathered likewise that they
kneeled not. 1. If there had beene a change from sitting,
which was the ordinarie gesture at the Paschall supper, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
kneeling a gesture of adoration at the Evangelicall sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
some of the Evangelists would have made mention
of it, for they make mention of other changes. 2. If
there had beene such a change, then kneeling should have
beene institute, and all have sinned that have not kneeled
since the first supper, which our opposits dare not affirm.


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7886:10"/>
To what end should the change have been made, if not
that that gesture might be observed afterward. 3. The
form of celebration could not comply with the gesture
of kneeling: for Christ spake in an enunciative form, and
not prayerwise, and the elements were carried from hand
to hand, and divided by the Apostles among themselves.
The distributing of the elements by the Communicants
among themselves is not compatible with kneeling, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of adoration which should bee directed to God.

supper being instituted after the paschall supper, to which

they might not lawfully eat leavened bread, nor at any

be the only religious feast to be used in the Christian
Church, observed the same gesture, which was used at
the paschall supper, and other religious feasts. So that
the using of this gesture at the first supper, was as it were
a ratification, that the common and ordinarie gesture of

represented another spirituall banquet, as sitting is the
usuall gesture at banquets or feasts, even when men are
invited by kings, in token of that familiar societie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they are honoured, so it represents that which is
answerable the familiarity of the soule with Christ at the
spirituall banquet. Christ intended not only to represent
unto us our spirituall nouritour, for then it had sufficed he
had given the signes any way without a table, without

brake it, and gave to them. This place is interpreted by
sundrie ancients and moderne of the breaking of the
sacramentall bread, which may be granted without any
vantage to the Papists for communicating in one kinde,
because the example is extraordinarie: and by the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew

bee meant the whole supper.</p>

that which they had used at their ordinary eating before.</p>

it, and partake of the meat set upon the table. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
if there bee no use of a table but to set meat
upon it, a dressour or a cupboord may bee called a table.
Whereas they say, the altar is called the table of the Lord
<hi>Malach.</hi> 1. and yet none did sit at it. True and so do
the Papists also call the lid of their altar a table. But it is
plain wee speak of a supper or feasting table.</p>
                  <p>The Altar is called the Lords table, because the Lords
meat, (<hi>Levit.</hi> 22. 25.) that which was burnt with fire in
oblation to GOD, was consumed on it. But the Lords
supper is called the Lords table, because our Lord and
Saviour appointed it for his guests, whom he inviteth to
it. So the table of the shew bread might bee called the
Lords table, but not in our sense, not a supper or feast ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

master of the feast thought sufficient. And this is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
an answer to that which they alledge for other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
feasts, that they kneeled not at the eating of the
passeover, because it was <hi>coena recta</hi> a full meale, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
a good space, but the action of the communicant
is soone dispatched. For it is not the length or shortnesse
of time, that we consider so much as the forme of a feast,
whereunto the gesture of kneeling is not suteable. The
same formes, which were used at the close of the paschall
supper, were used at this, with a little change. Further,
they kneeled not at any part of the paschall supper, no
not when the cuppe of praise was reached from hand to
hand, which was done in a very short time, or when the
bread was eaten in the quantity of an olive, and lesse then
an egge.</p>

likewise by this custome of the Jewes, that this
protestation concerned the communion cup. To imagine
that Christ protested twice, and that he bad devide the
one, and not the other, is a fiction without any ground in
the text. For none of the Evangelists make mention of
two protestations, or to what end two, seeing the last
paschall cuppe and the evangelicall was all one, the one
being changed in the other. Or to what end should he
have bidden them devide the paschall cup more then the
evangelicall. And if there were two protestations for
two severall cuppes, the later should have crossed the
former. <hi>Vasquez</hi> proveth by this protestation, that <hi>Luke</hi>
meant only of one cup, howbeit he maketh mention of it
twice, that it was in the communion cup, that the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
containeth the cause, wherefore he willed them
to drinke of it, and devide it among them, because now
at his last farewell, <note place="margin">In 3. part. tom. 3. quast. 78. num. 41.</note> he would testifie his love to them, and

Another reason, that the cup, which Christ commanded

thanks; when he tooke it in his hand. <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi>

both the places. But the breaking of the bread in both
the places is attributed not to the Ministers or Pastors
only, but to the people also, and is made common to the

There can be no other reason of this guise, but to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
a superstitious conceat, that it is holier to receave

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7886:29"/>
encreasing, at last they might not take the sacrament in
their owne hand to put it in their mouth, but it behoved
the priest to put it in their mouth. Such superstitious
conceats condemne Christ and his Apostles, and the
faithfull in their time who distributed to other, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
us of the profitable uses of fraction, or breaking
of bread, whereof we have already treated. The repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
and forme of a feast or banquet is not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
It is rather <hi>Sportula,</hi> which is opposite to <hi>coena,</hi>
then <hi>coena,</hi> that is, rather like a dole of meat, then a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
For <hi>Sportula</hi> was a dole of meat distributed by the

                  <p>This giving of the elements to every one severally, <note place="margin">The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences following upon the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensing.</note>
whither the communicants sit, stand, or kneel, bringeth
in also confusion of actions, and private communions in
the publike assembly. For while the ministers are giving
the elements to every one, the people is in the meane
time exercised in hearing the word read, or psalmes
sung, and heare not what they say to the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,
nor do the communicants understand, what is
read or sung in publike. Yea, sometimes two ministers
will be speaking at once to sundrie communicants. So
the communicants communicate a part, and might as
well go aside, or to an Ile of the Church, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
yea, and farre better. For the minister can scarce
know his owne voice, when he speaketh to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,
being troubled with the exercise of the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
as one of the ministers of Edinburgh confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
publikely in pulpit. The exercise is dead, and cold,
when the minister giveth to every one severally. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

It setteth an edge upon us, when with one heare,
as it were, and together we apply every one of us to our
selfes, that which is uttered by the minister. But when
the action is prolonged with speaking to every one, the
mindes of men languish and wander.</p>
                  <p>Our Doctour saith, <note place="margin">L. pag. 56. Christ spake in the plurall number at the deliverie.</note> they utter the words in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

at the rehearsall of the words of the institution, at,

the deliverie of the elements, which they do not. Next
(saith he) they apply the generall command to every
one in particular, as if the Apostles, or other communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,
to whom the words were uttered in the plurall
number, did not apply to themselfes particularly, when
every one did take, eat, and drinke. And the Doctour
himselfe confesseth, that every worthy receaver ought
to apply the words to himselfe in particular. If Christ
spake in the plurall number, when the communicants
were so few, what would he have done, if there had been
a great multitude present. Another profound Doctour
imagineth, that Christ spake first to all generally in the

wee are more troubled with rites abused, and polluted

in that we show not, as we ought, our hatred and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of idolatrie, when we retaine any monument or
memoriall of it. God will not have us to utter with
our lips the very name of the idol, with respect or any
honour. The brazen serpent, after the miraculous use of
it, for which it was set up, ceased, was keeped 700 years
for a memoriall of that miracle, and as a monument of
Gods mercie, and benefite receaved at that time. Yet,
when it began to be abused, and polluted with idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
<hi>Ezekias</hi> brake it in pieces. Farre more ought the
monuments and memorials of idols, or idolatrie. We
honour the idol and idolatrous worship, when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
any monument or memoriall of idolatrie. Next,
in so doing, wee keep a stumbling block in the Church,
and both harden the idolater in his idolatrie, and lay a
stumbling block and snare before our selfe and our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
by retaining of such allurements and provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to commit the same kinde of spirituall fornication

sinne. <hi>Woe be to him that giveth offence, it were

                  </p>
                  <p>That kneeling in the act of receaving the sacrament,
hath beene abused to idolatire, <note place="margin">Kneeling a monument of idolatrie.</note> can not be denyed. Nay,


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7886:36"/>
it is confessed, that kneeling in that act hath been abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to the vilest idolatrie, that ever was, to the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of a piece bread, which the worshipper esteemed
to be his god. To retaine it therefore, is to retaine a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall
or monument of that vile idolatrie, because we
use that same gesture, in that same very act, and without
necessity. For our opposits affirme, That all the maine

when he saith, No ordinance of God can bee a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

creature of God can be a monument of idolatrie, but all
gesturs are Gods creatures or abilities, whereunto man
is disposed by creation. <note place="margin">pag. 118.</note> And our Doctour saith, That

but the gesture it selfe is volnntarie, free, and acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.
A man hath abilitie to stand upon one of his legs,
or with his back to the elements, is such a posture of the
parts of a mans body, therefore lawfull in the act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaving.
Seeing neither by Gods ordinance, nor any
naturall necessity wee are bound to kneel in that act, the
retaining of kneeling so horribly abused in that act, is the
retaining of a vile monument of idolatrie.</p>
                  <p>How dangerous it is, <note place="margin">Kneeling scandalous to papists.</note> consider it first in the papist.
The papist is confirmed in his vile idolatry by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie

that we are comming home to them, and hope for the
full restoring of poperie againe, because we kneel at the
receaving of the eucharist as they do. It is confessed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
by conformitants. The ministers of Edinburgh, after
they had vexed the people ten yeares with their knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,

Next, it is as strange, that they should be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that the gesture of sitting was in use even then, to
wit 1573. 1578. 1583. in sundry Churches in Europe,
as in the Low-countries, Helvetia, Scotland. Yea, as a
worthy Polonian, as that Church hath bred in his time,
that Polonian Baron <hi>Iohannes Alasco,</hi> wrote before the
holding of that synod more amply, and more earnestly
for sitting; then any man else; and put it in practise in the
Churches where he had credite and authoritie. We are
not therefore conforme to Arrians in the gesture of
sitting, for it is not their invention, nor is it approved
only by them; It was in use before ever the name of
<hi>Arrius</hi> was heard. Yet, howbeit their synods were
mixed, and consisted partly of Lutherans, partly of such

or passing, since the dayes of Christ, have sinned.
For if wee be commended by God to kneel, wee sinne if
we kneel not. Next, the word translated <hi>worship, Psal.</hi>

as it is taken here in the act, for then wee should
sinne, if we kneel not, when we bear the word read or

kinde of worshipping of God, to wit, adoring God by
the gesture of prostration. And so wee shall bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to prostrat our body with our hands and feet
spread upon the ground, and not to kneel only. For
the people of God under the law used foure kindes of
gestures in signe of honour: First, a bending, or bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the bodie with hands and feet spread, as I have said, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed

mentioned in the verse alledged. Thirdly, we have not
here a commandement from God, but <hi>David</hi> his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
or invitation to the godly, not to kneel or fall
downe before the Lord, when they come to worship
him, or as the word beareth to prostrate themselfes, for
that were as much as to desire them to fall downe and
kneel, when they come to fall downe and kneel; but


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7886:47"/>
he exhorteth and inviteth them to come and prostrate
themselfes, bow and kneel before the Lord their maker
in token of thanksgiving, that is, in the temples where
the arke was, and where the Lord was present in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull

                  <p>The third reason in the narrative, <note place="margin">The third reason exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. L. p. 74.</note> is the correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
betweene the outward gesture of our body, and
then meditation, and lifting up our hearts, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
and consider the mysticall union betwixt Christ
and us, and among our selfes, whereof we are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
by the receaving of Christs body and bloud. He
shunneth to set downe the words of the narrative, and
of the conclusion answerable to them, as he did in the
former two reasons, because he perceaved they could
not be framed to his purpose. For there is no mention
made in the narrative of <hi>mysticall union,</hi> nor is it said in
the narrative, that the most humble and reverent gesture


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7886:49"/>
of the bodie, well becommeth the meditation, and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of our hearts, when wee remember and consider
the mysticall union betwixt Christ and us, but that the
most humble and reverent gesture of our body in our
meditation and lifting up of our hearts, becommeth well
so divine and sacred an action, to wit, as is the receaving
of the body and bloud of Christ. Wee are not directed
by the act to meditate and lift up hearts, but to use
that kinde of gesture, which becommeth meditation and
the lifting up of the heart; nor is kneeling a gesture well
becomming meditation. Wee meditate sitting, lying,
walking. Kneeling is a gesture well becomming prayer,
but not meditation. By lifting up the heart, no necessity
to meane prayer: for the minde and heart may be lifted
up by faith and contemplation, without prayer. And
to this lifting up the Communicants were exhorted of
old with <hi>sursum corda,</hi> least their hearts and mindes
should be groveling and onely bent upon the elements.
And so the lifting up of the eyes may be a signe of lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of the heart and minde, in token that wee looke
confidently to have our desires granted by God, who
dwelleth in heaven, as the casting downe of the eye as a
token of humiliation for sinne. Suppose by lifting up of
the heart prayer should be meant, yet kneeling is not the
humblest gesture for prayer, but prostration. Then we
should prostrat our selfes when wee receave the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Next, if the Communicant shall pray mentally,
when hee receaveth the sacrament, and in that regard
kneel, he shall be exercised other wayes then the act of
receaving requires. Further, a secret mentall prayer shall
be commended to him in publike without a vocall, and
the signe of it the humble gesture of kneeling, whereas


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7886:49"/>
the signes of secret and mentall prayer in publike should
be concealed, so farre as may be. The minister, when
he delivereth the elements, is not directed to use a vocall
prayer to be followed by the Communicant. And wee
see, the Conformitants are not uniforme among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfes
in the words uttered at deliverie of the elements.
If we may sit, or stand, or kneel in time of prayer, then
kneeling is not enjoyned in regard of prayer, but some
other thing intended. But, as I have said, we are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
by the act to lift up our hearts or pray; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I need not, as yet, to insist upon this pretext. Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
that in the conclusion these words, <hi>In remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of so mysticall an union,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e answerable in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
<hi>the meditation and lifting up of our heart;</hi> then by
<hi>meditation and lifting up of the heart,</hi> is meant not
prayer, but <hi>remembrance.</hi> And what is that, to say, to
kneel in remembrance, that were to kneel for a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall.
But suppone it were thus, <hi>when we remember,</hi> and
as he addeth <hi>consider,</hi> to remember and consider is not to
pray. Shall we kneel, whensoever we are put in minde
of that mysticall union? And what is meant by this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
union? It may meane as well a materiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
as they call it, or corporall union of the body
of Christ, with the bodies of the Communicants, by
touch in the mouth, swallowing downe to the stomack,
and mixture with the bodies of the communicants, as
spirituall with the soule. <hi>O Lord, let thy bodie which I

prayer and thanksgiving to that use, and after delivered
to the communicant, with command, to take, eat, and
assurance if he so doe, the bread shall be a pledge of his

annexed to the commandment as conditionall, and hath
no effect otherwise, but if the condition be performed.
It is a receaved action among the Divines. <hi>Elementa ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trausum

prayer is a senselesse one, like that old prayer, <hi>Anima
Christi sanctificaine,</hi> which is directed to Christs soule,
whereas wee should direct our prayers to his person,
not to his humanitie by it self.</p>
                  <p>Let it bee observed by the way, that the words of
the institution are rehearshed in the English service book,

in a continuall tenor with the prayer begun before, just
according to the order observed in the Canon of the
masse, when the priest offereth his sacrifice, which is an
horrible abuse of the words of the institution, which
Christ uttered to the Communicants, and not unto God.
I dare bee bold to affirme, the sacrifice of the masse
had never en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

had beene uttered at the deliverie of the elements to the
Communicants in an enunciative forme, or demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
as Christ did. Thirdly, if in regard of prayer, then,
if Christs sacramentall speach be uttered without addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a prayer, the Communicants must not kneel.
Christs forme of speach then must be thrust out, that
prayer and with it kneeling may enter in. Fourthly,
suppose the prayer might be substituted in the roome
of the word of promise, kneeling should not be enjoyned
nor urged more precisely at that bit of prayer, then at
other prayers. Yea, it is superstition to urge kneeling
at one prayer more strictly, then at another, and absurd,
in my judgement, to enjoyne it at all in any. They may
as well enjoyne any man to lift up his eyes, to knock on
his breast, to bow the head, or crouch, as to kneel: as
they doe in the popish service, which hath made it the
more ridiculous. for kneeling, lifting up of the hands or
eyes, knocking on the breast, are naturall expressions
and adumbrations of the inward motions of the soule,
and proceed <hi>ex abundantia interni affectu,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">De sacram. lib. 1. c. 10. s. 7.</note> as saith <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier,</hi>
and therefore ought not to be extorted by injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
for that were to command men to play the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crits,

of such inward motions, as perhaps are not in them, so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
as to stir them up voluntarily to such expressions.


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7886:53"/>
Yea, some of them may serve for ejaculations, as the lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of the eyes, to knock on the breast, and to bow
the head, which bowing is finished in one instant, saith
<hi>L.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">pag. 68.</note> All undecent and unseemly gesture in prayer, ought
to bee forbidden, but no gesture ought to bee comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in speciall, but left free. Fiftly, that prayer above
mentioned, is but a short ejaculation, and sooner
ended then the Communicant can addresse himself to
his knees. Sixtly, that prayer or short wish is ended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Minister offer the bread to the Communicant,
and bid him take it, and yet the Communicant is enjoined
to continue still upon his knees. Nor is kneeling enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to them by statute or their service book, in regard of
mentall prayer, for none such is enjoined. what suppose
kneeling were enjoined in respect of prayer also, for if
also, or principallie for reverence of the Sacrament, it is
sufficient for our purpose. for to adore any other thing
but God, or with God, are both idolatrous. Master

And againe, <note place="margin">pag. 299.</note> 
                     <hi>Suppose there bee no prayer used in the time of
receaving, I think never the worse of the gesture of kneeling.</hi>
No wonder hee say so, for hee layeth down a ground,
that any of the gestures may be used in any part of Gods
worship, which is a begging of the question, and yet
hee can not prove kneeling at the hearing of the word,
let bee in the act of receaving the sacramentall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

                  <p>Wheresoever the publike intent of a Church is to
kneel for reverence of the sacrament, <note place="margin">The intent of the knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler must be interpreted by the act.</note> every Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
following her direction, is an idolater. Howbeit
his privat intent were divers from the intent of the act,
which is urged as the publike intent of the Church, yet
he is <hi>interpretativè</hi> an idolater, and to be so construed
both before God and man. If any man receave the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
upon his knees at Rome, or in any other Popish
Church, whersoever were his privat intent, yet he must
be interpreted to kneel according to the intent of the
Church of Rome. The heart may be carried one way,
and the outward action another way for feare, or other
respects, but that outward action must be interpreted not
according to the intention of the minde, but the intent of
the injoyner. If ye fall downe before an idol in Spaine,
suppose for feare of the inquisition, ye commit idolatrie,
and honoureth that idol in the sight of men.</p>
                  <p>If it be asked, after what manner the Communicant
must be interpreted to adore, <note place="margin">Of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their adoration.</note> I answer, That upon better
consideration of the act then before, I thinke the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant
may according to the act kneel with a Popish
intent, carring both the inward motion of his spirit, and
outward submission of his body to the sacrament upon
opinion of transubstantiation, or with the Lutherans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
upon opinion of consubstantiation, and that for

two cases, first, because the words of the act make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
only of the body and bloud of Christ, and of the
blessed sacrament, but not one word of the elements of
bread and wine. Next, because some of our ministers
the chief urgers of kneeling are popish, and have taught
in publike in the pulpits of Edinburgh, that wee ought
not to contend, or descant curiously upon the manner
of Christs presence in the sacrament, and that he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

By this Popish reason, Christs flesh and bloud may be

in generall, but leaveth place to substantially
in an unknown manner. But wee proceed: If any will
extend the words of the act to the elements of bread and
wine, and interpret the receaving of Christs bodie and
bloud, of the souls inward receaving, then howbeit hee
kneeleth not upon opinion of the reall presence of Christ
in the sacrament, yet his adoration is terminated, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
someway upon the sacrament, or sacramentall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
otherwise hee cannot bee said to kneel for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Now, as the papists agree not among themselves about
the manner of worshipping their images, so the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7886:55"/>
may differ in the manner and way of termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
that adoration or worship. Therefore suppose he
believe not the reall presence or existence of the body of
Christ in the bread, yet hee may in his apprehension and
imagination unite them, as the papist doth his image with
the prototype, and so adore the thing with the thing sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified;
as the purple robbe with the King is coadored or

which hee would bestow upon the thing signified,
and by it, or in it honoureth the thing, signified proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but the signe improperly: As when a Kings Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour

signes as things sacred, and in relation to God, whom we
are serving in the use of them. So howbeit the way and
manner of terminating the reverence in the Sacrament
bee different, according to the conceat of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,
all come to one end, to wit, to kneel for reverence of
the Sacrament. Now to kneel for reverence, is a gesture
of adoration, <note place="margin">pag. 70.</note> and soveraigne worship, as <hi>L.</hi> ackow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth.
It is nothing to the devil, whether a man erre
this or that way. Howbeit the Communicants were not

I might draw another score heere, for it is enough that
the Communicants are directed by the act of Perth
to kneel, for reverence of the Sacrament: for seeing

such a creature, suppone but a'tree, and is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
tied when you pray before any other creature, your
gesture of adoration can not bee without respect to the
tree. God himself never appointed any creature to bee
an object to the eyes of man, when hee was to adore him
upon his knees, but only directed his people to kneel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
a certain place, where he was present himself in an
extraordinarie manner, or bound himself by promise to
hear them from thence. Hee was present in the Ark af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an extraordinarie manner, sitting betweene the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins,
answered by a lively voice out of it to Moses, and
vouchsafed to hear such as turned toward the Temple,
when they called upon him. But there is no such place
appointed under the Gospel, far lesse any creature before
which hee hath directed us to kneel. Our adoration is
directed to that place, where wee know the manhood
of Christ, whereof the Ark and the Temple were types,
doth exist naturally or substantially, that is, to the heavens

                  <p>We uncover our heads, <note place="margin">The unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of the head not like kneeling.</note> say they, when wee receave
the elements, why may wee not also kneel? I answer,
first, the uncovering of the head is a gesture of reverence
only, and that only among some nations, but not of
adoration. The Jewes, Turkes, and Mahometans pray
with their heads covered. The Grecians and Romanes
of old, howbeit they walked in publike with uncovered
heads, except in raine, great heat, or mourning, yet in the
service of their Gods, they had their heads covered.
The Europeans this day uncover their heads when they
are praying. Kneeling is a gesture of adoration among
all nations, either in civill or religious use. <hi>Augustine</hi>
saith, <hi>Honorat emnis qui adorat, no autem adorat omnes
quid onorat; Every one that doth adore, doth honour, but
not every one that honoureth, adoreth. Contraserm. Arian.
c.</hi> 23. I will not kneel to every one, to whom I uncover
my head civilly. Every one that standeth with his head
uncovered in presence of the king, is not adoring, as he
is who is presenting his petition to the king upon his
knee in their sight. A provinciall synod holden at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<hi>anno</hi> 1603: ordained the head to be uncovered,
when their service is read in the Church, yet I thinke
they would not have enjoyned kneeling. We heare the


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7886:57"/>
canonicall scripture read with uncovered heads, but yet
we kneel not. The words of Christ, which he uttered
at the institution, are still and often uttered; that same
voice soundeth through all the tables of the world, his
actions, which were divine and holy, are reiterat. In
<hi>Gratians</hi> decree, <hi>De consecrat. dist. 1. cap.</hi> 68. we have a
superstitious direction of Pope <hi>Anastasius,</hi> that when the
Gospell is reade in the Church, those that are present,
shall not sit, but stand <hi>venerabiliter curvi, bowing reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently,</hi>
hearken and adore. Wherefore more at the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the Gospell, then the Epistle, which is also Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall?
Yet you see, howbeit that standing with bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
be more then to have the head uncovered, it was but
veneration. And, whereas he saith, <hi>Et fideliter adorent,</hi>
the glosse hath, <hi>id est venerentur,</hi> because the word <hi>ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi>
is taken there in a large sense, as yee may see sundrie

were they never ranked among the <hi>Iconomachi,</hi> but by

the image, <note place="margin">De cultu adorat. Disp. 108. num. 73.</note> or in the image, or by the image. <hi>Vazquez</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
That these Doctours made the image <hi>objectum

the samplar and the image were adored, <hi>simul cum ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginibus
exemplaria proximè &amp; ut quód adorari.</hi> For they
used the same respect to the images, that other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks
used, they uncovered their head to them, they bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
toward them, kneeled before them, and kissed them.
And this he defendeth to be the right manner, when the
image and the samplar are adored with one adoration,
the inward motion and submission of the minde, being
carried to the samplar, and the outward signe of submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the image, being transmitted by the spirit, or in
thought and defire, <note place="margin">De adorat. disp. 108. num. 90. num. 132. 134. &amp; disp. 110 num. 34. Disp. 109. num. 7.</note> to the samplar. That all the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks
agree in this, that the kisse be so fixed upon the
image, and the body be bowed before it, that the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
being inflammed with the remembrance of the
samplar, be carried to it with inward reverence, <hi>Virtute

kneeling before the image, prostration, or any other
signe of submission is to be transmitted by the image to
the samplar after the same manner. For, <note place="margin">De adorat. disp. 106. num 2. &amp; 6.</note> saith he, in the

<hi>The adversaries to images, who use images only to put them

with the outward note or signe, but standing upright without
any gesture of the body before the image, which might be a
shew of reverence, they remember the samplar, and adore it
in spirit only.</hi> But these Doctours above mentioned, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
their inward reverence was directed to the sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar,

only as <hi>objectum à quo significativè,</hi> as instruments and

who were called <hi>Semiprobi,</hi> would not kneel before
them: for then, saith <hi>Vazquez,</hi> they should have adored
them, which he in his Popish judgement, thinketh they
should have done; but these Doctours did so. So if the
elements be used only as <hi>objectum à quo significativè,</hi> to
stirre up their remembrance, why kneel they before
them. Nay, why are not the elements lifted up, as
among the Papists, after they have said, <hi>This is my body,</hi>
(for, say they, it is made then a sacrament) that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
being stirred up at the elevation with the sight of
the signifying object, may kneel in whatsoever part of

such a signifying object, and are tyed to kneel, the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication

between images, which are the inventions of men,

in the case of adoration there is no difference. If the

<hi>quid obstat praesentia imaginis,</hi> saith <hi>Vazquez,</hi> what
doth hinder you at the sight of a crucifix to fall downe
before it, and worship Crist. And if the use of images
to this end be forbidden, so are also the creatures. Wee
esteeme more indeed of the workes of God, then of the
workmanship of man. Wee owe reverence at the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the word, decent and comely usage in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
of the sacrament, which we owe not to images,
howbeit this reverent use be not properly a spece of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. <note place="margin">L. pag. 77.</note>
Gods word and workes are ordained by God
for our instruction, and so are not images. But God
never ordained them to this end, that in them, by them,
or before them, we should adore him, or any other thing
wee are put in remembrance of by them. They are not
commanded to be used, either in or out of the time of
divine service, <hi>in modo &amp; statu accomodato ad adoratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi>
Wee may, and do use the word and sacraments for
meanes, occasions, instruments to stirre us up to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God, but it followeth not that wee should or may

worship God by kneeling before them. The generall

it, standing upright without any adoration or signe
of submission. The people of God had their sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
yet they kneeled not before them, nor yet heard
they the word either read or exponed kneeling. When
they heard the law of the passeover, they bowed not
their head, howbeit it might bee finished in an instant,

boldly, that we may bow our knees to God before his

this errour grounded upon the significant object, may
be the better perceaved, consider, that the booke of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is like the booke of grace. If I were reading and
meditating upon a passage of scripture, I am then consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
what is read. When I have ended that worke, if
I finde my selfe moved to pray, or give thankes, I pore
not still with the eyes of my body, and my minde upon
the booke, but turne my selfe to a wall, or a chaire, or a
bed, or any other thing casually placed before me, yea
perhaps before the booke it selfe, but casually, as before
any other thing. I am not then gathering leassons or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
for that exercise is ended. So when I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
a tree, an asse, or toad, and considering in them
the goodnesse, power, and wisedome of God, I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon the booke of nature, I am contemplating and
gathering profitable instructions. I cannot still be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating,
and in the meane time adore kneeling in
prayer, or praise, for that were a confusion of holy


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7886:63"/>
exercises. Nor yet after my contemplation, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratorie

my selfe before that asse, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I should kneel for a greater respect to that creature, then
to any other beside for the time, before which I might
have kneeled casually without respect. And so the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

my kneeling being convoyed by it to God, to whom it
is directed by my spirit or affection, as <hi>Vazquez</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrived
the manner of adoration by images. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is not different. If the old opinion of some Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nike

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7886:64"/>
the sacrament is <hi>objectum à quo significativè.</hi> And
what is that but reverence relative by the signe to Christ?
And what hindereth adoration to be carried by a signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
object, more then by a representative? The signes
in the sacr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

shape, represent Christ to us.</p>
                  <p>Yee may aske, What if yee keep not a constant course,
but sometimes sit, sometime stand, and sometime kneel?
I answer, Put case, yee kneel sometime for feare like a
temporizer, or of your owne accord, ye take liberty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to sit, stand, or kneel, but when and how oft yee
kneel, yee adore, and tie your self to adore at these times
before such an object, after the same manner, and for the
same respects, and considerations, which are observed
by those who keep a constant course. For it is not here
as in prayer. Wee may pray without externall adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or with it, as in the petition of the mother of <hi>Zebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi>
children, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. she came to Christ, <hi>adorans &amp;

14. 4. the woman of <hi>Tekoa</hi> fell on her face to the ground,
and did obeisance, when shee petitioned the King. For
every gesture in praying to God, is no more a gesture
of adoration, then in petitioning men. Now when yee
adore in prayer, your adoration is directed immediatly
to God, having no object before you, but such as standeth
casually before you, from which you may turne your
selfe in the very act of praying, to which you have no
more respect then to other objects round about you.
But here you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> kneel before such an object, an
object significant, and for that respect doth kneel, that
that signe of outward worship may bee convoyed to
Christs flesh and bloud signified by that object.</p>

We have in the former argument considered the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall
elements, <note place="margin">The second argument.</note> as an object presented before us in
the hand of the minister without any further use. Wee
are now to consider them in the use, when wee take, eat,
and drinke, and our next argument shall bee this. To
adore upon our knees, when wee are performing an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
action, which is not directed to God immediatly,
and in that action are occupied about an externall object,
is idolatrie, unlesse that whereabout the action is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
be worthy of divine honour. Our taking, eating,
drinking the bread and wine at the Lords supper, is not
an action directed to God immediatly, as prayer and
thanksgiving is, nor is it an outward signe of adoration,
as kneeling is. <note place="margin">De adoratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne disput. 93. num. 45.</note>

they do not prosecute it to the point, because they see, it

                     </note> putting us in minde
of a benefite, but also as passive, not of adoration, but of
blessing and sanctification for our use, for the meat is not
set upon the table meerly to be gazed upon, but to bee
blessed and sanctified for our use. Next, we are not, nor
can not be tied to blesse kneeling. Yea, wee read not in
scripture, that any blessed the meat upon the tabl

kneeling. Christ himself blessed sitting. <hi>Salomon</hi> knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 54. when he prayed, and spake to God:
but when he was to blesse the people, it is said, he rose
and stood up. It is an incongruous thing among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
to adore a thing, which is not higher then their
polles, when they adorer, because they can not be said
to humble themselves to that which is lower then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
say D. <hi>P.</hi> and <hi>P.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">D. B. pag. 68. P. pag. 387.</note> It were incongruous likewise,
and inexpedient to set the meat as high as our polles or
above, <note place="margin">Decret. pag. 366.</note> and adore before it kneeling, and looking up to in.
<hi>Bochellus</hi> citeth a canon forbidding the priest to lift up
the bread to be seene before the words of consecration
be uttered, least the people adore and commit idolatrie.
Thirdly, when we kneel, we are not bound to gaze upon
the meat, but may turne our selves to a chaire, a wall, or
a forme, or any other thing set before us casually. Yea,
when we sit at table, we are not bound at the blessing to
gaze upon the meat, but may, and do ordinarily lift up
our hands and our eyes to the heavens, as Christ lifted
up his eyes. But if they would come to the purpose;
and make a just comparison, they should consider next,
that after the meat is blessed, it were strange to see every
one who is present sit downe upon his knees, with his
countenance fixed upon the bread in the hand of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the family or feast. And after this sort we have
considered already in the former argument, the elements
holden in the hands of the minister. But now we are to
consider thirdly, the act of taking, eating, drinking, our
meate and drinke. Wee may not take, eat, and drinke
our ordinarie meat and drinke upon our knees. Nature
and custome teacheth us, it were rather a mocking of
God, then a reverent adoration of him. You will say,

sacrament is a further confirming and sealing of our
communion with Christ, and his benefits purchased to
us by his death. The testification of our thankfulnesse
by showing forth his death, and commemoration of the
benefits receaved thereby is a secondarie end. Neither
is it directed to God immediatly, as thanksgiving is,

Neither can eating and drinking of bread and wine be

a sacrifice, which is only for commemoration, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of a sacrifice. The acting of a tragedie upon
a stage, is not a true tragedy indeed, howbeit the object
represented, was a true tragedie. Giving of almes may
be called a sacrifice, yet wee kneel not when wee give
almes. It is a sacrifice only improperly, and in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
so called. The Gentiles are said to be sacrificed by

when he receaveth a benefite from a prince to testifie
his thankfulnesse? I answer, If we were to receave a gift,
suppose but a morsell of bread out of Gods owne hand
immediatly, wee ought no doubt to adore upon our

immediatly to God. Now wee receave the sacrament
out of the hand of the minister, not out of Christs owne
hand. <hi>Multum interest inter actionem Filii Dei perse,

on their knees, when Christ himselfe ministred the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
howbeit upon occasion, and at other times they
adored, not did they adore God the Father upon their
knees for the benefite they were receaving. The inward
benefite Christs body and bloud are receaved by the
soule, not by the body, by the godly only, not by all that
receave the sacrament, by faith embracing Christ present
by his spirit in the soul. The godly under the law recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the same gift, the same spirituall food, and drink, and
yet kneeled not. The D. <hi>pag.</hi> 113. saith, that in the law
they had but the shadow of the gift, a popish speach,
whereas the Apostle saith, the same food. If the clearer
revelation make the difference, which is without ground
or reason, then adoration is not in respect of the gift. The
godly take, eat, and drinke Christs body and bloud by
the act of faith and beleeving, Now the act of faith or
beleeving is not an act of adoration, as the schoolmen
acknowledge, nor is it expressed outwardly by kneeling,

23. By the same reason all the faithfull are preferred to
this dignity. As wee are friends and fellow-heires with
Christ, so hath hee instituted this holy feast, the onely
feast in the Christian Church, to assure us of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
and fellowship with him. Howsoever then
otherwise, and at other occasions wee behave our selves
as supplicants, we are now according to our Lords will
and pleasure, to observe that externall forme of a feast,
which he hath left to his Church, and to act thereat in
our outward carriage the persons of guests and friends.
And therefore, howbeit the inviter be a great person, the
manner of invitation is familiar, and our not acceptance
the more offensive. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> declaiming against such
as were present, and did not approach to communicate,
saith, <note place="margin">Hom. 3. in epist ad E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesios.</note>

the first part of the comparison, they bid not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants
sit downe. But they must kneel and receave,


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7886:71"/>
that which is reached to them. So that there is no more
use of the table, then if it were a cupbord or altar.
Fourthly, if we should kneel, because we are receaving a
gift, by this reason wee should kneel, when wee receave
any benefite or gift of God, as for example, when we are
taking, eating, drinking, our ordinarie meat and drinke.
If yee will say, the sacramentall is holy bread, the other
common, then yee confesse ye kneel, because of the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that is, the setting a part of it to a holy use, and that
is idolatrie. If ye will say, ye receave a greater gift, then
when yee receave your ordinarie food, that is no more,
but then there is a greater motive. Yet, if because a gift,
then whensoever, or whatsoever gift ye receave, ye ought
to kneel. God deserveth thankes for the least of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
and is to bee adored for whatsoever benefite spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
or temporall receaved, in the time of divine service,
or out of it. For this is the common doctrine of the
school men, <note place="margin">Vazquez de adorat. disp. 94. num. 7.</note>

the one, nor the other doth follow. For wee crave our

taxing of Christ, and his Apostles, and all others in
ancient time, or in reformed Churches, who have not
kneeled. And if there were no more, this alone may let
them see the weaknesse of their reasoning.</p>
                  <p>Seeing kneeling in the act of receaving the sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

divines construing charitably, some old Writers, or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
counterfeit workes for genuing, have imagined.
We may observe other ushers to have prepared the way
for bread worship by kneeling. After that the virgine
times of the first age or prime primitive, that is the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall
times were past, changes entered. They were
not content to sit, but at some time, and more frequently
stood. They left off distribution and breaking of bread
with other, and receaved out of the minister or deacons
hand. Other words were substitute in place of Christs
words. In processe of time, the women might not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave
the bread with their naked hand, but in a clean lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
cloath or napkin. And in many places the cuppes
had pipes, whereby they sucked the wine out of the
cuppe. At length the Communicants were not suffered

to receave with their hands, but in at their mouther.

God to choose any person, or any thing to consecrate
and sanctifie it to himselfe. <hi>Willets,</hi> that it belongeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Creatour, to sanctifie the creature. <hi>Perkinse,
Kuchlinus,</hi> and others, say the like. Master <hi>Cowper,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

church could make an holy day. The like was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by Master <hi>Galloway,</hi> in one of his Christmas ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
But so it is, that God hath permitted six dayes to
man for the worke of his calling, and selected the seventh
to himselfe, to be spent in his service. Seeing therefore
God hath given libertie to man to worke six dayes, and
counteth them common and prophane, no man ought to
be compelled to keep them holy, but when God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
maketh exception, as hee did by the yoke of some
anniversarie dayes under the law, or calleth us to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
humiliation or thanksgiving. The civill magistrat
may command cessation from worke for a politick end,
as weapon-showing, exercise of armes, defence of a city
or sort of the countrey, but that is not to enjoyne a holy
day, nor yet a meere idle day, but that oeconomicall and

                     <p>The Doctour saith, some dayes were made holy, not
onely because they were dedicated to the worship of
God, but because a speciall worship was appointed by
God, and appropriated to them, as the feast of the passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,

to them. He saith, our divines meane only, that it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proper to God, to make dayes holy after the first
manner, but not after the second, which is false, as may
appear by their description of sanctifying a day, which is
generally to set it apart to an holy use, and not to a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
only. Next, by such an answer men make holy
dayes like the Lords day.</p>
                     <p>His comparison with the temple of Jerusalem, and the
synagogues and Christian churches will not helpe him,
unlesse the synagogues and Christian churches answer in
holinesse to the sabbath and the Lords day, as hee saith,
the temple did to the anniversarie feasts, which, I trust,
hee will not maintaine. And this same comprison of
time and place shall cleare and confirme our argument.
For as no man can sanctifie a place, or make it holy but
God, that is, set it so apart from all worldly uses, that it
shall bee a prophaning of it to entertaine any worldly
purpose or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>riste in it, or carrie a vessell through it, and to
be bound to holy exercises in it, otherwise it cannot bee
said to be sanctified, and set apart to God, if it stand up
like an idol, so no man can sanctifie a day, that is, set it so
apart to God, that when it recurreth weekly, monethly,
or yearly, we must not use worldly, but must use holy
exercises. But the first is true, none but God can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
such a place, and under the new testament he hath
appointed no such place. Christian churches or houses
are builded for the commoditie of Gods people to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them from the injurie of the weather, to serve them
to sit in commodiously, when they are conveened to
serve God, which use is civill, and is common to houses
builded for civill meetings. The congregation may

meet in that house, but may forsake it, and take them to
another. But if it were sanctified and set apart to God,
they should be bound to use it. Our churches then are

that God is more moved, when the faithfull meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the houres appointed for preaching in the weeke, or
prayers morning and evening. For these are not houres
sanctified, or consecrated to Gods service, but the most
convenient times men finde in their wisedome, when
most may resort to hearing of sermons and prayers,
which m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

offer a more convenient time. So time is designed oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally,

serve Gods people, and not Gods people made to serve
the time, or to serve God, because it is a holy time.</p>

for his worship, and not onely that, but also competent
and sufficient times. But nature cannot lead us without
further direction, to setle upon one of the seven dayes,
more then upon one of eight, ten or twelve. The Lord
set downe one in the circle of seven to bee observed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually,
and universally by all that were to worship
him. In his wisedome he could best discerne what time
might be spared. In respect of this perpetuity, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality
this determination participateth of the nature
of a law morall. For this cause it was placed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue
among the precepts purely morall, and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated
with them of the same prerogatives. It was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by God himselfe, written in tables of stone, and
preserved in the arke as the rest were. The determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of such a seventh day in particular, was made also
by the Lord. Both the determinations are divine posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
the first unchangeable, the second changeable, but
yet only by divine authoritie. The ten precepts of the

In the fourth commandement, there are three
preceptive sentences. The first is the principall. Some
reason after this manner. The Lord saith not, <hi>Remember
thou, keepe holy the seventh day,</hi> but <hi>Remember thou, keepe
holy the sabbath-day,</hi> and in the end, <hi>he sanctified the sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day,</hi>
hee saith not that seventh day from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
howbeit it was so for the time. But that seventh
was to be changed, and the sabbath was to be fixed upon
another seventh day. But to come nearer to the purpose,
that this commandement requireth not directly the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day from the creation, but the seventh day in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
appeareth by the reason, which enforceth not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarly
the seventh day from the creation, that wee
should rest the same day that the Lord rested, but that
wee should rest from our workes the seventh day, as hee
rested from his. Which seventh, as under the law he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be saturday, so under the Gospell, sunday, the
substance of the commandement remaining. See Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Cartwrights</hi> Catechisme. <note place="margin">pag, 110.</note> But to come yet nearer.
The Lord might have created the world in six houres, as
easily as in six dayes. Hee might have done it in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or have taken eight ten or twelve dayes. The
Lord would do neither the one, nor the other, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
himselfe to that space of time, which in his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
he thought sufficient for man to doe all manner of
workes of his owne. This paterne doth not concerne
his peculiar people of the Jewes onely, but both Jew and


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7886:83"/>
Gentile, and not for a time onely, but to the end of the
world, as if the Lord would reason after this manner
with mankinde, What needed me to have spent six dayes
in creating the world, for I might have done it in one?
or wherefore stinted I my selfe at six, I might have taken
ten? you may easily then consider wherefore I have
done it. I did it, that thou may doe the like: Do all thy
workes and businesse in six dayes, and rest the seventh.
The imitation lieth in this then, not so much that wee
rest upon such a seventh day, as upon a seventh. There is
equitie in it indeed, that seeing the Lord hath granted us
six dayes to worke, wee should rest the seventh, but the
force of the reason lieth chiefly in this, that the Lord
purposly tooke six dayes, and rested the seventh, to be a
paterne to men, howbeit with all in setting downe that
paterne, he considered that equity.</p>
               <p>That the precept concerning the sabbath, concerned
not the Jewes onely, but all mankinde, appeareth also by
this, that it was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in the beginning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.

the reason given for the observation of the sabbath,
was not, that the Lord rained Manna six dayes, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
the seventh, which concerned onely the Iewes, but
that hee created all in six dayes, and rested the seventh,
which concerned all mankinde. Were it not ridiculous
to imagine, that God spent six dayes in creating the
world, and rested the seventh, onely for the Iewes, to
whome hee was to intimate the sabbath 2453. yeares
after.</p>
               <p>But ye will say, what needed <hi>Adam</hi> a sabbath-day in
the state o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

of the gard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n was committed to him, and he was to live
an animall life, which would draw with it some distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Therefore the Lord would have a day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
wherein he might be wholy sequestrat from other
affaires. Further, howbeit <hi>Adam</hi> was in the state of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie,
yet his state was mutable. Whereas it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that there was no positive precept given to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
in paradise, but the eating of the forbidden tree, I
answer, none meerly positive, but that. But this is not
meerly positive, but determinative, of the indefinit time
required by the law of nature, which urgeth a time for
sequestration. Some thinke, that <hi>Adam</hi> fell the same
day that he was created, and therefore that the sabbath


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7886:85"/>
was sanctified after his fall. But the imposing of the
names upon the creatures, the precept concerning the
forbidden tree, the tentation of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> &amp;c.
move others to thinke otherwayes. <hi>Lyd at</hi> agreeth not,
either with too short time, or yet three yeares, which
were too long, but with those who alledge eight moneth
wanting a week, that hee might be the more sensible of
his fall and defection, after hee had for a certaine space
enjoyed the pleasures of that estate. But suppose <hi>Adam</hi>
fell upon the sixt day, yet the sanctification of the sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
after, was for all mankinde, and not the Iewes
onely.</p>
               <p>But yet we have no mention made, <note place="margin">The sabbath observed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Moses time.</note> that the Patriarchs
observed it. What then? It is sufficient, that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
howbeit the observation had beene neglected.
But wee must judge more charitably of the holy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,
that they were observant of the institution recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by tradition from <hi>Adam. They receaved the law of
sacrifices and other positive lawes, by revelation, by oracle,
and by d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">pag. 45.</note> saith Doctour <hi>Francis White</hi> in
his treatise of the sabbath. Is it likely then, they obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not a set day, or wanted direction what day to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
or that the Lord would hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> set any other day for
ordinarie. Some gather the observation from <hi>Noahs</hi>
sending forth the dove the seventh day after her returne,
and againe the seventh day. That it is likely, <hi>Noah</hi> was
taken up with holy exercises, every seventh day hee sent
forth the dove, and that he sent it forth rather then, then
any other time, because hee was craving and expecting
good successe. But I will not stand upon this. <hi>Junius</hi>
approveth the opinion of the Hebrew Doctours, who
all agree, that there passed seven dayes betweene the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7886:85"/>
of the people out of Egypt, and the drowning of the
Egyptians in the red sea, and therefore there were seven
dayes appointed for the feast of the passeover. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
their opinion with his owne reckoning in his
<hi>annot. upon Exod.</hi> 12. Vpon <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. he noteth, that is
was the sabbath, that day <hi>Pharaohs</hi> hoast was drowned,
and the people of Israel sang that song of triumph,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 15. The Apostle in the Epistle to the Hebrewes,
<hi>chap.</hi> 4. proveth, that there is a sabbatisme me, or keeping of
a sabbath yet remaining for the people of God, and all
beleevers, whereinto the incredulous were not to enter,
and to this purpose citeth a passage out of the psalmes.
There the incredulous are threatned to be excluded from
rest, which was to come: For there were two rests al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
past in <hi>Davids</hi> time, the one beginning at the rest
of God from his workes, which were finished from the
foundation of the world, and the other, when <hi>Josue</hi>
brought the people into the land of Canaan. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
enumeration had not beene sufficient, if the sabbath
day had not beene observed from the beginning: for he
maketh not mention of another sabbatisme past before
<hi>Davids</hi> time, but two, whereinto man entred. There
was no oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r sabbath then in <hi>Davids</hi> time, beside that
rest in Canaan, except that which was from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and consequently the sabbath observed in his time,
was all one with that which was observed from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
The rest of the sabbath is called Gods rest or
sabbath, because God was the instituter of it, gave exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
himselfe to man, and appointed it for his owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 1. and 28. 2. <hi>Jesa. 56. 4. Ezech.</hi> 20. 20.

only for Gods owne proper rest or sabbath, the Apostles


<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7886:86"/>
reasoning had not beene pertinent: for <hi>David</hi> maketh
mention of a rest, whereinto men might enter, and were
exhorted to enter in, but men cannot be said to enter in
Gods owne proper rest. The sabbatisme which is to
come, is called Gods rest, and yet men are said to enter
in it. Further, if the first rest were so called only, because
it was Gods owne peculiar rest, it would fol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Seeing the sabbath was observed from the beginning,
it was not instituted in the wildernesse, but only renewed
to the people of God, and enjoined to them with so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie,
both because of their owne neglect, or forced
prophanation in Egypt, as also, because it was neglected
among other nations, who observed it not, or not in the
right manner, but rather prophaned then sanctified it.
The question ariseth, whether it was then onely morall,
or partly morall, partly ceremoniall. But the question


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7886:88"/>
should bee stated other wayes. For there is a difference
betweene these two questions, whether the sabbath of
the Jewes was partly morall, partly ceremoniall, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the fourth precept, as it standeth in the decalogue,
was partly morall, partly ceremoniall. That the Iewish
sabbath was partly morall, partly ceremoniall, is the
commun and receaved opinion, which, for mine owne
part, I would be loath to contradict, even taking cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall
for typicall and profigurative of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
forus by Christ. But it followeth not, that the
fourth precept, as it standeth in the decalogue, is partly
morall, partly ceremoniall in that scene, that is typicall
and prefigurative. There is nothing in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
as it was promulgat upon mount Sinai, ranked
among the rest of the morall precepts; placed in the
midst, and written with Gods owne finger in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ibles of
stone, that soundeth any way to typicall ceremonie. At
other times when the ceremonies of the law were inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated,
then were typicall and ceremoniall precep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

delivered. It is true, when the fourth precept was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated,
it was accommodated to the state of man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his fall. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that day from all manner of workes, which might give
offence to Gods people, which needed not to be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the state of innocencie, or, if mankinde had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued

of persons bound to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

The reason in the precept is morall, and the end of the
cessation and rest is morall, to wit, to sanctifie, and keepe
holy the sabbath-day. To <hi>sanctifie</hi> is taken in a generall

This maketh nothing to the purpose; for the word <hi>san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie</hi>

Iewes and Christians. The mutabilatie of the seventh
day from the creation, maketh it not ceremoniall; for a
thing may bee mutable, and not ceremoniall. To ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
the seventh day to bee observed and sanctified, is
not a ceremonie, unlesse the word <hi>ceremonie</hi> be abused,
and taken more largely, then for a thing significant or
typicall. It is properly but a politick order, determining
a time for the worship of God, To bee a memoriall of
the creation, and Gods rest the seventh day followed
indeed upon the observation of that day, but was not the
only nor principall end of the institution; for then that
should have beene the chiefe or onely exercise on that
day, to contemplate and meditate upon the creatures.
God propoundeth his worke of creation, and resting the

               <p>The Jewish sabbath which was the seventh day from
the creation, <note place="margin">The satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day sabbath changed.</note> was abolished at the resurrection of Christ,
because it had types and ceremonies annexed to it, which
were shadowes of things to come. The ground ceasing,
the observation of that day ceased also; for the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
flee away when the body commeth in place.
Yea further, I will yeeld, that the abrogation was meant
by the Apostle, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 17. and under the name of sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
there, is to bee meant onely the weekly sabbath,
which is more then <hi>White</hi> craveth. Not that I thinke,
they answer sufficiently to those, who will have the
word to be applied to the first and last day of anniversary
feasts, which were also called sabbaths. But because I
thinke these to bee comprehended under the name of
feasts, whereof these sabbaths were the principall, and
most solemne dayes. So that here is a perfite division of
all their solemne dayes, to wit, that they were either
feasts, to wit, anniversarie dayes, or new moones, which
returned monethly, or the sabbath, which returned
weekly. I so thinke the rather, because we have the like
division, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 31. where the Levits office is set
downe, <hi>to offer burnt sacrifices unto the Lord, in the sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,
in the new moones, and on the set feasts.</hi> And againe, in

this sense: for so is the weekly sabbath usually expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

Suppose it had not beene a shadow, yet even as it was

is morall positive, it might have beene changed for a

the former. For the resurrection of Christ, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his triumph, after he had ended his course of hu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miliation,
was a greater reason for making choice of the

went in to their synagogue, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. upon their sabbath,
that was not for the observation of their sabbath, but
because hee could not finde the Iewes assembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

wherein the Church was builded, and setting down

day like the Lords day, or else the Church universall. If
every nationall Church, then they might have differed,
and hallowed sundrie dayes. If the Church universall,
that could not be brought to passe but in the representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
an oecumenicall councell. None such could be had
for 300 yeares after Christ. But so the hallowing of such
a day had beene suspended for 300 yeares. If the Church
may institute such a day, it may abrogate it also, and
change at pleasure. If the Church, or ordinarie pastours
may institute such a day, they may make lawes binding

be no such day for the Lord, then wee deny to him that

The observation of the Lords day is not like the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
unwritten verities, for it is extant in the scripture,
but the question is about the precept. We confesse pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
say they, but where is precept? I answer, their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice

Adde also, that the observation was uniforme in all
the Churches, and constant, which presupposeth a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
an ordinance, or institution. For what likelihood
is there, that one began, and the rest every one after
other followed the example of others that went before
in practice, and that this way the observation crept in by
exemple, and did grow to a custome. The places above
cited make mention of the first day of the weeke, and
the Lords day not as then begun, but as knowne and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
before, even at the Pentecost, before the holy
Ghost descended upon the Apostles. And yet <hi>Rivetus</hi>
inferreth a precept out of 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 16. where the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
are directed every first day of the weeke, to lay
aside some thing for the poore, where, howbeit the
chiefe intention of the Apostle is to give direction for
the helpe of the poore, yet because hee will have it to
be done the first day of the weeke, it followeth that hee
willeth also, that they should dedicate the Lords day to
the solemne assembling of the Church, for hee that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
the end, intendeth also the midst, <hi>Vbi etsi prima

and to endure onely for a time, as abstinence from
bloud, and strangled, which was enjoyned only for avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the offence of the weake Jewes: others were to
bee observed constantly. Of this sort was the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Lords day. Experience hath proved the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
observation of it hitherto, and no reason can bee
given, wherefore it should bee changed hereafter, as I

divines, referring the institution of this day to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.

instructions, they delivered after to the Churches, and
set them downe in their canonicall writes. Next, Christ
himselfe appeared, the day of his resurrection five times.
At the third appearance, hee appeared to the two disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
going to Emaus, at which time hee celebrated the
holy supper according to the judgement of great divines.
At the fifth appearance, he appeared to all the disciples,
save <hi>Thomas,</hi> who were conveened together before.
Then he gave them commission to goe and teach all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and in conferring his spirit hee breathed upon
them, <hi>John 20. Mark.</hi> 16. Eight dayes after, that is, the

day upon the fourth commandement, some upon the
sanctification of the seventh day at the creation, other
seeke for authority out of the new Testament; but all
these three agree in one. For the fourth commandement
was but a renovation of the first institution after the
creation. The substance of the commandement is to
observe a seventh day, the renewing the appointment of
that seventh day of the first weeke, was a circumstantiall
point, and therefore it was changeable, like as for some
types and ceremonies annexed to it, it behoved to bee
changed. The institution of the Lords day, was but a
substitution of another day to that which was, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
remaining, to wit, that the seventh day of a weeke
be sanctified. For, as I observed before, the force of


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7886:96"/>
Gods example alledged in the fourth commandement,
lieth in this chiefly, that God purposly tooke six dayes
to create the world, whereas he might have done it in six
houres, and rested upon the seventh; not in this, that he
created in those six dayes, and rested upon that seventh
day, which followed immediatly after: for the Lord
saith, <hi>for in six dayes,</hi> not, <hi>for in those six dayes.</hi> God made
choise of that seventh day at that time to sanctifie it, to
bee a memoriall of his rest from the worke of creation
that seventh day. When Christ rose from the dead, and
a new creation, as it were, of a new world was begunne,
there was greater reason to sanctifie that day, howbeit
there had beene no types and ceremonies annexed to the
former, farre more seeing it behoved to bee abolished.
The seventh day in the precept is to be considered mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially,
as it were, or formally. As it is considered for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,
and in generall, it is of the substance of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
but consider it materially, as the seventh from the
creation, it is not of the substance of the commandment.
The seventh day may bee considered both the wayes: <note place="margin">S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

These are the common phrases of divines; that
the old sabbath was changed into the first day of the

God had not an eye to the mysteries, or hid vertue
which is in the number of seven, but to the abilitie of
man. The sabbath was made for man, and not man for
the sabbath.</p>
               <p>Our reason the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the perpetuity of a sevenths day sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
to be sanctified, that this order cannot be changed,
that it is of the substance of the fourth commandement,
are these. First, if by vertue of the fourth precept of the
decalogue, wee bee not bound to sanctifie one day of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
then we have no divine precept for any certaine cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
or circuit of dayes for the sanctification of a certaine
day: for no where in scripture have we any precept for
any other revolution of dayes to observe one of them.
Without a certain and set systeme of dayes there would
arise great confusion and division in the Church of


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7886:97"/>
God, some judging one of ten, others perhaps one of
twenty, or thirty suffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ient, &amp;c. It behoved th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Lord
therefore by his supreme authoritie to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>int the time, to
exeeme all Scruples out of mens mindes, and to prevent
all confusion and disorder. No humane authoritie could
have bound mens conscience to the observation of it.
The Lord no where hath done it, but in the fourth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.
Next, the reason in the precept concerneth us all,
for as I have said before, the Lord tooke six dayes to
creat the world, no moe, no fewer, and rested the seventh
to be a paterne to man, many hundred yeares before the
Iewes became a nation, and in that precept, which was a
renewing of the institution, commandeth us to follow
that paterne. Thirdly, the proportion betweene the six
dayes for man to doe his owne businesse, and the seventh
to be dedicated to God, is so just, that it cannot bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
without prejudice; for to give man but five, were
an heavie burthen, to give him seven, or eight, or moe,
the time set apart for God would not be sufficient. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
wee will thinke God exacted more then was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
when he required the seventh. But we must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that God is good, and wee professe equity in his
precept, in that he hath given us six dayes, and taken but
the seventh to himselfe. And who was so wise, as to finde
out this proportion without prejudice either to God or
man. <note place="margin">1. 2. quaest. 100. art. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> as these
of the third. And to this ranke may this proportion bee
referred. But wee are content to urge it onely as divine
positive, but unchangeable, as the rest of the morall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
are. So that the fourth precept is partly divine
naturall, that God must have a time set for his worship,
partly divine positive, that he must have one whole day
of seven. Fourthly, Christ or the Apostles would not
varie from this circle, when they changed the seventh
day from the last to the first day of the weeke, but kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
themselves within that circle, which they might
and would have done, if the fourth precept had beene
given onely to the Jewes, or the circuit had been cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall,
and had relation onely to the Iewish sabbath.
And this is an argument by the way, that this systeme
of seven, or circuit of the weeke, was set from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
The reason of the institution of the Lords day,
saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">De cultu sanct. lib. 3. c. 11.</note> was, that it might succeed to the sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
<hi>for divine law required, that one day in the weeke
should bee dedicated to divine worship. Nam jus divinum
requirebat, ut unus dies hebdomadae dedicaretur cultui divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no.</hi>
And seeing it was not convenient that the old sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
should bee still observed, it was changed into the
Lords day. For the perpetuity of one of seven, the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of many divines may bee alledged. <note place="margin">Homil. 10. in gen. 2.</note>

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7886:99"/>
weeke. It is not onely unfit, and unconvenient, but it
cannot bee changed. Not because of the nature of the
day, for it differeth not in nature from another day,
more then the former sabbath. If the former sabbath
had beene holier in nature then other dayes, it could not
have beene changed. But the reason of the immutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the Lords day is, that it was set downe by divine
authority, and therefore cannot bee abrogated by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
authoritie of princes, pastours, or prelates. Wee
must not looke for Christ till his comming againe, nor
for any to arise hereafter equall in power and authority
to the Apostles. Next, the consideration taken in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
choise of this day, cannot serye for another day.
Christ is not to suffer death, and rise againe at any other
time. A weightier consideration to make a new change,
will never fall forth, then the resurrection of Christ. And
therefore nowbeit the Church had instituted it, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

which have so fixed the determination, that this

not against all difference of dayes, but the ceremoniall,
or dead judaicall. The weaker Jewes; <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. thought
the holy dayes commanded by God in the old law, were
still holier then other dayes. The Apostle willeth such
to be borne with, till they come to the fuller knowledge
of their Christian libertie. The Galathians had beene
converted from paganisme, had begun in the spirit, but
were now by the persuasion of the false apostles, like to
end in the flesh, beginning to observe the dayes, moneths,
and yeares, which the Jewes observed of old: <hi>Dayes,</hi>
that is, their weekly sabbaths; <hi>Moneths,</hi> that is, their
new moones; <hi>Yeares,</hi> that is, their yearly dayes, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversarie
feasts; or <hi>tymes</hi> and <hi>yeares,</hi> that is, <hi>Statuta
tempora annorum,</hi> the appointed times of the yeares. For
by the same reason, that <hi>moneths</hi> may be taken for new
moones, <hi>yeares</hi> may be taken for yearly dayes. I see no
likelihood, that they observed the seventh or fifty yeare.
This exposition agreeth with the division of the Iewish
solemnities, whereof I made mention before. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of such dayes, is taxed here, as were in some
respect, of the quality of the new moones and yearly
feasts. Now these were the sabbaths. This ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
difference was abrogated, but the morall use of a
set holy day was not taken away. For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the Lords day was observed, and by the Galathians in

to set a day is not a shadowing ceremonie more then to
designe a place for the congregation to meet in, but a
matter belonging to order. But there was more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to this day. For it was not instituted only for order
and policie, that the people might know what dayes to
conveene to publike, exercises, howbeit it was one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.
Times may bee appointed for preaching and
prayer on the weeke dayes by any particular Church.
But there is more required here, a day to be obseved
holy by the universall Church, not only for publike wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
but also for privat, not onely for externall, but also
for internall, which could not be done but by divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
which is supreme, and onely able to binde the
conscience to internall as well as externall, to privat as
well as to publick worship, as I have said before.</p>
               <p>The last point which I am to touch, <note place="margin">The manner of observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> is concerning the
strictnesse of the observation: Whither we be bound to
as strict observation of the Lords day, as the Jewes were
of their sabbath. The superstitious observation of the
Iewes wee are not bound unto. For they observed that
day more precisely, then God required. They found
fault with Christ healing of the sicke man upon the sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
and the sicke mans carrying home of his bed. They
have had, and have many foolish observations, as not to
pull to an herb on the sabbath, nor to eat an aple which
they pluck upon that day, nor claw with their nailes in
publike, nor catch a flea unlesse it bite. Let us then see,
what God hath forbidden them. They were bidden
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ake that which they had to bake upon the sixt day, and


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7886:100"/>
seeth that they had to seeth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 23. and forbidden
to kindle a fire upon the seventh day. But that which
was baken and seethed upon the sixt day, a part of it was
not reserved to the seventh day, but that which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
over unbaken and unsodden. The text importeth
no further, for if it had beene baken or sodden, they
would perhaps have attributed the not putrifying upon
the seventh day to the baking or seething. It was food
that might bee eaten without baking, like comfites or
fruit. It seemeth then this injunction was given onely
during the time the manna rained. If this direction had
beene to bee observed afterward, they might not have
eaten any thing which was baken two dayes before. Is
it likely that Christ and others bidden to the Pharisees
house upon the sabbath-day, had no meat dressed for
them by baking of seething. The kindling of fire was
forbidden, not simply, but for baking or seething the
manna, as some thinke, and therefore endured onely so
long as the manna lasted, howbeit the most superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sort of the Jewes in later times observed it. It is
noted of the Essens, <note place="margin">Drusius de tribus sectis, lib. 4.</note> a strict sect of the Jewes, as singular
in them, that they kindled no fire upon the sabbath-day.
They were commanded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 29. to abide
every man in his place, and not to goe out of their tents,
at lest out of the campe. This was but temporarie. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
they might take journey upon the sabbath to
the Prophets or synagogues, 2 <hi>King. 4. 23. Levit</hi> 23. 3.
Yea, if they were not to journey for that, the Scribes
prescrived to them 2000 cubits, that is a mile or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
out of a towne or citie, which was called the sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-dayes-journey.
But afterward they became more
superstitious, not taking up the Lords intent, in that place


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7886:101"/>
of Exodus, as the Jew that would not be drawne out of
the jackes, wherein he had fallen upon the sabbath-day.
So howbeit the Iewes should be superstitious now in not
kindling fire, that is no warrant that the direction was
not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>oratie. Some thinke, this prohibition served
onely during the workmanship of the tabernacle. But
let it bee granted, that both the one direction and the
other were to endure during the policie of the Iewes, I
denie that they were forbidden by vertue of the fourth
precept of the decalogue. They would and might have
kindled fire notwithstanding of the fourth precept.
Their rest upon the sabbath was ceremoniall and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative.
And because ceremoniall and figurative, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">pag. 31.</note> and <hi>Dow</hi> after him, with others,
it behoved to be more strict, exact, and rigid. For the
more exact the figure is, the better it representeth and
signifieth. So granting, that dressing and preparing of
meat by fire were not a temporarie precept during the
manna, yet it depended upon the ceremoniall rest and
typicall state of Gods people under the law. They ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
from the buriall of the dead upon the sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
2 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 12. 39. because if any touched the dead,
or entred into the house where the dead lay, or touched
a grave, was uncleane seven dayes, <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. 14. 16. and
consequently they might not enter into the tabernacle.
Here a duty forbidden for legall uncleannesse, which
bindeth not us. The prophanation of the sabbath was
a capitall crime, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 14. but this law bindeth not
us. The workes depending upon the ceremoniall rest,
or any particular ceremonie bindeth not us, but only the
workes inhibited in the fourth precept, wherein the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall
and iudicall precepts are not included, but


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7886:101"/>
onely annexed to them, as peculiar unto that people,
which was under the tutorie, and paedagogie of the
law. <hi>Aquinas</hi> saith, that the ceremoniall and judiciall
precepts are not contained in the decalogue. <note place="margin">Secunda, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundae qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

anniversarie, but a weekly day. It is not instituted for
the commemoration of a particular benefite, but for the
worship of God at large, as the morall law requireth, and
as the old sabbath did. For howbeit that day, was made

enjoyned nothing concerning fasting or eating, either
the first time that he sanctified the seventh day, or after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
when he gave the manna. The Lords day succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the roome of the old sabbath, as it standeth in the
decalogue, is of the same qualitie. Wee may lawfully
fast upon the Lords day, which were absurd to dee upon
our anniversarie feast dayes. It is true, that in the ancient
Church it was thought a hainous thing to fast upon the
Lords day. So did they also forbid to pray kneeling
that day, to signifie their joy for Christs resurrection.
This use of signification or testification was the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of much superstition, and brought in a heap of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
some of which the Papists themselves were

of the institution had beene solide, it should become
us no lesse then them to pray standing upon the Lords
day. But the ground was naught. The like may bee
said of not fasting upon the Lords day. Some reason
they had indeed not to fast upon this day, when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees
and Priscillianists fasted; for the Manichees fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
ordinarily upon the Lords day, lest they should
seeme to rejoyce for the resurrection of Christ, which

ordinarily upon the Lords day, and the nativitie day.
But when there are no knowne Manichees, nor Priscil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianists,
there is not the like reason for not fasting. But
the extremities should be avoided. To thinke it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to fast that day, or unlawfull to dine and breake our
fast, are both without warrant, and superstitious. But to
fast upon occasion, or in time of any imminent judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is lawfull. When <hi>Paul</hi> continued preaching upon
the sabbath till midnight at Troas, before the tasted any
thing, or the rest were refreshed with meat, this conceat
of not fasting upon the Lords day, had not entred in the
Church. Was <hi>Paul</hi> a Manichaean, saith <hi>Hierome,</hi> because

were a festivall day, it should follow, that we should not

               <p>Now we proceed in our reasons against festivall dayes.</p>
               <div type="reason">
                  <head>THE II. REASON.</head>
                  <p>NOne appointed holy festivities under the laws
when the times were more ceremonious, but
God himselfe.</p>
                  <p>The dayes of <hi>Purim</hi> were called simply the dayes of
<hi>Purim,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The dayes of Purim</note> not the holy dayes of <hi>Purim.</hi> They were not

                     </hi> No peculiar sacrifice was appointed,
nor any holy convocation of the people enjoyned. The
ordinance required but feasting and joy, and sending of
portions to other. The rest mentioned <hi>Esther</hi> 9. was
onely from their enemies. So much worke as might
stand with a feasting day was not forbidden. Suppose
they had rested altogether from worke, that would only
prove an idle day, but not an holy day. Our Doctour
therefore hath no warrant to say, <note place="margin">pag. 18.</note> that they were made
holy dayes by <hi>Mordecay.</hi> Afterward, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>nt the rest
of the day in revelling and riotousnesse. Next these
dayes were instituted by Mordecai, and therefore were
called Mordecai's dayes, 2 <hi>Maccahab. last chap. vers.</hi> 37.
<hi>Sixtus Senensis</hi> saith, <note place="margin">Biblioth li. p. 20.</note> he is thought to be the penman of
the booke of <hi>Esther,</hi> he was one of the 120. of which the
great synagogue consisted, of which number were <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie,
Daniel, Ezra,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">De sacram. pag. 206.</note> and <hi>Malachie. Whitaker</hi> thinketh
<hi>Mordecai</hi> did this, God inspiring him, or perhaps by
the advice or warrant of some Prophet, and doubteth
not, but it was done by divine authoritie. Many things
might have beene done then by their direction, the like
whereof wee have not now. Thirdly, it appeareth
<hi>Esther</hi> 9. 28. that this custome was to bee observed as
long as the feasts appointed by the Lord himselfe. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dayes of ecclesiasticall constitution are not of such a
nature as Doctour <hi>Fulk</hi> acknowledgeth. Fourthly, it
was not done without consent of the people of the
Jewes themselves, <note place="margin">Against the Rhem. Apoc. 1. 10. Contr. 3. l. 4. cap. 17. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

tooke upon them and their seed to keepe these two

but politike dayes, <note place="margin">3 part. decre. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Mordecai</hi> would not impose them
without their consent. The equitie of this is seene in the
Canon law, where bishops are forbidden to appoint any
particular festivall dayes within their diocies without
consent of the people. And there is good reason, seeing
they are to be withdrawne from their calling, I put now
the case they had power to make a holy or festivall day.
Lastly, can any prince or state make the like ordinance
for the posteritie, to feast, and send portions and gifts
one to other, or were it seemly to command feasting in
a Christian common-wealth, howbeit allowed, and in a


<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7886:106"/>
manner commanded to the Jewes. <note place="margin">Alstedii po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemic. p. 399.</note> 
                     <hi>Alstedius</hi> denieth
that the Christian Church can imitate the Jewes in the
like.</p>
                  <p>The memoriall dayes of the dedication mentioned, <note place="margin">The dayes of dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 22. serve as little for their purpose, for first, they
are not called, either 1 <hi>Macchab.</hi> 4. or here; the feast of
dedication, howbeit the English translatours without
warrant have translated the word dedication so, which
the Rhemists retaine without such a supplement. If any
supplement were needfull, it may be translated the dayes
of dedication, as the former were called the dayes of
Purim. And so they are called 1 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 4. 59. and in
the testimonie cited by <hi>Junius</hi> out of the Talmud. <hi>Joh.</hi>
10. If yee will call them the feast of dedication, because
of their bodily feasting, yet unlesse there was holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations

from worke, they cannot bee made a president for holy

they anniversarie holy dayes added to those the Lord
himselfe appointed. There was offering of sacrifices,
singing and playing upon instruments at the time of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of the altar eight dayes, but not enjoyned at
the yearly memoriall. Thirdly, <hi>Judas Maccabaeus</hi> and
his brethren, had the consent and assistance of the whole
congregation of Israel to this ordinance, 1 <hi>Macc. b.</hi> 4.
59. which is wanting to our festivall dayes, But <hi>Junius</hi>
citeth a testimonie out of the Talmud, bearing, that the

<hi>Drusius.</hi> We are not to imitate the inventions of Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,
or of such corrupt times as those of the <hi>Maccabces.</hi>
There was no yearly remembrance by solemnitie of
feast, not so much as of one for the dedication of the
whole temple, either the first under <hi>Salomon,</hi> or the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
under <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> nor for restoring of the temple by
<hi>Ezekias,</hi> after it was prophaned by <hi>Ahaz</hi> and <hi>Vrias,</hi> or
by <hi>Josias</hi> after it was polluted by <hi>Manasses</hi> and <hi>Amon.</hi>
But now there was an annuall memorie appointed for
renewing of the altar only, and other decayed places of
the temple. As for Christs conference in the porch of
the temple in the dayes of dedication, it proveth not
that he honoured that feast, as they call it, with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
Only the circumstance of the time is pointed at,
when that conference was, as the dayes of the shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread,
<hi>Act.</hi> 20. and of the fast, <hi>Act.</hi> 27. are mentioned,
to note a circumstance of time, but not that <hi>Paul</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them. Christ came up to the feast of the tabernacles
before, and stayed in Jerusalem. In the meane time the
dayes of dedication fell forth, <note place="margin">De emendat. temp.</note> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
So Christ came not up to Ierusalem for this feast,
and went away in the time of it immediatly after this
conference. Further, Christ and his Apostles tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of frequent meetings to thrust their sickles in thick
harvests.</p>
                  <p>In a word the dayes instituted to Gods people, beside
such as God himselfe appointed, were either appointed
by extraordinarie warrant, or were not holy dayes, or
were the inventions of the pharisees, and corrupter
times.</p>

                     <hi>Galate potius Judaizabant quam astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicas
regidas servabant.</hi> Yet the Apostle reasoneth
against all observation of such like dayes as judaizing.
As if he had said, the observation of ceremoniall dayes,
moneths and yeares, was convenient for Gods people
under the law for their instruction, and to shaddow
things to come, because of their non-age, and was a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogicall
and rudimentarie instruction, which besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
not the state of a Christian Church, and clear light
of the Gospell. These dayes were all ceremoniall, yea,
the very dayes of <hi>Purim,</hi> and the dayes of dedication.

To celebrate the memorie of any particular act of


<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7886:108"/>
Christ at a set time in the yeare with cessation from

admitting of a fast at any time, is not to observe a day
morally, but ceremonially. Not to fast when such a day
of the yeare or weeke returneth, but to hold it festivall,
is to observe a day, as to fast yearly upon another day.
No doubt the Galatians observed not these dayes with
the Iewish worship of sacrifices and oblations, or as sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
of things to come, for then they had denied
Christ. Neither is it likely, that they neglected the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Easter and Pentecost, but yet the Apostle calleth it a
returning to the Iewish rudiments, that is, Iudaizing.
He instructeth the Corinthians, how they shall observe
Easter, to wit, all the yeare long with the unleavened
bread of sinceritie and truth, not after the Iudaicall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
If there had beene other festivall dayes, which
might have beene observed by Christians, the Apostle
having so faire occasion, would have directed them to
the observation of them, and not spoken so generally.

Lords dayes. <hi>Beatus Rhenanus</hi> in his annotations upon

nativitie, and consequently of the rest depending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
as of his circumcision, presentation, baptisme,
have beene hid from mortall men. And therefore the
day of Christs nativitie was observed diversly of old, by
some in one moneth, by some in another. The 25. of
December was grounded upon an erroneous conceat,
that <hi>Zacharie</hi> the father of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist was high
priest, which errour is yet fostered by observing that
day. Yee see then, as God hid the bodie of <hi>Moses</hi> for
avoiding of idolatrie, so hath he the day of Christs nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie
for avoiding superstition. And this is sufficient to
declare the will of God concerning other notable acts,
which were knowne, to wit, that not the act, but divine
institution maketh a day holy. Gods resting upon the
seventh day made it not holy, but his sanctifying of it,
and instituting it to be observed as holy. <hi>Ratio conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae

did no more consecrate the times, wherein they were
wrought, then his body did the manger, or the crosse by
touch. And suppose this might have beene, it would not
follow that all mangers and crosses are consecrated, no
more would it follow that every 25. day of December
should bee consecrated and made holy, because that
whereon he was borne (I put the case it were true) was
consecrated. <hi>Verum etiam non est, dies illos fuisse consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos

of them, but only keep them for order and policie, that
the people may be assembled to religious exercises, and


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7886:111"/>
instructed in the mysteries of religion. But that is false,
howbeit an old shift. The Papists themselves confesse,
that one day is not holier then another in the owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
no not the Lords day, but in respect of the use and
end. And in this respect our Formalists esteeme their
festivall dayes holier then other dayes, call them holy
dayes, and maintaine, as yee have heard before, that they
may be observed as holy dayes. If the observing of a
day holy for the honour of a saint be a worshipping of
the saint, the observing of a day to the honour of Christ
cannot bee without opinion of worship. If the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the Lords day as a festivall, as it is in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
be worship, the observing of their holy dayes is
worship. Whereas they alledge, that it is not worship,
because they hold not the like necessitie in observing the
one as the other, it will not helpe them. For that doth
not alter the nature of worship, but maketh the one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie,
because God instituted it, the other arbitrarie
and voluntarie, and consequently will-worship. The
same matter, forme, and end is in both, but God institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the one, and therefore lawfull, the other is instituted
at the pleasure of man, so it is worship, but a vicious
worship. Further, some other Formalists have of late
maintained the mutabilitie of the Lords day it selfe.

&amp;c. Are they not ordered according to the knowne or
supposed times, when such things fell forth? If it were
for order and policie, they were observed, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may assemble and be instructed, wherefore is there
but one day betweene the passion and the resurrection,
fourty betwixt the resurrection and ascension, and then
againe, but ten betwixt the ascension and whitsontide.
Wherefore follow wee the course of the moone in our
moveable feasts, and observe not a certaine day in the
moneth, as we doe for other. If we observed dayes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

not observe festivall dayes as the Jewes did, which were
holy, not only for the use whereunto they were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to serve as circumstances, but by reason also of their
mystik signification, and of the worship appropriated to
them, which might not bee performed at another time.

to bee made upon the five dayes, must not bee
omitted on these dayes. If it bee absurd to celebrate an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
day after the same manner with the same service,
and no other service will serve on these dayes; is there
not a peculiar service appropriated to our festival dayes,
as of old among the Jewes? <note place="margin">pag. 23. 18.</note> That shift is of no weight,
that a minister may preach, or wee may meditate upon
Christs passion another day, then the nativitie. For that
is not to celebrate with solemnitie. To use another day
with the like solemnitie in the place of it, or both, would
be thought very absurd. The Jewes themselves without
the service appropriated to their feasts, might remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
these same benefites and mysteries upon other
dayes, but not with the like solemnitie and peculiar ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
And so the solemnitie is tyed to the time. To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
dayes after this manner is not like the appointing
of houres, for preaching or prayers on weeke dayes or
times for the communion, according to the policie and
order set downe by everie particular congregation,
we tye not our selves to them, not any peculiar service
to any of them. Wee use time then onely as a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and for order, and not as a sacred time, let be as a
holy festivitie. Wee observe dayes after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that the Jewes did, howbeit not the same dayes, nor
with the same kinde of worship. The change of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance,
the day and manner of wotship, doth not
free us of Judaizing. <hi>Non sublata sed mutata est significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
dierum,</hi> saith <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> and so it is with the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists.
Wee doe not say that the anniversarie revolution
made the Jewish festivals ceremoniall, for in the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of time there was no mysterie, but the tying of
such a peculiar service to the time of anniversarie reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution

with such solomnitie. To performe the same du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

had not beene ceremoniall.</p>
                  <p>What then, they say, ought not Christs inestimable
benefites and notable acts to be remembred? I answer,
Yes, and so they are, for where the gospell is preached,
his acts are published. Christ is set forth crucified by
the preaching of the word, every communion day, his
passion and death is and will be remembred to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
againe. <note place="margin">De eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist. l. 3. c. 9.</note> The <hi>Eucharist,</hi> saith <hi>Bellarmine, est memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riale

day to use a peculiar kinde of service proper to
it. And without divine service, it were but an idle day,
not a holy day. The word of God is good of it selfe,

they dare, and will take upon them the rest of the rites
used in the English Church, laying of hands, &amp;c. we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as before, against confirmation, as it is used in the
English Church. Yet two things I perceave in the act as
it standeth. The one is, that the bishop is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound to
try by himselfe every one that is to be presented before
him, but only to try, whither the minister hath beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse
in catechising, and yet he must upon the report of
others blesse them with prayer, for the increase of
knowledge, and continuance of grace. Next, that he must
blesse who hath not a calling to blesse, that hee must
blesse as if hee were the pastour of all the souls within
the diocie old and young, which charge that null and
pretended assembly could not give him, seeing it hath
beene acknowledged before in free assemblies to have
no warrant in the word of God, and hath beene sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by our Church as a damnable office. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his blessing is but a prophanation with his fingers.
But what language is this, to say, that the bishop shall
blesse them with prayer, for to blesse is one thing, and to
pray another. For prayer seeketh of God good things
for us, but to blesse is in Gods name to assure us, that the
blessing of God is upon us, and shall accompanie us.
But let us come to their paterne.</p>
            <p>That which now the Papists make the sacrament of
confirmation, <note place="margin">The origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the act of the sacrament of confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> was of old a part of the solemnitie of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.
After the person was baptized, they laid on hands,
that is prayed for increase and continuance of grace to
the baptized, as we doe now, but without laying on of
hands, because it was a rite indifferent without any use,


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7886:115"/>
but to designe the person for whom the prayer was
made, and afterward abused to make up another sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Afterward entred a superstitious device, to strike
<hi>Chrisme,</hi> that is, oile of olives tempered with balme, in
manner of a crosse upon the forehead of the baptized.
This anointing in the forme of a crosse was called signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or consignation, because of the signe of the crosse
made upon the forehead. This unction or consignation,
and imposition of hands, became in the mindes of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
men so necessarie, that without them they
thought they had not gotten their perfite christendome,
that the signe of the oily crosse perfited baptisme, and
conferred the spirit of God upon the baptized. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s
consignation and imposition of hands at the closure of
baptisme was called confirmation, like as the giving of

But when it was found, that the bishop could not bee
present at every baptisme, the priest was permitted after
baptisme to anoint the baptized in the top of the head
with holy Chrisme, but he must not crosse the forehead.
That must bee reserved to the bishops leasure. Then
they were presented to the bishop to be confirmed, and

of hands to the bishop, and gave their priest power to

baptized, but without chrisme. Howbeit there bee no
greater antiquitie for the crossing without it then with
it, they call notwithstanding the bishops imposition
of hands onely confirmation, and not their priests cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

he saith, <hi>Wee receave this childe into the congregation of

was extraordinarie. The Apostles by imposition of
hands might conferre the gifts of tongues, prophesy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
healing, which <hi>Philip</hi> the Evangelist had not, and
therefore <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were sent to Samaria for that
end. For they had need of some to prophesie, and to
have the Gospell in these times confirmed to them by
such wonders. The effects of this imposition of hands
were sensible to these that were present. And therefore
<hi>Simon Magus</hi> would have bought with money that
gift which the Apostles had. Strength against tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
is a grace invisible, and given onely to the faithfull,
whereas the gifts of tongues, prophesying, healing,
might have beene given to the unregenerat. The bishop

I will let passe the different interpretation of Divines,
who thinke, some that it was that extraordinary, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
wee have made last mention, others that it is that
which was used in ordination of ministers. I will give;
that it was an ordinarie laying on of hands upon the
faithfull. But as it is joyned with baptisme in that place,


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7886:117"/>
so it seemeth to be that imposition of hands, which was
used in the end of baptisme, when the minister prayed
for persons baptized, that the Lord would increase and
continue his graces with them. The Apostle there oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the doctrine of the beginning, that is the catatheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
doctrine of repentance from dead workes, faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
from the dead, and eternall judgement, to the
doctrine of perfection. The converted Jewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
behooved to be catechised in these grounds suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
and tried before they could be baptized, and have
hands laid upon them. These were called <hi>Catechument,</hi>
till the time of their baptisme. Others apply it to the
children of the faithfull, and thinke that when they
come to age, and were fit for the communion, they were
after triall in the grounds of religion admitted with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of hands into the societie of communicants, <hi>in
ecclesiam adultorum,</hi> as <hi>Paraeus</hi> calleth them. But wee
finde that imposition of hands was used after, as a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie
in the end of baptisme, even in the baptizing of
infants; Yet this laying on of hands upon the baptized,
was, as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>gestus orantis,</hi> the behaviour of
him that prayed for, or blessed any particular person, a
gesture used both under the old and new testament. As
ye may see, when <hi>Jacob</hi> blessed the sonnes of <hi>Joseph,
Genes.</hi> 48. when <hi>Moses</hi> laid hands upon <hi>Josua, Num.</hi> 27,
Such as had power, laid hands on these that were to bee
admitted to an office in the Church, <hi>Acts 6. 1 Tim.</hi> 4.
The teachers and prophets at Antioch upon <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Barnabus,</hi> when they were separated for the worke to
which the Lord called them, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. Yea, the elders who
were admitted to be Counsellers in the great Synedrion,
and the Rabbins who were promoved to their degree


<pb n="216" facs="tcp:7886:118"/>
of Doctourship were admitted and promoved with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of hands. So it was used in actions both civill
and religious, and in religious it served to be an indicant
signe of the particular person whom they were to pray
for, or blesse. For when they were to blesse or pray for
moe, they lifted up their hands, <hi>Levit. 9. 22. Luke</hi> 24. 10.
See also <hi>Drusius.</hi> If it was only the gesture of him that
prayed according to the forme of the Jewes, <note place="margin">In pen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknowledgeth,
that the imposition of hands at the receaving of peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
which was called <hi>Impositio manuum reconciliato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
was not a consecration imprinting a character, but a

In the Catechisme before confirmation it is said, <hi>That
there are but two sacraments generally necessarie to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
What then? <note place="margin">Estius in l. 4. dist 7.</note> So will the Papists confesse, that
confirmation is not necessarie to salvation, otherwise,
they would minister it to the baptized at the point of
death. The English booke ordaineth, that <hi>the childe shall
be brought to the bishop by one that shall be his god-father, or


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7886:118"/>
that every childe may have a witnesse of his confirmation.</hi>
This the Papists observe in their confirmation. Thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
is a token, that of old, that which is now called <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,</hi>
was but an appendicle or closure of baptisme,
from which being afterward separated, it must not want
the god-fathers it had, when it was the appendicle of
baptisme. In the prayer before the laying on of hands,
they pray that the childe may be strengthened with the
holy Ghost the Comforter. The Papists say, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter
promised by Christ, was bestowed in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of confirmation. The Papists say, that in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
they receave the sevenfold grace of the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
wisedome, counsell, strength, knowledge, understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
godlinesse, feare. They crave the like in the prayer
before the laying on of hands.</p>

congregation, and necessarily annexed to Gods word, as
seales of the same. In the assembly holden at Edinburgh
in October <hi>anno</hi> 1581. it was ordained, that the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be not ministred in privat houses, but solemnely,
according to the good order hitherto observed. But in
the late pretended assembly holden at Perth, <hi>anno</hi> 1618.
it was ordained, that the minister shall not refuse to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptise
infants in privat houses, when great need compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the parents to crave it, but the great need is not spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
and therefore left to the judgement of every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
minister, who shall be willing to pleasure his pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoner
upon pretence of any alledged necessitie, as a
rainie day, or the saving of some charges, as a dinner,
&amp;c. Such like the minister must not refuse to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat
the communion in a privat house beside him, that
for infirmitie is unable to resort to the church to receave
it, or if the sick person that shall declare upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to the minister, that hee thinketh his sicknesse
deadly. It is required only, that there be three or foure
of good religion and conversation present to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with him. But, which shaketh all loose, these must
be free of all impediments. What if they bee not free?
What suppose there were fourtie, let be foure, if it be not
celebrated in the congregation, it is but a privat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>

which wee ought to obey rather then foster the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and infirmitie of the people.</hi> He had beene disputing
before against the administration of baptisme by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and woman, but concludeth in end against admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
also in a privat place, and requireth, that all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
be administred, not only by publike and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
office-bearers, <note place="margin">pag. 110.</note> but also publickly. How can the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
then alledge, that <hi>Tilenus</hi> words were perverted?
That the sacraments are actions of publike nature, and
therefore ought to bee celebrated publickly in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
appeareth by these reasons: 1. The sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are appointed not only to be signes and seales of
invisible graces, but also to be testimonies of our pietie
towards God, and badges of our profession distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
true Churches; from false. All sacraments are
kindes of protestation of our faith, <note place="margin">Part 3. quest. 7 artic 5.</note> saith <hi>Quinae.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
corners are not fit places for such protestations.
2. Visible communion in the holy things of God, is the
end of our union and consociation with a particular
Church. Because wee cannot attaine to a visible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in the holy things of God, immediatly with the
whole Church militant, wee enjoy it mediatly by our
communion in a particular congregation. Therefore
the sacraments which are the holy things of God, ought
to bee administrated in common. 3. All other actions
which concerned the whole Church, were done with
consent and presence of the Church, as elections, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
excommunications. By the same reason ought
the sacraments to be administred in publike, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
that all have in them, and the benefite and fruit
may redound to all. 4. The sacraments ought to bee
preserved from contempt, neglect, and corruptions.


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7886:122"/>
Heretickes take occasions to corrupt the pure admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the sacraments, when they are administred in
privat houses. The publike is the lesse regarded when
people may have them in privat, as they thinke they have
need, nor yet are they so reverently used, as when cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
in the publicke assemblie. 5. It breedeth opinion
of extreme danger of salvation, if any die without ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme,
or the Lords supper. Wee will have occasion to
touch these reasons, when wee descend to baptisme and
the Lords supper in particular.</p>
            <p>The Doctour in his answers useth often the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of ordinarie and extraordinarie, <note place="margin">The distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frivolous.</note> that ordinary
they should be administred in publick, but extraordinar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and in case of necessitie they may bee administred in
privat, which is a begging of the question; for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are directed against administration in privat, in
whatsoever case, and there is no necessitie to violate the
common order, unles it were the danger of mens salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for want of such a middle or meane, which is a grosse
and damnable opinion ingendred and intertained by the
administration in privat.</p>
            <p>He wresteth also that place in <hi>Matthew,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Where two or three are gathered, &amp;c.</note> where Christ
promised to be in the midst of two or three conveened
in his name, as if three or foure conveened to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of baptisme or the Lords supper, were a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
number to make up a lawfull assembly. But this
speach of Christ in the precise termes cannot be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the sacrament. For then where two only are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veened,
the communion may bee administrated. The
Priest then may celebrate masse, having none to beare
him companie, but the clerke to say Amen. Christ spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not there, as Master <hi>Cartwright</hi> hath already


<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7886:122"/>
answered, of the publicke administring of the word and
sacraments, but of the proceeding in the Church disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
against offences, and of that part which was done
privatly by two or three, and promiseth, that not onely
the proceeding of the Church should be ratified, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that the admonition given by two or three, whereof
hee spake before, with invocation of the name of God,
should not be in vaine, but have the owne effect, either
for the conversion of the offender; or to make him inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable.
Or by two or three is meant only a few number,
where a greater number cannot be had to make up a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat,
with power to execute the censures of the Church,
or a few but sufficient number, where a greater may not
be had to make a visible Church. But where a sufficient
number may be had, and of these a Church already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
two or three apart cannot binde and loose. And
what they may doe, other two or three may undoe, or
doe the like, whereupon would follow great confusion.
Wee reason against two or three conveening in a privat
place to minister the holy things of God, where there is
already constituted a Church, and a number consociate
to that end, of which societie these two or three are but
members.</p>
            <p>We meane not that the sacraments may not be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrated
at no time in a privat place, but onely in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat
meeting of some few; for the congregation is not
tyed to, and some time hath not the libertie of materiall
Churches, but is forced to retire to woods, caves, privat
houses, but their the administration is publike, because
in sight and presence of the congregation.</p>
            <p>Baptisme is that initiatorie sacrament, <note place="margin">Against pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat baptisme. Epist. 185.</note> wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

into the Church of God, a testimonie of our heavenly
burgesship, into which these are written, whom he hath
adopted to himselfe. By baptisme we became members
of some societie joyned together, to make up one visible
Church, as it were one bodie. Baptisme therefore should
bee celebrated in the presence of that visible Church
whereof we are to be members. The minister then, and
the parents have not the onely interest in this businesse,
but the congregation also, and principally, because of
their right to receave, or refuse, their concurrence to assist
the minister in prayer to God for the infant, their testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of his entrie, and receaving, and the benefite they
may reap to themselves, by remembring their owne ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme,
and the promises made to God, when they were
baptized. The baptized must have communion with
them in the holy things of God afterward. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
good reason, they enter in with their approbation,
and acceptance. If a member may not be cut off by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
without their consent, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 5. none

               </gap>t are these times appointed for
the meeting of that societie to that end. Was it not
then a superstitious or foolish conceat in many of the
ancients who delayed baptisme, to the end of their life,
or till they were overtaken with dangerous diseases, that
being purged from all the sinnes of their former life, they
might flie straightway to heaven. These were called
<hi>Cliniei q. d. lecticularii.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we maintaine baptisme in publicke assemblies,
wee meane where there is a visible Church constituted,
and an order established. Therefore the exemples of
the Eunuch, the jaylour, Cornelius, &amp;c. make nothing
for baptisme in privat and apart, where there is a visible
Church constituted.</p>
            <p>The defence and practice of baptisme in privat, <note place="margin">Privat ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme hath bred the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of baptisme.</note> hath
bred an opinion of an absolute necessitie of baptisme, as
if the infant could not be saved without it, and doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tended. For there is no precept
requiring baptisme, when it cannot be had orderly. It is
not the neglect, but the contempt which maketh not the
infants but the parents guilty. It is not contempt or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect,
when the ordinarie times of publicke meetings ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for such ends are not neglected and co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ned.
In the ancient Church, Easter and Pentecost eves
were appointed to bee the solemne times of baptisme.
Whereby it came to passe, that many died without ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme,
as <hi>Socrates</hi> reporteth. <note place="margin">Lib. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not commendable, is worne out of use many hundred
yeares since. We have now weekly ordinarie assemblies


<pb n="228" facs="tcp:7886:124"/>
for the purpose, and yet these are neglected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned,
specially by the wealthier sort, and the times of
evening prayers are preferred before the times appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for preaching in the morning, or upon the Lords day,
whereunto they were restrained by the first booke of
discipline.</p>
            <p>Whereas the sacraments should bee celebrated with
reverence, <note place="margin">Baptisme prophaned by privat ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration.</note> and we see how solemne the baptisme of <hi>Iohn</hi>
was, and of Christ at Jordan; this baptisme in privat is
irreligiously, and unreverently ministred, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke
scarce attended unto; for upon the opinion of
the necessitie of baptisme in privat, hath followed the
defence of baptisme by women, baptisme by a pagan,
baptisme with pudle water, baptisme by supposition.
For if the infant recover health, they baptisme againe in
publicke, if they doubt it was baptized after the right
manner in privat, saying, <hi>It thou bee not baptized N. I ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptise
thee in the name of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> But what if the
childe was already baptized after the right manner, is
not this publicke baptising rebaptization. I know our
Formalists doe not defend baptisme by laymen or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to be lawfully ministred by such persons, yet they
esteeme it valide and effectuall, if the right forme and
manner was in substance observed, as yee may see in our
Doctours grounds. <note place="margin">Proceedings pag. 105.</note> That which our worthie divines
have condemned as nullin it selfe, they account as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide,
which no man would doe, that were not infected
with the opinion of absolute necessitie of baptisme to the
salvation of the infant. For <hi>necessitas precepti,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
to baptise cannot drive them to this absurditie, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
none are commanded or have warrant to baptise but
pastours or ministers. It is <hi>necessitas medii</hi> then, that


<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7886:124"/>
driveth them to such courses. The English service book
permitteth, in privat baptisme to omit the doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the institution and use of baptisme, and also to
spare the Lords prayer, if the time will not suffer. That
booke supposeth likewise, that some things essentiall to
this sacrament may bee omitted in the privat ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
through feare or haste in such extremitie. Is this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent
using of the holy things of God, or is it sure
worke, that forceth them to flie to a conditionall ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme.</p>
            <p>The case of baptisme and circumcision is not alike, <note place="margin">The case of baptisme and, circumcision different.</note>
for the Lord appointed a precise time for circumcision,
to wit the eight day, which in no cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
suppose the infant should die in the meane time. It
might have beene delayed, if there were some urgent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to hinder, as in the wildernesse for many yeares,
because they behoved to be in readinesse to remove ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the moving of the cloudy rollar. But <hi>Moses</hi>
had no urgent occasion, therefore the Lord chastised
him, and <hi>Sephora</hi> circumcised the childe <hi>Moses</hi> being
sicke. Her example was not imitated by the Jewes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
after, and the Church of God was yet in families.
When synagogues were erected, and places for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike
service of God, circumcision was ministred onely
in publike, as some thinke, and so it is an this day in the
synagogues, <note place="margin">Bueanus lec. 46. Zepperus de sacram. pag. 251. Chamier. tom. 4. lib. 5. c. 14. Barrad. tom. 1. l. 9. c. 2.</note> where a synagogue is to bee had. Others
hold that the Lord committed not the act or office of
circumcision to the priests or Levits, but that the infants
were circumcised at home, the family and nighbours
being conveened, because present remedy was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for curing of the wound. <hi>Barraillus</hi> the Jesuit
saith, that circumcision required not either a peculiar


<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7886:125"/>
place, <note place="margin">Suar. in 3. partem. tom. 3. disp. 29. sect. 2.</note> or a peculiar minister. <hi>Suarez</hi> saith, that at this
day, he that is called the circumciseth, circumciseth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
in the house or the synagogue. But it is not
so in baptisme, as it cannot be ministred, but by a lawfull
minister, so likewise only in the publicke assembly. The
make of circumcision was permanent, and by it the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
might bee easily discerned whither they were
counterfite professours or not. But it is not so in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme
The paschall lambe was eaten only in families,
and small societies conveened in some chamber on par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and might not be eaten in publick assemblies. But
who dare affirme, that the Lords supper howbeit it be the
sacrament answerable to it, must be celebrated after the
same manner. Different is the case betweene the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the old law which belonged to one nation, and
the sacraments under the Gospel belonging to the whole
Christian world.</p>
            <p>The Lords supper is the sacred banket of the whole

Yet it is not that Church which hath the power and
right to use the sacraments and censures, for then every

the sacraments at home. So howbeit the name be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated

Which was the first abuse we read of. After followed
reservation of the eucharist for the use of the sicke, which
was a greater abuse, and carrying of it home to their
houses. The opinion of the necessitie of privat commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
did grow to such an hight, that the eucharist was
given not onely to aged persons departing this life for
their <hi>Viaticum,</hi> to bee their voyage victuall, as they call
it, but also to infants and babes, and this indured for the
space of 600. yeares. The Papists themselves are asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of it, and expresly inhibit it. Yea of old, in some
parts, it was the practice, to use Master <hi>Perkins</hi> words,
to cram the eucharist into the mouth of them that were
deceased, or to lay it upon the breast; and burie it with
the corps. Such horrible prophanations arose from the
opinion of necessitie engendred upon these reservations,
and giving of the eucharist to the sicke. The continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the like customes doth foster and entertaine the
same opinion of necessitie. The ignorant are fostered in
superstition, as if the grace of God were tyed to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
and no comfort could be had by there receaving
of it in former times, but they must have it now for their
voyage victuall, whereby they may bee enabled to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to life eternall without fainting in the way.
