         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

so earnestly at my handes, and that the party is to
returne presently, I shall say somewhat with the
greatest breuity that I can: Albeit I do not doubt,
but that the partyes, that are principally interessed
therin, will answere the same much more largely.</p>
            <p>II. First then for the Authour, for so much as
he setteth not downe his Name,<note place="margin">About the Authour of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie.</note> it seemeth not so
easy to gh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sse; yet the more generall opinion in these
partes is, that as, that odious <hi>Discouery of Roman Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctryne,
and practises,</hi> which of late yow haue seene
answered, was cast forth against the Catholickes,
vnder the cyrred name of T. M. with direction (as
he said) from <hi>Superiours,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tho. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> the Authour being in deed
but an inferiour Minister; so dyuers thinke it to be
probable, that this other <hi>Booke</hi> also, commeth from
some other T. M. of like condition,<note place="margin">Tho. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of his office, somewhat neerer to his maiesty,
to whome, perhaps, he might shew the same (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s the
other dedicated his) and therupon might presume to
set it forth <hi>Authoritate Regiâ,</hi> as in the first front of
the <hi>Booke</hi> is set downe, somwhat different from other
bookes, and cause it to be printed by <hi>Barker</hi> his
Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Printer, and adorned in the second page with
the Kings Armes, and other like deuises, wherin our
English <hi>Ministers,</hi> do grow now, to be very bold, &amp;
do hope to haue, in tyme, the hand, which <hi>Scot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ish</hi>
Ministers once had. But I most certaynly do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
my selfe, that his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> neuer read aduisedly
all, that in this <hi>Booke</hi> is conteyned: For that I take
him to be of such iudgement and honour, as he
would neuer haue let passe sundry things, that heere
are published, contrary to them both.</p>
            <p>III. As for example, his Highnes great iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would presently haue discouered, that the State
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4755:5"/>
of the Question,<note place="margin">What his Maiesties great iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t would haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, if he had read the Apology.</note> is twice or thrice changed in this
<hi>Apologie,</hi> and that thing proued by allegations of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
Fathers and Councels, which the aduerse part
denyeth not, as after in due place I shall shew. And
againe he would neuer haue let passe, so manifest an
ouersight, as is the charging of <hi>Card.all</hi> 
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> with
eleuen seuerall places of contradiction to himselfe in
his workes, whereas, in the true nature of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
or contrariety, no one of them can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
or mainteyned, as euery man that vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the Latyn tongue, and will but looke vpon
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe will presently fynd.</p>
            <p>IV. Nay some of them are so palpable, as euery
man of common sense, euen without Latyn, or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arning,
will espy the same: as namely, the very first,
where it is said, That <hi>Card.all</hi> 
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> writeth in his
fifth Booke of <hi>Iustification:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 7.</note> That, <hi>for the vncertainty of our
owne proper righteousnesse, and for auoyding of vayne glory, it is
most sure and safe to repose our whole confidence in the alone mercy
and goodnes of God.</hi> Which proposition (sayth the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie</hi>)
is directly contrary to the whole discourse and
currant of all his fyue bookes <hi>De Iustificatione.</hi> But euery
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n out of common reason, will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, that the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
betweene one place, and fiue bookes, is very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and vncertayne to the Reader. He should haue
c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted some one or two, or more places, out of those
fyue bookes, which in true sense, and wordes had byn
contrary to the former place, to the end that iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might haue byn made therof: and this in credit
he ought to haue done, to conuince so great a man
of contradiction to himselfe.</p>
            <p>V. Agayne, it is alleadged for a manifest contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> for that in one place he saith:
That, <hi>the end of the world can not be knowne:</hi> and in an
other, <hi>That within 25. dayes after Antichrists death, the world
shall haue an end.</hi> But what man is so simple, or sil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4755:6"/>
that will not presently demaund, how we shall know
the certaynty, when Antichrist is to come? For ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
dependeth the whole controuersy.</p>
            <p>VI. In like manner wheras his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> is knowne to
be a Prince of most honorable respects in treaty, and
vsage of others, especially men of honour and dignity,
it is to be thought, that he would neuer haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
if he had but seene the <hi>Booke,</hi> with any atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that those phrases of contempt, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Pope</hi> (at least as a temporall Prince) but
neyther against the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> calling him by the name
of <hi>M. Bellarmine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What his Maiesty in honour woulde haue mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked.</note> should haue passed; For so much, as
both the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and greatest Kings of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
do name that dignity with honour. And it
seemeth no lesse dissonant, to call a Cardinall, <hi>Maister,</hi>
then if a man should call the chiefest dignityes of
our Crowne by that name, as <hi>M. Chauncelour, M. Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer,
M. Duke, M. Earle, M. Archbishop, M. Bancroft,</hi> which I
assure my selfe, his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> would in law of honour
condemne, if any externall Subiect or Prince, should
vse to men of that State in our Countrey, though he
were of different Religion. Wherfore I rest most as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
that this proceeded, eyther out of the Ministers
lacke of modestie, or charity: and that if his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>
had had the perusall of the <hi>Booke,</hi> before it came
forth, he would presently haue gyuen a dash of his
pen ouer it, with effectuall order to remedy such
ouersightes of inciuility.</p>
            <p>VII. Furthermore that generall assertiue note
gyuen against <hi>Card.all</hi> 
               <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that, <hi>VVhensoeuer he is
pressed with any difficult argument of his Aduersary, he careth
not to contradict himselfe, so he may declyne therby the present
storme,</hi> I can hardly belieue that his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> would haue
passed ouer with approbation. For so much, as it is
so generall, as I said, and would require an indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of many particuler examples, to inferre the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4755:6"/>
same; wherof no one is heere alledged, that can be
stood vnto, and proued to be a true contradiction in
deed. That other iniurious and stinging conclusion
also, that, <hi>There is no greater difference betweene</hi> God <hi>and</hi>
Belial, <hi>light and darknes, heauen and hell, then there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the doctrine of the Scriptures, and Card.<hi rend="sup">all</hi> Bellarmines
workes, concerrning the dignity of temporall Princes,</hi> I can not
imagine that the equity, and grauity of his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>
would euer allow of it, being apparantly a passionate
exaggeration, and refuted euery where by <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
himselfe,<note place="margin">Vide lib. de Laicis, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximè ca. 10. 11. &amp;c.</note> where he teacheth, that temporall Princes
haue their Authority from God, are Gods substitutes
and Vicars, in all temporall affayres of their States
and Kingdomes, are for such to be obeyed, not only,
out of feare to auoyd punishment, but of conscience
vnder paynes of damnation: so as, wherin this great
and absolute opposition of <hi>Scriptures</hi> to <hi>Bellarmins</hi> works,
about the Authority and dignity of temporall Princes
doth consist, I see not. And if his bookes had byn so
derogatory to Princely Authority, as heere is said, it
is very like, that so many other Monarches, Princes,
and great States, would neuer haue permitted them to
haue bene printed in their Dominions, as they haue
done, and do dayly. Wherfore, neyther this also, do
I suppose, that the great wisedome of his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> would
haue allowed.</p>
            <p>VIII. This then remayneth most firme in my
persuasion, that his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> had nothing to do with
the <hi>Booke,</hi> but only, perhaps, the allowance therof in
generall termes, before it was published: and this
yow will easely see by the substance therof, which
consisteth (such as it is) of three principall poynts or
partes.<note place="margin">Three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the Apology.</note> The first, conteynng, as it were, a preamble to
the <hi>Breues,</hi> concerning the nature of the <hi>Oath</hi> exacted,
and circumstances therof. The second, touching the
contents of the said <hi>Breues,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Popes</hi> manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4755:7"/>
therin. The third, the examination of Card.<hi rend="sup">all</hi>
               <hi>Bellarmines</hi> letter to <hi>M. Blackwell</hi> the Arch-priest: of all
which, I do promise yow, but a small tast, as I said; for
I haue very little tyme, and I should offer iniury to
others, to whome it belongeth to make a more full
answere, if I should deteyne my selfe long therin.</p>
            <p>IX. The preamble beginneth with, <hi>The monstrous,
rare, nay neuer-heard of treacherous, famous, and infamous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
plotted within these few yeares heere in</hi> England <hi>(of

               <hi>singular from all example,
crying loudly for vengeance from heauen,</hi> &amp;c. All which Epl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetes
for due detestation of so rash and heynous an
attempt, Catholicks, no lesse then Protestants, do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
admit; though for singularity from all exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,

be like to an other in all poynts, there be recounted
in Historyes, many attempts of the same kynd, and

            <p>X. But why (I pray yow) is this wofull attempt
of those vnfortunate Gentlemen,<note place="margin">The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and often repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> so often brought in
agayne, and repeated almost in euery corner of this
<hi>Booke?</hi> Are they not executed, that were culpable
therof? And are not other Catholicks deliuered from
the guylt therof, by the long, and diligent search of
Iustice made thereabout? The Minister himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
in his very next lynes, <hi>Teh equity of his Ma.tie</hi> 
               <hi>to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4755:7"/>
be such, as he professed in his Proclamation, &amp; Parlament-speach, that
be would not vse other Catholicks the worse for that,</hi> wherof it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
that he held them for guytlesse; &amp; that all those
pressures both of cosciences &amp; externall afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which
since that tyme they haue suffered, and do at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
were designed before that, and begunne also to
be put in execution (as indeed they were) and that
the powder-treason was not a cause of these affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
but an effect rather:<note place="margin">The pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son not so much a cause, as an effect of Catholiks tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> that is to say, that those
Gentlemen forseeing or knowing the course that
was designed to be taken, and partly also put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
resolued vpon that miserable <hi>Medium,</hi> to their
owne destruction, and publike calamity.</p>
            <p>XI. But alas, is there no end of exprobration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Innocent for the Nocent? No compassion?
No commiseration? If the clemency of his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>
in his gratious Proclamation (as heere is confessed)
gaue security, that, notwithstanding that headlong
action of those few Catholycke Gentlemen, <hi>None of
the profession should be the worse vsed for that cause;</hi> how
commeth it to passe, that so many aggrieuances haue
byn heaped vpon them euer since, and are daylie,
both by infamous libels published against them, as
appeareth by the former T. M. his flau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous <hi>Discouery,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation in the preface</note>
and others mentioned in the Answere therunto; as also
by the new <hi>Oath,</hi> deuised for the vtter ouerthrow,
both in soule, if they take it against their conscience,
and of body, goods, and estimation, if they refuse it?
How come so many searches of their houses, spoyle
of their goodes, apprehensions of their persons, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of their tennants, seruants &amp; friends, so many
citations, attachments, vexations, and molestations,
that dayly do flow vpon them, as if they were the
only malefactours of the Land?</p>
            <p>XII. And now I pray yow let vs see, how this
second T. M. (if he be Authour of the <hi>Booke,</hi> as he is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4755:8"/>
presumed) doth speake of this <hi>Oath,</hi> as of a thing of
no pressure &amp; preiudice at all. For hauing spoken of
the former asseueration of his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>,<note place="margin">Apologia pag. 2. lin. vlt.</note> 
               <hi>That none of that
profession should be worse vsed for that cause,</hi> he adioyneth
presently: <hi>Only</hi> (saith he) <hi>at the next sitting downe againe
of Parliament a forme of Oath was framed to be taken by all his
Ma.ties</hi> 
               <hi>Subiects, wherby they should make cleere profession of
their Resolution, faithfully to persist in his Ma.ties</hi> 
               <hi>Obedience,
according to their naturall allegiance:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 3.</note> 
               <hi>To the end, that heerby his
Ma.tie</hi> 
               <hi>might make a separation of his Subiects &amp;c.</hi> by which
exception of <hi>(Only)</hi> a man may well perceaue, that this
Minister maketh litle accompt of taking, or not taking
this <hi>Oath,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The agrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance of this Oath.</note> for so much as he supposeth Catholike people
to haue receaued no hard vsage therby, though they
be brought into such extremityes, as either they must
sweare against their owne iudgements, &amp; conscience
in diuers pointes, appertayning to their Religion,
or indure his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> heauy displeasure, with losse of
all, that in this ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e is dearest vnto them: which
no Catholicke man can auoyd now in <hi>England,</hi> but
he that maketh no scruple to sweate or vnsweare
whatsoeuer turneth him best to his commodity, or
Superior Authority doth impose vpon him.</p>
            <p>XIII. But against this, you will say, that two
thinges heere are alledged, and auouched in his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
behalfe, by the Authour of this Pamphlet: the
one, that, <hi>He intendeth no persecu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion against Catholickes for
conscience cause,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 4.</note> 
               <hi>but only desireth to be secured of them for Ciuill
Obedience:</hi> Which if it be so, I see not, but that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
may quickly be ended: for that I presume no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
in <hi>England,</hi> will deny to sweare all cyuill obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that he oweth to his Maiesty, or that any subiect
hath euer in former Catholicke times sworne to their
leige Lords or Princes, or do in other countryes at this
day. The other is, <hi>That very many</hi> (sayth he) <hi>of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
subiects that were Popishly affected, as well Priests as Laycks
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4755:8"/>
haue freely taken the same Oath, wherby they both gaue his Maiestie
occasion to thinke the better of their fidelity &amp; likewise freed them
selues of that heauy slaunder.</hi> So he. And then followeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
that his Maiesty punisheth none for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
cause, so they exhibite Cyuill Obedience. And
why then are men kept in prison, after they haue
taken this Oath? Why are <hi>M. Blackwell,</hi> and M. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocke</hi>
deteyned styll by the L. of Canterbury? Why
are Recusants punished, &amp; fyned for Recusancy,
though they take the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance?</hi> Is not Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sancie
a cause of Conscience? Do you see how these
things do hold togeather.</p>
            <p>XIIII. To returne then to this Booke, the
writer saith, <hi>That the Dyuell could not haue deuised a more
malitious tricke, for interrupting this so calme and clement a
course, then by sending hither and publishing a</hi> Breue <hi>of the Pope,
counter-maunding all them of his profession, to take this Oath,
therby sowing new seedes of iealousy betweene his Maiesty and his
Popish Subiects. &amp;c.</hi> But what was the calme &amp; cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
course before, all men know. For first men were
vexed, spoyled, &amp; imprisoned for Recusancy; then
was the <hi>Oath</hi> deuised to afflict their Consciences: and
in these afflictions what should Catholicks do? They
first consulted the case which Learned men at
home; then also abroad: And albeit at home,<note place="margin">The Oath consulted, both at home and abroad.</note> some
were moued in respect of the compassion they had
of the present perill, if it were refused, to thinke that
in some sense the <hi>Oath</hi> might be taken: yet none
abroad were of that mynd: For that they allowed
not of any sort of <hi>Equiuocation</hi> in matters touching faith
&amp; religion. And in these, I heare say that the Iesuites
were among the chiefe &amp; most forward, as heere
also is confessed: who notwithstanding before were
most accused, bayted and exagitated, both in Bookes,
Pulpitts, and Tribunalls, for allowing, in some points,
the lawfull vse of <hi>Equiuocation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:4755:9"/>
XV. About this doubt, Catholickes, according to
their rule of Subordination, and spirituall Obedience
in such affayres, referring the matter to the iudgment
and consultation of their Supreme <hi>Pastour,</hi> whome by
the principles of their Religion they belieue, that our
Sauiour giueth assistance, for the direction of mens
soules; they receyued from him, after due deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
this answere,<note place="margin">See the Breue 10. Kal. Octo. 1606.</note> 
               <hi>That the whole Oath, as it lay, could not
be admitted with the integritie of the Catholicke Faith.</hi> For that
albeit diuers partes therof were lawfull, to wit, all
such clauses, as appertained to the promise of Ciuill
and Temporall Obedience: yet other thinges, being
interlaced and mixt therwith, which do detract from
the spirituall Authoritie of their said highest Pastour
(at leastwise indirectly) the whole Oath, as it lieth,
was made therby vnlawfull.</p>
            <p>XVI. And this I vnderstand to be the substance of
the <hi>Popes</hi> Resolution and answere, though all these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularityes
be not set downe in his <hi>Breues,</hi> but onely the
Oath declared to be vnlawfull in conscience to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
men, as it lyeth, without distinction. And what
<hi>malitious tricke of the Diuell them,</hi> this may be thought, where
sheepe do make recourse to their spirituall Pastour, in so
great and important occasions of their soules, as these
are, I see not. Do English Catholickes any other thing
in this, then that which all English Subiects, both great
and small, learned and vnlearned haue done, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
from our first Christian Kinges, vntill the time
of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, vpon the point of a thousand
yeares?<note place="margin">See Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer cap. 6.</note> Let the Answere to Sir <hi>Edward Cookes</hi> booke of
<hi>Reportes</hi> lately set forth, be examined; whether it doth
not shew, that in all those Ages, recourse was euer
made to the Sea <hi>Apostolicke,</hi> in like occasions, without
preiudice of Subiectes temporall dueties to their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
Princes.</p>
            <p>XVII. No one English Christian King (though
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4755:9"/>
they were many) did euer absolutly deny recourse to
<hi>Rome</hi> in spirituall things (notwithstanding in some
other Cyuill,<note place="margin">Recourse to <hi>Rome</hi> euer vsual from our first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</note> or mixt matters, vpon different occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
some restraintes were some tymes made) from
our first king <hi>Ethelbert</hi> to king <hi>Henry</hi> the eyght, as by the
said discourse &amp; Answere is euidently proued: &amp; much
more throughout the noble rancke of the Christian
kinges of <hi>Scotland,</hi> his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Progenitours, vntill his
most renowned Progenitrix (by whome, and from
whom he hath his royall right of both Crownes) who
is knowne &amp; reputed throughout Christendome,<note place="margin">Q. Mary of Scotland.</note> to
haue died for defence of this Catholicke doctrine:
For so much, as if she would haue abandoned that,
there had byn little doubt of making her away. And
the like may be said of all other great Christian and
Catholicke Princes of our dayes, as the Emperour
himselfe, the Potent Kings, and Monarches of <hi>Spayne,
France, Polonia,</hi> and other States, Common-wealthes,
and Potentates, do not thinke it any disgrace, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
of honour, perill or iniury vnto them, that
their Subiects, for matters of Conscience, do make
recourse to the Sea <hi>Apostolicke,</hi> or that, which is conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
therof, the said Sea, or generall Pastour do inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
his iudgement, declaration, or decision in such
affayres.</p>
            <p>XVIII. This is the Catholicke doctrine and
practise: this hath bene in vse throughout Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from all antiquity, &amp; no where more then in our
Realmes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> as hath byn said. In
this beliefe and practice,<note place="margin">Catholiks do hould &amp; practice what all their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours haue done.</note> liued and dyed all our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
that were Subiects, all our noble Kings, that
were our Soueraignes, all our Bishops and Prelats,
that were our Pastours, all our great Counsellours and
Lawyers, that by their wisdome and learning gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the land, all our Nobility, Gentry, Priests and
Laytie: So as if now this be holden for <hi>a malitious tricke
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4755:10"/>
of the diuell, dishonorable and preiudiciall to his Ma.tie</hi>, <hi>his Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
Crowne, dignity and security,</hi> as heere is insinuated,
it must needs be, for that the diuell indeed hath made
some change in other men, and matters, by altering
of opinions and apprehensions. For the Catholicks
are the same that they were wont to be, and do thinke
the same, belieue the same, teach the same, and practice
the same, that all their predecessors haue done before
them.</p>
            <p>XIX. But to returne to the Apologie. Two mislikes
are consequently set downe, after the former wordes:
The first,<note place="margin">Apol. pa. 6.</note> 
               <hi>that the Pope did</hi> mittere falcem in alienam
messem, <hi>by intermedling betweene his Ma.tie</hi> 
               <hi>and his Subiects,
especially in matters that meerely and only concerne cyuill Obedience.</hi>
The other, <hi>that he refuted not particulerly, what speciall wordes
he quarrelled in that Oath; which if he had done</hi> (saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie)
<hi>it might haue byn, that his Ma.tie</hi> 
               <hi>for the Fatherly care he
hath,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. pag. 7.</note> 
               <hi>not to put any of his Subiects to a needles extremity, might
haue byn contented, in some sort, to haue reformed, or interpreted
those words with his owne Catholicks, and so had they byn therby
fully eased in that busines; or at leastwise, some appearance or
shaddow of excuse, might haue byn left vnto them for refusing the
same, vpon scrupulous tendernesse of Conscience,</hi> &amp;c. Thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
he. Which if he do <hi>bona fide,</hi> and haue besydes any
inckling or insight in his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> meaning indeed that
way, for the ease or comfort of his afflicted Catholicke
people; I doubt not, but that full satisfaction may be
gyuen to his Royall Highnes, in these two poyntes that
heere are set downe.</p>
            <p>XX. For first, about <hi>putting the Popes hooke in another
mans haruest,</hi> supposing, as we do, that wee treate of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
people only,<note place="margin">English Catholiks not <hi>Messis aliena</hi> to the Sea A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike.</note> and according to Catholicke do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctryne,
and in matters belonging to Catholicke mens
soules and consciences; it cannot be called <hi>Messis aliena,</hi>
an other mans haruest, that the <hi>Pope</hi> dealeth in <hi>England,</hi>
with such kynd of people, and in such causes, as well
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4755:10"/>
as in <hi>Spayne, France, Flanders, Italie, Germanie, Polonia,</hi> and
other States and Kingdomes; for that they are no lesse
appertayning to his flocke, care, charge, and haruest,
then the rest. Neyther doth the materiall separation of
our Iland, separate vs from the vnion of one body, nor
of one Obedience to one &amp; the selfe same general Head
and Pastour, no more, then it doth from the vnion of
one beliefe, and of one number and forme of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
of one manner of seruice, and other like poyntes,
belonging to the internall and externall vnitie of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
Religion.</p>
            <p>XXI. But the Apologie saith,<note place="margin">Ibid. pag. 6.</note> that, <hi>His medling about
this Oath, is in matters, that meerly and only concerne Cyuill Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:</hi>
and the same he repeateth in dyuers other partes
and passages of this <hi>Booke;</hi> which if it be true, I will
easely graunt that his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> hath cause of iust mislike.
But if this proue not so, and that the matters refused in
the <hi>Oath,</hi> are poyntes appertayning in deed to Religion,
then I hope, that by answering fully this poynt, we
shall satisfy also the second, why it was not needfull for
the Pope to set downe any particuler confutation in
his <hi>Breues,</hi> but only to say (as he doth) in generall, that,
<hi>The integrity of Catholicke Religion permitteth them not to take such
an Oath,</hi> in which, both Cyuill and Ecclesiasticall poynts
are couched, and conioyned craftily togeather, with no
small preiudice of the said Catholicke Religion.</p>
            <p>XXII. And how the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall we cleare this importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
matter, <hi>VVhether there be any pointes in this Oath belonging to
religion, besydes Cyuill Obedience?</hi> Very easily: by foure se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall,
and distinct wayes. The first wherof shall be
taken from the playne expresse wordes, sense, and drift
of the Oath it selfe: That besydes the acknowledgment
of our Soueraigne <hi>to be true King, and rightfull Lord ouer all his
dominions,</hi> and that, <hi>I will be a true loyall Subiect vnto him,</hi> and
other such like clauses, wherat no man sticketh or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
difficulty; the said <hi>Oath</hi> conteyneth further, that,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4755:11"/>
               <hi>I must sweare in like manner some poyntes concerning the limitation
of the Popes authority,</hi>
               <note place="margin">That the Oath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth poyntes against Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Religion.</note> to wit, <hi>what he cannot do towards his
Ma.tie</hi> 
               <hi>or his Successours in any case whatsoeuer.</hi> Which question
being brought from the particuler <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<hi>Thesis,</hi> concerning all Kings (for the like reason is
also in others) both in the one &amp; the other; it toucheth
a poynt of doctryne and Catholicke beliefe, concerning
the sufficiency of Pastorall authority, left by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in his Church vnto <hi>S. Peter</hi> and his successours, for
redressing of all inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces that may fall out, which
I (being a Catholicke) <hi>cannot in my Conscience for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>weare,
without perill of euerlasting damnation.</hi> And this is one way
of cleering the question.</p>
            <p>XXIII. An other is, to looke vpon the Popes wordes
in his <hi>Breues,</hi> wherby will appeare, what his meaning
was of the contents of the <hi>Oath.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Popes wordes in his Breue.</note> Wee haue heard (<hi>saith
he</hi>) how yow are compelled by most grieuous punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
set before yow, to go to the Churches of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes,
 to frequent their Assemblyes, to be present at their
Sermons, &amp;c. <q>Wherby we are moued by the Zeale of
our Pastorall Office, and by the Paternall sollicitude
which we haue for the saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your soules, to warne,
&amp; pray yow, in no sorte, to go to the said Churches, nor
to heare their Sermons, nor to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with them
in any externall rytes, least yow do incurre the wrath
of God therby. For that, <hi>it is not lawfull for yow to do these
things without detriment of Gods seruice, and of your owne saluation:</hi>
as also yow may not, without most euident, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
iniury of Gods honour, <hi>bynd your selfe with the
Oath,</hi> which in like manner to our great griefe,
we haue heard, to be administred vnto yow, of the
tenour vnder written, &amp;c.</q>  And then after the whole
forme of the <hi>Oath</hi> set downe, he writeth thus. <hi>VVhich
things being so, it ought to be cleere, vnto yow, by the wordes
themselues, that such an Oath can not be taken without domage
to the Catholicke fayth, and health of your soules: for that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4755:11"/>
it conte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of your soules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXIV. By these wordes of the <hi>Breue,</hi> we may see
playnly, that as the matter of going Church, Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes,
and Sermons of those o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d.</p>
            <p>XXV. The third proofe may be taken out of the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etter of <hi>Card.all</hi> 
               <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who hauing dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
considered with other learned men, of the nature
of this <hi>Oath,</hi> doth therfore hold it to be vnlawfull, for
that it is so compounded by artificiall ioyning togeather
of Temporall and Spirituall things, Cyuill Obedience,
and forswearing the <hi>Popes</hi> authority,<note place="margin">Cardinall Bellarmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Oath.</note> as (to vse his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des)
<hi>No man can professe his Cyail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Subiection, and detest treason
and conspiracy</hi> (by this Oath:) <hi>but he must be forced also to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the Primacy of the Sea Apostolicke.</hi> And therfore he
compareth it to the crafty composition, and commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Images of the Emperour <hi>Iulian,</hi> &amp; of the Paynim
Gods, so coupled and combined togeather in his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall
banner, as dutifull Subiects that were Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
&amp; desyred to performe their Temporall duety &amp; Cyuill
honour to their Soueraigne, could not bow downe to
his Picture, as the fashion was, but must seeme also to do
the same to the heathen Idols: which rather then they
would do, they were content to suffer cruell death. So
as in this case such as denyed to obey in that point, did
it not for lacke of reuerence, and loyall affection to
their Emperour, as odiously it was obiected and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified
against them: but by reason of the mixture of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4755:12"/>
things vnlawfull, with those that were lawfull: And
the like plainly is heere in this case, where Catholicks
are wrongfully accused to deny their acknowledgment
of cyuill Obedience conteyned in this <hi>Oath,</hi> for that
they refuse to take the same: wheras their refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
is not for this, but for other clauses pertayning
to their Religion.</p>
            <p>XXVI. Fourthly then, for a more full, and fynall
cleering of this matter, I can thinke of no better, nor
more forcible meane, then to make this reall offer, on
the behalfe of euery English Catholicke,<note place="margin">A loyall offer of ciuill Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, made by Catholiks to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty.</note> for better sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> in this poynt, so much vrged
of their Cyuill &amp; Temporall Obedience. First that he
will sweare, and acknowledge most willingly, all
those partes, and clauses of the <hi>Oath,</hi> that do any way
appertaine to the Ciuill, and Temporall Obedience
due to his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, whome he acknowledgeth for his
true and lawfull kyng and Soueraigne ouer all his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
and that he will sweare vnto him, as much
loyalty, as euer any Catholicke Subiect of England, did
vnto their lawfull King in former tymes, and ages,
before the change of king <hi>Henry</hi> the eyght: or that any
forraine Subiect oweth, or ought to sweare to any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
<hi>Prince</hi> whatsoeuer at this day.</p>
            <p>XXVII. Secondly that for the <hi>Pope,</hi> who, by the
force of Catholicke Religion, is the Supreme <hi>Pastour</hi> of
his soule, he hopeth in Gods goodnes, that he will
neuer attempt any thing in preiudice of his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>,
nor will he euer procure, of his part, that he do: but
rather will seeke to stay, or let the same, as much as
shall lye in his power; praying hartily for them
both. But for so much, as the Question of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
what he might do, in certayne vrgent cases, for
the preseruation of any Countrey, and for the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
good of Gods Church, is a matter belonging to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
&amp; Religion, he cannot with safety of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4755:12"/>
sweare vnto the Articles and branches of the
<hi>Oath</hi> touching that poynt.</p>
            <p>XXVIII. Heere then wee see that all Ciuill
Obedience,<note place="margin">Apol. pag. 4.</note> and humble acknowledgment of all
Temporall Duety is offered to his Maiestie by his
Catholicke Subiects, in most ample manner, that
can be deuised, or that is offered to any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Catholicke Prince lyuing. And if this be
not accepted, then is it euident, that more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
<hi>then meere and only Ciuill Obedience,</hi> as heere is
often auouched.</p>
            <p>XXIX. And now, for so much as it is said
heere in like manner, <hi>That very many of his Ma.ties</hi> 
               <hi>Subiects,
that were Popishly affected, as well Priests as Laycks, did freely take
the same Oath</hi> (which he calleth <hi>A blessed successe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God of this
godly and wyse intent, in deuising and proposing the same:</hi>) I shall
be forced also to say somwhat of this matter,<note place="margin">Whether the taking of this Oath by Catholicks be a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from God.</note> before I
passe any further. And first of all, concerning the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
wherby it is heere said, <hi>That priests and Laycks did
freely take the same;</hi> no man, I thinke, will deny, but that
the taking of this <hi>Oath</hi> is proposed by the Statute it selfe
vnder paine of the losse of all goods and lands, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
imprisonment to him, that shall refuse it:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

simply voluntary, for that, all circumstances considered,
he resolueth fynally to be the best to cast out his goods
and saue himselfe: yet all agree in this, that freedome is
taken away by this constraint of the passion of feare:
For that freedome requyreth full liberty to both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames
or obiects, that are proposed; which is not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4755:13"/>
in our case. For that the displeasure of the Prince,<note place="margin">How freely the Oath is taken.</note> the
losse of goods and liberty, the ruyne of his family, the
terrour and perswasion of his friendes, are heauie poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and do mightily preponderate on the one side: and
consequently the mention of this freedome, might haue
beene pretermitted, for so much, as no constraint of
humane will can be greater, then this. And yet
is it said in the <hi>Oath,</hi> that he must do it, <hi>both wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
and hartily, and as he belieueth in Conscience.</hi> Let
the discreete Reader consider what coherence there is
in their tale.</p>
            <p>XXX. Secondly, as for that multitude of Priests,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> &amp; Laycks, which he sayeth, <hi>Haue freely taken this Oath;</hi> as
their freedome was that, which now I haue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
and a principall motiue (as may be presumed)
the desyre they had, to giue his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> satisfaction, and
deliuer themselues, and others so much as lay in them,
from that inference of disloyall meaning, which vpon
the denyall therof, some do vse to make: so I cannot, but
in charity assure my self, that they being Catholicks
tooke the said <hi>Oath</hi> (for so much as concerneth the
Popes authority in dealing with temporall Princes) in
some such lawfull sense,<note place="margin">The sense &amp; meaning of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, that tooke the Oath.</note> and interpretation, as (being
by them expressed, and accepted by the Magistrate)
may stand with the integrity, and sincerity of true
Catholicke doctrine, and faith: To witt, that the <hi>Pope</hi>
hath not Authority without iust cause, to proceed
against them: <hi>Quia illud possumus, quod iure possumus,</hi> saith the
law: Our authority is limited by Iustice. Directly also
the Pope may be denyed to haue such authority against
Princes, but indirectly only, <hi>in ordine ad spiritualia,</hi> and
when certayne great, importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; vrgent cases, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

many yeares (though in different Religions) in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4755:13"/>
peace, and quietnes euen since his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> began first
to raigne.</p>
            <p>XXXI. But concerning the generall Question, to
deny simply and absolutely, <hi>That the Pope is supreme Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour
of the Catholicke Church, hath any authoritie left him by
Christ, eyther directly or indirectly, with cause, or without cause, in
neuer so great a necessity, or for neuer so great and publicke an vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Christian Religion, to proceed against any Prince what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
temporally, for his restraint or amendment, or to permitt
other Princes to doe the same:</hi> this, I suppose, was neuer their
meaning that tooke the <hi>Oath;</hi> for that they should ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
contradict the generall consent of all Catholicke
Deuines, and confesse, that Gods prouidence, for
the conseruation, and preseruation of his Church,
and Kingdome vpon earth, had bene defectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
for that he should haue left no lawful remedy,
for so great and excessiue an euill, as that way might
fail out.</p>
            <p>XXXII. Wherefore, for so much as some such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
meaning, must nedes be presumed, to haue bene
in those that tooke the <hi>Oath,</hi> for safeguard of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences;
if it might please his Maiesty to like well, and
allow of this moderation, and fauourable interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

vtterly condemned the same: and the very tenour of the

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4755:14"/>
sweare without any Equiuocation, or mentall reseruation at all,</hi> that
is to say, hartily, willingly, &amp; truely vpon the true faith
of a Christian. Which being so, they see not how they
may take the said <hi>Oath</hi> in truth of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: for so much,
as they find no such willingnes in their harts, nor can
they induce themselues in a matter so neerly concerning
the Confession of their faith, to Equiuocate or sweare in
any other sense, then from his Maiesty is proposed:
and therefore doe thinke it lesse hurt to deny plainly,
and sincerely to sweare, then by swearing, neither to
giue satisfaction to God, nor to his Maiesty, nor to
themselues, nor to their neighbours. And so much of
this point.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> XXXIII. There followeth an other, which is the
third, about this matter, where this Apology saieth,
<hi>That God did blesse this godly deuise and intent</hi> (of making and
vrging this <hi>Oath</hi>) <hi>by the admittance thereof by so many Priests &amp;
La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cks: &amp;c.</hi> Which blessing (if it be a blessing) must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
eyther the takers, or the exhibitours, or both. But
for the takers, what inward blessing of comfort in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
they may haue receaued thereby, I know not;
But for outward blessing, I see small, for they remaine,
either in prisons, or vnder pressures still, as hath bene
said. But for others of the same Religion that cannot
frame their Consciences to take the said <hi>Oath,</hi> and yet
would gladly giue his Royall Maiesty contentment &amp;
satisfaction,<note place="margin">The vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Oath, how heauy a pressure to Catholicks of tender conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces.</note> so farre as they might, without offending
God; I can assure yow, that it is the greatest affliction
of mynd, among other pressures, that euer fell vnto
them. For that no violence, is like to that, which is
laied vpon mens Consciences; for so much, as it lyeth in
a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s owne will &amp; resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to beare all other oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
whatsoeuer, whether it be losse of goods, honours,
dignityes, yea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of life it self: but the oppression of the
Conscience, no man may beare patiently, though he
would neuer so faine. For if he yield therein, he offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4755:14"/>
God, and leeseth his soule: neyther doth <hi>Metus
cadens in constantem virum,</hi> feare that may terrify euen a
constant man, excuse in this behalfe, as appeareth by the
example of the auncient Martyrs, who were forced,
vnder paine of damnation, to stand out to death against
all humaine power, vexations, torments, and highest
violence, rather then to doe, say, or sweare any thing
against their Conscience. To all these men then,
which are thowsands in our Countrey, that neuer
thought otherwise then to be good Subiects to his
Maiesty, the deuising of this new <hi>Oath,</hi> was no bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
but an vnspeakeable affliction, and angariation
of mynd.</p>
            <p>XXXIV. To the exhibitours also, I see not what
blessing it could be, or can be, so extremely to vex other
men without any profit, or emolument to themselues,
or to his Maiestyes seruice,<note place="margin">Nothing gayned at all by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing the Oath, but much lost.</note> which herin they would
pretend to aduaunce. For if there be any cause of doubt,
of loyall good will in them, that are forced to sweare
against their consciences: much more cause and reason
may there be of like doubt, after they haue so sworne,
then before. For that the griefe of their new wound
of conscience remayning full within them, and stirring
them to more auersion of hart, for the iniury receaued,
must needes worke contrary effects to that which is
pretended. And whosoeuer will not sticke to sweare
against his conscience for feare, fauour, or some other
like passion, may be presumed, that he will as easily
breake his <hi>Oath,</hi> after he hath sworne, vpon like mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues,
if occasions doe mooue him. And among all
other passions, none is more strong, then that of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
for oppressions receaued: So as we read of
the whole Monarchy of <hi>Spaine</hi> ouerthrowne, and
giuen to the <hi>Mores,</hi>
               <note place="margin">R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Nothing then is gotten in this behalfe of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4755:15"/>
loyall good will, by such extreame pressures, but much
rather lost.</p>
            <p>XXXV. But besides all this, is the grieuous sinne
which they commit, who force, &amp; presse other men to
sweare against their consciences, then which, almost
nothing can be imagined more heinous: for it is to
thrust men headlong (especially such as are fearfull)
into the very precipitation and downfall of hell it selfe.
For it is the highest degree of scandall actiue, so much
condemned and detested in Scriptures,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 8. Rom. 14. Matth. 18.</note> and so dredfully
threatned by our Sauiour, to be seuerely punished in the
life to come: for that scandalizing properly, is nothing
else, but laying a stumbling-block for other men to fall,
and breake their necks. And such a one is this formall
<hi>Oath,</hi> which conteyneth diuers things lawfull for a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
to sweare and other things vnlawfull: and he
is forced by terrour to passe ouer, and swallow downe
the one with the other, without distinction, with
mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est repugnance of his Conscience; which repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnance
to him, is alwaies a synne, &amp; damnable in such
a publicke and weighty action, though the matter
were lawfull in it self, and consequently also vnto them,
that force him to the same, eyther knowing or suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
his said repugnance of Conscience.<note place="margin">How grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous a synne it is to force men to sweare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces.</note> For he that
should force a Iew, or Turke to sweare, that there were
a blessed Trinity, eyther knowing or suspecting that
they would doe it against their Conscience, should
synne grieuously, by forcing them to committ
that synne. This is Catholicke doctrine, which I
also thinke the learned Protestants themselues will not
deny.</p>
            <p>XXXVI. Here if any man obiect, that among vs
also men are vrged to take Oathes, and to abiure their
opinions in the tribunalls of Inquisitions, and the like;
and consequently in this <hi>Oath</hi> they may be forced vnder
punishment to abiure the Popes Temporall Authority
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4755:15"/>
in dealing with Kings: I answere first, that if any
Hereticke, or other should be forced to abiure his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
with repugnance of conscience, it should
be a synne to the inforcers, if they knew it, or
suspected it. Neyther is it practised or permitted
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n any Catholicke Court, that euer I knew. But
yow will reply, that if he doe it not, he shall
be punished by death,<note place="margin">Obiections answered.</note> or otherwise, as the crime
requireth, and Canons appoint, and consequently
the like may be vsed towards Catholickes, that
will not renounce their old opinions of the Popes
Authoritye: but heere is a great difference; for
that the Catholicke Church hath <hi>Ius acquisitum,</hi>
auncient right ouer Hereticks, as her due Subiects,
for that by their Baptisme, they were made her
Subiects, and left her afterward, and went out
of her; and she vseth but her auncient manner of
proceeding against them, as against all other of
their kynd and quality from the beginning. But
the Protestant Church of <hi>England</hi> hath <hi>Nullum Ius
acquisitum</hi> vpon Catholicks, that were in possession
before them, for many hundred yeares, as is euident.
Neyther was there euer any such Oath exacted at
their hands, by any of their Kings, in former
Catholicke tymes: Neyther is there, by any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
forreyne Monarch, now liuing vpon earth,
and consequently, by no reason or right at all,
can English Catholicke men, be eyther forced
or pressed to this Oath against their Conscience,
or be punished, beaten, or destroyed, if for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
they refuse to take the same: humbly offering
notwithstanding to their Soueraigne, to giue him all
other dutifull satisfaction, for their Temporall Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and Allegiance, which of loyall Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
Subiectes may be exacted. And this shall
suffice for this first point, concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4755:16"/>
and nature of the <hi>Oath.</hi> Now shall

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE summe of the Popes two <hi>Breues</hi>
the first of the 21. of September,
Anno 1606. the second of the 21. of
August the next yeare following, is
this: That wheras he had heard,
that the Catholicks of <hi>England,</hi> were
very sorely pressed with a new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised
<hi>Oath,</hi> against their Conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces,
concerning certayne poyntes, appertayning to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Sea Apostolicke,<note place="margin">The sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of the two Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.</note> in some cases; he wrote
the first <hi>Breue,</hi> to admonish, comfort, and direct them;
signifying his harty sorie for their long continued affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and exhorting them to patience, and constancy
in defence of the integrity of Catholike faith, and the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4755:17"/>
purity of their owne consciences. And after this setting
downe <hi>verbatim</hi> the whole <hi>Oath,</hi> as it lyeth in the Statute,
he condemneth the taking therof, as vnlawfull vnto a
Catholicke man, in regard of diuers clauses therin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned,
contrary to the said integrity of Catholicke
faith, and health of soules; though in particuler, he
descendeth not to dispute, or discusse the reasons, or
poynts, therof, as became not a Iudge: especially seeing
(as he saith) the matters themselues be euident by the
wordes of the <hi>Breue.</hi> And wheras this first <hi>Breue</hi> was
soone after called into question by some, as not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the Popes owne motion, and intention:
his second <hi>Breue</hi> was set forth to approue, ratify,
and confirme the former; assuring all Catholicks, that
both the one, and the other came from him directly,
sincerely, &amp; vpon due deliberation, and consequently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that they were to be acknowledged, and obeyed by all
true Catholicke people. This is the summe of what
the Pope wrote: now lett vs see, what aduantage is
taken by the Apologer against the same.</p>
            <p>II. First of all he felleth at the Popes sorrow for
Catholicks afflictions, making them to be none at all:
and wheras the late <hi>Q. Elizabeth</hi> is not so much as named
in eyther of these <hi>Breues,</hi> this man will needes bring her
in perforce, and iustifie her actions against Catholicke
people, therby the more to animate his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> to follow
her example, setting downe this notorious fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>That according
to his owne knowledge, her Ma.tie</hi> 
               <hi>never punished any Papist for
Religion.</hi> Which how he can iustify, or by what E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocation
mantayne, I know not. But being not
content with this, he passeth further, and rageth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
against those innocent Priests, Students, and
others, that only for the profession of their Religion,
gaue vp their lyues vnder her, as by their inditements,
and arraignements in publike record doth appeare, and

            </p>
            <p>III. Wherunto a man might answere, that if he
performe it with no more verity to his <hi>present Soueraigne,</hi>
then he hath done to his <hi>defunct Soueraigne past;</hi> he will
gayne little grace (I suppose) with his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> whom I
hold to be of that noble nature, and magnanimity, as
that he taketh such grosse-lying-flattery, father for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury,
then obsequie. But as for his heathen, prophane
sacrificing to the <hi>Manes</hi> or Hob-gob-lins of his late
Lady;<note place="margin">Q. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth her <hi>Manes.</hi>
               </note> I confesse, that it is an office fitter for a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant-Minister,
that thinketh it vnlawfull to pray for
her soule, to deale with her <hi>Manes</hi> or Infernal spirits,
then with Celestiall, by praying for her to Saints. But
would God these <hi>Manes</hi> might now haue licence to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
and talke with him, and relate what passeth
with her after all this ioylity, and ruffe in this world;
I doubt not but they would coole his excessiue veyne
of flattering vanity. For if all the old platforme of
Saints lyues, prescribed in Scriptures and practised by
seruants of God, were not erroneous &amp; vayne, as much
fasting, continuall prayer, dayly mortification, frequent
recollection, diligent chasticement of their bodyes,
humble and feruent deuotion, labouring and working
saluation in feare and trembling, aboundant almes-deedes,
haire-cloth and ashes, contrition, sorrow and
sobbing for synnes: If these things (I say) were the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
wayes to lyfe, and to euerlasting saluation: then
must the pathes of <hi>Q. Elizabeth,</hi> which are knowne by
most men, to haue byn, eyther wholy different, or most
opposite to these, lead to an other opposite end, <hi>Quia

            </p>
            <p>IV. But not to enter into these melancholicke
matters of her <hi>Manes,</hi> or of the other world, to make
any certayne iudgement therof, before we arryue
thither: I will only speake a word or two of the world
present, and this with protestation, that it is wholy
against my will, and against the generall inclination
(as I take it) of all Catholicke people, who would in
charity be content, that the memory of her actions, &amp;
iniuryes against them, being neuer so many, &amp; iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
were buried with her body; as may well appeare
by their long silence therin since her death. But the
continuall egging of the aduersary is such, as forceth vs
to say somwhat, for our owne defence, and for cleering
the cause, and men, by her so eagerly and iniuriously
pursued.</p>

in the world,</hi> euen vnto Catholicks, whose bloud
she shed so aboundantly, both at home, &amp; abroad,
during all the time of her raigne: nay, <hi>That her Ma.tie</hi>
               <hi>neuer punished any Papist for religion:</hi> And, That she was <hi>most
free from all persecution: That she neuer medled with hard punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of any Catholicke, nor made any rigorous lawes against them
before the excommunication of Pope Pius Quintus,</hi> that was in
the eleuenth yeare of her raigne:<note place="margin">See Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders <hi>lib. 7. de Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastica Monarchia:</hi> who set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth down the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> And yet is it knowne,
and cannot be denyed, but that the most grieuous law,
&amp; <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacie,</hi> &amp; rigorous penall Statute against
saying, or hearing Masse, were made long before that
tyme: And that all the Bishops, Prelates, Religious, &amp;
chiefe Ecclesiasticall men were depryued, spoyled, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned,
or forced into banishment: and this before
the Pope vsed any Censure against her at all: so exact,
&amp; punctuall is the truth of this Ministers narration.
And not content with this, he doth prosecute odious
comparisons, betweene the Pope, &amp; her, laying all the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4755:18"/>
origen of hurts and wickednes to him, and merit of
vertue, and innocency to her, which is the very same,
that is mentioned by the Prophet,<note place="margin">Isa. 5.</note>

taken vp this Common place, to celebrate her high
prayses, for disgrace of Catholicks. And one among the
rest, that for his place, should haue more equity and

Audience more then once, especially vpon the occasion

no doubt of the myseries of her soule, little respected
by her:) vpon which words the <hi>Orator</hi> triumpheth thus,
<hi>VVhat miserable?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lo. Cooke in the booke of the late Arraigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fol. 63.</note> 
               <hi>It is said, That,</hi> Miseria constat ex duobus
contrariis, copia &amp; inopia, copia tribulationis, &amp; ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pla
consolationis, <hi>Misery consisteth of two contraries, of
aboundance, and penury, aboundance of tribulation, &amp; penury of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sola<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion.</hi>
And then he sheweth in what aboundance of
consolations <hi>Q. Elizabeth</hi> lyued in all her life, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
want of all tribulations: which if it were true;
yet is it but the argument which the worldlings vsed
in the Psalme, to proue their felicity, that their cellars
are full, their sheepe fertile, theyr kyne fatt, they suffer
no losse: and then,<note place="margin">Psalm. 143.</note> 
               <hi>Beatum dixerunt populum cui haec sunt;</hi>
Happy did they call the people that had these things.
But the Holy Ghost scorneth them, and so may all
men do our Orator, that vseth and vrgeth so base an
argument, in so high a matter.</p>
            <p>VII. And as for his definition of <hi>Miserie,</hi> by <hi>Copia</hi>
and <hi>Inopia,</hi> store and want, it is a miserable one indeed,
and neuer heard of before, I thinke, to come from any
mans mouth, but his owne: it being ridiculous in
Philosophy, and fitt to be applyed to any thing that
hath either store or want: As a wise man in this sort
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4755:19"/>
may be defined to be him, that hath store of witt, and
want of folly; and a foole to be him, that hath store
of follie, and want of witt; and so a rich man is he that
hath store of riches and want of beggary, and a poore
man is he, that hath store of beggary, and penury of
riches. And are not these goodly definitions (thinke
you) for so great and graue a man to produce?</p>
            <p>VIII. But to returne to the matter it selfe of <hi>Q.
Elizabeth</hi> her store of consolations,<note place="margin">Cooke ib. pag. 64.</note> and penury of deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
in this life, <hi>VVho</hi> (saith this our Orator) <hi>was
so myraculously protected by God, so strengthened and fortified, as
she did beate her most potent enemy, did sett vp a King in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

Supposing all this were true, that she had such tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
felicity in this lyfe, and were so miraculously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected,
strengthened, and fortifyed by God as heere is
said: yea and that it were euident, that God had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
her for his elected seruant (which yet doth not
appeare) and gyuen her that tytle and power, to afflict
the Catholicks: yet had that byn no more, then we read
in the Scriptures to haue byn gyuen to dyuers Pagan
Princes, and namely to <hi>Nabuchodonosor,</hi> of whom <hi>Ieremy</hi>
the prophet testifyeth in sundry places of his Prophesy,
That God chose him, called him his seruant, and gaue
him speciall power, fauour, &amp; protection to afflict his
people.<note place="margin">Hier. 27. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Ego dedi omnes terras istas in manu Nabuchodonosor Regis

Countryes into the hands of <hi>Nabuchodonosor</hi> King of

yield obedience to him, and to his Sonne, and Sonnes

            <p>XI. And thus much for spirituall infelicityes, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
to the next world, and lyfe or death to come. But
if we would rest our selues only vpon vayne &amp; brickle
felicityes of this world, they were not (alas) so great in
Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Queene E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth her felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with infelicities.</note> but that they were mingled and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlaced

and these such, as did euen in the eyes of worldly
men, ouerpoise the other, especially with them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
honour and dishonour among humane felicityes,
&amp; infelicityes. For what more dishonorable infelicity
can there be, then that which standeth <hi>in Capito Libri</hi> of
<hi>Q. Elizabeths</hi> lyfe? To witt, the publike solemne Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
and Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> made within few dayes after
she was borne, vpon the 28. yeare of King Henryes
raigne, and yet extant in Print, wherin it is declared,
not only by the iudgment of the King, and of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l that

could there be any greater worldly infelicity the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>this.</p>
            <p>XII. I let passe many other infelicities, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
by her occasion to sundry, as well vnder the
raigne of King <hi>Edward,</hi> as the ruyne of the <hi>Seymers</hi> vpon
the Admiralls falling in loue with her, and making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his former wife <hi>Queene Catherine Parre</hi> to enioy her;
as also vnder Queene <hi>Marie,</hi> when so many rebellions of
<hi>VViat, Courtney, Carewes, Stafford,</hi> &amp; others, were made for
her. But her owne raigne had most infelicities for her, if
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4755:20"/>
they were well considered: and I could touch many, but
modestie forbiddeth. And least I should seeme to speak
out of reuenge, let this one consideration serue for all;
That after all her afflicting Catholicks, and by that
exercise, vpon the egging of others, more then of her
owne propension, she was drawne into continuall su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitions,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eares, and frights of her mynd and spirit,
euen in the midst or all these sensuall delights, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments
(admired so much by her Attorney) which
draue her to a point, wherunto by nature she was not
thought much inclyned, and by profession and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations,
she most condemned in others, to wit,
Cruelty, which in effect was such, out of the fore said
feares,<note place="margin">The infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Cruelty.</note> towards Catholicke Religion, as neuer perhaps
(yea without perhaps) were so many seuerall lawes,

had byn one, and in secret or priuate speaches also
would not deny, to be in sundry poyntes, euen to
her dying day. And was not this a great in felicity?
When stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers do read &amp; behold her Edicts &amp; Statutes,
wherin not only the whole vse of Catholicke Religion
is condemned, and vnder greiuous punishment prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited:
but men are forced also, by rigorous penall lawes
to go to the Churches of a contrary Religion, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with them, to do acts, and sweare against
their owne Religion, faith and Consciences: that there
are seuere punishments, of losse of goods and lands, for

another to be a Catholicke, or do the same: When
they read these things (I say) and many others, which
for breuity I pretermitt, and that all this notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
she would not haue it said, <hi>That she persecuted any for
Religion</hi> (which in manner this Apologer sticketh not to

haue yielded neuer so little. All this (I say) being read
and considered, seemeth vnto forreiners a strange infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
both of body and soule.</p>
            <p>XIII Especially when it is considered to what
perpetuall iealosy at length she was brought vnto, of all
sorts of people, <hi>Puritans, Papists,</hi> yea of her owne dearest,
as the death of the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> and his followers, doth
easily declare. Neyther was there any weeke lightly,
but that she had some new feares, of some Priest or

this gryping passion of feare and iealosy did so vexe &amp;
consume her inwardly, as she was neuer well, vntill she
had made away, against all law of Nature and Nations,
the nearest vnto her in Royall bloud, that lyued vpon
earth, and coequall with her in dignity, if in sundry
respects not Superiour, I meane his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> noble
renowned <hi>Mother,</hi> Queene of <hi>France</hi> &amp; <hi>Scotland,</hi> that by
force of the former Statute, which declared this other
for illegitimate and incapable of the Crowne (as now

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4755:21"/>
his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> had enioyed the same 38. yeares at
least, before he came vnto it after her death, who of all
other lyuing Creatures, is knowne most hartily to haue
hated that yssue &amp; succession. And as she went about to
disinable the same in the very roote &amp; fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayne it selfe,
by seeking the disgrace of the ofspring, by dishonour of
the origen: so neuer ceased she afterward to continue
practises against them both, vntill she had wracked the
one, and brought the other also to great probability
therof, if she might haue lyued to her will, or haue dyed
with such vse of senses and iudgment, as might haue
made way to her bad affections in that behalfe.</p>
            <p>XIV. Well then, all this I haue beene inforced to
speake vpon this occasion: first to represse somwhat
therby the insultation of our foresaid Orator, in
calling her,<note place="margin">Lo. Cooke in his Charge at Norwich. 4. August. 1606.</note> 
               <hi>The happy Queene, the blessed Queene, whose
vnmatched wisedome, and vnconquered prowesse</hi> (to vse his
words) <hi>crowned her the peerlesse wonder of her sexe.</hi> All which
tendeth to the exprobration of Catholicks, for hauing
had so happy &amp; peerles a persecutour; and to the insul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
also ouer the Pope, for calling her in his <hi>Breue,</hi>
as he saith, <hi>Miseram Foeminam,</hi> a miserable woman: which
how true or false it is, I leaue to the prudent Reader
out of the former discourse, about her byrth, youth,
age and end, to censure.</p>
            <p>XV. Secondly I do heerin but imitate the first an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers, that wrote for defence of those holy
Martyrs, that dyed for Christian Religion in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue
Church,<note place="margin">What ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutour Q. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth was.</note> as namely, <hi>Iustinus Martyr, Irenaeus, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>
and others, who to comfort the afflicted, and to
honour more their cause, did put them in mynd what
manner of people their first persecutours were; as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely
<hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Domitian,</hi> what lyfe they led, what end
they made, and the like; And that indeed they were
fit instruments, to be the first, in such a worke. And the
like we may say to Catholicks of <hi>Q. Elizabeth,</hi> that she
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4755:22"/>
being the strangest woman that euer was borne for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
circumstances, now partly touched, and the first
absolutly of that sexe, eyther Christian or created, that
tooke vpon her Supreme power in Spirituall and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
matters; it must needes be some comfort to
Catholicke people, that God chose such an instrument
to be their first scourge, out of all woman kynd.</p>
            <p>XVI. And lastly, for that this Apologer will needs
take vpon him, <hi>to sacrifice to her</hi> Manes: I thought my selfe
obliged to offer some incense in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner to the same,
for mitigating the euill sent, which that notorious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
assertion must needs import, to the senses of all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
Readers: That, <hi>Queene Elizabeth neuer punished
any Papist for Religion, Nor made any rigorous law against them,
before</hi> Pius Quintus <hi>his Excommunication, nor since that tyme,
but vpon priuate plots, machinations, &amp;c.</hi> For cleare confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wherof, I remit those of the elder sort that lyue in
<hi>England,</hi> to their owne eyes, eares, and other externall
senses, and those of yonger age, to the books of Statutes,
of <hi>Q. Elizabeths</hi> tyme, <hi>Iohn Stowes</hi> Chronicle, and other
such publicke Records. And so much of this poynt.</p>
            <p>XVII. Next after these exaggerations <hi>of the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
and indulgence of Q. Elizabeth</hi> towards Catholicks, this
Apologer passeth on to bestow some of his adulation,
and <hi>oleum peccatoris,</hi> vpon his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> in like manner that

hath bene touched, may appeare. Yet do we verily
perswade our selues, that if his Highnes had byn left to

               <hi>Q. Elizabeth</hi> was wont to say
of her disposition in religion) we had tasted, indeed,
much of this his great humanity, and so we began, for
some tyme: but being preuented and diuerted by the

            <p>XVIII. And I do name this Minister (T. M. the

the seruice he doth his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> in this exercise.</p>

as they did directly expect, and assuredly promise to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
liberty of Conscience, and equality with vs in all things,
that are his best, and faithfull Subiects &amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Do you see what
<hi>a height of pride</hi> this was? And what an abuse of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties

Why had he not obiected in like manner,<note place="margin">Liberty of Conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> that
they expected the libertie of breathing, and vsing the

breathing, nor the vse of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ayre, is more due vnto
them, or common to all, then ought to be libertie of
Conscience to Christian men, wherby ech one liueth
to God, and to himselfe, and without which he strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
with the torment of a continuall lingring death.</p>
            <p>XXI. And surely, I cannot but wonder, that this
Minister was not ashamed to call this the <hi>height of
pride,</hi> which is generally found in all Protestants neuer
so humble: yea the more humble, and vnderlings they
are, the more earnest are they both in bookes, speaches,
and preachings, to proue that liberty of Conscience is
most conforme to Gods law, and that wresting, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of Consciences, is the highest Tyranny, that can
be exercised vpon man. And this we may see first, in all
M. <hi>Fox</hi> his History, especially during the time of the
three King <hi>Henries, 4.</hi> 5. and 6. and afterward, when
those that were called <hi>Lollards,</hi> and <hi>VVickcliffians,</hi> who

pressed somewhat about their Religion, did continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

               <hi>to spare execution of all Priests, though they

Priestes that were taken, were sent ouer, and sett at liberty:</hi> and
many other gracious fauours &amp; benefittes: <hi>VVhich</hi> (saith
he) <hi>tyme and paper would fayle me if I would make enumeration
of them all: in recounting wherof euery scrape of my pen</hi> (so vse
his words) <hi>would serue but for a blott of the Popes ingratitude,
and iniustice in meating his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> with so hard a measure for the
same. So as I thinke</hi> (quoth he) <hi>I haue sufficiently wiped of the
teares from the Popes eyes, for complayning vpon such persecution</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>XXV. Thus writeth this man, who, in naming
<hi>the Popes ingratitude,</hi> must much more include ours, that are
Catholicks; for that these benefitts, such as they were,
appertayned nothing to the <hi>Pope,</hi> but only in Christian
charity, as a common spirituall Father and Pastour, he
being otherwise a stranger vnto vs in bloud, and for
other worldly respects. And as for Catholicks, they
accept gratefully,<note place="margin">Catholiks dutifull demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his Maiesty.</note> whatsoeuer least fauour hath byn, or
is done vnto them: and do not doubt, but that if his
Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> had not bene preuented by sinister information,
&amp; persuasion of others, they had tasted of much greater,
as due vnto them, in that they are naturall borne Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
of the Realme, most loyall in hart &amp; affection, &amp;
neuer meaning otherwise, but to liue in most orderly
and dutifull Subiection and Obedience to his Highnes,
as to their liege Lord and Soueraigne.</p>
            <p>XXVI. And wheras this man, for proofe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
nameth the powder-treason of a few, therby
to discredite the whole, though this calumniation
haue beene answered before: yet now I ad further, as
one said, <hi>Distingue tempora, &amp; scripturam concordabis,</hi> If
there had bene no persecution before that treason, this
might haue beene assigned for some probable cause of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4755:25"/>
the subsequent tribulations: but all <hi>England</hi> knoweth,
that this is not so, but that his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> sweete &amp; myld
aspect towards Catholicks at his first entrance, was
soone, by art of their enemyes, auerted long before the
conspiracy fell out. For that, not only all the most cruell
Statutes and penall Lawes made by Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were
renewed and confirmed before this,<note place="margin">Anno 1. Iacobi Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis.</note> with addition of
others, tending to no lesse rigour &amp; acerbitie: but also
the exaction of the same was put in practice with great
seueritie; &amp; namely the payme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the twenty poundes
a moneth, or two partes of their goods and landes for
Recusants (once remitted by his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> as heere is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed)
were not only recalled againe: but the arrearages
therof in like manner exacted; and for leuying wherof,
throughout sundry shyres of the Realme (especially in
the North) there was such ransacking of mens houses,
such dryuing away of their Cattell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their groundes,
such strayning of their Rents, such vexing of their
tennants (not knowne perhaps to his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>) as if
the whole Countrey had byn gyuen ouer to spoyle &amp;
desolation.</p>
            <p>XXVII. Nor were mens goods and persons only
afflicted, but the lyues also of sundry taken away for
cause of their Religion before this powder-treason fell
out: which desperate treason, to ascribe as an effect and
fruite of too much clemency in his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> (as this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
doth) is a strange assertion,<note place="margin">Apol. pag. 19.</note> no doubt: for so
much, as such effects do not proceed, but of exasperated
myndes; which clemency worketh not, eyther in men
or beasts. Neyther did euer any learned Philosopher,<note place="margin">Clemency no cause of desperate attempts.</note>
that wrote of the good institution of any Common
wealth, or of the security of any Prince in his Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
put such effects for fruits of clemency, but rather
of the contrary manner of proceeding. And if all the
disasterous ends of the most vnfortunate Princes, that
euer haue byn destroyed, should be layd togeather, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4755:25"/>
the causes therof exactly inquired, it would be found so:
and consequently that this Minister is no good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour
to his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> in this so great &amp; weighty affayre.
And we hope that Almighty God, by the mercy of his
dearest Sonne our Sauiour, and through the prayers of
his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> good Mother, and other holy Princes of his
Royall bloud now in heauen, will neuer suffer him, at
the egging of such exasperating people, to follow so
violent, troublesome, and dangerous a course, and so
contrary to theirs, whiles they lyued vpon earth, and so
alienate from his owne sweete nature and Princely
disposition.</p>
            <p>XXVIII. But to proceed a litle further in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of some poyntes of heauy persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that insued
soone after his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> being in <hi>England,</hi> much before
the powder-treason was attempted: Who doth not
know what afflictions were layd vpon Catholicks,
euen in the very first yeare of his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> raigne, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
towards the end therof, &amp; much more through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the second yeare, before the said powder-treason
fell out. For then not only in the Shires and Prouinces
abroad: but euen in <hi>London</hi> it sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, and in the eyes of the
Court, the violence, and insolency of continuall sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
grew to be such, as was intollerable; no night
passing commonly,<note place="margin">The cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches.</note> but that Souldiours, &amp; Catch-poles
brake into quiet mens houses, when they were asleepe,
and not only carryed away their persons vnto prisons
at their pleasure, except they would brybe them exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely,
but whatsoeuer liked them best besydes in the
house, eyther of Bookes, Cuppes, Chalices, or other fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture,
that might any wayes seeme, or be pretended to
belong to Religion, was taken for a prey, and seazed
on. And among others, I remember, that one frend of
myne, had a drinking Cuppe of syluer taken from him,
for that it had the name of IESVS engrauen vpon it,
though otherwise the forme therof did well shew, that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4755:26"/>
it was but a Cuppe, &amp; no Chalice. And these searches
were made with such violence, and insolency, as diuers
ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlewome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were drawne or forced out of their beds, to
see whether they had any sacred thing, or matter belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to the vse of Catholick Religion, either about
them, or vnder their bedds.</p>
            <p>XXIX. What shall I speake of the casting into
prisons, &amp; condemnation to death of many Catholicks
for the same cause, in euery corner lightly of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
as namely in <hi>London</hi> of <hi>M. Hill</hi> the Priest, and this
only for his function, and for comming into <hi>England</hi>
against the Statutes of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to the contrary?
Of <hi>M. Sugar</hi> also an other Priest in <hi>VVarwicke,</hi> that was
not only condemned, but<note n="*" place="margin">Anno 1604. mense August.</note> executed withall rigour in
that Cittie for the same cause, and a lay man with him
named <hi>Robert Grysold,</hi> for receyuing him into his house?
At <hi>Oxford</hi> also foure Priests being taken at that tyme
whose names were <hi>M. Greene, Tichborne, Smith,</hi> and <hi>Brisco,</hi>
all had sentence of death passed vpon them; though after
many afflictions suffered in the pryson there, which
made them desyre much the speedy execution of the
sentence gyuen against them, they had insteed of this
one death, many deathes layd vpon them, by sending
them prisoners to the Castle of <hi>VVisbich,</hi> where they
receyued such cruell vsage both in their diet, lodging &amp;
other treatie, as made euen dyuers Protestants to take
compassion of them. And why was all this, but for their
Religion?</p>
            <p>XXX. I let passe the condemnation to death of a
poore man in Oxford named <hi>Shitell,</hi> for that the Priest
M. <hi>Greene</hi> had fledde into his house, when he was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
by the searchers, through which condemnation, &amp;
perpetuall imprisonment therupon ensuing, were
brought to extreme misery &amp; calamity, his poore wyfe
and children, most lamentable to behold, or heare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted.
And vpon like occasion was apprehended,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4755:26"/>
imprisoned, condemned, &amp; executed in <hi>Yorke,</hi> about the
same tyme, an other Lay-man named <hi>Thomas VVylborne,</hi>
only for that he had vsed some words of perswasion to a
certayne woman to be a Catholicke, notwithstanding
the prohibition of her husband, who followed so
hoatly the matter against him, as he caused him to be
put to death.<note place="margin">Diuers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of seuere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.</note> I pretermit M.<hi rend="sup">ris</hi> 
               <hi>Shelley</hi> a Gentlewoman
of good Worshipp, cast into the common Iayle at <hi>VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi>
for that the Priest <hi>M. Hassells,</hi> was found in her
house. The apprehension in like manner, &amp; condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to death of <hi>M. Edward Tempest</hi> Priest and Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in London at the same tyme. I passe ouer the cruell
sentence of cutting of the ears, of so ancient &amp; venerable
a Gentlemam, as is <hi>M. Tho. Pound,</hi> that had lyued aboue
thirty yeares in sundry prisons only for being a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke,
and now last in his old age, had that honour from
God, as to be sentenced to leese his eares and stand on
the Pillorie in dyuers markets, for complayning of hard
measure, &amp; iniust execution, vsed against Catholicks,
contrary (as he presumed) to his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> intention.</p>
            <p>XXXI. And fynally I passe ouer what was practised
in <hi>Herefordshire, Lancashire,</hi> &amp; other places in this kynd of
persecution, and particulerly concerning the new an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gariation
and pressure, then first brought vp, that men
should be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to pay for their wyues, that were Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
a thing neuer before exacted in the former Queenes
tyme. I pretermit also to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion, how his M.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> before
this, had reiected the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, &amp; humble supplication of
Catholicks, exhibited in writing for some toleratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;
mitigation of the calamityes: the which supplication
was answered with conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt &amp; insultatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by a Minister,
and put in print. His Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> in like manner had gyuen
publike audience both to <hi>Protestants</hi> &amp; <hi>Puritanes</hi> for three
dayes togeather, concerning the differences of their
Religion: but to Catholicks he neuer yealded to gyue
any at all. And how then can this Apologer talke so
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4755:27"/>
much of equality vsed in all fauours? How can he say,
that there was no persecution before the powder-treason?</p>
            <p>XXXII. But let vs go forward yet somewhat fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
his Maiestie had before this tyme vpon other mens
importunity, confirmed, and ratified by his Letters
Patents, all that heape of Constitutions, and Canons,
(being in number aboue an hundred &amp; fourty) which
the BB. of <hi>London &amp; Canterbury,</hi> had deuised, &amp; set
forth against Catholicks, for their greater vexation, &amp;
affliction. Out of which hath flowed since a huge sea
of molestations and exagitations, by searchings, spoyles
citations, apprehensions, excommunications, and other
violences, vpon innocent and quiet people, by the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenous
hungry Purseuants of those Prelats, and other
their Catch-poles, without respect, either of Iustice, or
hope of remedy, for iniuryes by them offered. There had
passed also before this, the speach of the <hi>L. Chancelour</hi> in
the Star-Chamber,<note place="margin">The B. of Londons Sermon 5. August. 1605.</note> and the Sermon of the B. <hi>of London</hi> at
<hi>Paules-Crosse,</hi> both of them tending to take all hope from
Catholicks of any least fauour, that might be expected,
and the former expresly charging the Iudges in his
Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> name, to vse all seuerity in seeking out and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
them. Which things being seene, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>arre
worse feared, yea designed also and threatned, as those
Gentlemen apprehended it, (especially at the next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament)
cast them into that wofull impatience, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation,
which the euent declared.</p>
            <p>XXXIII. All this then which the Apologer heere
telleth vs, of Catholicks ingratitude for so many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
receyued,<note place="margin">Apol. pag. 21.</note> during his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> raigne, and, <hi>That it is a
mayne vntruth</hi> (to vse his words) <hi>and can neuer be proued, that
any persecution hath beene in his said Ma.<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ies gouernment, or that
any were, or are put to death or punished for cause of Conscience,</hi> is
such a kynd of speach, as if it were told in the <hi>Indies,</hi>
many thousand myles of, where nothing is knowne of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4755:27"/>
our Countryes affayres, might perhaps fynd some hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
that would belieue it:<note place="margin">Increace of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion since the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> but in <hi>England</hi> to auouch such
a thing in Print, where all mens outward senses, eyes
&amp; eares are witnesses of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, is a strange boldnes.
For as for persecution in goods and lands, as also of
mens bodyes by imprisonment, and other vexations,
who can deny the same, that will not shut his said eyes,
or eares,<note place="margin">Statut. 4. &amp; 5. Anno 3. Iacobi Reg.</note> from seing and hearing that which daylie pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
within the Realme. And when nothing els were:
Yet those two seuerall and most memorable Statutes, to
witt, the 4. and 5. made in the third yeare of this Kings
raigne, conteyning more seuerall heads of affliction, and
angariation against Catholicke-Recusants for their
meere Conscience, then euer, perhaps, in the world were
seene extant, against any one sorte of wicked men, or
malefactors before; do easely conuince the vntruth of
this asseueration about freedome from persecution. And
as for death,<note place="margin">Lond. 26. Febr. 1607. York. 21. Mar. 1608. Lond. 11. Apr. 1608.</note> which is lesse greiuous to many then those
other persecutions, the late example of <hi>M. Robert Drury,</hi>
and now againe these last monethes past, of <hi>M. Matthew
Flathers,</hi> &amp; <hi>M. Geruis</hi> Priestes (to omit others) that dyed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
for refusing this late deuised Oath, since the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-treason,
cannot, I thinke, be answered, except he
will say, that this <hi>Oath</hi> hath no matter of Conscience in
it for a Catholicke man to receaue: the contrary wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we haue euidently shewed before, by many demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations.</p>
            <p>XXXIV. Wherfore, that which he addeth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly,
insinuating, and expresly threatning, that as
there hath beene no persecution, or putting to death
before (which is not true as I haue shewed:) so now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as the Pope hath interposed his Authority,<note place="margin">Pag. 21.</note> and
forbidden the <hi>Oath</hi> as vnlawfull, <q>there may chance be 
greater persecution, and more aboundant shedding of
bloud, which (as he saith) must light vpon the Popes
head, for this his prohibition:</q> All this (I say) is so spoken
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4755:28"/>
as ech man may see, whither it tendeth: to witt, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyte
his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> by such deuises, to ingulfe himselfe into
the effusion of Catholickes bloud, casting on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and veile of the Popes intermedling, as cause ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
which is an ancient Art of deceipt, to giue <hi>Non causam,
pro causa:</hi> for that no iniury is euer offered vnder the
name of iniury, but of iustice or merit. And our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
was crucified as a deceyuer of the people,<note place="margin">Luc. 23. &amp; Matth. vlt. Act. 24.</note> &amp; disloyall
to <hi>Caesar:</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> pursued as a disturber of the Weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicke
and peace. And no suffering is so honourable,
as that which commeth with a dishonourable title: so
as English Catholickes must not be dismaied when
they suffer for the false imputation of Ciuill Disloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to their Temporall Prince, being witting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
that it is indeed for their Religion, and loyalty
to God, their eternall Prince, and supreme King. And
this only shall suffice for this matter. For if Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes
further affliction be determined by their Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
and permitted by God, pretences will not want
how to do it. The prouerbe is already knowne, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
inuenies baculum, vt canem caedas,</hi> as also the fable of
Aesope, that the lambe must be slayne, for that drinking
farre beneath the well, he was pretended not withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
to haue troubled the fountaine. Catholicks must
be beaten, for that the Pope hath resolued a case of
Conscience, that men may not sweare against
their owne Religion. All be to the glory
of God, and then fynally will they
leese nothing therby, which
is the only comfort in
such manner of
sufferings.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Apol. pag. 21.</note> as heere is alledged, <hi>That the

since it conteyneth many things, that are
playnly, &amp;</hi> directly <hi>contrary to their faith and saluation.</hi> And
albeit the word (<hi>directly</hi>) be conueyed in heere, which
is not in the Popes Breue, &amp; is of no small mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as all
Deuines know in this matter, and therfore ought not
to haue byn thrust in, as the Popes word, in a different
distinct letter: yet not to stand vpon that, but vpon
more grosser poyntes, and more iniurious, he presently
vseth the speach, which is reported to haue byn of
<hi>Auerroes</hi> the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Philosopher against <hi>Moyses Law-giuer</hi>
of the Iewes,<note place="margin">Vixit An. 1150.</note> 
                  <hi>Multa dicit, sed pauca probat,</hi> he saith much
but proueth little, and presently passeth to this insul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,<note place="margin">Pag. 22.</note>
                  <hi>How the naturall allegiance of Subiects to their Prince, can
be</hi> directly <hi>opposite</hi> (marke how he serueth himselfe of his
owne word shifted into the text) <hi>to the faith and saluation
of soules, is farre beyond my simple reading in Deuinity, as I must
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4755:29"/>
it a strange and new assertion to proceed out of the mouth of that
pretended generall Pastour of Christian soules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXXVI. Heere now what abuse is offered to the
words and meaning of the <hi>Breue,</hi> euery simple Reader
will see, without any explication from me: for that
the Pope doth not prohibite naturall Obedience in
things lawfull; nor doth say, that such naturall, or cyuill
Obedience is opposite to faith or saluation of soules; nor
that the Oath is vnlawfull,<note place="margin">The Oath why it is vnlawfull.</note> for exhibiting such naturall,
or cyuill Obedience: but for that, besydes this exaction
of naturall Obedience, which is lawfull, it conteyneth
diuers other poyntes also, concerning matters of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
Religion: which poyntes being so conioyned,
and couched with the other, as the one ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be sworne
without those other, do make the whole Oath vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
as it lyeth, without distinction, as before hath byn
declared. So as this charge is now proued, to be but a
meere cauill, and calumniation, &amp; voluntary mistaking
of the question and controuersy in hand.</p>
               <p>XXXVII. And yet doth he so insist in it, and so dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
himselfe vpon this false surmised principle (<hi>that
Cyuill Obedience is denyed</hi>) as though all his Discourse and
Treatise depended only of this (as indeed it doth,) and
therfore he entreth into the confutation therof with a
great florish of Scriptures, Fathers, and Councells
(wherin he and his do abound, when they say the same
that we do, but otherwise are altogether barren) as
though in earnest we did deny it: which thing neuer
so much as passed through our cogitations, but do hold
and teach that Subiects are bound to obey their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
Princes in all things lawfull, and those not only
good Princes, but bad also: and not only out of feare or
flattery, but out of Conscience, as the Apostle teacheth
<hi>propter Conscientiam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> for Conscience sake, but not <hi>contra
Conscientiam,</hi> against Conscience. Which being so; all is
meerly impertinent, that is alledged heere by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:4755:29"/>
out of Scriptures, Fathers, and Councels, to proue,
that which we grant without proofe, &amp; neuer denyed:
which is, that temporal Princes are duely to be obeyed
for Conscience sake, so long as they command nothing
against Conscience. But let them shew but one only
Authority, sentence, example or testimony out of any of
these three kind of witnesses, Scriptures, Fathers, or
Councells, that we must obey Princes against our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
or Religion, and I will grant he sayth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to the purpose, otherwise he doth but leese tyme,
and abuse his Reader in making him belieue, that he
saith somwhat when he saith nothing. Let vs examyne
therfore some of his examples if yow please.</p>
               <p>XXXVIII. He alledgeth for examples out of the
Scriptures,<note place="margin">Apol. pag. 22.</note> That the children of <hi>Israel</hi> obeyed the King
of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hier. 27. 12.</note> as also they exhibited temporall Obedience
vnto King Pharao of <hi>Egypt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 5. 1.</note> as in like manner to <hi>Cyrus</hi>
King of <hi>Persia:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esdr. 1. 3.</note> All which examples we grant to be
true, and could ad many more, both of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and
Christians that lyued peaceably vnder Infidell Princes
in those dayes. But lett one example (as I said) be
brought forth, wherin they obeyed them in poynts
contrarie to their Conscience or Religion, and it shall
be sufficient.<note place="margin">Dan. 3. 12.</note> We read in the Prophesie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that
those three famous Iewes, <hi>Sidrach, Misach,</hi> and <hi>Abdenago,</hi>
were most trustie vnto King <hi>Nabuchodonosor</hi> in temporall
affayres, and so much esteemed by him, as he made them
his vniuersall Gouernors ouer all the workes of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of <hi>Babylon,</hi> saith the <hi>Scripture:</hi> and yet when it came
to the poynt,<note place="margin">No obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God &amp; a mans Conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> that he would haue them for his honour
and pleasure, and vpon his commandement, adore the
golden <hi>Statua,</hi> which he had set vp; they forsooke him
flatly, and said to him in the presence o all his Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
assembled togeather, that they were not so much
as to answere him in that Commandement, nor would
they do, as he had appoynted them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:4755:30"/>
XXXIX. The like in effect did the ancienter
Iewes do with King <hi>Pharao</hi> of <hi>Egypt;</hi> for that albeit in
temporall affayres they obeyed him, euen in that tyme
when he oppressed, and persecuted them most: yet in
that he would haue had them stay and sacrifice in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
and not follow <hi>Moyses</hi> their Spirituall Superiour into
the desert (notwithstanding that the King had some
cause perhaps to suspect their temporall Allegiance,
also by that departure, they being a potent multitude
of people:) yet would they not obey him, nor do as he
would haue them, when they persuaded themselues
that God would haue the contrary.</p>
               <p>XL. I lett passe how <hi>Daniel</hi> and his fellowes would
not eate the meates of the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 1.</note> nor <hi>Tobie</hi> those
of the <hi>Asyrians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tob. 1.</note> &amp; much lesse would he leaue of to bury
the dead, though it were forbidden by Proclamation
vnder payne of death, The <hi>Machabees</hi> in like manner
obeyed King <hi>Antiochus</hi> so long,<note place="margin">1. Macha. 1.</note> as he commanded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
against their Law and Conscience: but when
he went about to force them to sacrifice, and to eate
swynes-flesh, and other things against their Law and
Conscience, they refused openly to performe that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
So as these places of Scriptures alledged by the
Apologer, do proue nothing for him at all, but are
rather flatt against him, and for vs, as yow haue
seene.</p>
               <p>XLI. And much more do make against him,<note place="margin">Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes of au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorityes
alledged out of the ancient Fathers, for that
they go about to proue the very same poynt that we
heere hold, that in temporall &amp; cyuill affayres we
must obey dutifully our temporall Princes, though In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
or Pagans: but not in matters concerning God,
our Religion, or Conscience. And his very first example
out of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> is such, as I maruaile much, that he
would cyte the same, but that somwhat for shew must
be alleadged: For it maketh so clearly &amp; directly against
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:4755:30"/>
him, as if it had beene written purposely to confute him
in this our case. But let vs heare what it is. Agreable to
the Scriptures (<hi>saith he</hi>) did the Fathers teach.<note place="margin">Apol. pag. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Augustine</hi>
speaking of <hi>Iulian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">August. in Psal. 124.</note> saith thus: <hi>Iulian</hi> was an vnbelieuing
Emperour, was he not an <hi>Apostata?</hi> an oppressor, and
an Idolatour? <q>Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> souldiours serued that vnbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
Emperour: when they came to the cause of Christ,
they would acknowledge no Lord, but him that is in
heauen: when he would haue them worship Idolls &amp;
sacrifice, they preferred God before him: but when he
said, go forth to fight, inuade such a nation, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
obeyed: they distinguished their eternall Lord
from their temporall, and yet were they subiect euen
vnto their temporall Lord, for his sake, that was their
eternall Lord and Maister.</q> Thus he.</p>
               <p>XLII. And can any thing be spoken more cleerly
for vs,<note place="margin">How farre we are bound to our te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Prince.</note> and for our cause, then this? For euen thus do
we offer to our King &amp; Soueraigne: we will serue him:
we will obey him: we will go to warre with him: we
will fight for him: and we will do all other offices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to temporall duty: but when the cause of
Christ commeth in hand, who is Lord of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
or any matter concerning the same, or our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
there we do, as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> heere appoynteth vs,
preferre our eternall King, before our Temporall.</p>
               <p>XLIII. And like to these are all the other places of
Fathers cyted by him, who distinguish expresly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the Temporall honour and Allegiance due to
the Emperour, and the other of our Religion, &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
belonging only to God.<note place="margin">Apol. pag. 23.</note> And to that playne
sense are <hi>Tertullians</hi> words cyted by the Apologer:<note place="margin">Tertull. ad Scap.</note> 
                  <hi>VVe
honour the Emperour in such sorte as is lawfull for vs, and expedient
for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a man second after God, and as hauing receyued from
God, whatsoeuer he is, and only lesse then God.</hi> And will not
the Catholicks of <hi>England</hi> vse this speach also vnto their
King? Or will the Apologer himselfe deny that <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:4755:31"/>
heere meant nothing els, but in temporall affayres, for
much as the Emperour at that tyme were Heathen &amp;
Gentils, and consequently were not to be obeyed in
any poynt against Christian faith or Religion?</p>
               <p>XLIV. The like playne doctrine haue the words of
<hi>Iustinus Martyr</hi> to the Emperour himselfe, cyted heere in
the third place,<note place="margin">Iust. Apol. 2. ad Anto. Imperat.</note> to witt: <hi>VVe only adore God, and in all other
things wee cheerfully performe seruice to yow, professing yow to be
Emperours, and Princes of men.</hi> And do not all English Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks
say the same at this day, that in all other things,
that concerne not God &amp; his Obedience, by rule of
Catholicke Religion, they offer cheerfully to serue his
Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, acknowledging him to be their liege Lord and
King, &amp; inferiour only to god in his Temporall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment?
And how then are these, and such other
places brought in for witnesse, as though they had somwhat to say against vs?</p>
               <p>XLV. The other two sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, in like manner cyted
out of <hi>Optatus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Optat. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra Parmen. li. 3. Ambros. Orat. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra Auxent. de Basilicis no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trad. lib. s. Epist.</note> and <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> the first saying: <hi>That
ouer the Emperour there is none, but only God, that made
the Emperour.</hi> And the other, <hi>That teares were his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
against the armes, &amp; souldiours of the Emperours: That he
neyther ought, or could resist:</hi> Neyther of them do make
any thing against vs, or for the Apologer, euen
as they are heere nakedly cyted, without declaration
of the circumstances: for that in temporall affayres the
King or Emperour is Supreme, next vnder God. And
when the Emperour will vse secular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orces against the
Priests of his dominion, they, being no souldiours, must
fall to prayers, and teares, which are Priestly weapons.
But what? Did <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> by this acknowledge that the
Emperour had higher Authority, then he, in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matters?
Or that if he had offered him an Oath, repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant
to his Religion, or Conscience, in those matters
he would haue obeyed, or acknowledged his Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?
No truly. For in three seuerall occasions that fell
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4755:31"/>
out, he flatly denyed the same, which this Apologer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
craftily dissembleth,<note place="margin">Three oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions in which <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> resisted the Emperour his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne.</note> and saith not a word therof.</p>
               <p>XLVI. The first was, when he was cited by <hi>Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
the Iribune, bringing with him a publicke Notarie
to testifie the same, in the name of the Emperour <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
the yonger, to come and conferre, or dispute with
the hereticall Bishop <hi>Auxentius,</hi> in the presence of his
Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> and other of his Nobility and Counsell, which
poynt S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> refused vtterly to do, tellyng the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour

                  <hi>and

yeare after in <hi>Milane,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amb. l. 1. epist. 33.</note> when the said Emperour, by suite
of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and fauour of <hi>Iustina</hi> the Empresse on their
behalfe, made a Decree that a certayne Church of that
Citty should be deliuered to the said <hi>Arrians:</hi> which
Decree <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> the Bishop refused to obey. And when
the Emperours Officers comming with armes, vrged
greatly to giue possession of the Church, he fled to his
former weapons of weeping and praying: <hi>Ego Missam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
caepi &amp;c.</hi> I began to say Masse, and when the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall
Magistrate vrged still, that the Emperour vsed but his
owne right, in appoynting that Church to be deliuered,
<hi>S. Ambrose</hi> answered, <hi>Quae diuina sunt, Imperatoriae Potestati non
esse subiecta:</hi> That such things as belonge to God, are not
subiect to the Imperiall power. And thus answered
<hi>S. Ambrose</hi> about the gyuing vp of a materiall Church.
What would he haue said in greater matters.</p>
               <p>XLVIII. The third occasion was, when the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Emperour sent his <hi>Tribunes,</hi> and other Officers to require
certayne Vessells belonging to the Church to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
which <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> constantly denyed to do, saying:
<hi>That in this, he could not obey:</hi> And further adding,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4755:32"/>
                  <hi>That if the Emperour did loue him selfe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amb. Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>he should abstayne from

the same more at large,<note place="margin">Ambros. Concion. de Basililcis no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tradendis haer. to. 5.</note> he saith: That he gaue to
Cesar that which was Cesars, and to God that which
belonged to God: but that the Temple of God could
not be the right of Cesar, which we speake (saith he)
to the Emperours honour. <q>For what is more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
vnto him, then that he being an Emperour, be
called a Child of the Church, for that a good Emperour
is within the Church, but not aboue the Church. So
<hi>S. Ambrose.</hi> What would he haue done, or said, if he had

against it, to the Emperour himselfe: yet to shew
his due respect in temporall things vnto him, and for
that indeed the law was not absolutly so euill, but
that in some good sense, it might be tolerated, to witt,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4755:32"/>
that Soldiours sworne to the Emperors warres, might
not (during the said Oath &amp; obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) be receaued into
Monasteryes, but with the Princes licence: yet for that
it tended to the abridgment of Ecclesiasticall freedome,

the same, and dealt earnestly with the Emperour to
relinquish it, or to suffer it to be so moderated, as it
might stand without preiudice of Christian liberty:
wherunto the Emperour at length yealded, and so <hi>S.
Gregorie</hi> sent the same abroad vnto diuers Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
and Archbishoppes of sundry Kingdomes
mencioned by him, but corrected first and reduced by
himself, as supreme Pastour, to a reasonable lawfulnes,
and temperate moderation: to witt, That those who

in limiting and moderating the Emperours law,
according to the law of God, though in temporall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectes
he shewed him the Obedience, that was due

law of the Emperour, without reprehension of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnes

did intringe the liberty of Religious life, when men
were called therunto, that he would not haue much

in reason can imagine the contrary.</p>

                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These things briefly which we

deemed to be presented to our Lord the Emperour, <q>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching

and if any thing be reasonably censured, it may

God.</q> 
                  <hi>So the Councell.</hi> And heerof would the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger
inferre that this Councell of Bishops submitted it

               <p>LII. But I would aske him wherin? To take any
<hi>Oath</hi> that the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> should propose vnto
them? Wee see no <hi>Oath</hi> offered, nor mentioned, and so
nothing heere to our purpose. Wherin then, or why are
they said to haue submitted themselues? For that, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
it is said in the Preface of the Councell, that they
were gathered togeather by order, and commandement
of the said Emperour. Surely it was hard, that so many
Bishops, &amp; Archbishops should be assembled togeather
without his liking, and Order. But that the consent,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4755:33"/>
direction, and chiefe Commission for the same, came
from the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> may easily be gathered: for
that in the first Councell that he caused to be celebrated
in his Dominions,<note place="margin">Vide in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitularibus Pranc. li. 6. c. 285. de Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for that yow haue heard before out of <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> that

are such as could not be put in execution, but by the

But that euer Temporall Obedience was against faith

                     </gap>es, as in this Breue is alledged, was
neuer before heard or read of in the Christian Church;
and therfore, I would haue wished the <hi>Pope,</hi> be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ore he
had set downe this Commandement to all Papists
heere, That since in him is the Power, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of his spirit, to make new Articles of
faith, when euer it shall please him; That he had
first set it downe for an Article of faith, before he
had commanded all Catholicks to belieue, and obey it.</q>
So he.</p>
               <p>LVI. And I maruaile, that a man professing
learning, would euer so tryfle, or rather wrangle, and
wrongfully charge his Aduersary: for that I fynde no
such thing in the <hi>Breue</hi> at all, as that Temporall Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
is against faith and saluation of soules: nor
doth the <hi>Breue</hi> forbid it:<note place="margin">Neither the Pope or Church can make any new Articles of Faith.</note> nor doth any learned Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
affirme, that the Pope hath power <hi>to make new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith:</hi> nay rather it is the full consent of all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
Deuines, that the Pope, and all the Church to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather,
cannot make any one new Article of beliefe,
that was not truth before, though they may explane
what points are to be held for matters of faith, &amp; what
not, vpon any new heresies or doubts arising: Which
articles so declared, though they be more particulerly,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4755:35"/>
and perspicuously knowne now for points of faith, and
so to be belieued, after the declaration of the Church
then before: yet had they before the self same truth in
themselues, that now they haue. Nor hath the said
Church added any thing to them, but this declaration
only.<note place="margin">3. Reg. 3.</note> As for example, when <hi>Salomon</hi> declared the true
Mother of the child that was in doubt, he made her not
the true mother thereby, nor added any thing to the
truth of her being the mother: but only the declaration.
Wherefore this also of ascribing power to the Pope of
<hi>making new Articles of faith,</hi> is a meere calumniation
amongst the rest.</p>
               <p> LVII. There followeth his conclusion: <q>I will then
conclude (saith he) my answere to this point in a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma:
Eyther it is lawfull to obey the Soueraigne in
temporall things or not. If it be lawfull, as I neuer
heard or read it doubted of: then why is the Pope so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust
and cruell towards his owne Catholicks, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
them to disobey their Soueraignes lawfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement?
If it be vnlawfull, why hath he not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
any one cause or reason therof?</q> But this <hi>Dilemma</hi> 
is easily dissolued, or rather falleth of it self, both his
pillers being but broken reeds, framed out of false sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions:
For that the Pope neyther denyeth it,<note place="margin">Wilfull mistaking of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersy.</note> to be
lawfull, to obey the Soueraigne in Cyuill and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
things nor doth he command Catholicks to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
their Prince his lawfull comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dements: but only
where they be vnlawful to be performed, as he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them to be in the taking of this <hi>Oath.</hi> Wherof he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
sundry causes, and reasons, I meane, so many
as the Oath it self co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyneth points co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Religion:
to which end, he setteth downe the whole Oath, as it
lyeth, with intimation, that those points cannot be
sworne with integrity of Catholicke Religion, &amp; good
conscience: which is sufficient for a Iudge, who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth
not, but determineth. So as, hereupon to make
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4755:35"/>
illation of the Popes vniust, and cruell dealing towards
Catholicks, by this his decision, as though he sorbad
Ciuill Obedience; is to buyld vpon a voluntary false
ground, supposing, or rather imposing the Pope to
say, that which he doth not, and then to refute
him, as though he had said it indeed. And is this good
dealing?</p>
               <p>LVIII. <q>But yet he goeth forward vpon the same
false ground to buyld more accusations against the
Pope, saying: That if the foundation of his exhorting
Catholicks to beare patiently their tribulations, be
false <hi>(as this Apologer auoucheth it to be)</hi> then it can worke
no other effect, then to make him guylty of the bloud
of so many of his sheep, whome he doth thus willfully
cast away, not only to the needles losse of their liues,
and ruyne of their famylies: but euen to the laying on
of a perpetuall slander vpon all Papists. As it no zealous
Papist could be a true Subiect to his Prince: and that
Religion, and the Temporall Obedience to the Cyuill
Magistrate, were two things incompatible and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant
in themselues.</q> 
                  <hi>Thus he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LIX. But who doth not see that these be all iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
inferences, inforced vpon the former false suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
to witt, <q>That Catholicks suffer nothing for
their Conscience, That there is no persecution at all in
<hi>England,</hi> That there is nothing exacted by this last oath,
but <hi>only</hi> and <hi>meerly</hi> Cyuill Obedience, and that in this,
the Pope exhorteth them to disobey the Temporall
Prince in Temporall dutyes, and thereby giueth iust
occasion to the Prince to vse his sword against them,
and consequently that he is cause of the effusion of their
bloud, and of the infamy of Catholicke Religion: as
though no Catholicke by his Religion could be a true
Subiect to his Temporall Prince.</q> All which supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
being vtterly mistaken, and not true, the more
often they are repeated, the more exorbitant seemeth
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4755:36"/>
the ouersight of the wryter. And in my opinion, the
very same might haue bene obiected vnto <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> and
other Fathers of the Primitiue Church,<note place="margin">See S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort. ad Martyr.</note> that they were
guylty of so many Martyrs bloud, willfully cast away,
and of the ruyne of their familyes, and other inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
by exhorting them not to doe against their
Consciences, nor to yield to their Temporall Princes
Commandements against God and their Religion: no
not for any torments that might be layd vpon them,
nor for any losses that might fall vnto them, of goods,
life, honour, same, friendes, wife, children, or the like,
which were ordinary exhortations in those daies of
persecution, as by their Bookes yet extant doth
appeare.</p>
               <p>LX. Neyther is it sufficient to say, that those
tymes and ours are different, for that the things then
demaunded were apparantly vnlawfull, but these
not: for that, to vs that are Catholicks, these
things are as vnlawfull now, as those other were
then to them, for that they are no lesse against our
Consciences in matters of Religion. For why should
it be more damnable then, and indispensable to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
vp a Byble, or new Testament, for examples
sake, when the Emperour commaunded it, then
now to sweare an Oath against our Conscience
and Religion, when our Temporall Prince exacteth
it? For that this, perhaps, is called the Oath of
Allegiance? Who knoweth not, that the fayrest
tytle is put vpon the fowlest matter, when it is
to be persuaded or exacted? And he that shall read
the Historyes of that tyme, and of those auncient
afflictions, shall see that Act also to haue beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,<note place="margin">See Euseb. lib. 8. ca. 4. &amp; Aug. de Bap. lib. 7. cap. 2. &amp; lib. 7. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra Cresc. cap. 27. &amp; Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nob. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra Gentes lib 4. in fine.</note>
as of Obedience and Allegiance, and not
of Religion, being only the deliuery vp of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
bookes: and yet did the whole Church of God
condemne them for it, that deliuered the same, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4755:36"/>
held for true Martyrs, all those that dyed for denying
thereof, for that they would not doe an Act against
their Consciences.</p>
               <p>LXI. Well then, to draw to an end of this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
paragraph about the two Breues of <hi>Paulus
Quintus,</hi> two things more writeth this Apologer,
whereunto I must in like manner say somewhat.
<q>The first is, That Pope <hi>Clemens Octauus</hi> sent into
<hi>England,</hi> two Breues immediatly before the late 
Queenes death, for debarring of his Maiestie, our
now Soueraigne, of the Crowne, or any other, that
eyther would professe, or any way tolerate the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours
of our Religion, contrary (saieth he) to
his manifold vowes, and protestations, <hi>simul &amp; eodem
tempore,</hi> and, as it were, deliuered, <hi>vno &amp; eodem Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu,</hi>
to diuers of his Maiestyes Ministers abroade,
professing all kyndenes, and shewing all forwardnes to aduance him to this Crowne, &amp;c.</q> Wherein still
I fynde the same veyne of exaggeration, and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niation
continued by the Apologer. For hauing
procured some knowledge of those two Breues,<note place="margin">Touching the two Breues of Clemens octauus. Anno Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini 1600. &amp; 1603.</note>
I fynde them not sent into <hi>England</hi> togeather, <hi>nor
immediatly before the late Queenes death,</hi> but the one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
yeares before shee dyed, and the other after her
death, and this to different effects. For in the first, the
Pope being consulted, what Catholicks were bound
to doe in conscience, for admitting a new Prince
after the Queene should be dead, for so much
as some of different Religions, were, or might be,
pretenders; he determined that a Catholicke was
to be preferred, not thinking (as may be presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
to preiudice therein his Maiesty that now
is, of whome, vpon the relations, and earnest asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerations
of those his Maiestyes Ministers abroad,
who heere are mentioned, he had conceaued firme
hope, that his Highnes was not farre from being a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4755:37"/>
Catholicke, or at least wise not altogeather so alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
from that Religion, or professours therof, as
reasonable hope might not be conceaued of his
conuersion: though in regard of not preiudicing
his Tytle in <hi>England,</hi> the said Ministers auouched,
that it was not thought expedient at that tyme to
make declaration therof.</p>
               <p>LXII. This was auerred then, how truly
or falsly I know not. But many letters and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
are extant hereof, which were the cause
of those demonstrations of <hi>Clemens Octauus,</hi> to fauour
his M.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Tytle, which he did so hartily and
effectually, as when he, after the Queenes death,
vnderstood that he was called for into <hi>England,</hi> he
wrote presently the second Breue, exhorting all
Catholicks to receaue and obey him willingly, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
that at leastwise they should be permitted to
liue peaceably vnder him. And this is the very
truth of those two Breues: nor was there in the
former any one word against his Maiesty then of
<hi>Scotland;</hi> and much lesse that he was therin called the
<hi>Scottish Hereticke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In his Charge at Norwich 4. August. anno 1606.</note> as <hi>Syr Edward Cooke</hi> hath deuised
since, and falsely vttered in print without shame
or conscience. Nor was there any such wordes, as
heere are alleadged, against any that would but
<hi>tolerate the Professours of Protestants Religion:</hi> nor was
there any such double dealing or dissimulation in
<hi>Pope Clement</hi> his speaches, or doings, concerning
his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ty</hi> as heere are set downe. But the truth is,
that he loued his person most hartily, and alwaies
spake honourably of him, treated kindely all those
of his nation, that said they came from him, or
any wayes belonged vnto him: and often tymes vsed
more liberality that way, vpon diuers occasions,
then is conuenient, perhaps, for me to vtter
heere: caused speciall prayer to be made for his
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4755:37"/>
Maiesty, wherof, I suppose, his Highnes cannot
altogeather be ignorant, and much lesse can so
noble a nature be ingrate for the same, which assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
me, that those things vtterd by this Apologer,
so farre from the truth, could not be conferred
with his Maiesty, but vttered by the Authour ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
vpon his owne splene, against the Pope, and such
as are of his Religion.</p>
               <p>LXIII. The second and last point affirmed
by the Apologer in this Paragraph,<note place="margin">To the last poynt.</note> is, that the first
of these two Breues of <hi>Paulus Quintus</hi> was iudged to
be farre <hi>against Deuinity, Policy, and naturall sense, by
sundry Catholicks, not of the simpler sort, but of the best account
both for learning and experience among them, wherof the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest
was one, and consequently, that it was held but for a
counterfaite libell, deuised in hatred of the Pope.</hi> &amp;c. All
this (I say) hath much calumniation in it, and
litle truth. For albeit some might doubt, perhaps,
whether it came immediatly from the Pope, <hi>Ex motu
proprio,</hi> or only from the Congregation of the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
vpon defectuous information of the State of the
question in <hi>England</hi> (of which doubt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
if any were, there could be little ground:)
yet no Catholicke of iudgement or piety, would
euer passe so farre, as to iudge it contrary <hi>to Deuinity,
Policy, or naturall sense,</hi> and much lesse, <hi>to be a libell
deuised in hatred of the Pope.</hi> These are but deuises of
the Minister-Apologer: and he offereth much iniury
to so Reuerend a man as the Archpriest is, to name
him in so odious a matter, but that his end therin
is well knowne. And if there were any such
doubt, or might be before, of the lawfulnes of
the first Breue, now is the matter cleered by the
second; and so all men see thereby, what is the
sentence of the Sea Apostolicke therein, which is
sufficient for Catholicke men, that haue learned
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:4755:38"/>
to obey, and to submitt their iudgements to
those, whome God hath appointed for the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and decision of such doubts. And thus much
about those two Breues. Now let vs see
what is said to <hi>Cardinall Bellarmyne,</hi>
for writing to <hi>M. Blackwell</hi>
in this affaire.</p>

a letter written by <hi>Cardinall

Arch-priest in <hi>England:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apolog. pag. 36. 37. &amp;c.</note> which
letter, as appeareth by the argument
therof, was written out of this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion:
That wheras vpon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
forth of the forenamed new
<hi>Oath,</hi> intituled, <hi>Of Allegiance,</hi> there were found diuers
poynts combined togeather, some appertayning mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
to Ciuill Allegiance, wherat no man made scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
some other seeming to include other matters, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to some part of the Catholicke faith, at least in
the common sense as they ly; there arose a doubt
whether the said <hi>Oath</hi> might be taken simply and
wholy, by a Catholicke man, as it is there proposed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4755:39"/>
without any further distinction, or explication there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Wherupon some learned men at home being diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in opinions,<note place="margin">The State of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie with Card. Bellarmine</note> the case was consulted abroad, where
all agreed (as before hath byn shewed) that it could
not be taken wholy with safety of conscience, and so
also the Pope declared the case by two seuerall Breues.</p>
            <p>II. In the meane space it happened, that <hi>M. Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
being taken, was committed to prison, and soone
after, as he had byn of opinion before, that the said <hi>Oath</hi>
might be taken as it lay in a certayne sense; so it being
offred vnto him, he tooke it himselfe. Which thing
being noysed abroad, and the fact generally misliked
by all sortes of Catholicke people in other Realmes, as
offensiue, and scandalous in regard of his place, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
so much respected by them: <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine,</hi> as
hauing had some old acquaintance with him in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
yeares, as it may seeme, resolued out of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler
loue, &amp; zeale to the Common cause of Religion,
and speciall affection to his person, to write a letter
vnto him, therby to let him know what reportes, and
iudgment there was made of his fact, throughout those
partes of Christendome where he remayned,<note place="margin">Ca. Pellar. his opinion of taking the Oath.</note> togeather
with his owne opinion also, which consisted in two
poynts, the one that the <hi>Oath,</hi> as it stood, compounded of
different clauses, some lawfull, &amp; some vnlawfull, could
not be taken with safety of Conscience: the other, that
he being in the dignity he was of Prelacy, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall
Charge, ought to stand firme and constant for
example of others, &amp; rather to suffer any kynd of danger
or domage, then to yield to any vnlawfull thing, such as
the Cardinall held this <hi>Oath</hi> to be.</p>
            <p>III. This Letter was written vpon the 28. day of
September 1607. and it was subscribed thus in Latyn;

               <hi>Dom.is</hi> 
               <hi>Vae</hi>.
Frater &amp; seruus in Christo.
Robertus Card. <hi>Bellarminus.</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:4755:39"/>
Which our Apologer translateth, <hi>Your very Reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Brother:</hi>
wheras the word <hi>very Reuerend</hi> in the letter,<note place="margin">Pag. 44.</note> is gyuen to
the Arch-priest,<note place="margin">A Cauill.</note> and not to <hi>Card. Bellarmine,</hi> which the
interpreter knew well inough, but that wanting other
matter, would take occasion of cauilling by a wilfull
mistaking of his owne, as often he doth throughout
this Answere to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> as in part will appeare by
the few notes which heere I am to set downe, leauing
the morefull Answere to the <hi>Cardinall</hi> himselfe, or some
other by his appoyntment, which I doubt not, but will
yield very ample satisfaction in that behalfe. For that,
in truth, I fynd, that great aduantage is gyuen vnto
him, for the defence of his said Epistle, and that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
taken there against it, be very weake and light,
and as easy to be dissolued by him, and his penne, as a
thin mist by the beames of the sunne.</p>
            <p>IIII. As for example, the first exception is (which
no doubt were great,<note place="margin">Pag. 46.</note> if it were true in such a man as
<hi>Cardinall Bellarmine</hi> is) that he hath mistaken the whole
State of the Questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in his writing to <hi>M. Blackwell,</hi> going
about to impugne only the old <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Whether Bellar. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staketh the state of the Question.</note> in
steed of this new <hi>Oath,</hi> entituled, <hi>Of Allegiance:</hi> but this is
most cleerly refuted by the very first lynes almost of the
letter it self. For that telling <hi>M. Blackwell,</hi> how sory he
was vpon the report, that he had taken <hi>illicitum Iuramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
an vnlafull <hi>Oath,</hi> he expoundeth presently, what
<hi>Oath</hi> he meaneth, saying: <hi>Not therfore (deare Brother) is
that Oath lawfull, for that it is offered somwhat tempered &amp; modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed,</hi>
&amp;c. Which is euidently meant of the new Oath of
<hi>Allegiance,</hi> not only tempered with diuers lawfull clauses
of Ciuill Obedience, as hath byn shewed, but interlaced
also with other members, that reach to Religion: wheras
the old <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacie,</hi> hath no such mixture, but is
playnly, and simply set downe, for absolute excluding
the <hi>Popes Supremacie</hi> in causes Ecclesiasticall, and for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the King supreme Head of the Church in the same
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:4755:40"/>
causes: all which is most euident by the Statutes made
about the same, from the 25 yeare of <hi>King Henry</hi> the 8.
vnto the end of the raigne of <hi>King Edward</hi> the sixt.</p>
            <p>V. Only I do heere note by the way,<note place="margin">The tytle of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</note> that the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

saith: I A. B. <hi>do vtterly testifie, and declare in my Conscience, that

causes spirituall as temporall,</hi> wheras in the Statute of 26. of

the wordes are these:<note place="margin">Henr. 8. c. 1.</note>

            <p>VI. And further, wheras two yeares after, an <hi>Oath</hi>
was deuised for confirmation heerof in Parlament, the
wordes of the <hi>Oath</hi> are sett downe:<note place="margin">Stat. 28. H. 8. cap. 10.</note> 
               <hi>That he shall sweare to

shall accept, repute, and take the Kings M.tie</hi> 
               <hi>to be the only Supreme
Head in earth of the Church of England &amp;c. And that the refusers
of this Oath, shall be reputed traytors and suffer the paynes of death
&amp;c.</hi> And in other Statutes it is decreed, that it shall be
treason to deny this title of headship to the King. And
by like Decree of <hi>Parlament,</hi> it is declared vnder King
<hi>Edward,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Stat. 1. Edo. 6. cap. 2.</note> what this Authority of headshipp is, when
they say: <hi>For so much as all Authority of Iurisdiction spirituall, and

               <hi>as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Head of these Churches, &amp; Realmes of England and Ireland
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VII. This was wont to be the doctryne of <hi>Supremacy</hi>
in the tymes of <hi>King Henry,</hi> and <hi>King Edward,</hi> and it was
death to deny this tytle, or not to sweare the same: now
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4755:40"/>
our Apologer thinketh it not good to giue it any longer
to his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> that now is, but calleth him only <hi>Supreme
Gouernour,</hi> which is a new deuise taken from <hi>Iohn Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi>
&amp; other his fellowes, who aboue twenty yeares
gone, being pressed by his Aduersary <hi>M. Hart,</hi> about cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>Q. Elizabeth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. cap. 1. diuis. 1. pa. 90.</note> 
               <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> he denyeth flatly, that
they called her so, but only <hi>Supreme Gouernesse,</hi> which I
had thought they had done in regard of her sex, that is
not permitted to speake in the Church. But now I
perceaue they haue passed the same also ouer to his M.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>
not permitting him to inherite the tytles, eyther of
<hi>King Edward,</hi> or <hi>King Henry;</hi> which misliketh not vs at
all, for that so farre they may passe heerin, as we may
come to agree. For if they will vnderstand by supreme
Gouernour, the temporall Princes Supreme Authority
ouer all persons of his dominions, both Ecclesiasticall,
and Temporall, in temporall matters, excepting only
Spirituall (wherin as yow haue heard a litle before <hi>S.
Ambrose</hi> told the Christian Emperours of his tyme, that
being Lay-men, they could not rightly meddle:) I see
no great difficulty, which in this affayre would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne
betweene vs.</p>
            <p>VIII. To returne then to the Charge of ouersight,
and <hi>grosse mistaking</hi> (to vse the Apologers words) layd by
him to <hi>Cardinal Bellarmine,</hi> for impugning the ancienter
<hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> insteed of this later called, <hi>Of Allegiance,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Of giuing the child a wrong name</hi> (as he saith,) I see not by
what least colour, or shew of reason, it may sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d against
him. For besydes that which we haue said before, of the
<hi>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perament,</hi> &amp; <hi>modification</hi> mentioned by him to be craftily
couched in this later <hi>Oath,</hi> which by his letter he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
(I meane <hi>of lawfull,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apolog. pag. 37.</note> 
               <hi>and vnlawfull clauses</hi>) which must
needes be vnderstood of the second Oath; he adioyneth
presently the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futation of those modifications, saying:
<hi>For yow know that those kind of modifications, are nothing els, but
sleightes &amp; subtilityes of Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the Catholicke faith, touching the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4755:41"/>
Primacy of the Sea Apostolicke, might eyther secretly, or openly be
shott at.</hi> Lo heere he mentioneth both the <hi>Oathes,</hi> the one
which shooteth <hi>secretly</hi> at the Primacy of the Sea Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicke
(which is the later <hi>Of Allegiance</hi>) &amp; the other that
impugneth it <hi>openly,</hi> which is the first of the <hi>Supremacy.</hi>
And as he nameth the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the first place, so doth he

<hi>Card.all</hi> 
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> could hardly reproue the particuler

parts of the Popes <hi>Primacie,</hi> without mentioning the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Oath of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> though it were not his purpose
chiefly to impugne that, but the other. Which later <hi>Oath,</hi>
albeit the Apologer sticketh not to say, that it toucheth
not any part of the Popes Spirituall <hi>Supremacy:</hi> yet in
the very next period, he contradicteth &amp; ouerthroweth
himselfe therin. For so much, as deuiding the said Oath
of <hi>Allegiance</hi> into 14.<note place="margin">The Oath deuided into 14. partes.</note> seuerall partes or parcels, twelue of
them, at least, do touch the said <hi>Supremacy</hi> one way or
other, as by examination yow will fynd, and we shall
haue occasion after to declare more at large.</p>
            <p>IX. As for example,<note place="margin">Apolog. pag. 49.</note> he writeth thus: <q>And that the
Iniustice (saith he) as well as the error of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his
 grosse mistaking in this poynt, may yet be more cleerly
discouered; I haue thought good to insert heere imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
the contrary conclusions to all the poynts and
Articles, wherof this other late <hi>Oath</hi> doth consist, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it may appeare, what vnreasonable and rebellious
poynts he would dryue his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Subiects vnto, by
refusing the whole body of that <hi>Oath,</hi> as it is conceaued.</q>
For he that shall refuse to take this <hi>Oath,</hi> must of necessity
hold these propositions following: <hi>First that our Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:4755:41"/>
Lord King</hi> Iames <hi>is not the lawfull King of this Kingdome,
and of all other his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Dominions. Secondly that the Pope by his
owne authority may depose, &amp;c.</hi> But who doth not see what
a simple fallacy this is, which the Logicians do call <hi>A
composito ad diuisa,</hi> from denying of a compound, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the denyall of all the parcels therin conteyned. As
if some would say, that <hi>Plato</hi> was a man borne in <hi>Greece,</hi>
of an excellent wit, skilfull in the Greeke language, most
excellent of all other Philosophers, and would require
this to be confirmed by an <hi>Oath,</hi> some <hi>Platonist,</hi> perhaps,
would be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to sweare it: but if some <hi>Stoicke,</hi> or <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticke,</hi>
or Professour of some other Sect in Philosophy,
should refuse the said <hi>Oath,</hi> in respect of the last clause,
might a man inferre against him in all the other clauses
also, <hi>Ergò</hi> he denyeth <hi>Plato</hi> to be a Man? He denyeth him
to be borne in <hi>Greece,</hi> he denyeth him to be of an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
wit, he denyeth him to be skilfull in the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue,
&amp;c. Were not this a bad kynd of arguing?</p>
            <p>X. So in like manner, if an <hi>Arrian,</hi> or <hi>Pelagian</hi> Prince,
should exact an <hi>Oath</hi> at his Subiects hands,<note place="margin">Bad kinde of arguing.</note> concerning
diuers articles of Religion, that were belieued by them
both, and in the end, or middle therof, should insert
some clauses, sounding to the fauour of their owne
sect, for which the Subiect should refuse the whole body
of that <hi>Oath,</hi> as it was conceyued; could the other in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
accuse him, for denying all the seuerall articles of
his owne Religion also, which therin are mencyoned?
Who seeth not the iniustice of this manner of dealing?
And yet this is that which our Apologer vseth heere
with Catholicks, affirming in good earnest, that he
which refuseth the whole body of this <hi>Oath,</hi> as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
(in respect of some clauses therof that stand
against his Conscience, about matters of Religion) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth
consequently euery poynt and parcell therof, and
must of necessity hold (in the first place) that our Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Lord King <hi>Iames</hi> is not the lawfull King of this
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4755:42"/>
Kingdome, and of all other his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Dominions.
The contrary wherof all Catholicks do both confesse,
and professe: &amp; consequently it is a meere calumniation
that they deny this. But let vs see, how he goeth, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in prouing this whole <hi>Oath</hi> to be lawfull to a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
mans Conscience.</p>
            <p>XI. And that the world (saith he) may yet further
see,<note place="margin">Apol. pag. 52.</note> his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> and whole States setting downe of this
<hi>Oath,</hi> did not proceed from any new inuention of theirs,
but as it is warranted by the word of God:<note place="margin">The Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Councels.</note> So doth it
take the example from an <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> decreed a
thousand yeares agone, which a famons Councell then,
togeather with diuers other Councels, were so farre
from condemning (as the Pope now hath done this
<hi>Oath</hi>) as I haue thought good to set downe their owne
 wordes heere in that purpose; <q>wherby it may appeare,
that his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> craueth nothing now of his Subiects in
this <hi>Oath,</hi> which was not expresly, and carefully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them by the Councels to be obeyed, without
exception of persons. Nay not in the very particuler
poynt of <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> which his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> in this <hi>Oath</hi> is so

of that Action, and this if ours, shall be found to haue
relation, and agreeance one with the other, saue only
in this; that those old Councels were carefull, and straite
in commanding the taking of the same; wheras by the
contrary, he, that now vaunteth himselfe to be Head
of all Councells, is as carefull and strait in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
of all men, from the taking of this <hi>Oath</hi> of
<hi>Allegiance.</hi> So he.</p>
            <p>XII. And I haue alledged his discourse at large,
to the end yow may better see his fraudulent manner
of proceeding. He saith, That the example of this <hi>Oath</hi>
is taken from an <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> decreed a thousand
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4755:42"/>
yeares agone in the Councels of <hi>Toledo,</hi> but especially
the fourth,<note place="margin">Conc. Tole. 4. can. 74.</note> which prouided also for the particuler poynt
of <hi>Equiuocation:</hi> But let any man read those Councels,
which are 13. in number, and if he fynd eyther any
forme of an <hi>Oath</hi> prescribed, or any mention of <hi>Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
but only of flat lying and perfidious dealing; let
him discredit all the rest that I do write. And if he
fynd none at all, as most certainly he shall not; then let
him consider of the bad cause of this Apologer, that
dryueth him to such manner of dealing, as to auouch,
<hi>Euery point of that Action to haue agreeance with the offering of
this Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XIII. True it is that those Councels of <hi>Toledo,</hi>
vpon certayne occasions, which presently we shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
do recommend much to the subiects of <hi>Spayne,</hi> both
<hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Spaniards;</hi> that they do obserue their <hi>Oath</hi> of
fidelity made vnto their Kings,<note place="margin">The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the 4. Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cell of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo.</note> especially vnto <hi>Sisenandus,</hi>
for whose cause principally this matter was first treated
in the fourth Councel of <hi>Toledo,</hi> but no speciall forme is
prescribed by the said Councell: nor is <hi>Equiuocation</hi> so
much as named therin, but only (as hath bene said)
<hi>Iurare mendaciter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to sweare falsely, as the wordes of the
Councel are. Which how far it is from the true nature
of Equiuocation hath bene lately and largly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
as yow know.</p>
            <p>XIV. The cause of the treatie of this matter in the
4. Councell of <hi>Toledo,</hi> was, for that one <hi>Sisenandus</hi> a
Noble man of the bloud of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> and a great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,

his French Historie recordeth, by helpe of <hi>Dagobert</hi>
King of <hi>France,</hi> put out the said <hi>Suintila:</hi> and fearing lest
the same people that had made defection to him, might

in the third yeare of his raigne, this fourth Councell of
<hi>Toledo,</hi> to be celebrated of 70. Prelates, as some say, and
as others, of 68. hoping by their meanes, that his safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

also is seene there) they in the last Canon, which was
the 74. turned themselues to treat in like manner of
matters of the Common wealth, appoynting the order
how their Kings for the tyme to come, should be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished:

all those, that shall attempt the destruction of the

If any man shall violate the Oath of his fidelitie, which
he hath promised for the state, or conseruation of his

(say they) <hi>in the sight of God the Father, and of his Angels, and

profaned; and let him be separated from all Society of Christians,
togeather with all his associates in such atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptes.</hi> And this curse
they do renew and repeat diuers tymes in that Canon;

often iterated sentence of excommunication, do not
condemne any of vs with iudgement present, and
euerlasting also, if we incurre the same.</p>
            <p>XVI. This then was the great care which those
ancient Fathers (wherof the holy and learned man <hi>S.
Isidorus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">No forme of Oath prescribed by the Councell.</note> Archbishop of <hi>Siuill</hi> was the first that subscribed)
had of the dutifull obedience, &amp; fidelity of subiects to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Princes, vnto whome they had once sworne
the same. But as for any particuler forme of <hi>Oath</hi> there
prescribed, wherby this new <hi>Oath</hi> now required of <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi>
may be framed, that hath so many clauses therin of
scruple of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science to the receauer, I fynd none at all.
And no doubt, but if this King <hi>Sisenandus</hi> should haue
exacted of any of these Bishops, or other his subiects,
such an Oath of Allegiance, as should haue beene mixed
with any clauses preiudiciall to any of those points of
Ecclesiasticall affaires, which are handled and decreed
by them, in the said 73. precedent Canons of this Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
or others contrary to their Conscience or iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Religion: they would haue beene so farre of
from yielding therunto, as they would rather haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
their liues, then their consents to such an Oath.</p>
            <p>XVII. But to go forward, and speake a word or

Fathers had taken this order for the temporall safetie
of their Prince, and <hi>Gothish</hi> Nation (for that was a

do yield to Christ, the giuer of all your power, good
correspondence by raigning ouer them, in humility of
harte, and indeauour of good workes &amp;c. And we do
promulgate here against all Kings to come this sentence;
<hi>Vt si quis ex eis, contra reuerentiam legum, superba dominatione,
&amp; fastu Regio in flagitiis crudelissimam potestatem in populis exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuerit,

That if any of them shall against the reuerence of the
lawes, by proud domination, and Kingly haughtines,
exercise wickednes, and cruell power vpon the people
committed to their charge, let him be condemned of
Christ, by the sentence of curse; and let him haue his
separation, and iudgment from God himselfe.</q>
            </p>

both him his wife, and their brother, to be iustly expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

the<note n="*" place="margin">Se Chro. Vasaei nu. 631.</note> former parte of the other King his life and raigne.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4755:44"/>
And fynally some fyue yeares after this agayne in the
sixt Councell of <hi>Toledo,</hi> being gathered togeather in
the same Church of <hi>S. Leocadia,</hi> the said Bishops, togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Nobility, did make this law, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
this forme of <hi>Oath</hi> to all Kings of that nation,
<hi>Vt quisquis succedentium,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conc. Tol. 6. ca. 3:</note> 
               <hi>temporum Regni sortitus suerit

reliquas conditiones, Sacramento pollicitus fuerit, hanc se Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicam

future King,<note place="margin">An Oath prescribed by the Councell to Kings.</note> shall obtayne the height of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
he shall not be permitted to ascend to the

other conditions, that, he will neuer suffer his
subiects to violate this Catholicke faith, Marke
that he saith (<hi>this</hi>) which was the Catholicke faith
then held in <hi>Spayne,</hi> and explicated in those Councels of
<hi>Toledo;</hi> the particulers wherof do easely shew, that they
were as opposite to the Protestant faith, as we are
now.</p>
            <p>XIX. So as, all this is against the Apologer: for
that in these Councells no particuler forme of any Oath
was set downe, or exhibited at all to Subiects, that
we can read of, but only in generall, it is commanded,
That all do keepe their <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> sworne to their
Princes, at their first entrance, or afterward. Which
thing, no Pope did euer forbid, and all English Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
at this day do offer willingly to performe the same
to this Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>; and consequently, all that ostentation
made by the Minister before, <hi>That this Oath is no new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention:
That it doth take the example from an Oath of Allegiance
decreed a thousand yeares gone, by a famous Councell: That the
Councel prouided in particuler for the poynts of Equiuocation: That
almost euery poynt of that action hath agreeance with this of ours,
sauing only in this, that the Councell was carefull, &amp; straite in
commanding the taking of the same, and Pope</hi> Paulus <hi>carefull and
strayt in the prohibition &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:4755:45"/>
XX. All this, I say, falleth by it selfe to the ground:
for so much, as neyther that Councell commanded the
taking of any <hi>Oath,</hi> nor prescribed any forme to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
nor Pope <hi>Paulus</hi> prohibiteth this, so farre as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
Temporall, and Ciuill Obedience, as hath byn
declared. And whatsoeuer the Apologer cyteth more
out of these Councels, the meanest Reader, by looking
vpon it, will easely espy, that it maketh nothing at all
for him, or against vs, and consequently the entring
into the narration of this mater, with so great osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as, <hi>That the world may see, that it proceeded not of any
new inuention, but is warranted by the word of God, authorized by
so auncient a Councell,</hi> and the like: All this (I say) was
needles; for so much, as nothing is found in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
that agreeth with our case, but only the naming
and recommending of an Oath of fidelity, wherin we
also fully agree and consent with our Aduersary.</p>

doubt not, but that the Card.<hi rend="sup">ll</hi> or some other by his
appointment, will discusse all these matters largly and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4755:45"/>
sufficiently: yet for so much, as I haue promised to giue
you my iudgment of all, I shall briefly in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner lay

               <p>XXII. Page 57. of his Apology he writeth thus:
<hi>That some of such Priests, and Iesuits, as were the greatest
traytors, and fomentors of the greatest conspiracyes, against her
late Maiesty, gaue vp F. Robert Bellarmyne, for one of their
greatest authorities, and Oracles.</hi> And for proofe he citeth
in the margent <hi>Campian</hi> and <hi>Hart:</hi>

                  <hi>See the Conference in
the Tower.</hi> By which I discouer a greater abuse then
I could haue imagined, would euer haue come from
a man carefull of his credit: for I haue seene and
perused the <hi>Conference</hi> of M.<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. <hi>Iohn Reynolds</hi> with M.
<hi>Iohn Hart</hi> in the Tower, vpon the yeare 1583. two yeares
after the death of F. <hi>Campian,</hi> and there it appeareth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that the said <hi>M. Hart</hi> alleadgeth diuers tymes the
opinions and proofes of F. <hi>Robert Bellarmyne,</hi> then pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
Reader of Controuersies in <hi>Rome,</hi> but alwayes
about matters of Deuinity and Controuersies, and neuer
about Treasons or Conspiracyes. And as for F. <hi>Campian,</hi>
he is neuer read to mention him, eyther in the one or
the other. Consider then the deceitfull equiuocation
here vsed, that for so much, as <hi>M. Hart</hi> alleadged F. <hi>Robert
Bellarmine</hi> sometymes in matters of Controuersie in
that conference, therefore both <hi>he</hi> &amp; <hi>F. Campian</hi> allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him for <hi>an Author and Oracle of Conspiracy</hi> against the
Queene. And how can these things be defended with
any shew or probability of truth?</p>
               <p>XXIII. Page 60. he frameth a great reprehension
against the Card.<hi rend="sup">l</hi>l for that in his letter he saith, that
this <hi>Oath</hi> is not therfore lawfull, <hi>for that it is offered as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
and modified.</hi> Whereupon the Apologer plyeth, and
insulteth, as though the Card.<hi rend="sup">ll</hi> had reprehended the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
speech therin vsed, adding, That in <hi>Luther</hi> and
others of the Protestant writers, we mislike their bold
&amp; free speaking, as comming from the diuells instinct.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4755:46"/>
                  <q>And now if we speake (saith he) moderately, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately,
it must be tearmed the diuells craft, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may iustly complaine with Christ, That when
we mourne, they will not lament, and when we pype
they will not dance. And neyther <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> his seuerity,
nor Christ his meeknes can please them, who buyld but
to their owne Monarchy, vpon the ground of their
owne Traditions, and not to Christ, &amp;c.</q> Thus he, and
much more exprobration to this effect, that we mislike
the temperate style and speach vsed in this <hi>Oath</hi> of
<hi>Allegiance.</hi> But all is quite mistaken, and the Apologer
hath iust cause to blush at this error, if it were error
and not wilfull mistaking. For that <hi>Bellarmyne</hi> doth not
say, that this <hi>Oath</hi> is temperate in wordes, but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
in matter, <hi>aliquo modo temperatum &amp; modificatum:</hi>
in a certayne sort <hi>tempered</hi> and <hi>modified</hi> by the offerers, in
setting downe some clauses lawfull, touching Cyuill
Obedience, and adioyning others vnlawfull, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
Conscience, and Religion. Which meaning of
<hi>Bellarmyne</hi> is euident by the example, which he allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth,
of the Ensignes of the Emperour <hi>Iulian,</hi> out of <hi>S.
Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> to wit; That the images of Pagan
Gods were mingled, and combined togeather with the
Emperours picture, &amp; therby so <hi>tempered,</hi> and <hi>modified,</hi>
as a man could not adore the one,<note place="margin">A volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate for tempered.</note> without the other.
Which being so, let the indifferent Reader consider
what abuse is offered to Card.<hi rend="sup">all</hi> 
                  <hi>Bellarmyne,</hi> in char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
him to mislike temperate speach in the forme of
this <hi>Oath,</hi> which of likely hood he neuer thought on, and
yet theron to found so great an inference, as to accuse
him to buyld therby to a <hi>Monarchy, and not to Christ.</hi> Is this
a token of want of better matter, or no?</p>
               <p>XXIV. Page 62. the Apologer hauing said with
great vehemency of asseueration, <q>That heauen and
earth are no further asunder, then the profession of a
Temporall Obedience, to a Temporall King, is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4755:46"/>
from any thing belonging to the Catholicke
faith, or Supremacy of <hi>S. Peter</hi> (which we graunt also,
if it be meere Temporall Obedience without mixture of other clauses:)</q>
                  <note place="margin">Two que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and solued.</note> he proposeth presently two questions
for application of this to his purpose. First this: <hi>As for
the Catholicke Religion</hi> (saith he) <hi>can there be one word found
in all this Oath, tending to matter of Religion?</hi> The second thus:
<hi>Doth he that taketh it, promise to belieue, or not to belieue any article
of Religion?</hi> Wherunto I answere first to the first, and then
to the second. To the first, that if it be graunted, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
power, and authority of the Pope, and Sea Apostolicke
left by Christ, for gouerning his Church in all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
&amp; necessityes, be any point belonging to Religion
among Catholicks, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is there not only some one word,
but many sentences, yea ten or twelue articles, or
branches therin, <hi>tending</hi> and <hi>sounding</hi> that way as before
hath bene shewed.</p>
               <p>XXV. To the second question may make answere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
euery clause in effect of the Oath it self. As for example
the very first:<note place="margin">Clauses of beliefe or not beliefe in the Oath.</note> 
                  <hi>I A. B. doe truly, and sincerely acknowledge, professe,
testify, &amp; declare in my Conscience, that the Pope neither of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
nor by any authority of the Sea or Church of Rome, hath any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
&amp; authority to &amp;c.</hi> doth not this include eyther beliefe,
or vnbeliefe? Againe: <hi>I doe further su eare, that I doe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my hart
abhorre, detest, &amp; abiure, as imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ous, &amp; here icall, that damnable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
&amp; position, That Princes which be excommunicated, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued
by the Pope, may be deposed &amp;c.</hi> Doth not heere the
swearer promise, not to belieue that doctrine which he
so much detesteth? How the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth the Apologer so grosly
forget, and contradict himself, euen then, when he goeth
about to proue contradictions in his Aduersary?</p>
               <p>XXVI. It followeth consequently in the Oath:
<hi>And I doe belieue,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>and in Conscience am resolued, That neyther the
Pope, nor any person whatsoeuer, hath power to absolue me from
this Oath, or any part therof.</hi> These wordes are plaine as yow
see. And what will the Apologer say heere? Is nothing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4755:47"/>
promised in those wordes to be belieued, or not to be
belieued?</p>
               <p>XXVII. But now we come to the contradictions
of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmyne,</hi> wherof the Apologer taketh
occasion to treate, for that the Cardinall affirmeth in
one part of his letter, That neyther his Maiesty of
<hi>England,</hi> nor any Prince else, hath cause to feare violence
from the Pope; for that it was neuer heard of, from the
Churches infancy, vntill this day, that any Pope did
commaund,<note place="margin">Apolog. 38. &amp; 64.</note> That any Prince, though an Hereticke,
though an Ethnicke, though a Persecutour, should be
murthered, or did allow the murther, when it was
done by an other.<note place="margin">Bell. lib. s. de Pon. c. 8. &amp; lib. 3. cap. 16.</note> Which assertion, the Apologer to
improue, bringeth in examples first of doctrine, that
<hi>Bellarmyne</hi> himself doth hold, <q>That Princes vpon iust
 causes may be deposed by Popes: and then of facts, That
diuers Emperours haue bene deposed, and great warres
raised against them, by Popes, as <hi>Bellarmyne</hi> in his workes
doth confesse, and cannot deny, and consequently doth
contradict himself.</q> But surely this seemeth to me a
very simple opposition or contradiction. For who doth
not see, that these things may well stand togeather, are
not opposite, and may be both true; That Popes vpon
iust causes, haue waged warres against diuers Princes,
and Potentates; and yet neuer caused any to be vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
made away, murthered, or allowed of their
murthers committed by others. For, may not we say
iustly, that warlike Princes are no murtherers, though
in the Acts of warres the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, many haue bene slaine,
by their authority and commandement? Or may not
we deliuer our Iudges of <hi>England,</hi> from the cryme of
murther, though many mens deathes haue proceeded
from them, by way of Iustice? No man (I thinke)
will deny it.</p>
               <p>XXVIII. And so if some Popes haue had iust warres
with some Princes, Kinges or Emperours, or haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:4755:47"/>
themselues, that they were iust, in respect of
some supposed disorders of the said Princes (as here is
mentioned the warre, and other hostile proceedings
of Pope Gregory the seauenth against the Emperour
<hi>Henry</hi> the fourth) this is not contrary to the saying of
<hi>Cardinall Bellarmyne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Touching Henry the 4.</note> 
                  <hi>That no Pope euer commaunded any Prince to
be murthered, or allowed therof, after it was done by an other.</hi>
For as for that which heere is affirmed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger,
<hi>That the Pope was inraged at the Emperour</hi> Henry
<hi>the 5.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 65. 66. Platin. &amp; Cusp. in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Henrici 4.</note> 
                  <hi>for giuing buriall to his Fathers dead corps, after the
Pope had stirred him vp against his Father, and procured his ruyne,</hi>
neyther proueth the matter, nor is altogeather true,
as heere it is alleadged. Not the first: for this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
not, that the Pope eyther commaunded or
procured this death, which <hi>Bellarmyne</hi> denyed. Not the
second: for that the two Authours by him cyted in his
margent, to wit, <hi>Platina</hi> and <hi>Cuspinian,</hi> doe not auerre the
same. For in <hi>Platina</hi> I finde no such thing at all; and
<hi>Cuspinian</hi> his wordes are plaine to the contrary:<note place="margin">Cusp. in Henrico quarto.</note> That
when <hi>Henry</hi> the Father was dead, and buried in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery
at <hi>Liege,</hi> his Sonne would not make peace with
the Bishop of that place, called<note n="*" place="margin">See Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cler. part. 2. gen. 37. in anno 1106. &amp; Crantz. lib. 5. Saxo. cap. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Otbert,</hi> except the
dead body were pulled out of the graue againe, as
it was, and so remayned for fiue yeares.</p>
               <p>XXIX. And againe <hi>Cuspinian</hi> writeth, That the
report was, that <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7. did before his death ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
the Emperour; but that his Sonne <hi>Henry</hi> the 5.
and his followers neuer left to sollicite the succeeding
Popes vntill he was exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated againe,<note place="margin">Cuspin. in Henrico 4.</note> &amp; thereupon
had afterward this Christian buriall denyed him. And
how then, is all this ascribed to the Pope, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the Some against his Father? Our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger
saith, That he was sett on by the Pope to rebell
against him, but this his witnesses affirme not. For
<hi>Cuspinian</hi> saith that it was, <hi>Suasu Marchionis Theobaldi, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarij

as<note n="a" place="margin">Vrsperge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>Nauclerus,</hi> and others. And why then is this so vniustly
layed vpon the Pope? What Author can he bring for
it, that auoucheth the same? Why is it couertly cast in,
as though this matter apperteyned to <hi>Gregory</hi> the
seauenth, who in his life had warres with <hi>Henry</hi> the
fourth, but yet dyed before him? Heere then nothing is
so apparent, as the desire to say much against Popes,
with neuer so litle occasion, and lesse proofe. But let vs
go forward.</p>
               <p>XXX. In the second place he produceth the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of the slaughter of the late <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> by Pope
<hi>Sixtus</hi> in his speech in the Consistory: But no record
of credit, eyther in <hi>Rome</hi> or elswhere, can be found to
testify, that any such speech euer was had by Pope
<hi>Sixtus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apolog. pag. 66.</note> And I vnderstand that diuers Cardinalls are
yet liuing, who were then present in the first Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
after that newes arriued, who deny that <hi>Sixtus</hi>
euer vttered any such words, as of the allowance of that
horrible fact, though he might, and did highly admire
the strange prouidence of God, in chastising by so
vnexpected a way, so foule and impious a murther, as
that King had committed vpon a Prince, Bishop, and
Cardinall (and those neerest of bloud vnto his Maiesty
of <hi>England</hi>) without any forme of iudgment at all. And
that a spectacle heerby of Gods Iustice was proposed
vnto Princes,<note place="margin">The exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of K. Henry the 3. of France his death.</note> to be moderate in their power, and
passions: for that in the midst of his great and Royall
army, and corporall guardes, he was strangely slaine by
a simple vnarmed man, when nothing was lesse expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
or feared. Nor can any thing be more improbable
or ridiculous to be imagined, then that which is heere
affirmed by our Apologer (and yet, he saith, <hi>he is sure
therof) That this friar, which killed the King, should haue bene
canonized for the fact, if some Cardinalls, out of their wisedome,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:4755:48"/>
had not resisted the same.</hi> No such thing being euer so much
as imagined, or consulted of, as many doe testify who
were then in <hi>Rome.</hi> So as nothing is more common
here, then bold assertions without wittnesses.</p>
               <p>XXXI. And the like may be said to his third exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the late Queene of <hi>England,</hi> against whose life
(he saith) that so many practises, and attempts were
made, <hi>and directly i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ioyned to those traytors, by their Confessours,
and playnly authorized by the Popes allowance.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apolog. pag. 67.</note> So he saith.
But if a man would aske him, how he can proue, that
those things were so <hi>directly inioyned, and plainly authorized,</hi>
what answere will he make? Yow shall heare it in his
owne wordes, for he hath but one: <hi>For verification</hi> (saith
he) <hi>there needeth no more proofe, then that neuer Pope, eyther
then or since, called any Church-man in question, formedling in
those treasonable conspiracyes.</hi> And needeth no more <hi>(Syr)</hi>
but this,<note place="margin">Priestes put to death for fayned co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies.</note> to condemne both Confessours and Popes
of conspiring the last Queenes death, <hi>That no Pope hath
called in question, or punished any Cleargy-man for such like at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts?</hi>
What i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> he neuer knew of any such attempt?
What if he neuer heard of any Clergy-man to be accused
therof, except such as were put to death by the Queene
her self, either culpable or not culpable? What if he saw
some such ridiculous false deuises, made against some
Priests to make their whole company and cause odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as iustly discredited with him all their other cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and calumnious accusations in that behalfe? As
that of <hi>Squier,</hi> induced (as was sayed) by <hi>Fa. VValpole</hi> in
<hi>Spaine</hi> to poyson the Queenes chayre,<note place="margin">An. 1598.</note> or the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi>
his sadd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, which was so monstrous a fiction, and so
plainly proued for such in forrayne Countryes (and so
confessed by the miserable fellow at his death) as tooke
all credit from like deuises in these attemptes, of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Queene in perpetuall frightes, to the end, she
should neuer attend to the true way of remedy.</p>
               <p>XXXII. And with what little care of sincerity.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:4755:49"/>
or of punctuall truth, all these things are here, and
elswhere, cast out at randome, to make a sound and
noise in the Readers eares,<note place="margin">Facility &amp; custome of ouerlash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> appeareth sufficiently in the
very next sequent wordes, wherein speaking of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Sanders</hi> he saieth: <hi>That whosoeuer will looke vpon his
Bookes, will fynde them filled with no other Doctrine then this.</hi> And
will any man thinke it probable or possible that so
many bookes as Doctor <hi>Sanders</hi> hath written, both in
Latyn and English, and of so different arguments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Religion, haue no other Doctrine in them, but
this of killing, and murthering of Princes? And that
other assertion also, that ensueth within very few lines
after, against Cardinall <hi>Bellarmynes</hi> whole Workes,
<hi>That all his large and great Volumes are filled with contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi>
wherof we are to treat more presently. Now
only I doe note the facility, and custome of ouerlashing
in this Apologer.</p>
               <p>XXXIII. To conclude then about Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.</hi>
Albeit <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> and some other Popes did
excommunicate her, and cut her of from the body of
the Catholicke Church by Ecclesiasticall Censures, in
regard of her persecuting Catholicke Religion: yet did
I neuer know it hitherto proued, that any Pope pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
or consented to any priuate violence against her
person: albeit, if the forealledged Statute of the 28.
yeare of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. be true, wherin it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
both by the King himself, his Counsell, and
whole Parlament, as by the Archbishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> with
his Doctors, in his Iudiciall Seat of the Arches, that
Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was not legitimate, nor that her mother
was euer King <hi>Henryes</hi> true wife (which once being
true, could neuer afterward by any humane power
be made vntrue, or amended to the preiudice of a
third, rightly by due succession interessed therin:) &amp;
if,<note place="margin">Statut. an. 28. H. 8. c. 7</note> as the whole Parlament testifyed, it should be
<hi>Against all honour, equity, reason, and good conscience, that the

said La. Elizabeth, should at any tyme possesse the said Crowne,</hi>
then the said Popes,<note place="margin">Q. Elizab. against co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce held the Crown from his Maiestyes Mother 44. yeares.</note> respecting in their said sentence
(as it is certayne they did) the actuall right of the
Queene of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of her noble issue
his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> that now is, they might proceed, as they did,
against the other, for her remouall (whome they held
for an vsurper) in fauour of the true inheritours op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by her, not only by spirituall, but temporall
armes also, as against a publicke Malefactor and intruder
contrary to right and conscience. And I cannot see, how
this fawning Apologer, can eyther without open
vntruth, or manifest iniury to his Maiesty, auerre the
contrary. Which being true, doth greatly iustify the
endeauours and desires of all good Catholicke people,
both at home and abroad against her, their principall
meaning being euer knowne to haue bene the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
&amp; preferment of the true Heire, most wrongfully
kept out, &amp; iniustly persecuted for righteousnes sake.</p>
               <p>XXXIIII. This then being so, and nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
at all against Popes for their murthering attempts
against Princes, which <hi>Cardinall Bellarmyne</hi> denyed: yet
this Apologer, as if he had proued much against him,
in this point of contradicting himself, he writeth thus:
<hi>But who can wonder at this contradiction of himself in this point,
when his owne great Volumes are so filled with contradictions, which
when either he, or any other shall euer be able to reconcile, I will
then belieue that he may easily reconcile this impudent strong denyall
of his, in his letter, of any Popes medling against Kings.</hi> Wherin
is to be noted first, that wheras <hi>Card.<hi rend="sup">ll</hi> Bellarmine</hi> doth
deny any Popes murthering of Princes,<note place="margin">Vniust dealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Cardinall.</note> this man cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it, <hi>An impudent strong deniall of any Popes medling against
Kings,</hi> as though medling, and murthering were all one.
Is not this good dealing? Truely if the Card.<hi rend="sup">ll</hi> had
denyed, that euer any Pope had dealt, or medled against
any King, or Prince, vpon any occasion whatsoeuer,
it had beene a <hi>strong denyall</hi> indeed: but for so much, as
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:4755:50"/>
he saith no such thing, I maruaile of the Apologers
proceeding in this behalfe, for with the word <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
I will not meddle. But let vs heare him yet
further.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
               </p>
               <p>XXXV. <hi>And that I may not seeme</hi> (saith he) <hi>to imitate
him, in affirming boldly that, which I no waies can proue, I will
therefore send the Reader, to looke for wittnesses of his contradictions
in such places here mentioned in his owne booke.</hi> Thus he, very
confidently, as you see, And verily I cannot but mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
that he knowing how many men of learning
would looke vpon the places themselues, (for I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
now also that the book is out in latyn) would not
be ashamed in him self, to suffer their iudgement of him
and his doings in this behalfe: albeit he had not respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
the Cardinals answere, which must nedes be with
exceeding aduantage against him, such as, in truth, I am
ashamed for Countrey sake, that strangers should laugh
vs to scorne for such manner of writing. For if I doe
vnderstand any thing, and that myne owne eyes, and
iudgement doe not deceaue me, this Apologer will
remayne vnder, in all &amp; euery one of these oppositions,
no one of them being defensible in the nature of a true
contradiction,<note place="margin">Card. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmynes Volumes much iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by these obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> and consequently <hi>Cardinall Bellarmynes</hi>
great volumes of Controuersies, will not only, not be
proued <hi>full of Contradictions</hi> by this tast here giuen, as is
pretended: but will rather be infinitly iustifyed; that
in so many great Volumes, this Author hath not bene
able to picke out any better contradictions then these.
Wherof againe, I must say and auouch, that no one
seemeth to me any contradiction at all, if they be well
examined.</p>
               <p>XXXVI. And though I meane not to discusse
them all in this place, nor the greater part of them, they
being eleuen in number, as hath bene said, both for
breuityes sake, and not to peruent the Cardinalls owne
Answere, and satisfaction therin (which I doubt not
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4755:50"/>
but will be very sufficient, and learned:) yet three or
foure I shall touch only, for examples sake, thereby to
giue the Reader matter to make coniecture of the rest.
This then he beginneth his list of eleuen contradictions
against the said Cardinall.</p>
               <p>XXXVII. First in his bookes of Iustification (saith
he) <hi>Bellarmyne</hi> affirmeth,<note place="margin">The first supposed contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> that for the vncertainty of our
owne proper righteousnes, and for auoyding of vayne
glory, it is most sure and safe, to repose our whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in the alone mercy and goodnes of God:<note place="margin">Bellar. de Iustifie. lib. 5. cap. 7. Apol. 68.</note> which
proposition of his, is directly contrary to the discourse,
&amp; current of all his fiue bookes <hi>De Iustificatione,</hi> wherin
the same is conteyned &amp;c. Of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> contradiction
we haue said somewhat before, to wit, That it is
strange, that fiue whole bookes should be brought in, as
contradictory to one proposition. For how shall the
Reader try the truth of this obiection? Shall he be
bound to read all <hi>Bellarmynes</hi> fiue bookes, to see whether it
be true or no? Had it not bene more plaine dealing
to haue alleadged some one sentence, or conclusion
contradictory to the other? But now shall we shew,
that there can be no such contradiction betwixt the
sentence of one part of his said Booke of <hi>Iustification,</hi> &amp;
the whole discourse or current of the rest: for that
<hi>Bellarmyne</hi> doth make all the matter cleere, by soyling
three seuerall Questions in one Chapter, which is the
seauenth of the fifth Booke here cyted.</p>
               <p>XXXVIII. The three Questions are these,<note place="margin">Three Questions about Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in merits ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered by Bellarmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</note> about
<hi>Fiducia, quae in meritis collocari possit,</hi> what hope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
may be placed, by a Christian man, in his
good workes, and merites. The first Question is,
whether good workes, in a Christian man, doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
hope and confidence by their own nature, and
the promise of reward made vnto them? And <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myne</hi>
answereth that they doe: and proueth it by many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
places of Scriptures, as that of <hi>Toby</hi> the 4. where it
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4755:51"/>
is saied: That <hi>almes-deeds shall giue great confidence, and hope
to the doers therof in the sight of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tob. 4.</note> And <hi>Iob</hi> sayeth: <hi>That
he which liueth iustly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>shall haue great confidence, and hope, and
shall sleep securely.</hi> And S. Paul to <hi>Timothy</hi> saith: <hi>That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
shall minister well,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>shall haue great confidence, &amp;c.</hi> And
I omit diuers other plaine places of Scriptures, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
there alleadged by him, which the Reader may
there peruse to his comfort, shewing euidently, that
the conscience of a vertuous life, and good workes,
doth giue great confidence to a Christian man, both
while he liueth, and especially when he commeth to
dye.</p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <p>XXXIX. The second Question is, whether this
being so, a man may place any confidence wittingly in
his owne merits, or vertuous life. And it is answered,
That he may; so it be with due circumstances of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
for auoyding pride, and presumption. For that
a man feeling the effect of Gods grace in himself, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he hath bene directed to liue well, may also hope,
that God will crowne his gifts in him, as S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines</hi>
wordes are. And many examples of Scriptures
are alleadged there by Card.<hi rend="sup">ll</hi> 
                  <hi>Bellarmyne</hi> of sundry
holy Saints, Prophets and Apostles, that vpon iust oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
mentioned their owne merits, as g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ts from God
that gaue them hope and confidence of his mercifull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
and namely that saying of S. <hi>Paul: I haue fought a
good fight, I haue consummated my course, I haue kept my faith, &amp;c.</hi>
and then addeth,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.</note> that in regard hereof, <hi>Reposita est mihi
Corona Iustitiae,</hi> A crowne of Iustice is laid vp for me,
which God the iust Iudge shall restore vnto me.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> XL. The third Question is (supposing the sore said
determinations) what counsaile were to be giuen: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be good to put confidence in a mans owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
or no? whereunto Card.<hi rend="sup">ll</hi> 
                  <hi>Bellarmyne</hi> answereth, in
the words set downe by the Apologer, <hi>That for the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of our owne proper Iustice, and for auoyding the perill of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4755:51"/>
vaine glory, the surest way is to repose all our confidence in the only
mercy and benignity of God;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmynes discourse and Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were.</note> from whome and from whose
grace our merits proceed. So as albeit Card.<hi rend="sup">ll</hi> 
                  <hi>Bellarmyne</hi>
doth confesse, that good life, and vertuous acts doe giue
hope, and confidence of themselues, and that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
also by the example of auncient Saints, for good men
to comfort themselues with that hope and confidence:
yet the surest way is to repose all in the benignity and
mercy of almighty God, who giueth all, and is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
as well of the grace, as of the merits, and fruites
of good workes that eusue therof. And thus hath Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
<hi>Bellarmyne</hi> fully explicated his mynd in this one
Chapter, about <hi>Confidence in good workes,</hi> by soluing the
foresaid three different Questions, wherof the one is
not contrary to the other, but may all three stand togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And how then is it likely, that the foresaid propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
<hi>of reposing our Confidence in the mercy of God,</hi> should <hi>be
contradictory,</hi> as this man saith, <hi>to the whole discourse and
current of all his fiue Bookes of Iustification?</hi> Let one only sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
be brought forth, out of all these fiue Bookes that
is truly contradictory, and I shall say he hath reason in
all the rest of his ouerlashing.</p>
               <p>XLI. His second obiected contradiction is as good
as this,<note place="margin">The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d supposed contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about <hi>Moraliter.</hi>
                  </note> which he setteth downe in these wordes.<note n="a" place="margin">Bellar. de amiss. grat. &amp; stat. pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat. l. 2. c. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>God</hi>
(saieth Bellarmine) <hi>doth not incline a man to euill, eyther na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
or morally:</hi> and presently after he affirmeth the
contrary, saying:<note n="b" place="margin">Ibid. pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> post.</note> 
                  <hi>That God doth not incline to euill naturally
but morally.</hi> But this is a plaine fallacy of the Apologer,
for that the word <hi>morally</hi> is taken heere in two different
senses, which himself could not but see. For first Card.<hi rend="sup">ll</hi>
                  <hi>Bellarmyne</hi> hauing set downe the former proposition,
That God doth not incline a man to euill, eyther <hi>Physicè
vel Moraliter,</hi> naturally or morally, he expoundeth what
is vnderstood by ech of these termes, to witt, That
Naturall or Phisicall concurrence is, when God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth
to the substance of the action, as mouing or
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4755:52"/>
impelling a mans will: but <hi>Morall</hi> concurrence is, when
he doth commaund or ordayne any synne to be done.
As for example, If a great man should concurre to the
murther of another, he may doe it in two manners,
eyther Naturally or Phisically, concurring to the action
it self of poysoning, strangling, or the like: or Morally,
by counselling or commaunding the same to be done,
which is properly called <hi>Morall</hi> concurrence. And by
none of these two wayes, God doth concurre to the
committing of a synne.</p>
               <p>XLII. But there is a third way of concurring,<note place="margin">Occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to a sinne what it is.</note> tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Occasionalicer,</hi> occasionally, or by giuing occasion,
which improperly also may be called <hi>Morall:</hi> and this is,
When God seeing an euill man euill-disposed, to doe
this or that synne, though he doe not concurre therunto
by any of the foresaid two wayes, of assisting or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding
the action to be done: yet doth he, by his
diuine prouidence, and goodnes, make occasions so to
fall our, as this synne, and not that, is committed; and
consequently it may be said, That almighty God,
without any fault of his, or concurrence in any o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the
forsaid two wayes, hath bene the Occasionall cause of
this synne.<note place="margin">Gen. 37.</note> As for example, we read in <hi>Genesis,</hi> That
when the brethren of <hi>Ioseph</hi> were obstinately bent to
kill him, God, by the pulling by of certayne <hi>I smaelites,</hi>
Merchants of <hi>Galaad,</hi> gaue occasion of his selling into
<hi>Egypt;</hi> so as he was herby some Occasionall, or Morall
cause of this lesser synne, for eschewing the greater, but
not in the former sense of Morall concurrence, which
includeth also commandement.</p>
               <p>XLIII. This Occasionall concurrence then,
though in some large sense, it may be called also <hi>Morall:</hi>
yet is it much different from the former, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
the one may be affirmed, and the other denyed,
without any contradiction at all. And so this second
obseruation against Cardinall <hi>Bellarmyne,</hi> is wholy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4755:52"/>
for that <hi>Contradictio</hi> must be <hi>in eodem, respectu
eiusdem,</hi> which heere is not verifyed. For that when the
Cardinall saith in the first place, That God doth not
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curre Morally to synne, he meaneth by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding or
counselling the same: &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the later place, he grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
That God doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curre somtymes Morally, he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
by giuing occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only for this synne to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
rather then that, which is a plaine different thing.</p>
               <p>XLIIII. And of the same quality is the third
Contradiction,<note place="margin">The third supposed contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, about Bishops succeeding of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</note> set downe by the Apologer in these
wordes: <hi>All the Fathers teach constantly</hi> (saith <hi>Bellarmyne)
that Bishops doe succeed the Apostles, and Priests the seauenty dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>
And then in another part of his workes, he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the contrary: <hi>That Bishops doe not properly succeed the
Apostles.</hi> But whosoeuer shall looke vpon the places here
quoted,<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Cler. lib. 1. cap. 14.</note> shall fynde this to be spoken in diuers senses, to
witt, that they succeed them in power of Episcopall
Order, and not in power of Iurisdiction, and other
extraordinary priuiledges:<note place="margin">Lib. 4. de Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tif. c. 25.</note> so as both those doe well
stand togeather. And the like I say of the 4. contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
obiected, which is, <hi>That Iudas did not belieue:</hi> &amp; yet
in an other place,<note place="margin">The 4. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction about Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das.</note> 
                  <hi>That Iudas was iust, and certaynly good:</hi>
which is no contradiction at all, if we respect the two
seuerall tymes, wherof Cardinall <hi>Bellarmyne</hi> doth
speake,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de Pontif. c. 12. Lib. 3. de Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stif. cap. 14. Io. in. 6.</note> prouing first, out of <hi>S. Iohns</hi> Ghospell, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> that <hi>Iudas</hi> at the beginning
was good, and did belieue; and then by other words of
<hi>Christ</hi> in the same Euangelist, vttered a good while after
the Apostles vocation, <hi>That he was a dyuell. and belieued not.</hi>
And who but our Apologer, would found a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
against so learned a man as <hi>Bellarmyne</hi> is, vpon a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
Equiuocation of tymes, wherby he may no lesse
argue with <hi>Bellarmyne</hi> for calling <hi>S. Paul</hi> an Apostle and
persecutour, and <hi>Nicolaus</hi> an elect of the holy Ghost,
and yet an Heretick, for that the one was a Persecutour
first, and then an Apostle, and the other first a chosen
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4755:53"/>
Deacon by the holy Ghost, and afterward an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,
possessed by the diuell, as most do hould.</p>
               <p>XLV. But I should doe iniury (as before I said)
both vnto Cardinall <hi>Bellarmyne</hi> and my self, if I should
goe about to answere these supposed contradictions
at length. To the Cardinall, in preuenting him, that
will doe it much better. Vnto my self, in spending
tyme in a needles labour, for so much as euery one of
meane iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that will but looke vpon the bookes,
and places themselues heere cyted, will discouer the
weaknes of these obiections, and that they haue more
will, then ability to disgrace Cardinall <hi>Bellarmyne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XLVI. After the obiecting then of these deuised
contradictions, our Apologer returneth againe to
exagitate yet further the foresaid saying of <hi>Bellarmyne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate Popes.</note>
That neither his Maiesty, nor other King hath need to

the Popes spirituall authority in his Kingdome,
more then other Christians, and Monarches haue done
 heretofore, <q>or doe now in other Kingdomes round
about him, who admitt the same Authority and haue
done euen from the beginning of their Christianity,
without any such dangers of murther incurred therby.</q>
Wherupon this Apologer maketh a large new excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
numbering vp a great Catalogue of contentions,
that haue fallen out, betweene some Popes and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
&amp; the said Emperours receaued hurtes, domages,
and dangers therby, and consequently had cause to
feare, contrary to that which <hi>Bellarmyne</hi> writeth.</p>
               <p>XLVII. And in this enumeration the Apologer
bringeth in the example of the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the 4.
brought to doe pennance at the Castle of <hi>Canusium,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Examples obiected of Princes molested by Popes.</note> by

to haue bene slaine by <hi>Otho</hi> at the Popes motion; and
that in respect therof,<note place="margin">Apolog. pag. 72. 73.</note> the said <hi>Otho</hi> going to <hi>Rome,</hi> was

him also: <q>Of the Emperour <hi>Fredericke</hi> the second, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated,

fourth, who in <hi>Apulia</hi> corrupted one to giue him poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and this not taking effect, hyred one <hi>Manfredus</hi> to
poyson him, wherof he dyed: That Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the
third wrote to the <hi>Soldane</hi> to murther the Emperour, &amp;
sent him his picture to that effect: That Pope <hi>Alexander</hi>
the sixth, caused the brother of <hi>Baiazetes</hi> the Turkish
Emperour, named <hi>Gemen,</hi> to be poysoned at his brothers
request, and had two hundred thowsand crownes for
the same: That our King <hi>Henry</hi> the second, besides his
going barefooted in pilgrimage, was whipped vp and
downe the Chapter-howse, like a schoole-boy, and
<hi>glad to escape so too:</hi> That the Father of the moderne King
of <hi>France,</hi> was depriued by the Pope of the Kingdome of
<hi>Nauarre,</hi> and himself (I meane this King of <hi>France</hi>)
forced to begge so submissiuely the relaxation of his
excommunication, as he was content to suffer his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
to be whipped at <hi>Rome</hi> for pennance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>XLVIII. All these examples are heaped togeather
to make a muster of witnesses, for proofe of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
wherin Princes persons are, or may be, by
acknowledging the Popes Supreme Authority. But
first in perusing of these, I fynde such a heape indeed
of exaggerations, additions, wrestings, and other
vnsyncere dealings, as would require a particuler Booke
to refute them at large. And the very last here me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned
of the present King of <hi>France,</hi> may shew what credit is
to be giuen to all the rest, to witt, <hi>That he suffered his Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour

it, <hi>Vt Legatum suum Romae virgis caesum passus sit:</hi> as though he

being yet aliue that saw that Ceremony (which
was no more, but the laying on, or touching of the

and laugh at such monstrous assertions, comming

fidelity doe they measure other things here auouched.</p>
               <p>IXL. As for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple,<note place="margin">Touching K. Henry the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</note> that our King <hi>Henry</hi> the second

                  <hi>Sigonius,</hi> &amp; others, shall fynd, that
as they write very wicked thinges committed by him
in his life: so talking of his first danger in <hi>Apulia</hi> by gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
sicknes, they make for the most part no mention
of poyson at all, and much lesse as procured by the Pope
<hi>Innocentius,</hi> praysed<note n="*" place="margin">Blond. vbi supra.</note> for a very holy man, and to haue
proceded iustly against Fredericke. And secondly for his
death, they agree all, that it was not by poyson, but by
stopping his breath and stifelyng him in his bed with a
pillow, by <hi>Mansredus</hi> his owne bastard Sonne, to whome
he had giuen the Princedome of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> for feare least
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4755:55"/>
he should take it from him againe, and bestow it vpon
<hi>Conradus</hi> his other soone. But that the Pope was priuy
to this, or hyred him to doe the fact, as our Apologer
affirmeth; there is no one word or sillable in these Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
therof.</p>
               <p>LIII. But you will say, that he cyteth one <hi>Petrus
de Vineis</hi> in his margent,<note place="margin">Petrus de Vineis lib. 2. epist. 2. &amp; Cusp. in vita Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rici 2.</note> and <hi>Cuspinian</hi> in the life of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericke,</hi>
both which are but one Authour; for that <hi>Cuspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
professeth to take what he saith, out of <hi>Petrus de Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neis,</hi>
which <hi>Petrus</hi> was a seruant to <hi>Fredericke,</hi> and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
enemy to the Pope, and wrote so partially of this
contention, as Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> himself wrote <hi>Libros Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logeticos</hi>
(as <hi>Blondus</hi> recordeth) Apologeticall Bookes to
coniute the lyes of this <hi>Petrus de Vineis</hi> in his life tyme:<note place="margin">Blondus Ibid.</note>
And yet yow must note, that he auoucheth not
all that our Apologer doth, nor with so much stomacke,
or affirmatiue assertion. For thus relateth <hi>Cuspinian</hi> the
matter, out of <hi>Petrus de Vineis: Non potuit cauere, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>The
 Emperour could not auoyd, but when he returned
into <hi>Apulia</hi> he perished with poyson, the 37. yeare of his
raigne, and 57. of his age, on the very same day that he
was made Emperour. For wheras at the towne of
<hi>Florenzola</hi> in <hi>Apulia,</hi> hauing receaued poyson he was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously
sicke, and at length, by diligence of Phisitions,
had ouercome the same, he was stifeled by <hi>Mansredus</hi>
his bastard sonne, begotten of a noble woman his
Concubine, with a pillow thrust into his mouth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were, that <hi>Mansredus</hi> did it, as corrupted by his
enemyes, or by the Pope, or for that he did aspire to the
Kingdome of <hi>Sicilia.</hi>
                  </q> So he.</p>
               <p>LIV. And albeit, as yow see, he saith more herin
against the Pope, then any of the other Authours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned,<note place="margin">Inforcing of matters against the Pope.</note> for that he desired to cast some suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
vpon him: yet doth he it not with that bold as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seueration,
that our Apologer doth, saying: <hi>That both his
first sicknes was by poyson, of the Popes procurement, and his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:4755:55"/>
afterward by hyring of Manfredus to poyson him againe:</hi>
whereas the other ascribeth not the first poysoning to
the Pope (if he were poysoned) neyther doth so much
as mention the second poyson, but onely the stifeling,
and finally leaueth it doubtfull, whether the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the Emperours enemyes, or from the Pope,
or from his Sonnes owne ambition, and emulation
against his brother.</p>
               <p>LV. To the other obiection, or rather calumniation
out of <hi>Paulus Iouius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apolog. pag. 73.</note> that <hi>Alexander</hi> the third did write to
the <hi>Soldane,</hi> That if he would liue quietly, he should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the murther of the Emperour, sending him his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
to that end: It is answered, that no such thing is
found in that second booke of <hi>Iouius,</hi> by him here cyted,
nor elswhere in that History, so far as by some dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
vsed I can fynde: and it is not likely, it should be
found in him, for so much as he beginneth his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
with matters only of our tyme, some hundreds
of yeares after <hi>Alexander</hi> the third his death.</p>
               <p>LVI. So as the only chiefe accusation,<note place="margin">About the death of Gemen or Sizimus brother to the great Turke.</note> that may
seeme to haue some ground against any Pope, in this
catalogue, for procuring the death of any Prince, is that
which he alleadgeth out of <hi>Cuspinian,</hi> that <hi>Alexander</hi> the
sixth tooke two hundred thowsand Crownes of <hi>Baia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zetes</hi>
Emperour of the Turkes, to cause his brother <hi>Gemen</hi>
to be put to death, whome he held captiue at <hi>Rome,</hi>
which he performed (saith our Apologer) by poyson,
and had his pay; this I say, hath most apparence: for
that some other Authors also besides doe relate the same,
affirming, That albeit Prince <hi>Gemen</hi> the Turke, when
he dyed, eyther at <hi>Caieta,</hi> or <hi>Naples,</hi> or <hi>Capua,</hi> (for in this
they differ) was not the Popes prisoner, but in the
hands of <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. King of <hi>France,</hi> who tooke him
from <hi>Rome</hi> with him, when he passed that way with his
army: yet that the common fame or rumour was, that
Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixth, had part therin, or, as <hi>Cuspinias</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:4755:56"/>
words are, <hi>Pontifice non ignorante,</hi> the Pope not vnwitting
therof.<note place="margin">Lib. 2. hist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> The reason of which report <hi>Guicciardine</hi> allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
to be this, to wit, That the euill nature and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> which was hatefull to all men,
made any iniquity to be belieued of him.<note n="a" place="margin">In vita Alexand. sexti.</note> 
                  <hi>Onuphrius Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinus</hi>
writeth that he dyed in <hi>Capua</hi> of a bloudy flux
without any mention of poyson. And<note n="b" place="margin">Ennead. 10. lib. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Sabellicus</hi> before
him againe, relateth the matter doubtfully saying; <hi>Fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt
qui crederent, eum veneno sublatum, &amp;c.</hi> There were some
that belieued, that he was made away by poyson, and
that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Pope was not ignorant therof; for that
he was so alienate in mynde from the French-men, that
he was loath they should take any good by him: Thus
we see, that the matter is but doubtfully and suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
related only, and the French-men being angry
for his death, by whome they hoped great matters,
might easily brute abroad a false rumour, for their owne
defence in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>LVII. But as for the two hundred thowsand
crownes, though <hi>Iouius</hi> doe say, that they were offered
by <hi>Baiazet,</hi> as also <hi>Vestis inconsutilis Christi,</hi> The garment of
our Sauiour without seame: yet doth he not say, that
they were receaued, eyther the one, or the other. So as
whatsoeuer euill is mentioned of any Pope, our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger
maketh it certayne: and when it is but little, he
will inlarge it to make it more: and when it is spoken
doubtfully, he will affirme it for a certaynty: wherin he
discouereth his owne humour against Popes, and therby
limiteth the Readers faith in belieuing him; though we
do not take vpon vs to defend the liues and facts of all
particuler Popes, but their faith and authority; being
forewarned by our Sauiour, that vpon the Chayre of
<hi>Moyses</hi> shall fit Scribes and Pharisyes, whome we must
obey, in that they teach, and not follow or imitate, in
that they doe. And this shall serue for this point: Card.<hi rend="sup">ll</hi>
                  <hi>Bellarmyne,</hi> I doubt not, will be more large. If a man
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:4755:56"/>
would go about to discredit Kingly authority, by all
the misdeeds of particuler Kings that haue byn registred
by Historiographers, since the tyme that Popes began,
he should fynde, no doubt, aboundant matter, and such,
as could not be defended by any probability. And yet
doth this preiudicate nothing to Princely power or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and much lesse in our case, where the facts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
obiected, are eyther exaggerated, increased, wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
or altogeather falsifyed.</p>

this impugnation of the Cardinalls
letter,<note place="margin">Apolog. pag. 78.</note> which consisteth in the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
all the Authorityes and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of ancient Fathers, alledged
by him in the same. As first of all, the
comparison of the art, and deceipt
vsed by <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperour,<note place="margin">Nazian. orat. 1. in Iulian.</note> surnamed <hi>Apostata,</hi> and
recounted by <hi>S. Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> in placing, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting
the images of his false Gods, into the pictures
of the Emperour, in his Imperiall banner: so, as no man
could bow downe,<note place="margin">The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner examined.</note> or reuerence the Emperours picture,
(as then was the custome) but that he must adore also
the images of the false Gods. Which art of temperament,
the Cardinall doth compare vnto this mixture &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
of clauses lawfull, and vnlawfull, Cyuill, and
Ecclesiasticall in the <hi>Oath</hi> proposed; so as a man can
not sweare the one, but he must sweare also the other.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4755:57"/>
Which similitude, although it do expresse most fitly the
matter in hand; yet the Apologer being sorely pressed
therwith seeketh many euasions to euacuate the same,
by searching out dissimilitudes, and saying; That albeit
a similitude may be admitted <hi>claudicare vno pede,</hi> to limp,
or halt on one foote: <hi>yet this</hi> (saith he) <hi>is lame, both of feete &amp;
hands, and euery member of the body:</hi> And then he taketh
vpon him to set downe at length the diuersityes that
may be picked out. As first, <q>that <hi>Iulian</hi> was an <hi>Apostata,</hi>
 but our Soueraigne is a Christian: he changed the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
which he once professed, but our King not: he
became an Ethnicke, or an Atheist, our King is not
ashamed of his profession: <hi>Iulian</hi> dealt against Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
but his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> dealeth only to make a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
betweene true subiects, and false-harted tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.</q>
And so he goeth forward to weary his Reader
with many more like diuersityes, which must needs be
loathsome to euery man of meane iudgment, who know
that a similitude requireth not parity in all poynts
(for then it should be <hi>idem,</hi> and not <hi>simile</hi>) but only in the
poynt wherin the comparison is made, as heere in the
compounding and couching togeather of lawfull and
vnlawfull things in the <hi>Oath,</hi> as the other did in his
banner.</p>
               <p>LIX. For if a man would tryfle, as our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger
doth, and seeke out differences betweene things,
that are compared togeather, as like in some certayne
poynts,<note place="margin">Similitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des hold not in all.</note> but vnlike in other; we should ouerthrow all
similitudes whatsoeuer, and consequently we should
eneruate many most heauenly speaches of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in the Ghospell, that stand vpon similitudes.
As for example: <hi>Be yow wise as Serpents, and simple as Doues.</hi>
What enemy of Christian Religion might not cauill,<note place="margin">Matth. 10.</note>
and calumniate this? seeking out diuersityes betwixt a
serpent and a man, and betweene the malicious craft
of that malignant creature, and the wisedome that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4755:57"/>
ought to be in a prudent man. But it is sufficient that
the similitude do hold in that particuler poynt, wherin
<hi>Christ</hi> made the comparison. And so agayne, When our
Sauiour maketh the comparison betweene the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heauen, and the litle grayne of mustard-seed;
who cannot fynd out infinite differences betweene the
one and the other,<note place="margin">Matth. 13.</note> making the similitude to halt and
limp in many more parts,<note place="margin">Mar. 4.</note> then it can go vpright. But
it is sufficient,<note place="margin">Luc. 13.</note> that it stand, and halt not in that one
poynt, wherin the comparison is made.</p>
               <p>LX. I passe ouer many other like similitudes,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> as
that the Kingdome of heauen, is like to a man that sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
good seed in his field: As also it is like to leauen,
which a woman tooke and hid in three measures of
meale, vntil the whole was leauened: It is like also to a
treasure hid in the ground; and to a Marchant man,
that seeketh good margarites, and precious stones: And
vnto a net cast into the sea, and gathering togeather
of all kynd of fishes. Who cannot (I say) fynd out diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
and diuersityes, if he would study for them in all
these similitudes vsed by our Sauiour. For as for the
last of the net, that gathereth togeather perforce, good
and bad fish in the sea, seemeth hard to be applyed to
the Kingdome of heauen, whether we vnderstand it,
eyther of Gods Kingdome in the next world, or of the
Church in this; for that in the next world good &amp; bad
are not admitted; and in this world, the Church of
Christ gathereth none perforce, as the net doth. But yet
in the poynt it selfe, wherin Christ our Sauiour made
the comparison, the similitude doth hold; and that is
sufficient to shew the impertinent indeauour of this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologer
heere, to seeke out diuersityes, that appertayne
not to the poynt wherin the comparison is made.</p>
               <p>LXI. The next example which our Apologer see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
to auoyd or euacuate in the Cardinalls letter, is
that of old <hi>Eleazar</hi> in the booke of <hi>Machabees,</hi> who rather
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4755:58"/>
then he would do a thing vnlawfull, and against his
owne conscience,<note place="margin">2. Mach. 6.</note> or that might be scandalous to others,
he refused not to suffer all kynd of torments; which
the Cardinall applyeth to the taking of this vnlawfull
<hi>Oath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">About the example of Eleazar.</note> by such as are Catholicks, but especially by the
<hi>Arch-priest,</hi> head of the Clergie in <hi>England,</hi> whose case he
presumeth to be more like to that of <hi>Eleazar,</hi> for his
age, estimation, and authority aboue the rest. To which
example the Apologer answereth thus:<note place="margin">Apol. pag. 81.</note> That if the
Arch-priests ground of refusing this <hi>Oath</hi> were as good
as <hi>Eleazars</hi> was, for refusing to eate of the swynes-flesh
 that was proposed, and vrged vnto him, it might not
vnfitly be applyed to his purpose: <q>
                     <hi>But the ground fayling,</hi>
(saith he) <hi>the building cannot stand.</hi>
                  </q> But this is an escape
much like the former, that runneth quite from the
matter: for that the Cardinall supposeth a Catholicke
conscience in him to whome he writeth, to which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
it is as repugnant to sweare any thing, sounding
against any poynt of Catholicke Religion or Doctrine,
as it was to <hi>Eleazar</hi> to eate swynes-flesh, against the law
of <hi>Moyses.</hi> Which supposition being made, and that in
the Cardinalls iudgment, this <hi>Oath</hi> conteyneth diuers
clauses preiudiciall to some poynts of the said Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
beliefe and doctrine concerning the authority of
the Sea Apostolicke, and that the taking therof would
not only be hurtfull to the taker, but offensiue also, and
scandalous to many other of that Religion, both at
home and abroad; the application of this example of
<hi>Eleazar</hi> was most fit and effectuall. Let vs see what ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of the rest of the Authorityes.</p>
               <p>LXII. The third example is of <hi>S. Basill</hi> surnamed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
for his rare learning and holinesse, <hi>The great,</hi> who being
most earnestly exhorted (as <hi>Theodoret</hi> recounteth the
story) by <hi>Modestus</hi> the deputy of <hi>Valens</hi> the <hi>Arrian</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,<note place="margin">Apol. pag. 84.</note>
sent of purpose to that effect, that he should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modate
himself to the said Emperours will,<note place="margin">Theodoret lib. 4. c. 19.</note> &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4755:58"/>
tyme, and not suffer so many great Churches to be
abandoned (for that all such bishops,<note place="margin">The tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of S. Basil by the Deputy Modestus.</note> as would not
accommodate themselues were sent into banishment)
for a little needles subtility of doctrines, not so much to
be esteemed: offering him also, the friendship of the
Emperour, and many other great benefits to ensue,
both to him and others, if he would in this poynt shew
himselfe conformable. But this holy and prudent man
(saith the Cardinall) answered, That it was not to
be indured, that any one syllable of<note n="*" place="margin">Diuinoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dogmatum.</note> dyuine doctrynes,
should be corrupted, or neglected; but rather, that for
the defence therof, all kynd of torment was to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced.
Out of which example the Cardinall doth
gather, how strict and wary a good man must be, in
yealding to any thing neuer so litle, that is preiudicall
to the integrity of Catholicke doctryne: and it seemeth
very fit to the purpose, and the cases somwhat like.</p>
               <p>LXIII. Yet doth our Apologer by all meanes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
seeke to wype of, or weaken all that can be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out of this example.<note place="margin">Pag. 84.</note> And first of all, he beginneth
with a meere calumniation thus: <q>First I must obserue
(saith he) that if the Cardinall would leaue a common
and ordinary tricke of his,<note place="margin">A cauill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmyne.</note> in all citations, which is, to take what makes for him, and leaue out what makes
against him, &amp; would cyte the Authors sense, as well as
the sentence; we should not be so much troubled
with answering the Ancients which he alledgeth.
And to instance it in this very place, if he had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
his allegation but one lyne further; he should
haue found this place of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> of more force, to
haue moued <hi>Blackwell</hi> to take the <hi>Oath,</hi> then to haue
dissuaded him from it. For in the very next
words it followeth (in <hi>S. Basils</hi> speach:) I do esteeme
greatly the Emperours friendship, if it be ioyned with
piety, but without it, I hold it for pernicious. </q>So he.</p>
               <p>LXIV. And do these words last adioyned make
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4755:59"/>
any thing at all for our Apologer? Or rather agree they
not fitly to the purpose of the Cardinals exhortation,
though for breuityes sake he left them out? How then
is their omission brought in for a profe of <hi>A common &amp;
ordinarie tricke of the Cardinals, in all his citations, to take only
that which is for him, &amp; leaue out what makes against him?</hi> How
is this against him? Or how doth this shew any such
<hi>ordinary tricke</hi> of falshood in the Cardinal, not in one or
two, but in all his citations? Doth this man care what
he saith? This then is one shift, to answere this <hi>Ancient,</hi>
or rather <hi>Anticke,</hi> as heere he is made. Let vs see an
other.</p>
               <p>LXV. His second is by taking aduantage of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
out of the Greeke,<note place="margin">Another shift a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>S.</hi> Basils te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony.</note> in which <hi>Theodoret</hi> wrote his
story, or rather by peruerting the same in some pointes
to his purpose. For which cause he repeateth againe the
substance of the history in these wordes: But that it
may appeare (saith he) whether of vs hath greater
right to this place (of <hi>Theodoret</hi> about <hi>S. Basil</hi>) I will in
few wordes shew the Authous drift.<note place="margin">Aplo. Pag. 84. &amp; 85.</note> The Emperour
<hi>Valens</hi> being an <hi>Arrian,</hi> at the perswasion of his wife,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had depriued all the Churches of their Pastours,
came to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> where S.<note n="*" place="margin">Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret lib. 4. cap. 19. graecè. la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinè cap. 17.</note> Basil was then Bishop; who,
as the story reporteth, was the light of the world. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he came, he sent his Deputy to worke it, that <hi>S. Basil</hi>
should hold fellowship with <hi>Eudoxius</hi> (which <hi>Eudoxius</hi>
was Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and the principall of the
<hi>Arrian</hi> faction) or if he would not, that he should put
him to banishment. Now when the Emperours Deputy
came to <hi>Caesarea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Compare this to our tymes.</note> he sent for <hi>Basil,</hi> intreated him hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably,
spake pleasingly vnto him, desired he would giue
way to the tyme, neyther that he would hazard the
 good of so many Churches <q>
                     <hi>tenui exquisitione dogmatis,</hi>
                  </q> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
him the Emperours fauour, and himselfe to be
Mediatour for his good. But <hi>S. Basil</hi> answered, <q>
                     <hi>These
intising speaches were fit to be vsed to children, that vse to gape after
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4755:59"/>
such things. But for them that were throughly instructed in Gods
word, they could neuer suffer any syllable therof to be corrupted. Nay,
if need required, they would for the maintenance therof, refuse no
kind of death. In deed the loue of the Emperour ought to be greatly
esteemed with Piety; but Piety taken away, it was perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>LXVI. This is the truth of the storie (saith he:) &amp;
I haue layd downe at length his declaration, to the end
that his sleightes may the better appeare in eluding the
force of this Answere of <hi>S. Basil,</hi> as though he had said
only, <hi>that no syllable of Gods word was to be suffered to be corrupted,</hi>
wheras his meaning was, not only of Gods word, or of
Scriptures alone, but, <hi>Ne vnam quidem syllabam diuinorum
dogmatum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Crafty conueia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> not any one syllable of dyuine doctrine, taught
by the Catholicke Church, and so much import his
wordes in greeke, which are guylfully heere translated:
for that insteed of the forealleadged sentence, wherein
consisteth the substance of the said answere, to witt:
<hi>That for them that are throughly instructed in Gods word, they can
neuer suffer any syllable thereof to be corrupted,</hi> he should haue
said:<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>That they that haue beene brought vp &amp; nourished in sacred
learning, cannot suffer any one syllable of dyuine doctrynes</hi> (of
the Church) <hi>to be violated,</hi> which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme also to <hi>S. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils</hi>
purpose in hand. For that the controuersy, which
he and other Catholicke Bishops had with the <hi>Arrian</hi>
Doctors in those dayes, was not only, nor immediatly
about the Scriptures out of which the <hi>Arrians</hi> alleadged
more aboundantly then their aduersaries, but about cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
doctrynes determined by the Church, especially
by the Councell of <hi>Nice, as namely</hi> about the vse of the
wordes and doctrines of <hi>hom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>hypostasis,</hi> substance, person, trinitie, and other the like;
and whether they should say <hi>Gloria Patriet Filio,</hi> or <hi>Gloria
Patri cum Filio;</hi> or <hi>in Filio,</hi> &amp; such other differences, which
vnto the Deputy <hi>Modestus,</hi> seemed but small matters and
subtilityes of doctrine, but to S. <hi>Basil</hi> matters of great
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4755:60"/>
moment: for so much as they were now determined by
the Church, and thereby made <hi>Diuina dogmata,</hi> Diuyne
doctrines, though they were not all expresly found in
Scriptures. So as this sleight in tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slating <hi>S. Basils</hi> answer,
<hi>That such as were throughly instructed in Gods worde could neuer suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
any syllable therof to be corrupted</hi> (as though he had meant
only of Scripturs) is not sincere, neyther agreable eyther
vnto the letter of the Greeke text, or meaning of <hi>S.
Basill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LXVII. Let vs see then his third shift,<note place="margin">The third shift.</note> to put of
this matter, which is the same that before we haue
mentioned in the first example of <hi>Iulian,</hi> to witt, by
seeking out differences, &amp; disparityes, betweene the
clauses or members that are compared togeather, saying:
<hi>That albeit</hi> Basil <hi>and the</hi> Arch-priest <hi>may haue some compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison;
yet not our Orthodoxe King with an</hi> Arrian <hi>Emperour.</hi> Basil
<hi>was sollicited to become an</hi> Arrian: <hi>but the Arch-priest, not once
touched for any article of faith.</hi> And so he goeth forward
with many contrapositions. But I haue spoken suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
before of the weaknes of this manner of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And if we remoue the mentions of some persons,
that may be offensiue, the matters themselues will
easily discouer their conformity. For if yow had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
<hi>Modestus</hi> the Deputy then, in fauour of what
religion would he haue <hi>S. Basil</hi> to conforme himselfe &amp;
subscribe; he would haue said the <hi>Orthodoxe,</hi> no lesse then
the Iudges of <hi>England</hi> do now, that require this <hi>Oath:</hi>
And yet did not <hi>S. Basil</hi> thinke so.<note place="margin">Wherein the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of S. Basil and Modestus may be like in our dayes.</note> And if any man should
haue called that Emperour an <hi>Arrian,</hi> it would haue
bene no lesse offensiue, then to call a Protestant-Prince
at his day, a <hi>Caluinist</hi> or <hi>Lutheran;</hi> notwithstanding
that the reason of difference betweene the Catholicks
and <hi>Arrians</hi> at that day, be the same, that is betweene
Catholicks and Protestants at this day: to witt, the
following, or impugning of the vniuersall knowne
Church, descending from Christes tyme, vnto
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:4755:60"/>
                  <hi>Saint Basils,</hi> and from <hi>Saint Basils</hi> to ours.</p>
               <p>LXVIII. There remayne yet 3. or 4. other exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples
mentioned by the Cardinall in his Epistle to the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest,</hi>
wherof the first two are of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and <hi>Marcellinus</hi>
the Pope, whose fortitude and diligence in rysing
agayne, he desyreth him to imitate, if perhaps he follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
their infirmity in falling. The other two, are of
<hi>S. Gregorie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Three or 4. exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples togeather.</note> and <hi>S. Leo,</hi> two holy and learned Popes, and
for that cause both of them surnamed the <hi>Great,</hi> who do
set downe in dyuers places, the obligation that all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
Christian men haue, to hold vnion and subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
with the Sea Apostolicke. Vnto the first two
examples, as there is litle said, but disparityes only
sought out, betweene <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> and the story
also of <hi>Marcellinus</hi> called in question; so I leaue the same
to the <hi>Cardinall</hi> himselfe to treate more at large: for so
much, as in his former books, &amp; workes, he hath hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the same sufficiently; as also the third obiection,
made against S. <hi>Gregorie,</hi> about refusing the name of <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
Bishop.</hi> And the same I must say of the 4. also, S. <hi>Leo,</hi>
whome the Apologer confesseth to be truly alledged
against him,<note place="margin">Apol. pag. 94.</note> for exalting the Authority of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and
firmitie of his faith, which he putteth of with this
scoffe borrowed from D. <hi>Iohn Reynolds his booke of Conference
in the Tower,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reynoldes Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference. ca. 1. diuis. 2. Cicero in Horten.</note> That as <hi>Tully</hi> said to <hi>Hortensius</hi> the <hi>Orator,</hi>
when he praised immoderatly eloquence, <hi>That he would

S. <hi>Leo</hi> lift vp <hi>S. Peter</hi> with prayses to the sky, that he
being his heire, might go vp also, and be exalted with
him.</p>
               <p>LXIX. And after this scorne, he picketh out diuers
sentences of S. <hi>Leo</hi> his works,<note place="margin">The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnation of S. Leo.</note> which seeme somewhat o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,

the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of M. <hi>Iewell,</hi> to whome the same was very suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:4755:61"/>
answered before by D. <hi>Harding,</hi> and the most of
them shewed to be meere calumniations. The first and
chiefe wherof is this,<note place="margin">Leo Serm. 3. suae as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumpt. &amp; epistola 89. ad Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Vie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens.</note> 
                  <hi>That our Lord did take S. Peter into the
fellowship of indiuisible vnity;</hi> which S. <hi>Leo</hi> his aduersaries
going about to wrest to an absurd sense, to wit, that
this <hi>indiuisible vnity</hi> must eyther be in person, or nature
with Christ, D. <hi>Harding</hi> sheweth playnly by <hi>S. Leo</hi> his
owne words, sense, and drift, that he meant it only of
the <hi>indiuisible vnity</hi> or fellowship of the high name <hi>of Rocke
of the Church,</hi> which Christ our Sauiour the chiefe and
fundamentall <hi>Rocke</hi> imparted to none, but to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and
consequently that vnity of name of <hi>Rocke</hi> was indiuisible
betwene them: which if eyther M. <hi>Iewell,</hi> or M. <hi>Reynolds,</hi>
or our Apologer would haue equally considered, they
needed not to go about to disgrace so ancient a Father
with so meere a cauill: or at leastwise it being once ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered,
they ought not to haue so ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repeated it againe,
without some new matter, or reason for the same, or
impugnation of the former answere.</p>
               <p>LXX. But I will not trouble yow with any
more at this tyme, albeit there ensue in the Apology
diuers other poynts that might be stood vpon, not for
that they conteyne any great substance of matter, but
for that they seeme to proceed out of no small auersion
of mynd, acerbity, and gall in the writer, against all
sortes of Catholicke people: which CHRIST IESVS
amend and mollify, and giue him light from heauen to
see the truth, that he so bitterly impugneth.</p>
               <p>LXXI. And as he dealeth with S. <hi>Leo,</hi> so doth he much
more in the same kynd with <hi>D.<hi rend="sup">or</hi> Sanders,</hi> and <hi>Cardinall
Bellarmine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Car. Bell. about Kingly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</note> cyting out of their workes, dyuers sentences
culled and layd togeather, that seeme lesse respectiue to
the Authority of temporall Kings and Princes, and all
this to incite more his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> against them, and those
of their Religion: and fynally, against the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> he
concludeth in these wordes: <hi>That God is no more contrary to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:4755:61"/>
Belial, light to darknes, and heauen to hell, then Bellarmines estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Kings is to Gods.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aplo. Pag. 110.</note> Which is a very passionate Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
if yow consider it well, for that setting asyde the
prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for iudging in matters of Religion, which
in his Controuersyes he proueth both by Scripture, and
testimony of all antiquity, to appertayne to Bishops and
not to Princes (&amp; so was practised for 300. yeares after
Christ, when few, or no Kings, or Emperours were yet
Christians;) in all other poyntes he speaketh so reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
of them, and defendeth their Supreme Authority
with as great respect as any Authour (perhaps) hath
euer done before him. And to pretermit other places,
let the Reader but looke ouer the first 16. Chapters of
his Booke <hi>de Laicis,</hi> and he shall fynd not only the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Princes proued to be from God, by many
Scriptures, Fathers, Councels, Reasons, and other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorityes
of Saints, against <hi>Anabaptists, Atheists,</hi> and other
miscreants of our tyme; but the quality also, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
power of the said Princely Authority so exalted
both for making of lawes, iudging, condemning, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
warre, and like actions of supreme power; as will
easily refute this cauillation.</p>
               <p>LXXII. And among other propositions tending to
that effect, he hath this in the beginning of his eleuenth
Chapter, which he proueth largely, and of purpose
throughout the same; not only, That Temporall Princes
are to be obeyed out of Conscience, or for Conscience
sake; but also, <hi>Quod lex Ciuilis non minùs obligat in Conscientia,
quàm lex Diuina:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. de Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis cap. 11.</note> That the Cyuil law of the Temporall
Prince doth no lesse bynd the Subiect in Conscience,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the law that commeth immediatly from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
And how then is Cardinall <hi>Bellarmyne</hi> said heere to
be no lesse contrary to God,<note place="margin">Card. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm. exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth much Princely authority.</note> concerning Kings Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<hi>then light to darknes, and heauen to hell?</hi> But especially if
yow consider further, that when Cardinall <hi>Bellarmyne</hi> in
that booke, commeth to treat of the Authority of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:4755:62"/>
Princes in matter of Religion, though he set
downe this Conclusion, That, <hi>Non pertinet ad eos Iudicium
de Religione,</hi> The authority of iudging of Religion (which
is true or false) belongeth not vnto them, but vnto Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops:
yet, <hi>Pertinet ad eos defensio Religionis,</hi> the defence and
protection of Religion appertayneth vnto them: as also
the cyuill gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in cyuill matters ouer all persons,
as well Ecclesiasticall as Temporall, which is so much as
a Catholicke man can giue to <hi>Caesar,</hi> reseruing to <hi>God</hi>
that which is Gods.</p>
               <p>LXXIII. And albeit this might be sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to shew
the tooth that is held against Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and
the ardent appetite these Ministers haue to disgrace him
in somewhat: yet am I inforced to lay forth some few
examples more, wherby, as in a cleere glasse, the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Reader will see, behold, and wonder also, at the
manner of dealing vsed against him to that end.</p>
               <p>LXXIV. And now we haue already seene, what
general Conclusions haue bene gathered against him:
<hi>That he vseth to contradict himselfe wittingly, so often as euer he is
pressed with any hard argument by his Aduersary: That his common
tricke is to tell the sentence of his Authour without his sense: That
he seeketh euery-where to debase Kingly authority,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Calu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nious dealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Car. Bellar.</note> 
                  <hi>and the like.</hi>
Which generalityes, as, in truth and reason, they may
not be inferred, but vpon proofe, and induction of
many particularyties: so when it commeth to tryall,
yow haue seene not so much, as any one particuler
sufficiently proued. Now shall yow heare some more
examples of calumnious dealing with him.</p>

would haue it vnderstood, that for so much as in that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:4755:62"/>
place he speaketh to the Bishop of <hi>Palermo</hi> about the vse
of the <hi>Pall,</hi> accustomed to be gyuen by the sea Apostolicke

and then he inferreth thus: <hi>VVhich sense</hi> (saith he)
<hi>if yow will not admit, giue me leaue to say that once of one</hi> (Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie)
<hi>which Bellarmyne himselfe saith often of many of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
Minùs cautè locutus est: Gregorie</hi> spake not so aduisedly:
And the latin translation hath, <hi>Quod ille de multis, &amp; saepe
dicit, ex omni numero Patru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> That <hi>Bellarmyne</hi> saith it often, &amp;
of many, and of all sortes of Fathers; to wit, that they
spake inconsideratly: and yet when I went to examyne
the two places of <hi>Bellarmynes</hi> workes, cyted by our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger
in the margent, I found a strange abuse, to wit,
no such thing at all spoken of the Fathers, but only of
one <hi>Nicolaus de Lyra,</hi> made a Christian of a Iew, not much
aboue two hundred yeares past, who seeming by some
words of his, to hold a certayne extrauaga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that
<hi>S. Peter,</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Paul</hi> were not put to death at <hi>Rome,</hi> but at
<hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lyr. com. in 24. Matth.</note> against the generall consent of all antiquity,
Cardinal <hi>Bellarmyne</hi> expoundeth first, what his true
meaning was, to witt, nothing in deed differing from
the Fathers expositions, and namely of <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> and
then addeth, <hi>Quanquam minùs cautè locutus est &amp;c:</hi> Albeit
<hi>Lyranus</hi> in his manner of speach, was not so wary, as
he might haue byn, in giuing suspicion of so absurd an
opinion, and so contrary to all the ancient Fathers.
Heere then yow see, how matters are strayned. That
which <hi>Cardinall Bellarmyne</hi> speaketh only of <hi>Nicolaus Lyranus</hi>
vpon so iust occasion, as this was, is extended by our
Apologer, <hi>to often, many, and all sortes of Fathers.</hi> Is this good
dealing? How can the Apologer defend himself in this
place, from willfull exaggeration, and voluntary mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking?
In the other place cyted by him <hi>lib. 2. de Christo
cap.</hi> 2. there is no such matter at all. But let vs see some
other like examples.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:4755:63"/>
LXXVI. Pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 108. he setteth downe this generall
odious proposition-out of <hi>Bellarmyne: That Kings are rather
slaues, then Lordes.</hi> And may a man thinke this to be true or
likely, that so rude a proposition should come from <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine?</hi>
Looke vpon the place by him cyted <hi>lib. 3. de Laicis
cap.</hi> 7. &amp; yow will maruaile extremly at this manner of
proceeding. For that in this very place, yow shall fynd
that the <hi>Cardinall</hi> doth most exalt, and confirme by
Scriptures, Fathers, and other arguments, the dignity
and authority of the cyuill Magistrate among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
And in the next precedent Chapter before this
cyted, he hath this begining. <q>The fourth reason, saith
he (to proue the lawfulnes and dignity of the Cyuill
Magistrate against the Anabaptists) is from the efficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
cause, to witt, God the Authour therof, from whom it is
certayne, that Cyuill power proceedeth, as S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine
proueth throughout his whole fourth, and fifth
bookes <hi>De Ciuitate Dei,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prouer. 8.</note> and it is euident by the Scriptures,
for that God saith: <hi>By me Kings do raigne &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> 
               </p>
               <p>LXXVII. So Bellarmine: and then passing to
the next Chapter heere cyted, which is the seuenth, he
proueth the same by another argument, which is. That
in the state of Innocency, if <hi>Adam</hi> had not synned, wee
should haue had Cyuil subiection and gouernment; and
consequently it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be thought to be euill, or brought
in by sinne, or for the punnishment of synne, as the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptistes</hi>
affirmed, but must needs be of God, &amp; from God.
<hi>True it is</hi> (saith he) <hi>that seruile, or slauish subiection, was brought
in after the fall of Adam, and should not haue byn in the state of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
but cyuill subiection should.</hi> And then he sheweth the
differences betweene these two sortes of gouernment,
and subiections, to witt, that the one, which is the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile,
tendeth wholy to the vtility and emolument of
him that gouerneth, and nothing to them that are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned.
But the other which is cyuill and politick, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
principally to the profit of them that are gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4755:63"/>
therby. <hi>So as if there be any seruitude,</hi> saith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
(but he meaneth not slauish) <hi>in this Ciuill principality, it
falleth rather vpon him, that gouerneth the people to their owne vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
then vpon the subiectes that receaue the said vtility therby.</hi> And
so are Bishops called the seruantes of their flockes, and
the Pope himselfe, <hi>The Seruant of seruants:</hi> and <hi>S. Augustine</hi>
vpon those wordes of our Sauiour in <hi>S. Matthews</hi> Ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
(<hi>He that will be made first</hi> (or chiefe) <hi>among you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. li. 19. de ciuitate Dei cap. 14. Matth. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>must be

Principatu, magis s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ruus est, qui praeest, quàm qui subest:</hi> In a
Ciuill Principality, he is more a seruant that gouerneth
to other mens profit, then he that obeyeth, to his owne.</p>
               <p>LXXVIII. This is all that Cardinall <hi>Bellarmyne</hi>
hath about this matter: wherin he doth scarce name
a King,<note place="margin">How good Kings and Princes are truly ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</note> as yow see, but Bishops, and Popes to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
in the gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of those, whome they gouerne;
though he include good Kings in like manner, putting
this difference betwene a good King, &amp; a Tyrant, out of
<hi>Aristotle;</hi> That a good king gouerneth to the profit of his
Subiects,<note place="margin">Arist. li. 8. moral. c. 10.</note> wherin he is their seruant in effect (though
not their slaue, as this man odiously vrgeth) and a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that turneth all to his owne vtility without respect
of those, whome he gouerneth. And is this so absurd
doctrine? Or doth this iustify the Apologers outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
proposition, <hi>That Bellarmyne affirmeth Kings to be rather
slaues then Lordes?</hi> Who would not be ashamed of this
intemperate accusation?</p>
               <p>LXXIX. And now there remayne eleuen places
more of like quality, alleadged by the Apologer out of
Cardinall <hi>Bellarmynes</hi> workes,<note place="margin">Apol. pag. 108.</note> which being examined
by the Authors wordes, meaning, and sense, haue the
same want of sincerity which the precedent had.<note place="margin">Libr. 1. de Pontif. c. 7.</note> The
second is, <hi>That Kings are not only Subiects to Popes, to Bishops, to
Priests, but euen to Deacons.</hi> This is a playne cauill: for the
fault, if any be, falleth vpon <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi> and not vpon
the Cardinall, whose wordes are these: <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> in
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:4755:64"/>
his eyghtie and three Homilie vpon S. Matthewes.
ghospell, doth subiect Kings and Princes (in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
matters) not only to Bishops, but also to Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.
For thus he speaketh to his Deacon: <hi>Si Dux quis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piam,
si Consul, si is qui Diademate ornatur &amp;c. If a Duke, if a
Consul, if one that weareth a Crowne, commeth to the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily,
restrayne him, and forbid him, for that thou hast greater
power then he.</hi> What fault hath Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> heere
in alledging the words, and iudgement of <hi>S. Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LXXX. The third place is,<note place="margin">Libr. 1. de Pont. c. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>That an Emperour must
content himself to drinke, not only after a Bishop, but after
a Bishops Chaplin.</hi> But these wordes are not found in <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi>
but are odiously framed by the Apologer out of
a fact of <hi>S. Martyn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tewers</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> related by
auncient <hi>Sulpitius</hi> in his life,<note place="margin">Sulpitius in vita D. Martini.</note> that he sitting one day at
dynner with the Emperour <hi>Maximus,</hi> and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
officer bringing a cup of wine to his Lord, he
would not drinke therof first, but gaue it to the Bishop
to beginne, who accepting therof, and drinking, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the said cup to his Priest to drinke next after him,
thinking no lay-man to be preferred before a Priest,
saith <hi>Sulpitius.</hi> But what doth this touch <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that
doth but relate the Story. May he, in truth, be said to

                     </gap>. c. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>That Kinges
haue not their Authority, nor office from God, nor his law; but from
the law of Nations.</hi> Good God! what desyre is here descried
of calumniation? Let any man read the two places here
quoted, and he will blesse himselfe, I thinke, to see such
dealing. For in the first place his wordes are these: <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipatus
saecularis. &amp;c. Secular Princedome is instituted by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; is of
the law of Nations; but Ecclesiasticall Princedome is only from God,
and by dyuine law,</hi> which he meaneth expresly of the first
institution of those Principalyties, or Gouernmentes:
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:4755:64"/>
for that at the beginning God did not immediatly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt
these particuler and different formes of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
gouernment, which now the world hath, some of
Kinges, some of Dukes, some of Common-wealthes, but
appoynted only, that there should be Gouernment, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
to ech nation to take or choose what they would.
But the Ecclesiasticall Gouernment by Bishops was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned
immediatly by Christ himselfe, for which cause
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith in the second place heere alledged: <hi>That
Kingdomes are not immediatly instituted from God,</hi> but mediatly
only by meanes of the people; which people therfore
may change their formes of gouernment, as in many
Countryes we see that they haue: but yet when any
forme of Gouernment is established, and Gouernours
placed therin, their authority and power is from God,
and to be obeyed out of Conscience, vnder payne of
damnation,<note place="margin">How Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly or imediatly from God.</note> as before I haue shewed out of <hi>Bellarmyne.</hi>
And he that will read but from his third Chapter <hi>de
Laicis</hi> vnto the 13. shall fynd store of assertions &amp; proofes
to that effect, to omitt many other places throughout
his workes. So as the former proposition, <hi>That Kings haue
not their Authority nor office from God nor his law,</hi> is very frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently
sett downe. For if he vnderstand, that their
forme of Principality and Office therin, is not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
from Gods institution, but by meanes of humane
lawes, of succession, election, or the like; it is true. But
if he meane, that their Authority is not from God,
eyther mediate, or immediate, or induceth not obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Conscience in obeying them, as it seemeth he
would haue his Reader to thinke; it is most false. And
the Apologer ought not to haue walked in these obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rityes,
if he had meant vprightly.</p>
               <p>LXXXII. I am weary to wade any further in
these obiections, and yet will I not let passe to note
three more, though most briefly, and almost in three
words, leauing the rest to be examined by the Reader
himselfe. The first is, <hi>That Church-men are as farre aboue
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:4755:65"/>
Kings, as the soule is aboue the body.</hi> The other: <hi>That Obedience
due to the Pope, is for Conscience sake.</hi> The third: <hi>That Obedience
due to Kings, is only for certayne respects of order and policy;</hi> The
first and last being meere calumniations and the other
not denyed by vs. For as for the first, though the words
heere mentioned be not in <hi>Bellarmyne:</hi> yet the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
it self of Ecclesiasticall and Temporall powers in the
Church, vnto the soule, and body, is the comparison of
<hi>S. Gregorie Nazianzen</hi> related only by <hi>Bellarmyne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nazian. orat. ad Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues timor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> pereulsos &amp; Imperat. irasc.</note> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
it must needs follow, as the same Father also
inferreth, that so much more eminent, as the soule is
aboue the body, so much more excellent is the power
Ecclesiasticall aboue Temporall, which <hi>S. Chrisostome</hi> in
like manner proueth at large in his books <hi>de Sacerdotio:</hi>
So as this is not Bellarmynes comparison, but of the
said two auncient Fathers, and consequently <hi>Bellarmyne</hi>
is not here reprehended, but they.</p>
               <p>LXXXIII. The other two places, if they be
two, and not one, but made two for multiplying of
odious matter against vs, haue byn so fully answered by
vs before, as we shall need to say no more heere therof.
For as Obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is due out of Conscience vnto the Pope,
&amp; other Bishops, &amp; Spirituall Gouernours, in spirituall
Gouernments,<note place="margin">Hebr. 13.</note> by the Apostles precept, <hi>Obedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e Praepositis
vestris, &amp;c.</hi> Obey your Prelates, &amp; be subiect vnto them;
for they watch, as being to render accompt for your
soules: So the same Apostle hath commanded also, due
Obedience to Temporall Magistrates, in temporall
affayres, by the same obligation of Conscience, as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
<hi>Bellarmyne</hi> doth shew at large, in the places by me
alledged. And I maruaile with what Conscience the
Apologer heere can deny it, cyting a place for the same
in his margent, which hath no such matter, as he would
inferre,<note place="margin">Libr. de Cleric. c. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>That not for Conscience, but only for certayne respects &amp;c.</hi>
For that treating of the obligation of Obedience to
temporall lawes, in temporall affayres, his second pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
is; <hi>Non sunt exempti Clerici ab obedientia legum Ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium:</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:4755:65"/>
Clergie-men are not exempted from the obedience
of temporall lawes. And in another place before cyted;<note place="margin">Libr. de Laicis c. 11.</note>
                  <hi>Lex Ciuilis non minùs obligat in conscientia quàm lex diuina:</hi> The
Temporall law byndeth no lesse in conscience, then the
Diuine. So as all those odious matters are but frandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
layd togeather to make Catholicks, &amp; their cause
hatefull, especially vnto him, whom vnto they desyre
most of all men vnder God, to yield most satisfaction
for their temporall dutyes, and would hope also to effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuate

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:4755:66"/>
do suggest, &amp; prosecute. Nothing can be more pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,
then to see a Noble House diuided in itselfe, &amp; the
one to beate, hunt, &amp; pursue the other, &amp; this to be their
continuall exercise, especially of Children, vnder the
sight of their owne Father, louing them all, and desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to be beloued. Ah! what sollicitude must there needs
be in that Fathers hart! And were it not a great synne to
increase the same, by casting in oyle to augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the flame?</p>
               <p>LXXXVI. Would God his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> eares, and those
of his wise Counsell could reach into these partes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the seas, and to all forrayne nations of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
besydes, to heare what is said, what is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what

So as, besydes internall dangers, which are
euer consequent vpon such inward diuisions, if forrayne
occasions should be offred vs agayne (as in former tymes
they haue beene) by forrayne warres; we should not
know how to trust the one the other.</p>
               <p>LXXXVII. The cryes &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playntes of these affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
running throughout Christendome, do giue
strange admiration vnto men, and do worke strong ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes
both in iudgments and affections: Admiration,
for that no such thing was euer expected vnder his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
gouernment, for many causes: strong effectes,
for that they worke great alterations both in the one,
and the other: In iudgment, for that wise men fynd not
any reason, eyther of Religion or State, why such extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mityes
should be pursued, with such rigour at the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of partyes interessed, to the euident danger of so
great and honorable Kingdomes, who if in wills they
were vinted, as they are in one Prince and Gouernour;

their forces were both admirable and dreadfull: In affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,

               <p>LXXXVIII. I let passe the generall obloquies, and
murmurations that are to be heard euery where, almost
in Christendome, vpon this manner of proceeding, and
much more the publicke and priuate complaints, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes,

that by the view of those Statutes, they do easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue,
what enormous effectes, do, and must follow in
the execution therof; albeit they did not both heare &amp;
see daily so many lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table preside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; spectacles therin.</p>
               <p>LXXXIX. As for example, there haue not passed
many moneths, since there were seene some threescore
Priests more or lesse (to omit others) cast into banishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
about one tyme, &amp; wandring vp and downe, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dome, according as euery man had occasion,
or necessity for their mayntenance, gaue a lamentable
spectacle to all nations, to see me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of so good partes, amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
aspects, sweet behauiour, naturall borne subiects of
the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, the most of them of very worshipfull pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage,
all of learned education, cleere and deuoyd of any suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of crymes that could be obiected vnto them (for
otherwise they should not haue bene dismissed) in the
flower of their age, to be cast out of their natiue soyle, for
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:4755:67"/>
professing that Religion only, wherby their said Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
was first made Christian, &amp; so continued vnder all
their noble Princes, Kings, Queenes, and Soueraignes,
Nobility, and Communatly, from the beginning of
their Conuersion, vnto this our age.</p>
               <p>XC. This spectacle (I say) presented to the eyes of
most Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> moued men not a litle, especially
hearing them protest their duetifull affections to his
Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> and Realme in all Cyuill &amp; Temporall respects,
without seeking of any preferments, dignityes, riches, or
other emoluments by staying at home; but only the rest
&amp; vse of their owne Consciences in matters of Religion,
which Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in many other Catholicke Countryes
are suffered to inioy, though with farre lesser reason, in
regard of the ancient right &amp; possession, which ech part
pretendeth for the vse of their said Religion.</p>
               <p>XCI. And since this tyme agayne there hath beene
seene very lately another spectacle, not much vnlike to
the former (though much more markable) to wit, a like
number of Noble and Gentlemen, with their followers
and trayne, passing in very good sort through sundry
Countryes, being lately retyred out of his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Irela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,</hi> for the selfe same cause of their Conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
and Religion; which when men do behold, and heare
them otherwise to speake honourably of his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> &amp;
the State, ascribing rather their afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to some vnder
Magistrates in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Ministers that set them on; it
moueth more compassion, and maketh men thinke and
muse, what may be the end of all this, and whereunto
fynally it may grow? Whether the like may not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
in tyme or doubted, out of other partes also of his
Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> dominions, vpon like angariatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces:
which points seeme to be of no small consideration, and
consequence to wise men; though those that be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
causes therof, will and must make light of all:
but the naturall yssue of such euentes, are not vnknowne.
And if the occasioners therof were guylty of no greater
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:4755:67"/>
fault, but only to cast his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> &amp; the State into perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
cares about the same (his Royall nature being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
otherwise to sweetnes, peace, and tranquillity) it
were a great synne in them, and scarce sufferable.</p>
               <p>XCII. Nor is the remedy heere atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted by our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister-Apologer
(of denying all, and saying that there
is no persecution, nor hard dealing with any, for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion, no not in the late Queenes dayes, when
so many were so rackt and rented for the same) any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
at all; but rather a doubling of the iniury to the
afflicted, with encrease of exasperation &amp; auersion of
myndes; as also a leesing of all credit with others that
heare it, eyther at home or abroad: for that facts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to wordes, do preponderate with all sober men,
and preuaile against the same.</p>
               <p>XCIII. And truely, I cannot but wonder, why this
late Apology hath beene so greedily published by the
Apologer, both in English and Latyn to the world, for
that the Popes <hi>Breues,</hi> being but written priuatly to the
Catholicks of <hi>England,</hi> for informing their Consciences
in a matter of necessary doctrine about the lawfulnes,
or vnlawfulnes of taking the <hi>Oath,</hi> and the Letter of
<hi>Cardinall Bellarmyne</hi> being directed only to a priuate
friend; both of them might haue remayned also pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate,
if this attempt had not byn made of publishing
the same. But now being drawne by the Apologer into
the Vniuersall Theatre of the world, besydes, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
will hold themselues obliged, or at leastwyse
prouoked to answere the same; it will follow also, that
the vnlawfulnes of the said <hi>Oath</hi> to Catholicke Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
will more be seene, disputed, &amp; condemned by
all Vniuersityes, Schooles, Bookes &amp; Treatises of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler
learned men, throughout all Countryes of
Christendome that professe Catholicke Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
also the vniust violence, inforcing men to sweare
the same <hi>Oath,</hi> vnder so rigorous paynes, as are the losse
both of goods &amp; libertie, and therwithall to sweare in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:4755:68"/>
like manner, that they do it <hi>willingly, freely, and without
coaction:</hi> will be censured (no doubt) for one of the
greatest contradictions in it selfe, and the most iniurious
manner of proceeding with Christian men, that euer,
perhaps was heard of in the Christian world.</p>
               <p>XCIII. And this now occurred to me (deare Syr)
to write to you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning my iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this matter.
What more may be said to this Apologie, when it shall
come into the handes of learned men; you will easily
ghesse by these few notes, that I haue heere laid togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which conteyne but little in respect of that which
may be written of the matters heere handled. God of
his endles mercy inclyne the hart of his Maiesty, to take
the best way in this his course of Royall Gouernment:
&amp; for so much, as he hath byn pleased to ioyne so many
Great Kingdomes vnder his only Scepter, and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to haue so great differences of iudgements in
matters of Religion, that their vnion of wills, at least, in
dutifull affections, may be so combined and conserued
by sweet and temperate proceeding towards all, as
despayre, the mother of headlong precipitation, enter
not. The Prouerbe is knowne, <hi>Qui nimium emungit, elicit
sanguine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; patientia laesa vertitur in furorem.</hi> I neuer heard or
read, that too much viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce towards free Subiects euer
ended well, especially for supposed faultes that are not
acknowledged for such, by the punished: &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequently
no hope of amendment by way of compulsion. Some
may dissemble for feare, but they are more lost in their
affections then the other. Some reasonable toleration,
and friendly treatie would bynd vp woundes from
bleeding on all sydes: Exulceration maketh them fester
more greiuously, and dangerously. To Gods holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
the whole is to be committed, who will dispose
of all to his greater glorie, <hi>siuè in vitam, siuè in mortem.</hi> And
to him also I committ yow, with my hartiest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations,
&amp;c. This 10. of <hi>Iune.</hi> 1608.</p>
