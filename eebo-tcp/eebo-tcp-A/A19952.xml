            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You are a daughter of France, and therefore fittest to owne his worke who was in his time, an Ornament of your countrie. You are the Queene of England, and therefore fittest to patronize the making him an English man, that, was before so famous a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. You are Kinge Iames his Sonns wife, and therefore, since the misfortune of our times, hath made it a presumption, to giue the Inheritance of this worke (that was sent to the Father in Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch) to the Sonne in English, whose proper right it is, you are fittest to receiue it for him, who are such a parte of him, as none can make you two, other then one. And for the honor of my Sexe, let me saie it, you are a woeman, though farr aboue other women, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore fittest to protect a womans worke, if a plaine translation wherein there is nothing aimed at, but rightlie to expresse the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors intention may be called a worke. And last (to crowne your other additions) you are a Catholicke, and a zealous one, and therefore fittest to receiue the dedication of a Catholicke-worke.

            <head>An admonition to the Reader.</head>
            <p>COurteous reader, (for so I will esteeme of thee, whosoeuer out of a true desire of vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the truth, takest this learned work into thy hands, to peruse it with iudgment, and yet without preiudice,) vouchsafe before thou begin the perusall thereof, to take these few obseruations from me.</p>
            <p>First, whereas the most eminent authour thereof, had proiected to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide it into twelue seuerall bookes or partiall treatises, and died before he could make a compleat end thereof being often diuerted from it, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold employments which his high estate &amp; calling was subiect vnto, &amp; by some more necessary dispute &amp; writings, which the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce did then affoord: his frinds, either not marking this his proiect, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all the work was not ended, neglecting that diuision; set is foorth reparted into six bookes only, and those so vnequally sorted, that the first book alone is in the French edition farre bigger then all the other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing fiue bookes taken together. This vnproportionable partition we haue amended in this English translation; as we might easily do by the citations, or quotations with which the authour himself bordered his margent: for in them, he sometimes referres him self to such a chapter of the second, seuenth, eleuenth, twelft booke, whereby he sufficiently insinuates into how many bookes he intended to diuide this his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent worke, &amp; at what matter euery booke should take its beginning: which his intention we haue obserued in this that now we present to thy view, that the fit diuision of matters therein handled, may make it more intelligible and lesse tedious.</p>
            <p>Secondly the humour of the French demanded for their satisfaction that the many places which are cited out of learned, holy, and classicall autours, hould not only be faithfully translated in the text, but also placed at large in their originall languages in the margen: that the learned reader might without recourse to the seuerall volumes (which required a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious library, whereof few are furnished) out of hand examin the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes of the tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>seque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly how fitly the alleged authority made for the purpose. But this humour not yet (for ought I haue seen) much raigning in our country, we haue thought it sufficient, to cite the places only in the margen, which are fully expressed in the text; the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the excellent translatresse copy, which we haue faithfully expressed contayned no more; and more beseemed not her translation, as not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to make shew of skill in greek, and other such learned languages; but only of that which was sufficient, for her assumpt that it is of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full translation according to the significant expressement of the French.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we haue not presumed to alter or change any one word of her translation, but in some few places, where the French allusions could not be so well vnderstood, if they were expressed in English properly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>responding thereunto: for euery tongue hath some peculiar graces and elegancies, which be lost in the translation, yf they be put word for word; And yet this haue we done (as we sayde) very seldome, and that especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:7769:9"/>
in the word <hi>Church,</hi> wich we English men vse deriued from <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> in greek, and Cephas in Syriak do; but in our English we haue no such allusion. No other change, but in these few, and such like haue we made; neither was it needfull, the translatresse hauing so fittly, and significantly expressed the autours meaning, that it would haue been lost labour to striue to do it better, and rather marring, then mending so perfect an expression.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I desire thee (gentle reader) to beare with the faults of the presse: The printers being Wallons, and our English strange vnto them it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to see how may faults they committed in setting: so that in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlooking the proofes for the print, the margins had not roome enough to hold our corrections: and do what we could, yet the number of our corrections being so many, a great many of them remayned vncorrected by the fastidious fantasy of our workman. Yet we iudge there is no fault that may hinder, or change the sence, but is amended; and for the rest we desire thee to pardon vs, considering how hard it is to make a stranger here to expresse our ortography. Farewell in our Lord, and he of his goodnes giue thee grace to take profit by reading these learned dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses.</p>

            <head>THE LETTER OF THE LORD CARDINALL OF PERRON, <hi>SENT TO MONSIEVR CASAVBON INTO ENGLAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SIR. the letter that you deliuered to Monsieur de la Bodery, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to me by him, euen as I was vpon my departure for a voyage into Normandy; and since my returne from thence, I haue bene almost perpetuallie sicke, which hindered me from answering with more speede. Now that my disease begins to be at some truce with me, I will paie the arrerages of this delaie, and will first thanke you for the good office that you haue done me, in shewing the letter I writt to you, to the most excellent king of great Brittaine, and in procuring me an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in his fauour: I will striue so to husband it by my humble seruice s, (and particularlye by celebrating his prayses, which is the only fruite that good and vertuons kinges, such as hee doe gather from allthe labours and thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie cares, that the burden of a kingdome loades them with,) as his maiestie shall haue noe cause to be sorrie, that it be declared to after ages, how he hath honord mee with his well wishes, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d how I haue had his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and admiration. As for the translation of the verses of Virgill, whereof you writt to me that he desires a Copie, that which I sent you being lost; I deferr yet for some daies, to acquit myself of that dutie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I haue put it to the presse, with the addition of a part of the fowrth, which I haue ended expresselie for his maiestie; sake, to inlarge my prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te to him. As soone as those few Copies which are in doing, shall be fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, I will not faile to addresse one of them to you, to offer vp to him on my behalfe The third point of your letter yet remaines; which is, that his Maiestie was astonisht at those wordes in my letter; That, excepting the title of Catholicke, I knew nothing wanting in him, to expresse the figure of a perfect and compleate Prince: and that he pretendes, that since he beleeues all thinges that the Ancientes haue with an vnanimous consent esteemed necessarie to saluation, the title of Catholique cannot bee do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him. Now as on the one side, I can not but greatlie praise his maiesties pietie and Christian humilitie, in not disdayning to submitt his iudgement, adorned with so manie lightes naturall a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d acquired, to that of those cleare beames of antiquitie; (imitating therein the wisdome of that great Emperor <hi>Thodosius;</hi> who thought there was noebetter meanes to agree the dissentions which disturbed the Church of his time, then to exact from either part an answere; whither thy beleeued that the Fathers which had flourish'd in the Church before the separation, had bene orthodoxall; and that being confessed, to summon them to submitt themselues to whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they should be found to haue beleeued:) so on the other side, there are manie obseruations `to be made vpon this Thesis, before wee passe to the hypothesis; which since I Cannot represent to his maiestie, I shall be gladd to informe you of them for your particular satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:7769:10"/>The first is, that the name of Catholicke, is not a name of beleefe sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, but of Communion also; else antiquitie would not haue refused that title to those Which were not separated from the beleefe, but from the Communion of the Church: nor would they haue protested, that out of the Catholicke Church, the Faith and Sacramentes may be had, but not Saluation. <q>
                  <hi>Out of the Catholicke Church,</hi> saith S. Augustin, in his treatie of Conference with Emeritus, a man may haue orders, hee maie haue Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, he may sing Alleluya, he may answere A men, he may keepe the Gospell, he may haue and preach the faith in the name of the Father, of the Sonn, and of the holie Ghost, but he can no where finde Saluation, but in the Catholicke Church. And in the Booke, De vtilit, credendi, There is a Church as all men graunt, if you cast your eyes ouer the extent of the whole world, more full in multitude, then all the rest; and as those, that know themselues to be of it, affirme, more sincere in the doctrine of truth.</q> 
               <hi>But of the truth, that is an other question: that will suffice for this search, that there is one Catholicke Church, vpon which seuer all heresies impose seuerall names; whereas they are all call called euery one by his particular name, which they dare not disauow; from whence it may appeare to the iudgment of anie arbiter (that is not prepossessed by fauour,) to whom the name of Catholicke, where of all are ambitions, ought to bee attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted.</hi> And in the Booke against the fundamentall Epistle: <hi>Then to omitt this wisdome which you denie to bee in the Catholicke Church, there are manie other things, which doe most iustlie retaine me in her bosome: the consent of people and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions retaine me therein; the authoritie begu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n by miracles, nourished by hope, increased by charitie, confirmed by antiquitie, retaines me therein: the succession of Prelates euen from the verie seate of Peter, to whom our Lord deliuered his sheepe to be fedd after his Resurrection, euen to the present Bishops seate, retaines me therein: and finallie; the verie name of Catholick retaines me therein, which not without cause this Church alone, amongst so manie heresies, hath in such sorte obtained, as though all heretickes would be called Catholiques; neuerthelesse, when a stranger askes where the Catholicke Church doth assemble, there is not one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that dares shew his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or his howse.</hi> And in his treatise of Faith, and of the Creede: <q>Wee beleeue the holie Church and that Catholick; for heretickes and schismatickes, call their Congregations Churches: but hereticks beleeuing of God false thinges, violate faith; and Schismatickes separate themselues from brotherly charitie by vniust diuisions, allthough they beleeue the same things that we beleeue: and therefore neither can the hereticke belonge to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church, because she loues God; nor the schismaticke, because she loues her neightour. And in the Booke, Of the vnitie of the Church: All those that beleeue, as hath bene said that ouer Lord IESVS is come in the flesh, and is risen againe in the same flesh wherein he was borne, and hath suffered, and that he is the so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of god, god with god, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d one with the Father, and the onlie immoueable word of the Father, by which all things haue bene made; but yet dissent so from his bodie, which is the Church, that theire communion is not with the whole; or is spread in deed, but yet is in some part found to be separate; it is manifest, they are not in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. And Prosper, his scholler: Hee, saith hee, that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates with this vniuersall Church, is a Christian and a Catholicke; but he that communicates not therewith, is an hereticke and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And for this cause wee see, that the Fathers denied the title of Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que to the Donatists, because of the separation of Communion, and yet graunted it to those, from whom the Donatists had taken their doctrine, because of the vnitie of Communion <hi>Cyprians people, saith</hi> S. <hi>Pacian, hath neuer bene called otherwise then Catholicke.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> this article was inserted into the triall of the promotion of Bishops; whither they beleeue, that out of the Catholicke Church none ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be saued. And that in the Epistle of the Councell of Cyrtha, it was repeated by S. Augustin, who was Secretarie thereto, in theses wordes: <hi>Whosoeuer is separated from this Catholicke Church, how praise-worthie soeuer he conceaue his life</hi>

               <hi>to bee, by this onlie crime, that he is separated from the vnitie of Christ, he shall not haue life, but the wrath of God shall remaine vpon him.</hi> And after by <hi>Fulgentius</hi> in these wordes: <hi>Beleeue firmelie and doubt it not at all, that no hereticke or Schismaticke baptized in the name of the Father, of the sonne, and of the only Ghost, if he be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the Catholicke Church, what almes soeuer he may giue, yea though he should shedde his blood for the name of Christ; can in any sort be saued.</hi> That I say was<note place="margin">De side ad Petr. c. 39.</note> against, or principallie against the Donatists. And neuerthelesse, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists agreed in all the doctrine of the Creede, and of the Scripture with the Catholicks: <hi>Your are with vs, saith</hi> S. <hi>Augustine, in Baptisme, in the Creede, and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epist. 48.</note> 
               <hi>in all the other Sacraments of our Lord; but in the spirit of vnitie, and in the bond of peace, and finallie in the Catholicke Church, you are not with vs</hi> And yet they diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red only in one pointe of vnwritten tradition, which, as S. Augustin himself (who principallie triumphes ouer this heresie) confessed, could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated by Scripture. This, saith hee, in the Booke of the vnitie of the<note place="margin">Cap. 29.</note> Church, <hi>neither thou, nor I, doe euidentlie reade.</hi> And in the first Booke against<note place="margin">Cap. 33.</note> 
               <hi>Cresconius; though for this there be noe example in the scriptures, yet euen in this wee follow, the truth of the Scriptures, when wee doe that which hath pleased the vniuersall Church, which the authoritie of the same scriptures doth recommend.</hi> And in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Booke of Baptisme against the Donatists: <hi>And ourselues,</hi> saith hee, <hi>durst</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap 4.</note> 
               <hi>affirme no such thing, but that we are upheld by the vnanimous authoritie of the Church.</hi> And in the fift. <hi>The Apostles haue in this, prescribed vs nothing; but this custome which was opposite to Cyprian, ought to be beleeued to haue taken it's originall</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 23.</note> 
               <hi>from their tradition; as manie other things, which the vniuersall Church obserues, and for this cause are with good right beleeued to haue bene commaunded by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, although they haue not bene vvritten.</hi> From whence it appeares, that to obtaine the name of Catholicke, it sufficeth not to hold, or rather to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to hold the same beleefe that the Fathers held, vnlesse they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the same Catholicke Church, wherewith the Fathers did communicate, and which by succession of persons, and, as wee pretend, of doctrine, is deriued downe to vs: and if she haue lost anie thing of her extent in our hemisphere, she recouers as much and more daily in the other hemisphere, that these prophecies may be fulfilled: <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 12. 26.</note> 
               <hi>In thy seede, shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.</hi>

Augustin, hath obtained the title and the<note place="margin">Eccles. ca. 2. &amp; 3. &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libi.</note> marke of Catholicke.</p>
            <p>The SECOND obseruation is vpon the restriction in Cases neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to saluation: For besides pointes necessarie to saluation, there are two other degrees of thinges, the one sort profitable to saluation, as it is (according to the opinion of your owne ministers) to sell all our goods and giue it to the poore: to fast in affliction to appease the wrath of God: to pray our Bretheren in the faith to praie to God for vs; and the other sort lawfull, and not repugnant to saluation, as to fly from persecution; to liue by the Altar, since we
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7769:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
serue at the Altar, to putt awaie our wiues for adulterie, and other the like for I alleadge these for examples, and not for instances. Now it is needefull to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable to the integritie of the beleefe of the Fathers, to beleeue all thinges that they haue beleeued, according to that degree wherein they haue beleeued them: to witt, to beleeue for thinges necessarie to saluation those thinges that they haue esteemed to be necessarie for saluation: and for thinges profitable to saluation: those things that they haue esteemed to be profitable to saluation: and for things lawfull and not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to saluation, those thinges that they haue holden to be lawfull and not repugnant to saluation: and not vnder colour that the two last kindes, are not things necessarie to saluation, but only profitable or lawfull, to condemne them, and to separate ourselues for their occasion from the Church, which then had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in practise, and still practiseth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this day.</p>
            <p>The third obseruation is vpon the ambiguitie of the word <hi>necessarie to saluation,</hi> which because of the diuers kindes of necessitie which haue place in matters of religion, is capable of diuers sences: for there is an absolute necessitie, and a conditionall necessitie; a necessitie of meanes, and a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of precept; a necessitie of speciall beleefe, and a necessitie of generall beleefe; a necessitie of act, and a necessitie of approbatio, I call an absolute necessitie (not simplie, but by vertue of Gods institution,) that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues no excuse of impossibilitie, nor anie exception of place, time or persons: as in regard of those that are of age, capable of knowledge, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe in Christ mediator betweene God and man: for neither the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of being in a place where wee cannot be instructed in that article; nor the preuention of time, in dying before wee are informed thereof; nor the condition of being an ignorant person, vnlearned, dull not apt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend; a sheepe and not a shepheard, can warrant those from damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that beleeue it not actually, for as much as <hi>who beleeues not in the onlie Sonn of Gods, is alreadie iudged:</hi> And in regard of little Children, baptisme only according to our doctrine, may supplie the defect of Faith in Christ in their behalfe, agreeing with that sentence of S.

                  </gap> by death, from being baptized, can come to the remission of originall sinne.</hi> And of this kinde of necessitie the examples are in small number. I call that conditionall necessitie which obligeth not but in case of possibilitie, and receiues exception of place, time and persons: and that againe hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers branches: For first in regard of Faith there are manie points that are necessarie to be beleeued, if a man be in place where he may be instructed in them, or who hath time to be informed of them, which are not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for a man that liues in a wildernesse, or so pressed with the instant of death, as he hath noe leasure to receiue instruction: as that Christ was borne of a virgin that he was Crucified vnder Pontius Pilate, that hee rose againe the third daie. And manie thinges are necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued and holden for pointes of Faith, either by the bodie of the Church in generall, or by the order of the ministers and pastors, which are the eyes of the Church: which are not necessary for euery particular person to knowe, and hold to be points of Faith; as that the persons of the Trinitie, are the same in essence, and distinct in subsistence; that the Father hath begotten the sonn necessarily and not freely; that they are the diuine perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which produce, and are produced, and not the essence which doth neither produce, nor is produced: that the workes of the trinitie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out are vndiuided: that the only perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the sonn hath been incarnate, and not anie of the others: that in Christ there are two substances and one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence: that the diuinitie was not to him in the steede of a soule, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7769:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that besides his Bodie and his diuinitie, he had a Soule sensible and reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: that what he once tooke in hypostaticall vnion hee hath not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned: that the diuell was created good and made hinself euill by the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his will: and other such like. And in regard of action, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie things necessarie in case of possibilitie, and according to the oportunity of places, times and persons, which are not absolutely necessarie, when the commoditie to accomplish them is wanting, as the assistance at Church Seruice, the actuall participation of the Eucharist. And manie are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to some, as mission and imposition of handes to the Pastors of the Church; and marriage to those that will haue issue which are not necessary to others. And in breefe, some thinges are necessary to obtaine Saluation others some to obtaine it more easilie for ones-selfe, and others to procure and mediate it for other men: some for the constitution of the Church, and others for the edification and more ample propagation of the Church some for the simple being of Christian Religion; others for the better being, that is to saie, for the comlynesse, dignitie, and splendour of Christian Religion. I call necessitie of meanes that, that is in behalfe of the thinges them selues as that of Sacraments to which god hath graunted power to Conferr some grace and reall operation to saluation, that of the Commandementes of the morall lawe, whose necessitie is imposed vpon vs by the law of nature, that of repenting sins, which is a meanes neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to obtaine their remission. I call necessitie of precept, that which is only obligatorie in regard of the Commaundement, as the celebration of the first daie of the weeke in memorie of that wherein our lord did rise againe, which wee for that cause, call our Lords daie, and other such like obseruations, the omission whereof, could be noe hindrance to Saluation, but in respect of disobedience, and breach of the Commaundement. I call necessitie of speciall beleefe, that of thoses pointes, which all Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if they be not preuented by death, are obliged to beleeue with faith expresse, distinct and determinate, which the Schoolemen call explicit faith; as the twelue articles, of the Creede. I call necessitie of generall beleefe, that of those thinges which euery particular man is not obliged to beleeue with a distinct ad explicite faith: as the doctrine of originall sin the article or the two wills in Christ, the article that the holy Ghost pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Father and from the Sonne; the beleefe that Baptisme giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forth of the Church (prouided it be in the forme of the Church) is true Baptisme, and that heretickes which haue receiued Baptisme, must not be rebaptised when they returne to the Church: and other such like, when the simple sort of faithfull people, are not obliged to beleeue, with a distinct and explicit faith, but it sufficeth that they beleeue them gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie in the Faith of the Church; that is to saie, that they adhere to the Church that beleeues them, by whose faith they liue whiles they remaine in her Communion, as Children liue by their mothers nourishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t whilst they are in her bowells. I call necessitie of act, that of those thinges which euerie particular person is obliged to execute actuallie, as to Confesse the name of Christ, to forgiue offences done to them, to restore the Goods of an other man. I call necessitie of approbation, that of those thinges which euerie particular man is not bound to execute actuallie but onlie not to contradict them, and not to condemne those that doe them nor the church that approoues the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ad not to separate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paine of separating themselues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their owne saluation as the choice to liue in virginitie and single life, and other the like. Of all which kindes of necessitie, the Fathers haue hold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

make manifest in those occasions that will offer themselues wherein to examine them: it is not to be conformable to the ancient beleefe and practise of the catholicke church, to hold the pointes of doctrine or actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the Fathers haue holden, to be necessary to saluation, according to some of these kindes of necessitie, and to reiect the others; but to conforme our selues to the ancient beleefe and catholick practise, we must hold for necessary to saluation, all those things that the Fathers haue holden to be necessarie to saluation, in that degree, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to those kindes of necessitie, as they haue holden them.</p>
            <p>The fowrth obseruation is vpon the word FATHERS, which some, when it comes to the effect of their promise, to submit themselues to the iudgment of antiquitie, would restraine to the first or second age after the Apostles, not that they hope to finde in that space of time, anie thing in their behalfe: but because the Church being then oppressed with persecutions, there remaines to vs so fewe writinges of that date, and those against persons, and about points, for the most part so differing from the disputations of this present age, as the face of the ancient do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and practise of the Church, cannot euidentlie appeare to be therein represented. Now equitie would, that being to compare the state of the Societies of this age, wich pretend to the title of the Catholick Church, with the state of the ancient Church; wee should looke to take such a time, wherein not only our competitors might agree with vs, that the Church of the Fathers was still the true Church, the true Spouse of Christ, she in whom resided the lawfull authoritie to iudge questions in Religion: but also those monuments doe sufficiently remaine to vs, to manifest throughly all her doctrines and all her obseruations. Which can neuer be better chosen for both partes, then in the time wherein the fower first Councells were holden; that is to saie, from the Emperour Constantine, who was the first Emperour that was publicklie a Christian, to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Marcian. And it seemes to me, that his Maiestie hath yielded to this, and also more liberallie in some of his writinges, hauing extended this space, to the first fiue ages. For besides that the deliuerie from the yoake and subiection of the Pagans, then gaue the Church meanes to speake lowder, and to haue more communication with all her partes, situated in so manie different regions of the earth, and to flourish in a greater mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of learned and excellent writers, which is the cause that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to vs without comparison more monuments of those ages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to view the entire forme of the ancient Christian Religion, then of the former ages: Besides this, I saie, our aduersaries cannot denie, but that church which nursed vp the first Christian Emperours, which rooted out the Temples and seruices of the false Gods, which exercised the Soue raigne Tribunall of Spirituall authoritie vpon earth, by the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which she denounced vpon the fowre most famous heresies in the fowre first generall Councells, which were the fowre first Parliaments and Estates generall of Christs Kingdome; must bee she of whom it hath<note place="margin">Isa. 60. 62. 54.</note> bene foretold, that Kinges should be her nursing Fathers: that the nations should walke in her light, and Kings in the brightnes of her rising: that, euery engine sett vp against her, should be destroyed: that she should iudge euery tongue that should resist her in iudgment: that God had sett watchmen vpon her walles, which neuer should be silent by daie or night:<note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 16. 18.</note> that the gates of hell should not preuaile against her: that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer should not obey her should be holden for a heathen and a publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can:<note place="margin">1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For it sufficeth to assure vs of the perpetuall vse of such thinges that the Fathers of the first fower Councells, who had more knowledge of the ages before them, then wee can haue, doe testifie to vs, to haue beleeued and practised them, not as thinges instituted in their age, but as thinges that haue alwaies had place in the Church, and had come to them by a succession of obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Apostles downe to their time; and that there is not to be found in former authors anie testimony against them, but contrariwise in all places, where there is occasion to mention them, agreable and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorable testimonies; that is to saie in breefe, that, is to be holden ancient by vs, which those whom we account ancient, haue themselues holden to be ancient.</p>
            <p>The fifth obseruation is vpon the consent of the beleefe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which some contentious spirits would haue to be, when one selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same thing is actuallie found in the writings of all the Fathers, which is an vniust and impertinent pretence For to haue a doctrine or obseruation to bee trulie holden by the Fathers for vniuersall and Catholicke, it is not necessarie it should be in the writinges of all the Fathers, who haue not all written of the same matters, and of whose writinges, all haue not come to our handes: but there are two other lawfull waies, to secure our selues of them: The one is, when the most eminent Fathers of euery coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try agree in the affirmation of the same doctrine or practise, and that none of the others that haue bene without note of dissention from the Church, haue opposed it: As when S. Augustin hath cited against the Pelagians, the<note place="margin">Contr. Iul. l. 5. &amp; 2.</note> testimonie of eleuen eminent Fathers, all consenting in one and the same doctrine; he supposeth hee hath sufficientlie produced against them, the Common beleefe of the Catholicke Church: and when the Councell of Ephesus had produced tenn Fathers of former ages, they conceiued they had sufficiently expressed the consent of the former Church against Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius<note place="margin">Vincent.</note> his doctrine: <hi>Because none,</hi> saith Vincentius Lerinensis, <hi>doubtetb but</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lirin. c. 42</note> 
               <hi>that those tenn did trulie hold the same with al their other bretheren.</hi> The other is, when the Fathers speake not as Doctors, but as witnesses of the Customes and practise of the Curch of their times; and doe not saie, I beleeue this should be soe holden, or so vnderstood, or so obserued; but that the Church from one end of the earth to the other, beleeues it so, or obserues
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7769:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it soe: For then we noe longer hold what they saie, for a thing said by them, but as a thing said by the whole Church and principallie when it is in pointes whereof they could not be ignorant, either because of the Condition of the thinges, as in matters of fact, or because of the sufficiencie of the persons: and in this case wee argue noe more vpon their wordes probablie, as wee doe when they speake in the qualitie of particular Doctors, but we argue therevpon demonstratiuelie. That then shall remaine trulie vniuersall and Catholicke, that the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Fathers of the times of the fowre first Councells, haue taught in seuerall regions of the earth; and against which, none (except some persons noted for dissention from the Church) hath resisted; or that the Fathers of those ages doe testifie to haue bin beleeued, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by the whole Church in their times: And that shall remaine trulie antient and Apostolicke, that the Fathers of those ages doe testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to haue bin obserued by the whole Church, not as a thing sprung vp in their time, but as a thing deriued downe to them either from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial succession of former ages, or from the expresse tradition of the Apostles. For these thinges hauing bin holden vniuersallie by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church in the time of the first fowre Councells, they could haue noe other originall, but from an vniuersall authoritie; for as much as in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church, which did then so strictlie obserue the rule mentioned by <hi>Saint Vincentius Lirinensis,</hi> of opposing vniuersalitie to particularitie; a doctrine or obseruation from a particular beginning could not be slipt in, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d spread into an vniforme and vniuersall beleefe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Custome, through all partes of the Earth; and principallie soe as the Fathers that were next after these vniuersall innouations, could not perceiue it: but it must needes be, that all that was then vniuersallie obserued in the Church, must haue come from an vniuersall beginning. Now there were in those ages, according to the beleefe of your ministers, but two beginnings of vniuersall authoritie in the Church; to wit, either the Apostles, or the generall Councells; for they Will not yeild that the Sea Apostolicke had then anie vniversall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie And therefore whatsoeuer was vniuersallie and vniformly obserued in the Church by all the Prouinces of the Earth in the time of the first fowre generall Councells, and had not begun in that time, but had bin before practised; that is to saie; before there had bin anie generall Councell in the Church; must necessarilie haue bin from the tradition of the Apostles, following these rules of S.

            <p>These fiue obseruations then made vpon the theses, I will saie, to passe vnto the hypothesis, that your ministers to whose societie his Maiestie

outwardlie adheres, are so farr from holding all the same thinges that the Fathers haue beleeued and practised as necessarie to Saluation, that in the only Synaxis or Church Lirurgie, which is the Seale of Ecclesiasticall Communion, the fowre principall thinges for which they haue seperated themselues from vs, which are the reall presence of the Bodie of Christ in the Sacrament, the Oblation of the Sacrifice of the Eucharist, prayer and oblation for the dead, and the prayers of the Saints, the Fathers haue all vniuersallie and vniformely beleeued, holden and practised as things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie (but in different kindes of necessitie) vnto saluation. By which meanes, if your ministers had bene in the time of the Fathers, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> haue for these thinges renounced our Seruice and our Communion; so must they for the same causes haue renounced the Seruice and Communion of the Fathers, and Consequently, the title and Societie of the Catholicke Church. I haue said the reall presence of the Bodie of Christ in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not but that I could haue gone farther, and said, the Substantiall transition of the Sacrament into the Bodie of Christ which wee call tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation but I haue been content to saie, the reall presence, because it is not precisely and particularlie vpon the transubstantiation, but vpon the reall presence of the Bodie of Christ in the Sacrament, that we ground the importance and necessitie of this Sacrament to Saluation; to witt, the Communion and Substantiall vnion to the Bodie of Christ; which S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill<note place="margin">In Ioan. lib. 11. cap. 27.</note> calls, the knott of our vnion with god. Nor is it particularly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely vpon transubstantiation, but vpon the reall presence that the two inconueniences depend, for which your ministers, in this article, seperate themselues from our Lyturgies; which are, one, the adoration of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which they will haue to be only sought and adored in heauen: and the other, the pretended distraction of the vnitie of the Bodie of Christ, by existence in manie places in the Sacrament. Neither haue I spocken of the prerogatiue of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which all the Fathers haue holden for the center and roote of Episcopall vnitie, and of Ecclesiasticall Communion; because I will beleeue you are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie read in antiquitie, to knowe that the first Fathers, Councells, and Christian, Emperors, haue perpetuallie granted therevnto, the primacie and supereminent ouersight, ouer all religions and ecclesiasticall things; which is all that the church exacts as a point of Faith, from their confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that enter into her communion, to the end to discerne her societie from that of the Greekes and other complices of their Sect, wich haue deuided themselues for some ages, from the visible and ministeriall head of the Church.</p>
            <p>These fowre points then, which are the principall Springes of our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention and which being agreed vpon, it would be easie for vs to agree vpon the rest; I saye, that the Fathers of the time of the fowre first Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels haue all holden and practised as necessary to Saluation, though with diuers kindes of necessitie. The reall Presence, of the Bodie of Christ; and the oblation of the sacrifice, they haue holden as necessary with necessitie of meanes, for the Bodie of the Church absolutely, and for euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler person conditionnallie. Prayer and oblation for the dead they haue holden as necessarie, by necessitie of meanes for those for whom it is done that soe their deliuerace from temporall paines, which remaine after this life for sinne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, after baptisme, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for which thy haue not done such penances as it hath pleased God whollie to accept, may be hastned by the prayers and sacrifices of the Church: and necessarie with necessitie of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and to exercise christian charitie and pietie both to the Church that offers them, and to the ministers and Pastors by whom she offers them.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7769:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The prayer of the Saintes, they haue holden as necessarie to the bodie of the Church, and to the ministers by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are made, with necessitie of precept, to exercise the commerce betweene the Church Militant, and the Church Triumphant: and to particular persons out of the offices of the Church, and in their priuate deuotions not neeessary with necessitie of act, but only profitable, that they may the more easilie obtaine pardon for their sinnes, by the concourse of their prayers who are alreadie in the per fect and assured possession of the grace of God: but necessary to them and all others with nessitie of approbation; that is to saie, they are obliged not to contradict them, and not to condemne the custome and doctrine of the Church in that article: and not to separate themselues from her vpon this occasion, vnder paine of falling into Anathema, and to be holden for heretickes. All which things I will not now stand to proue, least I make a Booke of a letter; but I doe oblige myselfe to iustifie them, when soeuer you shall desire it; and to make it appeare both by the vnanimous consent of the Fathers, that haue flourished in the time of the first fowre councel's, and by the formes which remaine to vs in their writings of the ancient Church Seruice, that all the Catholicke Church of their times hath vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nersallie and vniformely beleeued holden and practised them, throughout all the regions and prouinces of the earth. I oblige myself I saie, to make it appeare to you, that she hath holden these fower thinges in the same sence, and in the same forme and for the same end, as our Lyturgies are, and not as obseruations that then sprung vp, but as things that the same Fathers testified to haue bene beleeued and practised from all antiquitie, and to be deriued to them by an vninterrupted continuance from the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or approbation of the Apostles. Soe as they cannot renounce the Communion of our Church vnder pretence of anie of these fowre points, without renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing the Communion of the ancient catholick Church and consequently the inheritance of saluation: and that by authors and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies all able to abide the touch; as you know I am curious to make vse of noe other; and with cleare and ingenuous answeres to all obiections, collected out of the Fathers of the same ages, or of ages before them. A thing that will be the more easie for me, because the proofes that wee will avouch out of the Fathers, are proofes which containe in expresse termes the affirmatiue of what wee saie: whereas our aduersaries cannot finde one only passage which containes in expresse terme the negatiue, but only in termes from whence they pretend to inferr it by consequence; and which at a iust tribunall, would not merit so much as to be heard. For who knowes not, that it is too great an iniustice, to alleadge consequences from passages, and euen those euill interpreted and misvnderstood, and in whose illation, there is alwaies some paralogisme hidd against the expresse wordes, and the liuely and actuall practise of the same fathers, from whom they are collected, and that may be good to take the Fathers for Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, and to accuse them for want of Sence or memorie; but not to take them for Iudges, and to submitt themselues to the obseruation of what they haue beleeued and practised? To this I will also adde whensoeuer you shall desire it, the present Conformitie of all the other Patriarchall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in these fowre cases with the Roman and of all those which haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained euen to this daie, vnder their iurisdiction; to witt, those that are vnder the Patriarchall iurisdiction of the Patriarck of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> as the <hi>Grecians, Russians, Muscouites, and Asians of Asia-minor,</hi> separate from vs neere eight hundred yeares: Of those that are vnde the Greeke Patriarch of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch;</hi> as the <hi>Syrians, Mesopotamians,</hi> and others yet more Easterne nations: (for those that obey the <hi>Syrian</hi> Patriarch, as the <hi>Maronites,</hi> perseuer in the

Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; of those that relye vpon the <hi>Egiptian</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as the Egiptians whom they call <hi>Cophtites,</hi> and the Ethiopians which haue bene diuided both from vs and from the greekes more then eleuen hundred yeares, euen from the time of one of the fowre first Councells, to witt, of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> For all these hold these fower pointes; yea, with more iealousie, if it be possible, then the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Churches, and particularlie, the article of the Sacrament, where of they doe not only beleeue transubstantiation, which the greekes at this daie call in the very self same sence and phrase, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, but also exercise the adoration with externall gesture, more full of humilitie then ours. A manifest proof that these fowre pointes were vniformely holden and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued by the ancient Cahtholicke Church, since all the partes, whereinto the ancient Catholicke Church is disme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, doe retaine them vniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this daie; notwithstanding soe manie distances, separations, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions, through all the regions of the Earth.</p>
            <p>These are in generall, the causes that haue moued me to vse that excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my letter, that you obiect to me in yours: whereof if the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent King of great Brittaine had as well leasure to heare the particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, as he hath capacitie to comprehend them, I assure myselfe he would not thinke it strange, that I should desire in him the title of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique;</hi> but he would desire it himsefe, and put himsefe in state to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, and to cause it to be obtained by those, that are depriued of it: that is to saie, he would add yet to is other Crownes, that of making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sefe a mediator of the peace of the Church; which would be to him a more triumphant glorie, then that of all the <hi>Alexanders,</hi> and of all the <hi>Caesars,</hi> and which would gaine to his Isle, noe lesse an honor in hauing bredd him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue bredd great <hi>Constantine,</hi> the first deliuerer and pacifier of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church.

To which answer of his maiesty the Cardinall replieth with that modesty and submission, which is due to the person and worth of so high and mighty a Monarch. and with that learning, and solidyty, that might be expected from so great a maister of truth as that most eminent Cardinall was, in behalf of so glorious a cause, as is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the catholique Church.</hi>

            <p>THE name of <hi>Catholicke</hi> doth not simplie designe Faith, but also Communion with the Catholicke Church; for this Cause the Fathers would not suffer that those should bee Called <hi>Catholickes,</hi> which had separated themselues from the communion of the Church, though they retained the Faith thereof: For there is one only Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church, out of the which, Faith and Sacramentes may be had, but not Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>WHEN the Philosopher FAVORINVS disputed against the Emperor ADRIAN, and that his hearers were amazed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached it to him that he suffered the Emperor to confute him, and yielded to him; he answered them, <hi>should not</hi> I <hi>yield to a man, tha commaundes twentie legions?</hi> Soe if there were noe question in this worke, but of humane philosophie &amp; secular learninge, it should be easie for me to stop my selfe at FAVORINVS boundes, and to abstaine to contest with his maiestie, or to resist him. But since heere wee treate of his interest, who hath, not legions of men, but of Angells, and which hath for his title, THE KINGE OF KINGES, AND LORD OF LORDES; and from
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7769:16"/>
whom this excellent Kinge himselfe makes profession to holde in Fee his life and Crownes; that is to saie, the cause of IESVS CHRIST, and of his Kingdome, which is the Church: I will promise myselfe from his Maiesties bountie, that he will not mislike, where it shall be needefull, that I resist and contradict him, with all the respectiue libertie, that the lawes of disputation yield me.</p>
                  <p>Then for the argument of the Creede, I will saie, after I haue kist my weapones, three thinges for my defence; FIRST that it is vncertaine, whither the cause of the Communion of Saintes, be an article aparte, or an explication of the precedinge cause, and a declaration that the Catholicke Church consistes not in the simple number of the faithfull, euery one considered a parte; but in the ioinct Communion of all the bodie of the faithfull, in such sorte as both clauses make but one arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle as it seemeth sainct IEROM, <note n="a" place="margin">Hier. adu. Luciser.</note> RVFFINVS, <note n="b" place="margin">Ruffin in Symbol.</note> and <note n="c" place="margin">August. de fide &amp; sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol &amp; de Symb. ad Catec.</note> Sainct AVGVSTINE, who haue omitted the latter, haue esteemed it. The SECOND, that it is vncertaine, whether it signifie the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the faithfull liuinge haue one with an other, or the Commerce that the Saintes of the triumphant Church doe exercise with the Saintes of the militant Church, by the prayers, that the Saints of the triumphant, offer for the Saints of the militant; and the commemoration that the saints of the militant make of the saints of the triumphant, which is that, that wee in our Liturgie call, <hi>to communicate with the memory of the Saintes.</hi> And the THIRD, that whatsoeuer it signifie, it is most certaine, that the word CATHOLICKE was not added to that of the Church, to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the Christian Church from the Iewish Synagogue, which had neuer borne the name of Church in qualitie of a title of a Religion when the creed was Composed, and by consequence did not oblige the Christian Church to take the Epithete of Catholicke, to bee discerned from that, from which in all cases she had bene suffieientlie distinguished by the title of <hi>Christian;</hi> but it was added to discerne the true Church from hereticall, and schismaticall Societies, which vsurpe equiuocally, and by false mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, the name of <hi>Church,</hi> for that our Lord was the first that affected and consecrated the word ECCLESIA (which we vsually translate in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishe <hi>Church)</hi> to signifie a societie of Religion; whereas before, neither it, nor the Hebrewe word that answeres to it, had anie other vse, but that which prophane authors giue it, which is to signifie. <hi>Assemblies, conuocations, Generall Estates;</hi> as when DEMOSTHENES said to ESCHINES, <hi>thou wert dumbe to the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>d</hi> Demost</note> assemblies where the greeke word is <hi>Ecclesijs,</hi> the conuocations or general meetings. And as when Aristotle <note n="e" place="margin">Arist. po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit 2.</note> called the conuocations of Creete ecclesias. And as when the Scholiast of HOMER said, <hi>Iupiter gathered together Ecclesias the Assemblies of the Gods:</hi> It appeares first by the testimonie of MOSES, who forbids bastardes to enter <hi>into</hi> the Church of Israell; And<note place="margin">Deuteron. 23.</note> of DAVID who singes, <hi>I hate the Church of the malignant;</hi> And of S. STEPHEN,<note place="margin">Psal. 25.</note> who said MOSES was in the Church in the solitarie place; that is to saie,<note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> with the multitude of the people in the desert. It appeares secondlie, by the testimonie of S. IEROM, and of S. CYRILLVS, who interpretinge this verse of ESAY, <hi>Thou shalt bee called by a new name, that the mouth of our Lord shall pronounce,</hi> Doe affirme, that this new name, must be the name of<note place="margin">Hieron. in Esai c. 62.</note>

                     <note place="margin">Cyril. ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>God.</hi> And finallie, it appeares by the verie testimonie of our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that not only in all the textes of the old Testament, where the Greeke
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7769:16"/>
translation of the Seuentie, vse the word <hi>Ecclesia;</hi> but also in all those of the new, where that word hath relation to anie other multitude, beside the Christian Church, they expresse it by <hi>Congregation</hi> or <hi>Assemblies.</hi> And if since the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minge of IESVS CHRIST, and the edition of the creede the Fathers haue sometymes called the Synagogue, by the name of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> it hath bene by anticipation, to shew the successiue vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the one and other societie; but not that the Iewish Church while it lasted, hath euer vndertaken to attribute to herselfe, the title of a Church, in the qualitie of a title of Religion. Neither consequently, when the creede was composed, was there neede of an Epithete, to distinguish the Christian Church from her: for as the starr that the authors call <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer,</hi> although it be the same with that, that is called <hi>Vesper,</hi> yet when it goes before the Sonne, it beares one name; and when it followes him, it hath an other: soe although the Iewish congregation hath bene in some sorte one same societie with the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neuerthelesse, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this societie hath gone Before her SVNNE, which is CHRIST, she hath borne one name, to witt, the <hi>Synagogue</hi> and when she followes him, she<note place="margin">Matth. 18.</note> beares an other, to witt; the <hi>Church.</hi> And therefore when our Lord said to S.

                  <head>THE REPLIE.</head>
                  <p>TELESIVS a Stripling of Greece, hauing won the prize and victorie of the Combate in the Pythian games, when there was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of leadinge him in triumph, there arose such a dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the diuers natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s there present, euery one being earnest to haue him for theire owne, as the one drawing him one waie, the other an other waie, insteed of receiuing the honor which was prepared for him, he was torne and dismembred euen by those that stroue who should honor him most. Soe happenes it to the Church: All those that beare the name of Christians auow that to her only appertaines the victory ouer hell, and that whosoeuer will haue parte in the prize and glory of this Triumph, must serue vnder her ensigne; But when they come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of the true bodie of this societie, then euery sect desirous to draw her to themselues, they rent and teare her in peeces; and in steed of embracing the Church which consistes in vnitie, they embrace schisme and diuision, which is the death and ruyne of the Church. The cause, or rather the pretext of this euill, comes from two faultes, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries of the Church commit in the distinction of the word Ecclesia, or <hi>Church,</hi> which makes the possession vncertaine and disputable: The one is the fraudulent <hi>restriction</hi> of the terme of the <hi>Church</hi> to the only <hi>inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible number</hi> of the predestinate, by which (when they feele themselues pressed to represent the succession of theire Church) they saue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues like Homers Aeneas, or Virgils Cacus, in obscuritie and darknes. The other is the equiuocall and captious <hi>extension</hi> of the same word, <hi>Church,</hi> to all Sectes, which professe the name of Christ, by which (when they see themselues excluded from the refuge of theire <hi>inuissble Church)</hi> they haue recourse from darknes to confusion, and confesse that there hath bene alwaies a visible Church, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes pure in faith, and sometymes impure, that is to saie now a Church, and now noe Church. And therefore I attribute it to a singular care of the prouidence of God, that his Maiesty saying he beleeues the catholicke Church, hath added as to preuent all theses shiftes, <hi>without colour or fraude.</hi> For to beleeue the catholicke church <hi>without colour or fraude,</hi> is to beleeue her in the sence that the Fathers haue beleeued and vnderstood her the Fathers I say which haue lest vs these sentences pronunced sometymes, as in the hypothesis against the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees and Donatists; but as in the thesis against all kindes of heretic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes or schismatickes in generall that out of the Catholicke Church there is noe saluation; that whosoeuer is separate from the Catholicke Church cannot haue life, and other such like, which his Maiestie protested to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue.

                     <hi>that by a wrong interpretation, the Ghospell of God may be made the Ghospell of a man, nay (which is worse) the Ghospell of the diuell.</hi> Wherefore to iudge surely of the doctrine by the Scripture, it is necessarie, to be first assured of the interpretation of the Scripture; and that by an infallible meanes. For all the conclusions of Faith, which are not found in termes expresse, and incapable of ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in the Scripture, but are drawne by interpretations to make them conclusions of Faith and decisions infallible and equall to the authoritie of theire principles, must be drawne from it by an infallible meane. Now there are but three waies whereby we may pretend to be assured, that a conclusion drawne from the Scripture should be infallible, and necessarily agreeable to its principle; to witt, either <hi>human discourse,</hi> or <hi>priuate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,</hi> or <hi>the authoritie of an externall meane</hi> interposed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, betweene the Scripture and vs; as the magistrate betweene the law of the Prince and the people: to interpret to vs the wordes, to gather the sense, and to sorme and propound the conclusions. For to saie that one passage of Scripture should be interpreted by an other, (besides that there be diuers singular texts wherein this pretention can haue noe place;) this is still to returne to the same difficultie: because one will haue the controuerted place interpreted by one passage; and the other, will haue it interpreted by an other; and the very sense of the passage, which shal be brought to cleer the controuerted places, will againe be brought into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and cannot be infalliblie decided, but by an infallible meane, which must necessarily be one of these three, to witt either humane dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, or priuate inspiration, or the authoritie of an externall Iudge. And from this the verse of NEHEMIAS derogateth not, which is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to the impression of Geneua, <hi>and they interpreted the law by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> for it must be read with Saint IEROME, <hi>They whilst it was reading, vnderstood it the</hi> word <hi>Mikra</hi> neuer hauinge bene employed in the Scripture to signifie scripture; but only in the Rabines,<note n="a" place="margin">

                     <hi>because all vnderstand not the holie Scripture, (by reason of the depth thereof) in one sense; But one interprets it in one fashion, an other in an other; so that it seemes, there may be as many seuer all opinions drawne out of it, as there are seuer all men, for Nouatia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> expounds it one waie, Photinus another waie: Sabellius an other, Donatus an other, Arrius, Eunomius, Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius an other, Apollinaris, Priscillianus an other, Iouinian, Pelagius, Caelestius, and finally Nestorius an other: for these causes it is verie necessarie, to auoid the perill as so manie great Labyrinths of so diuers errors, that the line of the propheticall and apostolicall interpretation, should be drawne according to the rule of the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Catholique sense.</hi> And háue not the ministers of <hi>Geneua</hi> themselues, noted this in the margent of theire last Bibles?<note n="d" place="margin">In 2: Tim. c. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>The doctrine of Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a domesticall and particular instruction, namely in those that are ordained to deliuer it into the Church, least they should take it in theire owne particular sense, vnder colour of the Scripture. And this is it, that was anciently called TRADI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION in the Church.</hi> Now if the certainty of the interpretation of the Church ought to be také, (according to the exposition of the very <hi>Geneua</hi> Bibles) not from the sense of euery particular man, but from the traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church: how can it be that the truth of the vnder standinge of the Scripture should be the only certaine and infallible marke to discerne and know the Church?</p>
                  <p>But against these proofes, the aduersaries of the Church propound ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections which we had best co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute before we proceede to an other article. The first obiection is, that Saint AVSTINE in his writinge against the <hi>Manichees,</hi> after he hath made a longe list of the markes of the Church, addes this;<note n="e" place="margin">Aug. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. ep. fundam. cap. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Among you, where no such thing is found as holdes and tyes me, there soundes only a promisse of the truth; which, if it be soe manifestly demonstrated, as none can call it in question, ought to be preferred before all those things, whereby I am retained in the Catholicke Church.</hi> And from hence they conclude, that S. AVGVSTINE held not the other markes for necessary and infallible, but onelie for probable and coniecturall: since he offered to depart from them if they could demonstrate to him vndoubtedly, that the truth was of the other side,</p>
                  <p>To this I make two answeres, one that the truth, whereof Saint AVGVSTINE speakes, makes nothing for theire purpose that alleage it. For Saint AVGVSTINE speaketh not there of the truth demonstrated by scripture, which is that whereof the Protestants vaunt: but of the truth demonstrated by the light of naturalle reason, which was that, that the Manichees promised: as it appeares by what he said three lines belowe;

                     <hi>That which remaines for you, is, to saie, that you will produce areason soe certaine and inuincible, as the truth thereof being mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested by it selfe, it shall haue noe neede of the authoritie of anie witnes, nor of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, (vertue you must</hi> reade) <hi>of anie miracle.</hi> The other answer is that Saint AVGVSTINE did not propound this in the forme of a possible condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (for contrarywise he disputes of deliberate purpose against the <hi>Manichees,</hi> that the naturall light of reason could not be the waie to come to the knowlege of the truth of saluation;) but in the forme of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible condition: and which consequentlie diminisheth nothing from the efficacie of the markes of the Church, as it appeares by what he addes immediatelie after;<note n="k" place="margin">Cont. ep fundam. c. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>But if it be only promised, and not exhibited, none shall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate me from this Faith which by so manie and so great bondes</hi> (so calls he the externall and sensible markes of the Church) <hi>bindes my Spirit to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second obiection, that the aduersaries of the Church oppose, is, that the externall and sensible marks, that the Fathers assigne to the Church, as <hi>antiquitie, perpetuitie, eminencie and succession,</hi> belong not to the Church only; for as much as manie other things may claime <hi>antiquitie,</hi> as the Sunne, the Sea, the mountaines, and manie other; <hi>succession,</hi> as the Springs, the brookes, the riuers, and manie other; <hi>vniuersalitie,</hi> as the aire the earth and the other Elements: and euen amougst Religions, that of the pagans, hath heeretofore had <hi>eminencie</hi> and <hi>vniuersalitie;</hi> and that of the Iewes, hath still <hi>antiquitie</hi> and <hi>perpetuitie.</hi> Certainlie a childish and ridiculous obiection; for first the marks that God hath giuen to his Church, haue not bene imposed vpon her, to distinguish her fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all kindes of things, but to distinguish her only from those things that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, though equiuocally, vnder the same next kinde, and may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and taken for Churches, that is to saie, from other Christian socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; to witt, from hereticall and Schismaticall Sects, which challenge and pretend by false markes the title of the Church: no more then the markes that Golodmithes giuen to golde that it will not euaporate in the fire, and that it will resist the coupelle and the water of separatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are not giue it, to discerne it from all kinde of bodies; for there are other bodies, to which these conditions arc common, as glasse and diamondes; but to discerne it from false gold, that is from metalls made and sophisticated, that may be supposed and made to passe for golde. And this alsoe Saint AVGVSTINE esteemes the Church would insinuate in the Canticle, where after she hath demaunded of her spouse markes of the place, where he dwells; she saith, <hi>Least I be as hidden amougst the flockes of thy competitors,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug. de vnit. Eccl. c. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>that is to saie</hi> (saith saint AVGVSTINE) <hi>of those, that being in the beginninge with thee, would assemble without, not thy flocke, but theire stocks.</hi> For what is this but to saie, that the Church demaundes marks of her spouse, not to be discerned from all kinde of things, but to be discerned only from the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of heretickes, which beare by false markes the name of Christ, and the title of Churches? And secondly, it is not necessary, that the markes in parte, (that is to saie, those, that taken separatlie, haue not the entire office of markes,) may not be found euery one a parte, without the thing marked; but that the thing may not be found without euery one of them, nor they, taken iointly and altogether, without the thing whose marke

                  <p>To the fourth obiection, to witt that saint AVGVSTINF writeth, <hi>that only predestinate Catholiques are true partes of the Church, and true members of the bodie of Christ:</hi> and distinguisheth betweene them which are in the howse, and them which are of the howse; and betweene the people knowne in the eyes of God, and knowne in the eyes of man: we haue three solutions. <hi>The first</hi> solution is, that saint AVGVSTINE inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not, that only Catholiques predestinate were true partes of the Church, according to the <hi>formall</hi> beinge of the Church, which is common to all that are called; but according to the <hi>finall</hi> being of the Church, that is, to the end, and in the fruits, for which the Church is instituted. I meane, saint AVGVSTINE did not intend in those places to define the Church <hi>formally,</hi> and by what she is in this world, but <hi>finally,</hi> and by what she shall be in the other. Euen as he that saith, only good Citizens are true partes of a common wealth, doth not define a common wealth formally, and by what it is in it selfe; but finally, and by what it is in the intention of the law-maker: And he that saith, a true haruest is only the corne, that is gathered from the strawe, and not the strawe wherewth it is mingled; defines not a haruest formally, and by what it is in the feild, or in the barne: but finally, and by what it will be in the garner. <hi>We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>second bataile</hi> is, that besides the thinges, which particular men are bound to belieue with a <hi>distinct and explicite faith,</hi> there are manie other, which they are obliged to belieue with a <hi>faith of adherencie and non-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And therefore euen as while children are in theire mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe, or sucking at her brestes, they liue by the foode and nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theire mother; but when they are parted from her, they can no longer liue with that communicated nourishment, or that infused foode:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7769:34"/>
so while simple persons remaine within the bosome and Communion of the Church, they liue, in those things, which are aboue theire capacitie, by the faith of the Church, which is imputed ahd applied to them by the adherence that they haue with her. <hi>Such,</hi> saith Saint AVGVSTINE,<note place="margin">Epist 57.</note> 
                     <hi>if before they arriue to the spirituall age of the Soule (where they shall noe more be nourisht with milke, but with solid meate;) the last daie of theire life surprise them: he that dwells in them shall supplie what they want in theire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The <hi>third battaile</hi> is, that it is not sufficient to saie in forme of an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The <hi>fowrth battaile</hi> is, that the vniuersall distinction of things <hi>necessarie or not necessarie</hi> to saluation, cannot be assuredly made by the iudgement of euery particular person; but it dependes of the iudgement of the Church. For there is noe Sect, but belieues, that those thinges which they hold,<note place="margin">De pece. orig cont.

                  <p>The <hi>fifth battaile is,</hi> that it is not euough for the constitution of a Church, that the persons, where of it consistes, should be vnited among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in matters necessarie to saluation; if they be not also deuided from the externall communion of all other societies, which holde things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to saluation. For it sufficeth that we be vnited with anie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, which belieueth anie one point repugnant to Saluation, although we be well perswaded in all the rest, nay, and euen in that alsoe; to be excluded from the participation of the Church; for whosoeuer communicates in matter of Religion with anie Societie, is answerable for all the pointes, vnder the obligation whereof he receiueth men to his communion. From whence it ariseth, that a multitude of men of diuers externall communions, such as his Maiestie hereafter propounds, (as, a number of men of the Roman Communion, a number of men of the Greeke communion, and a number of men of the Ethiopian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;) cannot constitute a common Church: for as much as, though they are vnited in the beliefe of most things necessarie to saluation; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse there are things repugnant to saluation, wherein some of them are vnited by the bond of theire externall Communions with the body of theire Sects; which externall vnion, though the internall went not with it, is sufficient to depriue them from the participation of the Church.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>sixth battaile</hi> is, that the vnitie of faith, which enters into the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall definition of the Church, is not simply the vnitie of <hi>internall</hi> faith; but the vnitie of <hi>externall</hi> faith. For the vnitie of faith, which concurrs to the <hi>formall</hi> constitution of the Church, is that, which serues for a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the commerce of Ecclesiasticall Charitie, that is to saie, by meanes whereof the members of the mysticall bodie of Christ, may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and embrace one an other as brothers and members of one and the same bodie. Now this is the vnitie of <hi>exteruall and professed faith,</hi> and not that of <hi>hidden and internall,</hi> which serues for nothing, neither for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>To this then I will succinctly saie fower thinges. <hi>The first</hi> that philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers teach vs that the morall passion, which wee call <hi>hope</hi> from whence theologicall hope hath by analogy borowed her name is alwaies min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled and tempred with <hi>feare:</hi> By meanes whereof, those thinges, that fall vnder the obiect of hope, as are the goods of future life in respect of euery particular man, cannot be apprehended with a certaintie of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall faith (that is to saie, infaillible, &amp; not to be doubted of) otherwise hope should noe more be a vertue distinct fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith, against this oracle of sainct PAVL, <hi>now remaines, faith, hope, and Charitie; and these things are three:</hi> but ought to be embraced with an expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mingled &amp; tempered with feare, as <hi>Dauid</hi> exhortes vs in these wordes: <hi>ferue the Lordin feare, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in him with tremblinge.</hi> And S. PAVL in these, <hi>Thou subsistest by faith be not pussed vp, but feare. He that thinkes he stands, let him take heede least he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>second,</hi> that faith cannot bee but of things reuealed by the word of God: for <hi>faith</hi> (saith saint PAVL) <hi>is by hearing, and hearing by the word of God,</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:7769:36"/>
Now it is not reuealed to anie one in the word, which God hath consig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his Church, either by writinge or tradition; that he is absolutelie of the number of the predestinate, and therefore if hee haue not expresse and particular reuelation from God, as Saint Paule had, (who vpon this occasion speakes somtimes of himselfe, according to his common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as simply one of the faithfull; and sometymes according to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a predestinate person;) he can not haue anie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of Faith in this respect.

                     <hi>perseuere in goodnes, otherwise thou shalt be also cutt of.</hi> Now where is it that this finall perseuerance is particularly promised to anie one in the word of<note place="margin">Marc. 11.</note> God? for if you answere that our Lord saith, <hi>all that you aske for when you pray, beleeue you shall receiue it, and it shall be done to you:</hi> And consequentlie if we demaunde perseuerance, we shall obtaine it: I answere that he meanes, all that you demaunde, as you should demaunde it. Now the principall condition required to demaunde perseuerance as you should demaunde it, is to perseuere in demaundinge it, and not to content our selues with demaundinge it once, but to demaunde it petpetually, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowinge this preeept os Saint Paule; <hi>Pray without ceasinge.</hi> And againe<note place="margin">1.

Neither is it the question, whether there may be anie externall and visible societie, wherewith it is vnlawfull to commuuicate: but whether such a tyme can be wherein there is noe externall and visible Societie, wherewith it is necessary to communicate.

                  <p>The <hi>first</hi> way of vnderstandinge it, is to interpret <hi>Babylon</hi> described by the Reuelation, to be the <hi>Societie of all the wicked</hi> in generall, as S. AVGVS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINE and many others often expound it in that sense; and to expound <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> described in the same booke, to be the <hi>Societie of all the Good;</hi> which are the two Citties whereof Saint AVGVSTINE hath composed a worke, of the Cittie of the diuell which began in <hi>Cain,</hi> and the Cittie of God, which began in <hi>Abell.</hi> For as there is the same reason in things contrary and opposite: soe must the interpretatio of that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> painted out in the Reuelation; and that of that <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is opposed to it, be a like. <hi>Marke,</hi> said Saint AVGVSTINE, <hi>the names of these two Citties, Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Psalm. 64.</note> 
                     <hi>and Ierusalem. Babylon signifies confusion, and Ierusalem the view of peace &amp;c. They are mingled from the beginninge of humane kind, and shall continue soe to the end of the world. Hierusalem tooke her beginning from Abell, and Babylon from Cain.</hi> And a little after; <hi>From whence can we now shew them, that is, discerne them? Our Lord will shew to vs, when he placeth them, the one on his right hand, the other on his left. Ierusalem shall heare, come you blessed of my father, take possession of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which is prepared for you from the beginminge of the world; and Babylon shall heare; goe you cursed into eternall fire, which is prepared for the diuell and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells.

Two loues, make these two Citties, the loue of God makes Ierusalem, the loue of the world, makes Babylon: let euerie one then exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himselfe what he loues, and he shall finde of which he is a Cittizen.</hi> And in an<note place="margin">In psalm. 86.</note> other place; <hi>all the wicked belong to Babylon; as all the Saintes doe to Ierusalem.</hi> And in the volume of the Cittie of God: <hi>And what shall we gather from this,</hi>

                     <hi>but that we must flie out of the middle of Babilon? which propheticall precept ought spirituallie to be vnderstood in this sense: that out of the Cittie of this world, wich is without doubt the societie of euill Angells, and wicked men, we should flie with the steps of faith, which workes by loue, and aduauncinge towards the liuing God.</hi> And<note place="margin">In Psalm. 61.</note> in the volume vpon the psalmes; <hi>all those who perferr earthlie felicitie before God all those which seeke themselues, and not Iesus Christ, belonge to that onlie Cittie, which is mysticallie called Babylon, and hath the diuell for her kinge.</hi> And to this it is noe impediment, that she is described to be clad in purple; fore there, <hi>purple,</hi> signifies not the coulour of purple; but temperall powers dignities, and authoritie, which are for the most parte in the hands of the wicked, rather then of the good: the <hi>white</hi> and shining linnen, wherewith the bride is clothed, signifieth not the stuffe and colour of linnen, but the iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Apoc. 19.</note> of the saintes.

                  <p>The second interpretation celebrated by the Fathers, is, to expound the destruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> described in the Reuelation, to be destruction of Paganisme, and of the honor of the false Gods: and the descent of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to be the propagation of Christian Religion; for as much as in the tyme of the prophetes, from whose wordes this verse of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation, <hi>goe out of Babylon my people</hi> is taken, <hi>Babilon</hi> was as it were, the head of Pagan superstition, and also that the word Babylon signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyinge

               <p>To the second obiection, which is, that after that <hi>Liberius</hi> being cast out from the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Arians,</hi> and ouercome with the induring a farr banishment, and manie corporall persecutions &amp; vexations sorgott himselfe so farr, as to subscribe the condemnation of saint ATHANA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIVS, and to receiue the <hi>Arrians</hi> into his communion; saint HILLARIE reciting the Epistles of the same <hi>Liberius</hi> insertes these clauses; <hi>This is the Arrian treacherie, this I haue noted I that am noe Apostata:</hi> And againe; <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema for my parte, to thee ô Liberius, &amp; to thy Complices;</hi> And a while after; <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema to thee the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; third tyme, ô wicked Liberius,</hi> we bring fower answeres.</p>
               <p>The first answere is, that though it be certaine, and not to be doubted, that this is written by an ancient author, and of saint HILLARIES tyme, as besides the antiquitie of the manuscriptes, which are to be sound in sundrie libraries, it appeares both by the manner of that stile, which fullie agrees with that of saint HILLARIES age, and by manie things which are there recited, which could not haue bene knowne but by the authors of saint HILLARIES age; neuerthelesse, it is not equally certaine, that it is S HILLARIES. Contrariwise there are fower co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iectures, which seeme to intimate, that either it should be <hi>Hillaries</hi> the <hi>Luciserian</hi> deacon, of the same tyme with saint HILLARIE, or some other authors of the same Sect, and age, which haue supposed it, and made it passe vnder the name of saint HILLARIE; or that the <hi>Parentheses</hi> which are inserted into <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> his Epistles that he cites, which also are inserted in forme of notes, and marked with signes of a crosse at the head, and enuirond with semye-cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and written in an other character, are not saint HILLARIES, but some exemplaristes of that age.</p>
               <p>The first coniecture is, that these <hi>Parentheses</hi> condemne the Faith of the Councell of <hi>Sirmium</hi> which <hi>Demophilus</hi> caused <hi>Liberius</hi> to signe; that is, the Faith of the first Councell of <hi>Sirmium,</hi> which did not err but in the omission of the word <hi>Homousion</hi> (for <hi>Demophilus</hi> as the Illustrious Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall<note place="margin">Anual 16. 3. ad an 357.</note>

And then howe could the celebration of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells haue bene a meanes, to make men assured of the communion of the true Church, if generall Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cells lawfully assembled that is, according to the externall solemne and vsuall waies, might erre in faith, as the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> pretend, and had not the infallible assistance of the holy Ghost, but that a particular man, esteeming his opinion agreeable to the sense of Scripture, and that of the Councell differing from it; might, yea ought to preferr his iudgement, before that of the Councell.</p>

                  <p>But in regarde of euidence, the authoritie of <hi>Oecumenicall</hi> Councells in deede, is more powerfull and eminent, in the behalfe of those men which are deuided from the Church, then that of <hi>Oecumenicall</hi> Councells in right. For in Councells <hi>Oecumenicall</hi> in right, there are none but Catholicks, that are assured, that all the body of the Church is there assembled: whereas in Councells <hi>Oecumenicall</hi> in deede, each of the parties co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>testing, is of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that all the Body of the Church is there represented. And the medley of hereticall or Schismaticall Bishops, that is prouided with the onely, succession of the Episcopall character, but cut of from the communion of the Bodie of the Church hinders not, but that in such councells, the holy Ghost may worke by the common note of the Assemblie; because, the true Church receiuing those Bishops there (for the effect then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) into her charitie, and into her communion, while they are ioyned with her, to the end to seeke meanes to assemblish vnitie; she re-enables and restores to them for the tyme of the assemblie, the authoritie of the exercise, and of the Iurisdiction of their order whereof before, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned to them nothing but the character.</p>
                  <p>To say then that some of the Councells of the latter age, haue not bene <hi>Oecumenicall,</hi> because the Greekes or <hi>Ethiopians</hi> did not assist there, is not a valuable exception, vnlesse it first appeare that the <hi>Greekes</hi> or <hi>Ethiopians</hi> are true and lawfull partes of the Church, and haue not bene iustly cutt off and deuided from the Catholicke communion. For it sufficeth to make a Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell generall and vniuersall in right, that all the partes that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine actuall within the Body &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the true Catholick church, doe concurr to it: and it is not requisite, that those that are lawfully sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her either for Schisme or herefie, as are the <hi>Greekes</hi> who erre in the Faith of the procession of the holy Ghost, which his Maiestie himself holdes to be an article of Faith; &amp; the naturall <hi>Egiptians</hi> &amp; <hi>Ethiopians</hi> who<note place="margin">

               <head>Of the difficulties of the Scripture, concerning the tyme of S. Peters staie at Antioch, and at Rome. CHAPT. IV.</head>
               <p>BVT against this that wee haue affirmed of the sitting of Saint PFTER at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and at <hi>Rome; Caluine,</hi> and the other aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Church, forme twelue principall obiections; eight from the Scripture, and fower from the Fathers. The first obiection is, that S. PAVL found S. PETER in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the two first voyages that he made thither; the one, three yeare after his conuersion; &amp; the other, when<note place="margin">Galat. 1. Act. 12. Hier. de script. cccl. in Petro. Greg. ep. l. 6. ep. 36. Hier. ibid.</note> he carried the almes for the famine foretould by <hi>Agabus;</hi> &amp; then that the Episcopall staie of S. PETER at <hi>Antioch,</hi> which after S. <hi>Ieroms</hi> computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene these two voyages, could not be seauen yeares, as S. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> affirmes it, &amp; as wee suppose it; for asmuch as S. <hi>Paules</hi> conuersio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at the soonest, three yeares after the death of IESVS CHRIST; &amp; S. PETER departed from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yeare of the Empire of <hi>Claudius,</hi> which was the eleauenth yeare after the death of<note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> Christ. The seconde obiection is, that S. PETER still assisted at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> at the Councell holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the legall causes about twentie yeare, saie they, after the death of our Lord and was crucified as we saie, the fourteenth yeare of the Empire of <hi>Nero,</hi> that is the seauen &amp; thirtith yeare after the death of our Sauiour, &amp; then he could not haue bene 25 yeare at <hi>Rome</hi> as wee saie. The third that S. PAVL addressing the principall of his epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to the <hi>Romans,</hi> doth not there salute S. PETER, whom he would not<note place="margin">Rom. 16.</note> haue forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if he had bene there. The fourth is, that S. PAVL writing<note place="margin">Philip. 2.</note> from <hi>Rome</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> complained that euery one sought his owne, &amp; not that which was of Christ. And to <hi>Timothie</hi> that all had abandoned him: which he would not haue done if S. PETFR had bene there. The<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.</note> fist, that when S. PAVL came to <hi>Rome,</hi> the bretheren went to meete him,<note place="margin">Act. 28.</note> amongst whom there is noe mention of S. PETFR, and the <hi>Iewes</hi> prayed him to declare to them his opinion of the sect of the <hi>Christians,</hi> a thing they would not haue required, if S. PETER had preached at <hi>Rome</hi> before him. The sixt; that S. LVKE who writ the history of the Actes of the Apostles, maketh no mention of S. PETERS voyage to <hi>Rome.</hi> The sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth that S. PAVL who hath described the enterview betweene S.<note place="margin">Galat. 1. &amp; 2.</note> PETER and him at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>Antioch, speakes</hi> not of their enter-view at<note place="margin">Ioan. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> which was the most famous cittie of the world. And the eigth, that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> made mention of the kinde of death by which S. PETER should glorifie God, but makes no mention of the place of his death. Now lett vs first dispatch the obiections taken out of scripture, and after we will proceede to those taken out of the Fathers.</p>

For in anie one of the epistles, that S.

Iointlie that wee say not, that S. PETER remained alwaies fixed and tied to <hi>Rome,</hi> while he was Bishop thereof, but that he went from tyme to tyme, planting the Ghospell in the lesser citties, and placing Bishops ouer them, and that during these voyages he administred the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, by the ministrie of <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Cletus,</hi> whom he had there establisheth for his Coadiutors; which is the cause for which (if wee belieue <hi>Russinus)</hi> they are sometimes<note place="margin">Ruffi. praef. in Clem.</note> reckoned in the order of the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> before S.

               <p>The eight nullitie is, that when they would proceede to the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the canon, the Popes Legates protested a nullitie against it, and made their protestation to be registred within the acts of the Councell.

               </p>
               <p>The tenth nullitie is, that <hi>Anatolius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> seeing this canon could not subsist if it were discouered that it had bene annulled by the Pope, concealed from the Bishops of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> the abrogation that the Pope had made of this decree, and kept backe the Popes letters, whereby he had annulled and abolished it, a fraude so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous, as it had like to haue turned vpsidowne all the Church of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the <hi>East.</hi> For the Pope hauing ioyned in one letter the abrogation of this decree, with the confirmation that hee made of the other acts of the Councell, <hi>Anatolius</hi> because he would not shewe the censure of his ambition, concealed the Popes letters, where the one and the other clause was contained; which was the clause that the Easterne Churches remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in such doubt, whether or not the Pope had confirmed the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> as infinite people for this cause making difficultie to receiue it; the Emperor was faine to request the Pope, to dispatch new letters confirmatiue of the Faith of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> to all the Bishops who had assisted there, and to send them to each one of them in their Churches. <hi>This</hi> (said Pope <hi>Leo</hi> in his answere to the Emperor <hi>Martian) your clemencie thinks will be more easilie fufilled, if throughout all the Churches we</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The eleauenth nullitie is, that <hi>Anatolius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> euen he that had packed this Canon, he himself in whose fauour it had bene particularized, departed from it, as is seene by the text of the epistle that<note place="margin">Leo ad Anat. cp 59</note> Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the first writt him, which is such: <hi>This thy fault which to increase

               </p>
               <p>The twelfth nullitie is, that this Canon hath bene falselie inserted into the catalogue of the Canons of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> by the latter Greekes, which perchance made Sainct GREGORIE to<note place="margin">Greg. l. 5. indict. 14. cp. 14.</note> saie; <hi>The Councell of Chalcedon hath in one place bene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>For the vnderstanding whereof, you must knowe that there were two depositions of <hi>Anthymus,</hi> one from the Patriarkship of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which was made and perfected by the Popes onely action; and wherein the Councell of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whereof <hi>Iustinian</hi> speaketh, had noe hand; and the other from the Bishops Sea of <hi>Trebyzond,</hi> which was indeede be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by the Pope, who ordained, that if <hi>Anthymus</hi> did not purge himself of the heresie which was imputed to him, he should be deposed also from the Bishops Sea of <hi>Trebisond,</hi> which had bene reserued to him by the first deposition, and should be withall excommunicated and depriued of all Sacerdotall title, and of all Catholicke nomination. But because the Pope could not finish this second deposition, by reason death preuented him before he had the leasure to be fully cleered from the condition that was therevnto apposed, it was finished and executed in the Councell. This appeares by the Acts of the same Councell, whereof <hi>Iustinian</hi> speaketh, to witt, of the Councell of <hi>Constantinople</hi> holden by <hi>Menas;</hi> for the confirmation whereof, was published two moneths after, this lawe which is annexed to the end of the Councell.

assemblie authenticall temporallie, and the conuocation necessarie to make their assemblie authenticall in conscience and spirituallie. In the first case there was nothing to be determined betweene the Popes and the Emperors; for none doubtes, but the authoritie necessarie to call generall Councells temporallie, and to make them executory by the secular arme, was the authoritie of the Emperors, noe more then at this daye anie doubtes, but the authority necessary to make the conuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Nationall</hi> Councells authenticall temporally must be that of the Kings or Princes within whose estates they are to be holden. In the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond case, there was yet lesse, for as much as it is euident, that the authoritie necessarie to legitimate in conscience the conuocation of Councells; and to make them obligatorie spirituallie, must be a spirituall and ecclesiasticall authoritie, a temporall Magistrate not being able to conferr anie spirituall authoritie to Councells. And indeede when the Emperors haue pretended to call generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells without being moued thereto, or seconded by the iust ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall authoritie, those Councells haue bene declared illegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, not onely by the finall issue of their iudgements, but by the originall vice of their forme, if the Popes confirmation did not come in to correct the defect.

For if the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the equalitie that he challenged to haue obtained with the Pope in superioritie ouer the other Patriarkes, presumed to call the generall Councells of the <hi>East:</hi> why is it not manifest, that the authoritie to call generall Councells, forasmuch as concernes spirituall and Ecclesiasticall power, belonged to the Pope? And if it were soe, when the Emperors possest almost all the Regions of the Empire, and when the Catholicke Church was spread almost ouer all the other patriarkships, how much more nowe when that the Emperors hold but the least part of the Estates of the ancient Empire, and that the Catholicke Church is almost redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into the prouinces of the patriarkship of the Pope, or to those, that by the conuersion of countries newlie discouered, haue drawne their mission and Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction from them? But heere is enough of the calling of Councells; lett vs goe forward to the other Articles.</p>

For as for the impertinent shift of those that answere, that the restitution that the Pope makes of Bishops which had bene deposed by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells of their Prouinces, was but a simple declaration, that he was of opinion they ought to be restored, and not a formall and iuridicall resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; And likewise, that the deposition that he made of the Bishops or Priests of other Prouinces, was but a declaration, that his opinion was, that they ought to be deposed, and not a formall and iuridicall deposition; what can there be imagined more vnapt and more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous? Is there soe young a Nouice in the lawes, that knowes not how differing these things are, to be of opinion that a man ought to be absolued, and to absolue; or to be of opinion, that a man ought to be condemned, and to condemne him: And that if all the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world had pronounced that it was their opinion, that a criminall person ought to be condemned, he were not condemned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, vnlesse they pronounced planelie, <hi>wee haue condemned and doe condemne him?</hi> for as much as the one is an act of science and the other is an acte of authoritie; and that the least doctors can doe the one, and onely Iudges the other. But why said I soe younge a Nouice in the lawes? Is there a man soe destitute of common sence as can not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, that when the Pope restores anie one, who had bene deposed by the Councell of his prouince, if the Popes restitution were but a simple aduice, that he ought to be restored; he that had bene depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, had not more right to returne into his Bishopricke after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution then before; And that his diocesans were noe more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in conscience to receiue him, then they were before. Moreouer, if the Popes restitution, were but simplie an aduise; that he that was deposed, ought to be restored, what end would there be of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall contentions? for the Bishops that had deposed him, being of opinion that he ought to bee deposed, and the Pope being of opinion that he ought to bee restored, if the Popes restitution were but a simple aduise, that he ought to be restored, to whose aduise should the restored person be obliged to yeild? If to that which seemed most iust to him, then it was he himselfe that was the iudge of his deposition or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution; if to that of the Pope, then it were noe more an act of aduise and Councell, but an act of iurisdiction and authoritie, and not a simple act of iurisdiction and authoritie by which the Pope restored him for his part, and as much as was in him; but an act of iurisdiction and operatiue authoritie vpon the precedent sentence, and abrogating the first iudgement. O strange glosse to saie; that when Pope <hi>Julius</hi> resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red saint ATHANASIVS Patriarke of <hi>Alexandria; Paule</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople; Marcellus</hi> Primate of <hi>Ancyra</hi> in <hi>Galatia; Asclepas</hi> Bishop of <hi>Palestina;</hi> or that when Pope LEO restored <hi>Theodoret</hi> Bishop of <hi>Cyre,</hi> then liuing; and <hi>Flauianus</hi> Patriarke of <hi>Constantinople</hi> after his death; he did noe other thing then to declare, that his opinion was, that they ought to be restored.

               </p>
               <p>But to this instance <hi>Caluins</hi> Sect doe annexe two new obseruations; the first, that the Pope hauing threatned the Bishops of <hi>Asia</hi> to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate them, <hi>Polycrates</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and Metropolitan of <hi>Asia,</hi> despised the Popes threates, as it appeares by the answere of the same <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycrates</hi>

                     </gap>. in Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cr.</note> hee reportes it <hi>to shewe the spirit and authoritie of the man.</hi> And the second, that when the Pope pronounced anciently his excommunications, he did noe other thing but separate himselfe from the communion of those that he excommunicated and did not thereby separate them from the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall communion of the Church. To the first then we saie, that soe farr is this epistle of <hi>Polycrates</hi> from abating and diminishing the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that contrary wise it greatly magnifies and exaltes it. For although <hi>Polycrates</hi> blinded with the loue of the custome of his nation, which he beleeued to be grounded vpon the word of God, who had assigned the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:7769:136"/>

                  <hi>then man.</hi> Doth it not shew, that had it not bene, that he belieued the Popes threate, was against the expresse word of God, there had bene cause to feare it, and he had bene obliged to obaie him; for who knowes not, that this answere; <hi>it is better to obaie God then men,</hi> is not to be made but to those, whom we were obliged to obaie, if their commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were not contrarie to the commaundments of God; And that he adds, that hee had called the Bishops of <hi>Asia,</hi> to a Nationall Councell, being summoned to it by the Pope; doth it not insinuate, that the other Councells where of <hi>Eusebius</hi> speakes, that were holden about this matter,<note place="margin">Euseb. hist Eccl. l. 5. c. 23.</note> through all the prouinces of the Earth, and particularly that of <hi>Palestina,</hi> which if you beleiue the act that <hi>Beda</hi> said came to his handes, <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>

And that the Councells of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea,</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> of <hi>Ephesus</hi> embraced the censure of <hi>Victor,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated those that obserued the custome of <hi>Polycrates:</hi> doth it not proue, that it was not the Pope; but <hi>Polycrates</hi> that was deceiued, in beleiuing that the Popes commaundement, was against Gods commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement? And that saint IEROM himselfe, celebrates the Paschall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melyes of <hi>Theophilus</hi> Patriarke of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which followed the order of <hi>Nicea</hi> concerning the <hi>Pasche;</hi> Doth it not iustifie, that when saint IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROM saith; that he reportes the Epistle of <hi>Policrates, to shew the spirit, and authoritie of the man;</hi> he intends by authoritie, not authoritie of right, but of fact; that is to saie, the credit that <hi>Polycrates</hi> had amongst the <hi>Asians</hi> and other <hi>Quartodecumans?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the second obseruation; which is, that when the Pope excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated other Bishops, Archbishops, or Patriarkes, he seperated himselfe from their communion, but did not thereby seperate them from the communion of the Church; Wee will doe noe other thing, then exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine examples that they alleadged for proofe of their hypothesis; And yet we will not examine them all, for we haue alreadie confuted the<note place="margin">

We will onely treat of those that they propound to vs a newe, which consist in three principall heades: The first is that the fifth Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of <hi>Carthage</hi> ordained, that euery Bishop that should fall into the cases mentioned by the tenth and thirteenth canons of the same Councell, should content himselfe with the communion of his one Church alone, from whence they conclude, that euerie excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, did not import priuation of Sacraments. The second, that <hi>Nicephorus</hi> writes, that Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> hauing excommunicated <hi>Menas</hi> Patriarke of <hi>Constantinople</hi> for fower moneths, <hi>Menas</hi> yeilded him the same measure. And the third, that <hi>Sigesbert</hi> speaking of the proceeding of<note place="margin">Niceph. hist.

               </p>
               <p>To the first then of these examples, which is; <hi>That the fifth Councell of Carthage odaines, thàt euerie Bishop that should fall into the case of Canons aboue mentioned, should content himself with the communion of his owne Church onelie;</hi> Wee answere two things, The one, that the censure whereof the Canons

               <p>THE second instance of <hi>Caluin,</hi> is taken from saint CYPRIAN,<note place="margin">Inst.

The second that he complaines, because <hi>Basilides</hi> a Bishop of <hi>Spaine,</hi> hauing bene deposed by a Synod of his Prouince, for hauing bowed vnder persecution, and an other hauing bene ordained in his place, Pope <hi>Steuen</hi> restored him. The third, that he saith, there were but a small number of lost and desperate persons, who beleeued that the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Bishops of <hi>Africa,</hi> was lesser. The fowrth, that he saith, that the ecclesiasticall causes ought to be determined, where they were bredd. The fift, that hee affirmes, that the Episcopall power is one thing, whereof euerie one holdes his portion, vndiuidedly. The sixth, that hee cries, none of vs constitutes himselfe Bishopp of Bishopps. And the seauenth, finallie that he vseth rude wordes against Pope <hi>Steuen,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses him of ignorance and of presumption. To the first then of these heades, which is that saint CYPRIAN calls Pope <hi>Cornelius</hi> brother: Wee<note place="margin">Cyp. in ep. ad Cornel.</note> answere, he calls him Brother, not to denie to him the superintendencie of the Ecclesiasticall gouernement; but for two other causes: The one to insinuate that the Popes superintendencie ouer other Bishops, was not a Lordly Monarchie, as that of temporall princes ouer their subiects; but a gentle and brotherly Monarchie, as that of an elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ouer his younger Bretheren, which is the title that our Lord himselfe would beare when he made himselfe be called the first borne amongst<note place="margin">Rom 8.</note> manie bretheren, and which is the memoriall of humilitie, that God had<note place="margin">Deuter. 17</note> giuen to the Kings of his people, when he had pronounced; <hi>Thou shalt take a king from amongst thy bretheren.</hi> And againe <hi>that the kings heart, may not</hi>

I saie in right, and not in fact, for as much as the Emperor could well giue them Iudges in fact, and whose iudgement should be obligatorie to the secular Tribunall, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory by the officers of the Empire, and vnder the imposition of paines and temporall punishments; but hee could not giue them Iudges in right, whose Iudgements should bee obligatorie in conscience, and to the Tribunall of the Church, and should make those that contradicted, culpable of spirituall censures and punishments. And secondly the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> hauing specified in their request, that they demaunded Iudges of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and that of purpose to exclude particularlie the iudges of <hi>Italie;</hi> the Emperor harkening to their request, and giuing them Iudges of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> how had he sent them to <hi>Rome</hi> to iudge the cause with the Pope, and vnder his Presidencie and direction, who was hee against whom, if wee giue creditt to the <hi>Donatists</hi> in the conference of <hi>Carthage,</hi> their peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was principallie presented, if hee had not acknowledged that the Pope was naturall and ineuitable Iudge of the cause? Is there any likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that the Emperor beeing resident amongst the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and the Iudges whom he nominated for the <hi>Donatists,</hi> being risident there, that hee would haue sent them from about his person where they were, to the Popes person, from whom they were seperated by so large a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Sea and land to serue him for assistants, if hee had belieued that it was himselfe and not the Pope, that was the Naturall Iudge of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire. To what purpose should he haue made the <hi>Donatists</hi> take so much paines, who came to him out of <hi>Africa</hi> into <hi>Gallia;</hi> and the three Iudges that hee graunted them, who were also in <hi>Gallia,</hi> to trauaile from thence to <hi>Rome,</hi> if hee had not acknowledged that which wee read latelie<note place="margin">Iul. ep. ad Euscbian. apud.</note> in saint ATHANASIVS; <hi>That the causes of the Bishops could not be determined, till de decision had bene made at Rome.</hi> And in <hi>Sozomene; That those things that were constituted without the sentence of the Bishop of Rome, were nullities.</hi> And in<note place="margin">Athan. see aboue.</note> saint AVGVSTINE vpon the same place, <hi>that in the Roman Church had</hi>

               <p>THE fowrth instance of <hi>Caluin</hi> is; that in the <hi>Mileuitan</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell holden vnder Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the first thousand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares agoe, the Bishops of <hi>Africa</hi> forbad the clerkes of their Prouinces the appeales beyond Seas, <hi>In the Mileuitan Couueell, saith Caluin, where saint</hi> AVGVSTINE <hi>assisted;</hi>

And the second, that he speakes but of the Appeales of Priests deacons, and other clerkes of the inferior order; and not of the Appeales of the Clerkes of Superior orders; that is to sale,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:7769:149"/>
of Bishops. For the cleering then of the first of these doubtes; which is, that the Canon is meant but of Appeales in minor causes, it must be knowne, that the ecelesiasticall Tribunalls, did then examine not onely the spirituall and religious causes of the Church, but also all the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and secular causes of ecclesiasticall persons, as well ciuill as crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.

                  <hi>Nicholas</hi> the first, maketh him this protestation; <hi>Let it not please God, that we should soe despise the priuiledge of the first and soueraigne sea of the Pope of the holie Roman Church, as to wearie your soueraigne aucthoritie with all the Controuersies and with all the quarrells of the Clergie, as well of the Superior as inferior order, which the canons of the Councell of Nicea and the decrees of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and of the other Popes of the holy sea of Rome, commaund to be determined in their prouinces</hi> And againe; <hi>Wee Metropolitans trauailinge in our prouinciall Councells, decide carnall controuersies, and haue care after iudgement to referr the maior causes, and of maior persons, to the examination of the Pope of the Soueraigne Sea.</hi> And from hence it is alsoe that <hi>Gerson</hi> declaming longe tyme after against the disorders in the court of <hi>Rome</hi> during the schisme of <hi>Iohn</hi> the twentie three, cryes out; <hi>If the iudgement of minor causes be reproued in</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The first solution then that wee bring to the prohibition that the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops of the <hi>Mileuitan</hi> Councell made to their clerkes from appealing beyond Sea, is that the wordes of the Councell were intended not of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales in maior causes; that is to saie, in causes that concerne faith or the vniuersall customes of the church; but of appeales in minor causes; that is to saie, in causes morall or pecuniarie of Ecclesiasticall persons. And this solution besides the places alreadie alleadged, wee drawe first from the text of the canon which saith preciselie; In the cause that they shall haue to shewe, that he speakes of their particular causes, and not of the causes of the church. And secondly from the argument that hath bene sett be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one of the places of the Greeke translation of this canon neere thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares agoe, which saith in their proper causes, to distinguish them<note place="margin">Edit. Graec Conc. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th. c. 26.</note> from Ecclesiasticall causes: for the first councell of <hi>Constantinople</hi> that the Greekes held for the <hi>Palladium</hi> of their discipline; And the third<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st. 1. c. 6</note> Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> oppose proper causes to ecclesiasticall causes, not that proper and temporall causes of ecclesiasticall persons were not<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. Carth 3. c. 7.</note> sometimes called ecclesiasticall causes, but because when the word eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall cause was speciallie taken, it was restrained onely to ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall matter. And thirdlie wee collect it from the practise and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges of the same <hi>Mileuitan</hi> Councell. For after that <hi>Pelagius,</hi> whose cause was a maior cause, and belonging to the Faith, had bene iudged in the East by the Bishops of <hi>Palestina,</hi> and that <hi>Celestius</hi> his disciple had bene heard and excommunicated for the same cause in <hi>Africa,</hi> by the <hi>African</hi> Bishops, the <hi>Mileuitan</hi> Councell remitted the finall iudgement thereof to the Pope, in these words: <hi>Because God by the guift of his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall</hi>

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:7769:150"/>
that holde these doctrins so peruerse and pernicious, will more easilie yeeld to the authoritie of thy Holynesse, drawne out of the authoritie of the holie scriptures, in such sort as we may haue more cause to reioyce in their correction, then to afflict ourselues in their ruine.</hi> A meruailous encounter of the effects of Gods prouidence, which willed that the same <hi>Mileuitan</hi> Councell, which the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Caluinists</hi> abuse to ouerthrowe the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, not onely puts it in practise, but also witnesseth that it is of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine right, and grounded vpon the authoritie of the holie scriptures. For to thinke, to shift off this Epithete, <hi>drawne from the authoritie of the holie scriptures,</hi> by saying that the Councell speakes not of the cathedrall and Iudiciary authoritie of the Pope, but of the authoritie of the passages of the scripture, alleadged by the Pope against <hi>Pelagius,</hi> it is a childish and ridiculous shifte, aswell because, the Pope had not then alleadged anie thing against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> as because it had bene a singular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencie that the <hi>Pelagians</hi> would rather yeild to the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, then to that of the other Bishops, doctors, and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Councells, and amongst the rest, of saint IEROM, saint AV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GVSTINE, and of the two Councells of <hi>Africa,</hi> whereof bookes are full saith saint PROSPER,<note place="margin">Prosp. de Ingr.</note>

               </lg>
               <p>Because the Popes authoritie was drawne from the authoritie of the holy scriptures; If by the Popes authoritie, they had intended the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges alleadged by the Pope, and not the authoritie of the Popes chaire. Iointly that the fiue Bishops of <hi>Africa</hi> who accompained the relation of the <hi>Mileuitan</hi> Councell with their letters, did sufficientlie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of what authoritie the <hi>Mileuitan</hi> Councell intended to speake, when they writt to the Pope; <hi>If the abettors of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:7769:150"/>
death before he could bring it to effect, Pope <hi>Zosimus</hi> his Successor and that euen at the instance of the Councells of <hi>Africa,</hi> who sent to <hi>Rome</hi> the verball processe of that, that past betweene them, and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestius</hi> finisht it. And after he had heard <hi>Celestius</hi> in person, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated whether hee would absolue him or not absolue him from the excommunication that the Bishops of <hi>Africa</hi> had pronounced against him, he finallie confirmed the sentence of the Councells of <hi>Africa,</hi> and declared him condemned and excommunicated through the whole earth. <hi>Celestius</hi> (saith saint AVGVSTINE, speaking of the answeres that<note place="margin">Aug de pecc. orig. cont.

               </p>
               <p>The second solution that whe bring to the place of the <hi>Mileuitan</hi> Councell is, that the Canon speakes but of inferior clerks, which were Priests, deacons, subdeacons, and other lesser Orders, and not superior Clerks; that is to saie, Bishops, whose causes, because of the importance and dignitie of their persons, were reputed maior causes; as Pope <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> the first, though longe after, writes to the Bishops of France, in<note place="margin">Nicol. 1. ep ad Episc. Gallic.</note> these wordes: <hi>The more the Bishops are in a principall degree. and more exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Church of God, the more when their preseruation is treated of, or their deposition, ought their causes to bee reckoned amongst maior and difficult causes; for they are the first in the Church; they are those which holde the reede in their hand, to measure the holie Ierusalem; they are those that rule in Gods buildings.</hi> And this solution we drawe first from the very wordes of the <hi>Mileuitan</hi> Councell, which are; <hi>It hath bene thought fitt, that</hi>

               <p>The second proofe is, that the Councell intituled, the second of<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. Carth 1. c. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Carthage,</hi> was called by <hi>Genetlius,</hi> as it hath bene aboue said, and as he declared it himselfe in these wordes: <hi>You haue trauailed to Carthage vpon the instance of my letters:</hi> by meanes whereof he must necessarily be Archbishop of <hi>Carthage</hi> in chiefe, and not coadiutor to <hi>Aurelius,</hi> and consequentlie, that the Councell intituled the second of <hi>Carthage,</hi> was holden vnder <hi>Ualentinian</hi> the second, and not vnder <hi>Ualentinian</hi> the third.

               <p>The second question concerning the councells of <hi>Africa</hi> in chiefe, is about the number of the Canons of the third Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> and consists in this; whether the third Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> hath publisht all the fifttie Canons that are in the ordinary editions; and amongst the rest, the canon of the Canonicall booke, which is the fortie seauenth; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it hath publisht but twentie one. The new promulgators of the cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the <hi>African</hi> church will haue it, that it publisht but 21. amongst which that of the canonicall bookes, which they pretend to haue bene framed by the sixth cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> is not comprehended. And we contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise maintain that the third councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> hath publisht all the fiftie canons contayned in the ordinarie edition; &amp; amongst the rest, that of the canonicall Bookes. Their prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces are grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two reasons; the one, that there are but twentie one Canons, or few more of the third cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of <hi>Carthage</hi> inserted into the <hi>African</hi> Rapsody, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst the which, the canon of the canonicall bookes is none; and the other that in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of this cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is said that they must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with Pope <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> and with other Bishops beyond Sea; which <hi>Boniface</hi> was of the tyme not of the third Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> but of the sixth.

Can. artic. 13.</note> the one, that he, that collected them, had restrained himselfe of delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate purpose as it appeares by the diuision of the nintie ninth canon of his rapsodie which is the last of the seauenth Councell of <hi>Carthage;</hi> which to finde the rekoning iust he diuides in two, to make but one century of <hi>African</hi> canons, within which the fowrth Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> which onely contayned a hundred and foure canons, could not enter; and the other, that the fowrth councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> hauing prescribed the lawes, vnder which all the ecclesiasticall perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of <hi>Africa</hi> ought to be promoted to the order of Priestood; there was noe neede to inserte it into the bodie of this Rapsodie, to keepe them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wandring fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the matter; for as much as all ecclesiasticall persons, and particularly Bishops were obliged to keepe it in their hands. To those two reasons I will yet annex two others, which conuince that it is truly ancient, and due to the age whereto wee attribute it; the one is that the things there decided, agree wholie to the Estate of <hi>Africa</hi> in S.

combats in the worke of the trauaile of Religious persons, who held it<note place="margin">Aug de oper Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nath.</note> for an oprobry, that Religious men should labour with their handes or shaue their heades. The other reason is, that the decrees of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell are acknowledged, and cited not onely by all the canonists that haue written since six hundred yeares, as <hi>Burchard, Iuon,</hi> and <hi>Gratian,</hi> but also by <hi>Isidorus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hispalis,</hi> now called <hi>Seuill,</hi> a cittie neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vpon <hi>Africa,,</hi> who liued a thousand yeares agone; who reported the canon of the ordination of Exorcists, in these wordes. <hi>When the Exorcists</hi>

                  <hi>are ordained, they take</hi> (as saith the canon) <hi>from the Bishops hand, the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Booke where the exorcismes are written, receiuing the power to impose hands vpon the Energumenes, whether they be baptized or Catechumens.</hi> Which are the very words of the seauenth Canon of the fowrth Councell of <hi>Carthage:</hi> And by <hi>Hincmarus,</hi> ancient Archbishop of <hi>Rheims,</hi> who cites the Canon where it is forbidden to the Bishop to iudge the cause<note place="margin">Hincmar. opusc. 55.</note> of anie without his clergie, in these termes: <hi>Let the Bishop heare noe mans cause, without the presence of his Clergie;</hi> which are the very wordes of the twentie third canon of the fowrth Councell of <hi>Carthage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fowrth difference is, vpon the order of the fifth Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> that the Illustrious cardinall <hi>Baronius,</hi> pretends to haue bene transferred from the degree; and that it ought to be placed againe in the third place; that is to saie betweene the Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> holden vnder the consulship of <hi>Cesarius</hi> and <hi>Atticus,</hi> that he places in the second ranke, and the fowrth. The reasons of the Illustrious Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> are, the one that the date of this Councell which is not filled vp in the printed editions, but onelie beares, <hi>The sixth of the calends of June after the Consulship,</hi> without specifying the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulls names, is found in some manuscripts filled vp with these wordes <hi>Cesarius and Atticus:</hi> by which meanes this councell must haue bene holden the next yeare after the celebration of the Councell, that we call the third of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and he, the second which was holden vnder the consulship of <hi>Cesarius</hi> and <hi>Atticus;</hi> and the other, that there is a<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. Carth 5. c. 15.</note> canon in the fifth Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which ordaines that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror may be besought to roote out the relickes of Idolatry. From whence it followes, that this Councell hath preceded the commaundement that the Emperors gaue to abolish the remainder of Idolatrie. Now this Commaundement was giuen vnder the consulship of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> the yeare of our Lord, according to our computation three hundred nintie nine by two edicts, the one addressed to <hi>Apollodorus</hi> vicar of<note place="margin">Cod. Theod. l. 16. Titul. De pag. l. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Africa,</hi> where the Emperors commaund that the pagans Idolls, should be taken out of their temples and their sacrifices abolisht. And the other addressed to <hi>Eutychianus,</hi> prouost of the Easterne Pretory; where they commaunded, that the temples of the pagans that were in the fieldes,<note place="margin">Ibid. l. 18.</note> should be demolished without trouble or tumult; And consequently saith he, the Councell had bene holden the yeare before, which was the yeare after the Consulship of <hi>Cesarius</hi> &amp; <hi>Atticus.</hi> To the first then of these reasons, we answere that the manuscript which saith, after the Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>Cesarius</hi> and <hi>Atticus,</hi> is not confirmed by the vniuersall consent of the other manuscriptes; for there are collections in manuscripts of <hi>Merca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> as the new publishers of the Councells of <hi>Africa</hi> haue noted; which saie, after the Consulship of <hi>Flauius Stelicon.</hi> And to the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d we saie, that the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ordaines the request for the abolishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the remainders of Idolatrie hath nothing in it common with the Edicts of the Emperors of the yeare three hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred nintie nine. Forasmuch as the Emperors had onely ordained by one of the Edicts; that the Sacrifices should be taken
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:7769:158"/>
out of the Temples; and the Idolls deposited into the handes of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Empire, but that the buildings should still be kept intire; and by the other, that the Temples of the pagans which were in the fiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. Carth 5. c. 15.</note> should be demolished. And the fifth Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> demaun des, that the remainder of Idolatrie, should be abolished, not onely in the Idolls, but also in the woods and in the trees.

Afric. c. 35</note> enough of these reasons; it is tyme to propound ours. The motiue then that incites vs to belieue, that the Councell that we call the fifth of <hi>Carthage,</hi> hath bene holden in the tyme wherein we place it; that is to saie, betweene the fowrth Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> and the sixth consists besides the common consent of copies, and the vniuersall voice of <hi>Canonists</hi> in two reasons; the one is, that S. AVGVSTIN in his Epistle to <hi>Quintianus,</hi> after he hath spoken of the Councell, where there were ioyntly publisht the Canon of the canonicall Bookes; and that of the prohibition to Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, to vsurpe one an others Clerkes, which was the third Councell of<note place="margin">August. ad Quintian. Ep. 235</note> 
                  <hi>Carthage,</hi> saith, <hi>And after in a fresh Councell it hath bene ordained, that those who retire from a monastery, or are driuen from it, shall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued elsewhere to be clerkes, or to be superintendents in an other Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery;</hi> which are the wordes of the thirteenth Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of the fifth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Carthage:</hi> from whence it is gathered, that the fifth Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> that saint AVGVSTIN calls freshe, in regard of the third Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> was not holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n the next yeare after the third coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> but a longe while after: and by consequent, ought to keepe the ranke of the fifth and not of the fowrth Councell of <hi>Carthage.</hi> The other reason is, that in the Epistle two hundred thirtie sixth written to <hi>Xantippus</hi> Primat of <hi>Numidia,</hi> the same saint AVGVSTIN cites the canon, by which those that had neglected to followe their cause a whole yeare together, were excluded from goeing forward with it, which is the twelfth canon of the fifth Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> as a canon newlie instituted. From whence it appeares, that the fifth Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> was holden after that, that we call the fowrth. For saint AV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GVSTINE testifies, that the yeare in which he writt this Epistle, the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:7769:159"/>
                  <hi>Pasch</hi> should be the eigth of the Ides of Aprill. <hi>I haue</hi> (said he,) <hi>heard the cause of Abundantius, there being yet a hundred daies to Pasch Sundaie, which</hi>

                  <hi>shall be this yeare the eigth of the Ides of Aprill. This I haue had care to insinuate to your Reuerence, because of the Councell, and I haue not concealed it from himselfe, but haue faithfullie aduertised him, of what was there instituted, that if within a yeare, in case hee thinkes he should be prouided of a iudgement, he neglect to pursue</hi>

                  <hi>his cause, none may after giue him audience.</hi> Now <hi>Pasch</hi> neuer fell out vpon the eigth of the Ides of Aprill while <hi>Xanthippus</hi> was Primat of <hi>Numidia,</hi> but the yeare of our saluation four hundred and two, which was the yeare of the fifth consulship of <hi>Archadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> and consequently the fifth Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> that had bene holden the yeare before, fell out in the yeare foure hundred and one, that is to saie in the yeare after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulship of <hi>Stelicon;</hi> which was two yeare after the yeares of the consulship of <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Eutychianus,</hi> in which the fowrth councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> had bene celebrated.</p>
               <p>The fifth question is concerning the second <hi>Mileuitan</hi> Councell, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vnder the Consulship of <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Constantius,</hi> that the new pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishers of the Councell of <hi>Africa</hi> pretend to haue made noe canons, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by three coniectures; the first, because in the Rapsody of the <hi>African</hi> canons, there is noe mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made of this Councell. The second because the canons that are thereto attributed, are in part taken from the first <hi>Mileuitan</hi> Councell; and in part from the Councell holden vnder the twelfth consulship of <hi>Honorius.</hi> And the third, that amongst the Canons that are thereto assigned, there are some, that cannot agree, either with the place or tyme wherein it was celebrated. To these three coniectures, we haue also three answeres. The first answere is, that the Councell cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated vnder the twelfth Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sulship of <hi>Theodosius</hi> against <hi>Pelagius</hi> &amp; <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stius,</hi> was rather a repetition and confirmation of the <hi>Mileuitan</hi> councell, which had bene holden the yeare before against the same heretickes, then a new Councell. By meanes whereof, it must not be held strange, if the <hi>African</hi> Rapsody whereinto the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell celebrated vnderthe twelfth consulship of <hi>Houorius</hi> is inserted, hath not reported the Canons of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Mileuitan</hi> Councell; and principally the second <hi>Mileuitan</hi> Councell, hauing bene but a prouinciall Councell of the Bishops of <hi>Numidia,</hi> which had not the force of a nationall Councell of <hi>Africa,</hi> but by the concurrencie of the Councell of the Proconsulary Prouince, celebrated the same yeare at <hi>Carthage;</hi> and by the emologation that was made the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof the yeare following in the generall Councell of all <hi>Africa</hi> assembled at <hi>Carthage</hi> For the Bishop <hi>Aurelius,</hi> who is mentioned in the inscription of the <hi>Mileuitan</hi> Councell, reported by saint AVGVSTIN, is not <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:7769:159"/>
enough conuersant in historie to discerne them by the distance of dates, haue mingled a part of the preface, and of the decrees of the one, with the text of the other. And the third, that the same Bookebinders, finding the greater part of the canons of the <hi>Mileuitan</hi> Councell in the Councell holden vnder the twelfth consulship of <hi>Honorius;</hi> and vpon this occasion conceiuing that the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell holden vnder the twelfth Consulship of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi> was but a repetition of the <hi>Mileuitan,</hi> haue added to the <hi>Mileuitan</hi> what they haue found more in the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell holden vnder the twelfth con sulship of <hi>Honorius,</hi> and haue yet added thereto, some other canons taken out of other Councells. But that for this cause it followes, that the second <hi>Mileuitan</hi> Councell hath made noe canons, wee denie, and denie it with the authority of the second Councell of <hi>Tours,</hi> celebrated a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand and fifteene yeares agone, which cites the canons of the second <hi>Mileuitan</hi> Councells, in these words; <hi>It hath bene ordained in the ancient</hi>

                  <hi>Mileuitan Canons, that euerie Bishop that in case of necessitie etc. vailes a virgin before the age of twentie fiue yeare, shall not be holden culpable of breaking the Councell, were this number is prescribed.</hi> Which are the very words of the twentie sixth canon of the <hi>Mileuitan</hi> Councell, that we haue in our handes at this daie.</p>
               <p>The sixth controuersie is, concerning the dura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the sixth Councell, of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which not onely the Protestants, but the Illustrious Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> himselfe, and the doctors of <hi>Collen</hi> which haue followed him in<note place="margin">Edit.

From whence, it appeares that the sixth councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> was finished the same yeare wherein it began, and lasted but till the copies came out of the East, which arriued in the month of <hi>Nouember</hi> of the consulship of <hi>Monaxius</hi> and <hi>Plinta;</hi> and the other, that when there was question of the last processe of <hi>Apia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and of the second voyage of <hi>Faustinus</hi> into <hi>Africa;</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Africa</hi> writt to Pope <hi>Celestine,</hi> that they had assembled a councell, express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the occurrence of this Businesse; from it may be gathered, that the sixth councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> had not continued till then: <hi>Our holy brother</hi>

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:7769:162"/>
all the rest haue giuen their consent vnto it. And there are also so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metimes Clauses of two or three wordes, pronounced together by all the Bishops of a Councell; And principallie in the acclamations to Princes; where one of the Bishops hauing begun a period, all the<note place="margin">Concil.

There are also sometymes orations composed and pronounced by the deputies of Councells, which are attributed to the whole bodie<note place="margin">Concil. Const. 6.

               <p>The sixth reason is that the most part of the Canons of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Councell, are taken from diuers Clauses of former Councells; sticthed together, and threded as it were in the forme of Centons, one at the end of an other, and ioyned with soe little relation, and so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aptlie and impertinently as the Collection can but be attributed to the ignorance of a particular Rapsodist, and not to the sufficiencie and napacitie of the Fathers of the Councell. I will content myselfe with producinge two examples, to the end that from thence, the readers may coniecture the rest. The first example shall be drawne from the<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. Carth dict. 6. c. 4.</note> fifth Canon, whereof this is the tenor: <hi>Aurelius Bishop saith, there is none doubtes, but that the greedines of Couetousnes, is the mother of all euills; and therefore it must be interdicted, that anie should vsurpe the bounds of an other, or for hope of profitt to trench beyond the limitts establisht by the Fathers, neither shall it be lawfull for anie to take vsurie of anie thing whatsoeuer: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the new propositions which are either obscure or hidden vnder the generalitie of words being considered by vs, shall receiue a rule. But for the rest those whereof the Scripture hath cleerely determined must not longer be delayed, but rather to execute iudgement. And therefore that which is repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in laymen, ought by as much stronger reason to be condemned before all others in ecclesiasticall persons, all the Councell saith; None can labour without danger either against the prophets or the Ghospell.</hi> Now this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non is a centon compiled of two clauses, taken the one from the<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. Carth 1. c. 10.</note> tenth Canon of the first Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which forbidds Bishops to trench vpon the lymitts of their fellowe-Bretheren; and the other<note place="margin">Concil. Carth. 1. c. 13.</note> from the thirteenth which forbidds Clerkes to lend vpon vsury; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene which the Rapsodist hath vnaptlie interposed this interlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>although the new propositions which either are obscure or hidden vnder the generalitie of wordes, being considered by vs, shall receiue a rule, yet those where the ordonance of the seripture is cleere, must not be delayed, but rather the iudgement must be executed;</hi> which is not of the bodie of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Canon, but is an answere to the demaund that <hi>Abundantius</hi> Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. Carth 1. c. 13.</note> of <hi>Adrumeta</hi> had made, that they should confirme in the first Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which was a generall Councell of all <hi>Africa,</hi> the decree that had bene propounded in the Councell of <hi>Adrumeta,</hi> which was a particular Councell of one of the prouinces of <hi>Africa; that it was not lawfull for Clerkes to lend vpon vsurie.</hi> To this demaund then <hi>Gratus</hi> answered that new propositions and the decisions whereof were either obscure or ambigious in the Scripture, it was reasonable to deliberate of before they should be resolued. But that those where the ordonance of the Scripture was cleere, as in the case of vsurie, which was euidently forbidden both by the old and new Testament, there needed noe deliberation but execution. And the Rapsodist hath
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:7769:162"/>
inserted the answere into his centon without makeing mention of the question. And to tye it to the rest of his fagot, he hath put in there the word, <hi>although,</hi> which hath noe relation either to the wordes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after; But this will best appeare by confronting the Texts. The first clause then of this centon, is taken from the tenth Canon of the first Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where the text saith. <hi>Gratus Bishop said,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. Carth 1. c. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>that none doubts, but that the greedines of auarice, is the roote of all euills; and therefore it must be forbidden, that anie man should vsurpe the ends of nother, or trench vpon an other Bishop his colleague.</hi> And the second is taken from<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. Carth 1. c. 13.</note> the thirteenth Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the same Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell, whereof the wordes are these: <hi>Abundantius Bishop of adrumeta said, It hath bene ordained in our Councell, that it is not lawfull for clerkes to lend vpon vsurie: and if it seeme to your Holynesse and to this Councell to be to purpose, let it be appointed by this present decree. Gratus the Bishop said, new propositions, which are either obscure or hidden <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the ambiguitie of anie generall wordes; wee deliberate of, before we sett downe a Rule concerning them; but those wherein the ordinance of the diuine Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is cleere, it is not needefull to delay the iudgement, but rather to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it. And soe that which is reproued euen in the laitie, ought by a much stronger reason to be condemned in ecclesiasticall persons, before all others. All the Bishops said, None can doe anie thing contrary to the prophets, nor contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Ghospell without perill.</hi> And out of these two Canons of the first Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> seperated by the interposition of two other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and distant by more then twelue periods one from an other, the gatherer of the collection <hi>intituled the sixth Councell of Carthage,</hi> hath made this continued text vnder the title of the fifth Canon of the sixth Councell of <hi>Carthage. Aurelius the Bishop said, none can doubt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conc. dict. Carth. 6. c. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>but that the greedines of Auarice is the mother of all euill, and therefore it must be forbidden, that anie man should vsurpe the ends of an other, or for hope of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitt trench beyond the lymittes prescribed by the Fathers; and that that also it shall not be lawfull for anie clergie man to lend vpon vsurie; although new propositions, which are either obscure or hidden vnder the generalitie of wordes, should be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by vs, before wee sett downe a rule concerning them: yet those where, the ordinance of the diuine Scripture is cleere, must not be delayed, but rather procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in to Iudgement: and so that which is reproued euen in laymen, ought to be by stronger reason much more condemned in Clergy-men.

               <p>NOW as for this medley and rapsody of the Councells of <hi>Africa</hi> that we call the <hi>African</hi> Councell, which is a century of <hi>African</hi> canons, gathered from diuers cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cells, there are therin two difficulties. The first difficultie concernes the author of the Rapsodie, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sists in this, to witt; whether this composition hath bene made by anie particular canonist; or whether it hath bene gathered in a Councell. The Greekes, &amp; the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants who follow them, and some Catholickes as well ancient as moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, belieue it to be made in a councell, which some suppose to haue bene the sixth Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and others the seauenth, &amp; I contrarywise incline to beleeue, that it hath bene made by some <hi>African</hi> canonist, and whilst the <hi>Uandalls</hi> possest <hi>Africa,</hi> in which tyme there could no nationall councell be assembled in <hi>Africa:</hi> And this I incline to beleeue for ten rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons amongst others: The first reason is, that the Epistle of the Councell of <hi>Africa</hi> to Pope <hi>Celestine</hi> is there inserted, which was made in a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell holden expressely, for the second processe of <hi>Apiarius,</hi> and after the last<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. Afric. cap. 105. in ep. ad Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest.</note> voyage of <hi>Faustinus</hi> into <hi>Africa,</hi> as appeares by these wordes; <hi>Our holie Brother and fellow Bishop Faustinus, coming to vs, we haue assembled a Councell, and haue beleeued that the aime of his coming hath bene, that as by his procurement Apiarius had bene once before restored to the priesthood, so now by his labour, he might be purged from the accusations of the Tabracenians.</hi> Now this Councell that we call the ninth was holden long after the fixth &amp; seauenth which had bene celebrated vnder <hi>Boniface.</hi> And to sale that it was in this ninth that the Rapsodie of the Councells of <hi>Africa</hi> were made, it is a thing that cannot subsist, for the Fathers would not haue bene contented, to insert heereinto their Epistle only, but would haue added to it somewhat of the historie, and of the date of their Councell. The second reason is, that after the quotation of the Councell of <hi>Hippo,</hi> which is the first whose date is registred in this Rapsody follow these wordes: <hi>The acts of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. Afric. in not. ante. c. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>are not heere described because the things that hane bene therein ordained, are aboue inserted, which words cannot haue relation either to the rapsody of the councells of Africa, or to the sixth Councell of Carthage;</hi> for the actes of the Councell of <hi>Hippo,</hi> which containe more then fortie canons, are inserted neither into the Rapsodie, which begins with the Councell of <hi>Hippo,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends nothing that precedes it, nor in the thirtie three canons attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bured to the sixth Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> but are the wordes of the Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifier or Rapsodist, which remitts the readers to finde the Canons of the Councell of <hi>Hippo,</hi> to the former collections of the Councells. The third reason is, that in the quotation of the Councell, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The ninth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, that if this Rapsody had bene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>piled by the Fathers of the seaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> or anie other later; as the vse that is there made of the Canons at the seaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th of <hi>Carthage,</hi> &amp; other subsequent pieces do suppose, they would neuer haue forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tosett downe the extract of the sixt cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For with what colour should the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the seauenth Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which were made by the deputies that remained of the sixth Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> after the rest were dismissed, haue bene inserted into the Rapsody, &amp; the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the sixth councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which had bene made by the whole councell, not haue bene inserted? And it will not serue to saie that the sixth Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> is in an act a part: for so is the seauenth also which neuerthelesse is registred in the Rapsodie. Lesse will it auaile to saie that the Canons of the sixth Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> are inrolled in the Greeke Rapsody. For besides that the ancient &amp; originall Rapsody is the latine and not the Greeke, as it appeares amongst other meanes by the quotations of <hi>Cresconius,</hi> which answere to the numbers of the latine, and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:7769:169"/>
not or the Greeke; they are not inserted into the Bodie of the Greeke<note place="margin">Crescon. in Breuiar.

The tenth reason is, that if this Rapsody were a reading of diuers former Councells of <hi>Africa,</hi> which had bene made in a later Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell, there would haue bene in the same Councell some ordinance to reade them: as in the third Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And the causes of this doubt are, that whereas in the copie of the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Canons, the latine edition is much more correct then the Greeke, in the copie of the Epistles; contrarywise, the Greeke edition is very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and the latine most depraued and corrupt; and the corruptions are such: as seeme to proceede from the ambiguitie, and misunderstanding of the Greeke wordes: I will alleadge fiue patterns.</p>
               <p>The first patterne shall be taken from the Epistle to Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> where the Greeke text, speaking of the canons that Pope <hi>Zozimus</hi> had sent into <hi>Africa,</hi> vnder the title of the Canons of the Councell of <hi>Nicea,</hi> saith; <hi>These things haue bene rigistred in the Acts, till the more certaine Copies of the Councell of Nicea shall come, in which if they be couched in the same forme, as they are contained in the instruction, that our Bretheren haue shewed vs sent by the Sea Apostolicke, and that they be obserued in the same fashion by you in Italie, we will make no more mention thereof, nor further contest of the not suffering them:</hi> which is the true sence of the <hi>African</hi> Bishops, who had newly before be sought the Pope, that he would cause them to obserue in the like case, what should be found in the copies of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of <hi>Nicea,</hi> which should<note place="margin">Edit.

               </p>
               <p>The fourth aduertisement shall be, that it was not of sett purpose, and of the first designe, that the <hi>African</hi> Fathers moued the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie of the beyond-Sea Appeales of Bishops, but by accident, and in continuance of <hi>Apiarius</hi> his appeale. For the <hi>Africans</hi> had alwaies till then obserued this difference betweene Bishops and Simple Priests; that Bishops might Appeale beyond the Sea, and Priests not; as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, both by the declaration that saint AVGVSTINE made, That<note place="margin">Aug. ep. 162.</note> 
                  <hi>Cecilianus</hi> might reserue the definition of his cause, to the iudgments beyond Seas, because he was not of the number of simple Priests, or other inferior Clerkes, but of the number of Bishops; And by the testimonie he giues; that manie <hi>African</hi> Bishops, the Sea Apostolicke iudging them, or confirming the iudgments of others, had bene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued to the title of their Bishoprick without retayning the exercise thereof. And by the tacite exception of the order of Bishops, that the Fathers of the <hi>Mileuitan.</hi> Councell had sett into the decree of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales,<note place="margin">Concil. Mileuit. can. 22.</note> when they had ordained that the Priests Deacons and other inferior Clerkes, could not appeales to the Prouinces beyond the Sea. And therefore, when <hi>Apiarius</hi> Priest of the Church of <hi>Sicca</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> came to appeale beyond Sea, the <hi>African</hi> Bishops opposed themselues against it. And from thence by occasion, the question of Episcopall appeales, tooke, the originall, as an incident sett on the backe of an other affaire. For vpon this opposition, the Pope sent the <hi>Rule</hi> of the Councell of <hi>Sardica</hi> concerning appeales into <hi>Africa,</hi> which consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in two articles; whereof one treated of the Appeales of Bishops, and the other of the appeales of Priests. Now the Pope sent these two Canons in the qualitie of Canons of the Councell of <hi>Nicea,</hi> for as<note place="margin">Concil. Carth. 6. c. 3.</note> much, as the Councell of <hi>Sardica</hi> was an Appendix, and a supplie of the Councell of <hi>Nicea.</hi> The <hi>African</hi> Prelates then not finding the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Bishops Appeales in the copies of the Councell of <hi>Nicea,</hi> that they had with them no more then that of the Priests Appeales; And besides being much vexed with the frequent Appeales of Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops from their prouinces, besought the Pope to be pleased, that they might send into the <hi>East,</hi> to see if this <hi>Rule</hi> were to be found in the copies of the Councell of <hi>Nicea,</hi> which were kept in the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne</hi> Churches: and putting in compromise the Title, which was produced to them of that, which they had till then obserued by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, in regard of Episcopall Appeales, tooke occasion also to put the continuance of the custome to compromise; that is to saie, to contest, not only the Priests Appeales, but also to beeseeche the Pope to reiect, or more rarelie to receiue the Appeales of Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The sixth aduertisement shalbe, that whereas the <hi>African</hi> Fathers, did not perceiue that these Canons which they found not in the copies of the Councell of <hi>Nicea,</hi> were in those of the Councell of <hi>Sardica,</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened from this that the <hi>Donatists</hi> had suppressed in <hi>Africa,</hi> all the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the true Councell of <hi>Sardica,</hi> which had bene holden by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Bishops at <hi>Sardica,</hi> and had substituted in their steede the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the false Councell of <hi>Sardica;</hi> which had bene holden by the <hi>Arrians</hi> neere <hi>Sardica.</hi> For in the same tyme, when the three hundred Catholicke Bishops, which represented all the Catholicke Church, held their Councell at <hi>Sardica,</hi> where they confirmed the faith of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of <hi>Nicea,</hi> &amp; the absolution of S. ATHANASIVS; the seauentie <hi>Arrian</hi> Bishops which had seperated themselues from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, held their hereticall mock-Councell, which they falsely and impudently intituled, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Sardica,</hi> at <hi>Philippopolis,</hi> a cittie neere <hi>Sardica,</hi> where they condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Faith of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of <hi>Nicea,</hi> and the person of S.

Now it happened, that in the addresse of the Epistle of this false Councell of <hi>Sardica,</hi> the <hi>Arrians</hi> amongst the Bishops of their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, inserted the name of <hi>Donatus,</hi> Bishop of the <hi>Donatists</hi> of <hi>Carthage;</hi> for as much as this <hi>Donatus,</hi> besides the heresie of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> was<note place="margin">Socrat. hist.

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:7769:181"/>
the copies of the true Councell of <hi>Sardica,</hi> which had bene brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Gratus,</hi> Catholick Archbishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and to sowe in their steedes, the copies of the false Councell of <hi>Sardica,</hi> which had bene ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed to <hi>Donatus</hi> his competitor, and wrought so in it, that in the time, of saint AVGVSTINE, and of the sixth councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> as it shalbe heereafter proued by many places of S. AVGVSTINE, there were to be found in <hi>Africa,</hi> none of the copies of the true councell of <hi>Sardica,</hi> but only those of the false councell of <hi>Sardica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The seauenth Aduertisement shalbe, that the <hi>African</hi> Fathers, neuer went so farr as to make anie decision or anie decree vpon the Article of the Episcopall Appeales: contrarywise before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the copies fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>East,</hi> all their proceeding was to beseeche the Pope, to cause their<note place="margin">Concil. dict.

And after the copies had bene brought out of the East, so farr were they from making anie decree vpon the Article of the Bishops Appeales, as they hindred not those of Simple priests. For after the death of Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> vnder whom the copies of the <hi>East</hi> were brought into <hi>Africa, Apiarius</hi> being fallen into new crimes, for which he was againe condemned, by a Councell of <hi>Africa,</hi> and Pope <hi>Celestine,</hi> vpon a pretence of Appeale, hauing againe sent <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinus</hi> his Legate into <hi>Africa,</hi> to cause a newe Councell to be holden there, where <hi>Apiarius</hi> did not only forbeare to hinder it, but also to obay the Popes Bill of Appeale, assembled a new Councell, where, in his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates presence, <hi>Apiarius</hi> his cause was againe put to triall; and they did<note place="margin">Epist.

This<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> confession then, hauing renewed in the spirit of the <hi>Africans,</hi> the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the greeuances that they receiued by Appeales, which in steede of seruing, as they ought, for a shield for innocence, when the raynes were let too loose, serued for a Shield for incorrigibilitie and impunitie; they tooke occasion from thence to write an Epistle of<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> complaint to the Pope. But yet euen then they passed not so farr, as to make anie decree of the Episcopall appeales, but contained them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues within the simple lymitts of complaints, petitions, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrances. Which the Bishops of the Councell of <hi>Constantinople</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Trullian,</hi> that the Greekes call the sixth generall Councell,<note place="margin">Conc. in Trull. c. 2.</note> acknowledged when they said, <hi>wee receiue the Canons made by the holy Fathers assembled at Sardica and at Carthage;</hi> words which shewed plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they beleeued not the Councell of <hi>Sardica</hi> to haue bene disabled by the decrees of the Councell of <hi>Carthage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The eight and last aduertisement shall be, that the end &amp; issue of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire was, that after all these contentions, searches, and proceedings, the Pope remained in full and intire possession of the Right of the Episcopall Appeales of <hi>Africa,</hi> and that the <hi>Africans</hi> were satisfied, that what they hadnot found in the Councell of <hi>Nicea,</hi> was contained in the Councell of <hi>Sardica,</hi> whose Canons vpon this occasion, they inserted into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non law of their prouinces; and in summe that all the <hi>African</hi> Church continued and perseuered, in the practise of yielding Episcopall Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales to the Sea Apostolicke, and in the communion and obedience of the Pope, as long as Christianitie lasted in <hi>Africa:</hi> This is the history; <hi>Apiarius</hi> priest of <hi>Sicca,</hi> a cittie of the prouince of <hi>Numidia</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> after he had bene condemned, deposed, and excommunicated by the <hi>African</hi>

to the continuance of the sixth Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which had bene held three yeare before, as a foundling, without anie mention of the date or of the actes, or of the history of the Councell where it was written, as, because it was full of clauses, and cannot be compatible with the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the <hi>Africans,</hi> for it takes for a first foundation, that if the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Nicea</hi> excluded Priests from being to be adiudged by Appeale out of their Prouinces, the Bishops may by stronger reason be excluded. And the foundation of the <hi>Africans</hi> contrarywise in the question that they had against the <hi>Donatists</hi> was, that <hi>Cecilanus</hi> after he had bene depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Bishops of <hi>Africa</hi> might haue reserued the iudgment of his<note place="margin">Aug. epi. 162.</note> cause to the beyond sea Churches, for as much as he was not of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Priests or other inferior Clerkes; which the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of <hi>Nicea</hi>

                  <hi>Cecilianus</hi> assisted, could not be ignorant of. It takes for a second foundation that ecclesiasticalls condemned might appeale to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of their Prouince, yea euen to the generall Councell of all <hi>Africa</hi> which is manifestly against the history and discipline of the Councells of <hi>Africa,</hi> and principally for the inferior Clerkes, as Priests, deacons and Subdeaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For, the holding of the anniuersary Councells of all <hi>Africa,</hi> had bene suppressed twelue yeares before <hi>Celestine</hi> in the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell holden vnder the seauenth Consuslhip of <hi>Honorius;</hi> where it had bene ordained that the vniuersall Councells of <hi>Africa</hi> should no more be ordinary and anniuersary, and should no more be holden but for extraordinary and vniuersall causes. And that the causes that were not common, should be<note place="margin">Concil. dict. Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. c. 62.</note> iudged in their Prouinces; And that if there were an appeale, the appealant and the partie should choose Iudges, from whom it should not be lawfull to appeale. And finally, it takes for a third foundation, that there was no difference of priuiledge, betweene Clerkes of the Superior order, in the matter of passiue iurisdiction; and that the same which had bene ordained concerning the one, ought by a stronger reason, to haue place<note place="margin">Con. Car. 1. c. 1. &amp; ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. a.

For whereas the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Fathers inferr, that if the Councell of <hi>Nicea</hi> spake these words of Priests and Laymen, they must be much more intended of Bishops; this is formally opposite to saint AVGVSTINES foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who saith that <hi>Cecilianus</hi> tyme-fellowe with the Councell of <hi>Nicea,</hi> might haue appealed beyond Sea, because hee was not of the number of Priests and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior

Clerkes, but of the number of Bishops, <hi>They did not handle the cause</hi> (saith hee) <hi>of Priests, Deacons, or other inferior Clerkes, but of Bishops, which might reserue their causes to the iudgement of the churches beyond Sea.</hi>

But not for the iudgment of Bishops in the last instance, as appeares by the testimonie of saint ATHANASIVS, who had assisted in person at the Councell of <hi>Nicea,</hi> which alleadges for his defence an Epistle, where Pope <hi>Julius</hi> writes, that the Councell of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and other Councells of the <hi>East</hi> could not depose ATHANA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIVS from the Bishopricke of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> without expecting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision<note place="margin">Iul. ep. ad Eusebian apud A than.

                  <note place="margin">Aug. ep. 93</note> to themselues: <hi>Alwaies, and as often as matters of faith are handled, I conceiue that all our Bretheren and colleagues can haue no refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence but to Peter; that is to saie, to the author of their name and dignitie.</hi> The fourth, That it was very hard to assure beyond Sea iudgements, because of the difficultie of causing witnesses to passe the seas: <hi>How can</hi> (said they) <hi>the Iudgements beyond Sea be certaine, wherein the necessarie persons of witnesses for the debilitie of sexe of age, or manie other hindrances interuening cannot appeare?</hi> An euident Argument, that they spake of particular and personall causes. And the fifth that it had neuer bene taken from the <hi>African</hi> Church, by any decree of a Councell, that Appeales should goe out of <hi>Africa,</hi> and that to send Legats from <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>Africa</hi> to iudge them vpon the place, it was not constituted by any Councell: A thing the ignorance whereof they might well excuse, forasmuch as they had no more then in <hi>Africa,</hi> the true copies of the Councell of <hi>Sardica,</hi> but only as had bene aboue shewed those of the false Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Sardica,</hi> composed by the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and publisht by the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi> which gaue ground to all this question. The second request was, that the Pope should no more grante them clerkes executioners, so were certaine clerkes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church called committees, to cause to be executed (with the helpe of secular power, and of the imperiall forces; that is to saie, by the strength of Vshers, Sergeants, and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) the iudgements of the Pope or of his Legats; a thing which prouoked much murmure in <hi>Africa.</hi> For although the malice of the <hi>African</hi> Poeple, who after they were fastned in the hate of anie Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall person would hardlie lett goe their hold, did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes make this remedie necessarie; Neuerthelesse, the abuse of
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:7769:187"/>
those, which did too violently applie it, did often conuert it into a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and occasion of complaint, as S. AVGVSINE testifies in an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the same pope <hi>Celestine,</hi> when he saith speaking of <hi>Anthony</hi> Bishop of <hi>Fussala</hi> in <hi>Numidia,</hi> who had appealed to the Pope from the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<note place="margin">Aug. epi. 261.</note> which the inhabitantes of <hi>Fussala</hi> had caused to be giuen against him. <hi>He threatens them</hi> (saith hee) <hi>with secular power, and with the furie of souldiers, as if they should come to execute the iudgements of the Sea apostolike, in such sort as the miserable inhabitants being Christians and Catholiks feared more grieuous vsage from a Catholike Bishop, then they did when they were hereticks, from the lawes of the Emperors.</hi> For these causes then, the <hi>African</hi> Bishops besought the Pope, to grant no more Clerkes executors to those which demanded them; <hi>That you will not also</hi> (said they) <hi>send your clerks for executors to all those wich demaund them, nor permitt that wee should seeme to introduce the typhe or smoky meteor of the age into the Church of Christ, which propounds the light of simplicitie and the daie of humility to those that desire to see God.</hi> Calling the force and military violence with which those executors did exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the iudgements of the Sea Apostolike, <hi>Secular typhe;</hi> for this is that which the marriage of these two words, <hi>Typhe of the age,</hi> signifies; to witt, the furious and violent manner with which the worldly and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar powers were accustomed to cause themselues to be obeyed; as when the author of the life of <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> saith; That <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded nothing with the <hi>Typhe</hi> of secular dominion. And as when<note place="margin">Author. vit.

                  <hi>Monsieur le Feure</hi> a great Reader and Examiner of saint HILLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIES writings, causing a new fragment of the workes of the same saint HILLARY to be printed, doth iugeniouslie acknowledge the Councell of <hi>Sardica</hi> for a generall Councell in the preface of his Edition by these words; <hi>Athanasius approued his innocencie in the Synods of Alexandria, and of Rome, and in the Generall councell of Sardica.</hi>

               <p>The fourth Obiection is, that in the Code of the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Greeke<note place="margin">The fourth obiection, against the Canon of Appeales.</note> church, which was produced in the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> in the cause of <hi>Bassianus</hi> and <hi>Steuen,</hi> the Canons of the Councell of <hi>Sardica</hi> were not contained: to this obiection wee bring three answeres; the first, that there were two volumes of Canons produced in the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> the one where the Councells were sett downe in heades, and with the inscriptions of their titles and the particular number of their Canons, as appeares by the fourth and fifteenth act of the same Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> where the fourth and sixth Canons of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Nicea</hi> were read with the titles of the fourth and sixth Canons of the most holy three hundred and eighteen Fathers assembled at <hi>Nicea.</hi> And the third Canon of the Councell of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with the title of Synodicall of the second synod held by the hundred and fiftie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at <hi>Constantinople</hi> vnder <hi>Nectarius.</hi> And the other where the canons were annexed one after an other vnder a continued Cypher in the forme of a chaine and of a rapsody and without inscription of the titles of the Councells whence they were taken, and without distinction of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular number of the Canons of euery Councell, as appeares in the fourth and eleuenth act, where the third, forth, sixteenth, and seauenteenth Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Councell of <hi>Antioch</hi> were read vnder a simple quotation of Canon 84. 85. and 94. and 95. without anie mention neither of the title or of the particular cyphers of the Councell from whence they were taken. Now it is not of the volumes in heads where the Canons of the Councells were inserted with inscription and distinction of the titles of their Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cells, but of this rapsodie where the Canons were annexed one at the end of an other without inscription and distinction of the titles of their Councells, that the aduersaries to the Sea Apostolike speake: and therefore it is but the onely copie of this rapsodie that raiseth all this question. The second answere is, that there is noe proofe that euen in the copie of this rapsodie, the Canons of the Councell of <hi>Sardica</hi> are not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended with the Canons of the other Councells.

Contrariwise in regarde of Ecclesiasticall discipline, there were manie good things, and which had bene taken from the customes and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the former Church. And that if there were anie canon that hurt the policie of the church, it had bene corrected and medicined by the Councell of <hi>Sardica.</hi> But aboue all it is an impertinent thing to saie that the Bishops of the Councell of <hi>Antioch</hi> ordained by the first of their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, to obserue the canon of the great Councell of <hi>Nicea,</hi> concerning the daie of the celebration of <hi>Pasch;</hi> and so that they were not <hi>Arrians.</hi> For this Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of <hi>Nicea</hi> hauing bene holden as <hi>Eusebius</hi> testifies for two causes, the one to decide the controuersies of faith, and the other to reconcile the difference of the <hi>Pasch,</hi> the <hi>Arrians</hi> did imbrace ioyntlie with the catholickes the decree of the Councell of <hi>Nicea,</hi> concerning the obseruation of the <hi>Pasch</hi> &amp; reiected only that of the Faith: And therefore

               <p>The fowrth counterbattery is, that the greeke edition of the Canons of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of <hi>Sardica,</hi> is not a translation of the antient latine edition, which was curre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whether in the time of Pope <hi>Zosimus,</hi> or whether since, in the time of <hi>Dionisius Exiguus;</hi> but that it is a greeke edition, primitiue and originall, which was made in the councell itself, whereof (as holden vpon the confines betweene both empires) the Canons were publisht from the beginning in both tongues.

And indeede, that the vnitie of the Church depends not from the vnitie of the Empire but from the relation to a visible center of the Ecclesiasticall communion, it appeared sufficiently euen in the time of the greatest vnitie and extent of the Empire, when the Christians which were vnder <hi>Firmus</hi> King of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> vnder <hi>Mania</hi> Queene of the <hi>Sarazins;</hi> vnder <hi>Cosroes</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> states all distinct, yea the most part of the time, enemies to the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire: And after in <hi>Damascus</hi> and other neighbouring Prouinces vnder the Kings, of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garenians,</hi> did all agree in the vnion and communion of the Catholicke Church.

And therefore, as these two propositions, the faith of PETER walked vpon the waters, and the person of PETER walked vpon the waters, are both true, but in a different sence, for the faith of PETER walked vpon the waters causallie, as the Schooleme sare; that is to saie, it was the cause that the person of saint PETER walked there, and the person of saint PETER walked there trulie, properlie, and formallie; so these two propositions the Church was built vpon the confession of PETER, and the Church was built vpon the person of PETER, are both ioyntly true, but in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent sence; for the confession of PETER is the causall foundation of the Church, that is to saie, it is the cause for which the Church is built vpon the person of PETER, rather then vpon that of anie other Apostle, for as much as the primacie of this confession not proceeding nor preuented from or by anie humane instruction, but proceeding imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatlie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pure reuelation of God, the other Apostles being silent &amp; not knowing what to answere, was the cause, in fauour whereof Christ chose (preferring him before all others) saint PETER to constitute him the foundation of his Church. And the person of <hi>Peter</hi> is the formall foundation of the Church; that is to saie, him vpon whose ministrie, by preferring him before all others, Christ hath built and edified his Church. But the differenc of these two expositions is that the one is immediate and the other mediate; the one direct and the other collaterall; the one literall, and the other morall the one originall, and perpetuall, and the other accessorie and temporall; the one consigned from the beginning, and the other introduced by occasion.

                  <p>TO the tenth obiection which is, that S.

                     <note place="margin">Hebr. 5.</note> the other to exercise it in vnitie. For those that had exercised it out of vnitie had bene schismaticks, although they had true commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion<note place="margin">Opt. Mile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit. contr. Parm. l. 2.</note> and authoritie to exercise it. <hi>At Rome</hi> (saith <hi>Optatus Mileuitanus:) there hath bene placed a Chaire for Peter, that vnitie might bee preserued by all, least the other Apostles should attribut to euery one his owne.</hi> And againe; he repeateth the knowledge that sainct PETER had of the diuinitie of the Sonn of God; the promise that hee had made him, to die with him; and how he had thrice denied him; And adds: <hi>yet neuerthelesse, for the good of vnitie, he had not merited to be separated from the number of the Apostles.</hi> And a little after: <hi>They remained all innocent, and a Fisherman receiued
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:7769:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the keyes, that the negotiation of vnitie might be formed, &amp;c. without which thing, vnitie which is soe necessarie, could not bee.</hi> Now to preserue that vnitie, in which the internall and essetinall authoritie of the Apostleship ought to be exercised, it was necessarie first to haue a subiect, which should be as the center, the head, and roote, of this vnitie, and by relation and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence whereto all the colledge of the Apostles, and all the Bodie of the Church might be manitained in vnitie. For the thinges which are plurall by themselues, and are not one with locall vnitie, cannot without loosing their vndiuided pluralitie, be reduced to a visible vnitie, vnlesse by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to some thing, which by it self may be visiblie one. And secondlie, to maintaine this vnitie it is necessarie further, beside the internall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, essentiall to the Apostleship, there should be an other externall authoritie, and accessory to the Apostleship, which might haue the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendencie ouer the care of the preseruation of vnitie, to cause the Apostles to exercise their Apostleship in vnitie. And as the office of the cause is to rule his effect, he that should be the beginning and originall of this vnitie, should likewise haue the superintendencie ouer the rest, for what concernes the preseruation of vnitie; and by consequence, that to him should belonge, the supereminent iurisdiction ouer things necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the maintenance of vnitie; that is to saie, ouer things necessarie to preuent schisme, and hinder the disorder and confusion of the exercise of the ministrie; as are the distinction, and distribution, either mediat or immediate ofiurisdiction; the suspension &amp; limitation of the exercise of the ministrie, and other such like. Not that the Apostles for their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance in vnitie, had neede that the effect of this Authoritie should be practised so euidently ouer them as ouer their sucessors, because of the assistance that they had euery one in particular of the Spirit of God; but to the end to propound to the Church a forme and a modell of the order that she should keepe after their decease: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> as although there were noe neede of a Councell in the time of the Apostles, to decide questions of Religion whereof euerie particular Apostle might be informed with all fullnes and certaintie; neuerthelesse the holie Ghost would that they should vse this forme in the matter of legall things, to leaue it for a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne to the Church of the succeeding ages in like occurrences. It was then the internall authoritie, and essentiall to the Apostleship, which consisted in the power of reuealing matters of faith, with assurance of infallibilitie to make canonicall writings, to institute the first mission of pastors, remitt sinns, to giue the holy Ghost, and other the like, that saint CYPRIAN spake of when he said, that all the Apostles were indued with equall authoritie, and not of the externall authoritie and accidentall to the Apostleship, which was instituted to cause it to bee exercised in vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>

PETER in his propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had done two things; the one to declare the appellatiue name of our Lord, which is Christ, &amp; the other to explaine the sence and energy of the same name of CHRIST, in saying, <hi>Thou art Christ the Sonne of the liuing God.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the lawe of the Antithesis &amp; correspo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dencie wills, that not only our lord should declare the name that he had promised to giue him, in saying to him; <hi>Thou art Peter,</hi> but also should explaine the sence &amp; energy of this name in saying to him; <hi>and vpon this Rock I will build my Church.</hi> Which could not be vnlesse by the word <hi>Rock</hi> in this second clause there were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally vnderstood the person of S.

                  <p>THE third, that it had bene a thing extremely from the purpose, to haue made mention of the name of <hi>Peter,</hi> for the language that our Lord meant to speake to S. PETER, if by this clause, <hi>and vpon this Rock,</hi> he had not intended to speake of the person of <hi>Peter.</hi> For the word <hi>Rock</hi> hath no metaphoricall relation to the keyes, but to the building.</p>
                  <p>The fourth, that it had bene an inconstant grammaticall consequence, and euil knitt, to saie, <hi>And I declare to thee, that thou art Peter, and vpon this Rocke which is my self, I will build my Church: and I will giue to thee the keyes of the Kingdome of heauen.</hi> The fifth, that the connexion of the pronowne <hi>(this)</hi> with the repetition of the word <hi>(Petra)</hi> before exprest, sheweth that it is a relatiue pronowne, and whose relation is determined to the antecedent alreadie exprest; by meanes whereof this pronowne could not be diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the naturall vse of the relatiue, that the repetition of the antc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent giues it to an vse of a demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stratiue pronowne, but by the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an externall gesture of demonstration, either exprest in the text of the historie, or by the verie explication of the historian.

that it had not iustlie bene imposed vpon <hi>Absalon,</hi> From whence it ariseth that if our Lord in saying; <hi>Vpon this Rock I will build my Church,</hi> intended by the word <hi>Rock,</hi> the person of sainct PETER: he ment to make an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of approbation, but if hee intended his owne, he ment to make an allusion of translation, and consequently of correction. Now besides that it must be impertinent, that our Lord should make an allusion; of correction vpon a name imposed by himselfe, it is manifest that in hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable names, allusions of approbation and confirmation are in steede of complements and gratifications, and allusions of correction are in steede of reprehensions and chasticemets, Then to know whether our Lord did there meane to make an allusion of approbation, and by the word <hi>Rock</hi> intend the person of S. PETER, or to make an allusion of correction and translation, and by the word <hi>Rock</hi> intend his owne, there needes but to see, whether he meant by these words to cherish, gratifie, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence S, PETER, or to shake him vp and chastice him.

And against this ought not to be obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that S.

THOMAS to saie, that in metaphors the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is not so much regard to be had from whence they are take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as to what they are taken: and therefore although the word <hi>Rock</hi> sometimes signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, Christ in the scripture, it would neuerthelesse be a blinde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to will that wheresoeuer the scriptures vseth it, it should be inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of Christ. For sometimes the word <hi>Rock</hi> is imploied according to the relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the <hi>Rock</hi> of a quarry hath to the morcels of stone that are drawne out of it. And in this sence, <hi>Abraham</hi> is called <hi>Rock: Looke</hi> (saith <hi>Esaie vpon the Rock from whence you haue bene cutt; vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Abraham your Father;</hi> sometimes it is imployed according to the relation of the drynesse &amp; barennes that roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes<note place="margin">Esa. 51.</note> haue to the seede that is cast vpon them; and in this sence hard and<note place="margin">Luc. 8.</note> indocile partes are intended by the word <hi>Rock: Part of the seed</hi> (said our Lord) <hi>fell vpon the Rock.</hi> Sometimes it is imployed according to the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the stedfastnes and soliditie that <hi>Rocks</hi> haue in the buildings which<note place="margin">Matt. 16.</note> are founded vpon them; And in this sence our lord saith to S.

                     <hi>Rocks</hi> for their firmnes, rather then vpon other places. From whence it is, that the place where vpon the Temple of <hi>Delphus</hi> was built, was called the <hi>Delphian Rocks:</hi> and that the men of a certaine Cittie of <hi>Asia</hi> to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in the building of a Temple to the Emperor <hi>Tiberius,</hi> represented to him, that their cittie was situate vpon a Rocke. And therefore our lord intending to build his Church vpon S, PETER;
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:7769:212"/>
said to him according to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and the <hi>Syriacke; Thou art a Rock, and vpon this Rock I will build my Church.</hi> Sometymes it is imployed, according to the relation that <hi>Rocks</hi> haue to the sources and fountaines that spring from them; and in this sence the Apostle saith, <hi>They dranke of the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Rock which followed them, and that Rock was Christ.</hi> By meanes whereof, to inferr from this, that in these words, <hi>the Rock was Christ,</hi> when it is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the <hi>Rock</hi> referr'd to the water <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> sprang from it; Christ was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the word <hi>Rock;</hi> that heere, where it is spoken of the word <hi>Rock</hi> referrd to the metaphor of the ministeriall building of the Church, it should be necessarie to vnderstand it of the person Christ, and not of of that of saint PETER, were an inconsequent consequence. And it is not to be said, that in the parable of the man that built his howse vpon the rocke, by the word <hi>Rock;</hi> Christ is vnderstood, for the litterall sence of the word <hi>Rock</hi> in this place is noe other then to signifie a good and firme foundation; and that this is expounded of Christ, it is by allegorie. Now there is great difference betweene the litterall sence of places min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with metaphoricall termes, and the allegoricall sence. For from the litterall sence of places, mingled with metaphoricall termes arguments may be made, and consequences may be drawne from one passage to an other; and from the allegoricall sence, not. And then if sainct PAVL had said euen according to the relation, to the ministeriall building of the Church, <hi>the Rock was Christ,</hi> hath not our Lord vsually communicated his names to his ministers? And did not <hi>Iacob</hi> annoint the stone in <hi>Bethell</hi> in the figure of Christ, as prefiguring that Christ ought to be the stone whereof God prophecied by the mouth of <hi>Esay: Behold, I will set vp in Sion a Rock well founded:</hi> And neuerthelesse doth not the same <hi>Iacob</hi> saie, that <hi>Joseph</hi> was the Pastor and the <hi>Rocke</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> making vse of the word <hi>Euen</hi> in both of them? That is to saie, doth he not communicate by word, the same word <hi>Rock</hi> of <hi>Israell</hi> to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> that he had communicated by figure to Christ? And if they stagger about the difference which is betweene the word <hi>(Euen)</hi> &amp; the word <hi>(Tsur)</hi> or <hi>Petra,</hi> which signifies <hi>Rock,</hi> although <hi>Beza</hi> doe not distinguish it, when he translates; <hi>Thou shalt be called Cephas.</hi> which is interpreted, <hi>lapis.</hi> Doth not <hi>Tertullian</hi> write according to the vse euen of the word, <hi>Tsur,</hi> or <hi>Petra, He hath giuen to the dearest of his disciples to</hi>

                  <p>But against these decisions of the scripture and Fathers, there doe arise fowre obiections: The first that the word Church, doth grammaticallie signifie assemblie, and consequently that all assemblies are Churches, and so all Christian assemblies, are Christian Churches, Now this obiection is good in gramar, and to interpret prophane authors, but not in diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, nor to interpret christian Authors, amongst who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word Church hath noe more this vast and large Grammaticall signification as it had before. For as when <hi>Hormodius</hi> and <hi>Aristogiton,</hi> had freed the common wealth of <hi>Athens</hi> from the slauerie of the thirtie tyrants, the <hi>Athenian</hi> Senate to consecrate their names and to make them reuerenced to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie, ordained that from thence forward, they should neuer be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vpon, or communicated to anie other. Soe after our Lord had giuen to his Church, the priuiledge to conquer Hell, and to deliuer mankinde from the tyrannie and oppression of the deuill, that name is become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate and affected to her alone, and it hath bene forbidden to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate it, anie more to anie other Societie, either Paga, hereticall, or Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall. <hi>Let not the Conuenticles of hereticks</hi> (saith the fowrth Councell of <hi>Carthage) be called Churches, but Mock-Councells.</hi> And the verie lawe of<note place="margin">Conc.

                  <p>THE second, that S. PAVLE writing to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> calls their Societies, <hi>Churches;</hi> and neuerthelesse the <hi>Galatians</hi> erred in faith imbracing the circumcision with the Ghospell; and the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> in not beleeuing the Resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but the snare here is manifest. For there is great difference betweene the doctrine of a Church, and the doctrine of anie particular person, which is deuided from the doctrine of the same Church. The doctrine of a church is that which is held by the bodie of that Church, &amp; vnder the codition whereof either expresse or tacite, she receiues men into her comunion, &amp; not the doctrine which euery particular ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> straying fro the commo doctrine of the same church holdes against the opinions of the Bodie. Now it cannot be found that the Societie of the church of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did euer hold that the dead did not rise againe, nor that she had exacted that beleefe from those that entred into her communion; but onelie that amongst the <hi>Corinthians</hi> there were some that did not beleeue the resurrection of the dead: <hi>If Christ,</hi> (saith S. PAVLE) <hi>be preached to haue risen againe from the dead, how is it that there are some amongst you that saie, there is no resurrection of the dead?</hi> And that S. PAVLE, made his remonstrance in common, it was to hinder
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:7769:218" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them from being seduced by them which spake this language; <hi>Suffer not your selues</hi> (said hee) <hi>to bee seduced; euill words corrupt good manners.</hi> But not that he supposed they beleeued it; contrarywise hee exhorts them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine firme in that which they beleeued, <hi>And therefore my Bretheren</hi> (said hee) <hi>be stedfast and vnmoueable.</hi> And for the <hi>Galatians,</hi> soe farr off was it, that that error which sainct PAVL cryed out against was the doctrine of the Church of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> as it was the doctrine of those which rebelled against the faith of the Church of the <hi>Galatians;</hi> which doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne sainct PAVL disputes as if all the <hi>Galatians</hi> had imbraced it, not that they did doe soe, but to hinder them from doeing soe; as he testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to them in these wordes: <hi>I haue this confidence of you in our Lord, that</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. c. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>you will haue noe other beleefe, but that he that troubles you shall beare his iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement whosoeuer hee be.</hi> And againe, <hi>If a man be found in anie crime, doe you which are spirituall, instruct him in the spiritt of mildness.</hi> And that this is<note place="margin">Aug. ep. 48</note> the true intent of sainct PAVL, sainct AVGVSTINE teacheth vs when hee writes to <hi>Vincentius Rogatist: Thou might'st saie euen as well that manie of the Churches of Galatia were not when the Apostle cryed out. O foolish Galatians who hath bewitched you:</hi> And a while after; <hi>The Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall</hi>

HIEROME as spoken in his owne sence, which he spake according to the sence of his aduersary; that is to saie, according to the sence of the hereticke against whom he disputeth. For to this that some add, that a lying man, leaues to be trulie a man although he be not a true man; that is to saie, a veritable man, and then that a Church, leaues not to be truly a Church, although she be not a true Church, it is a Sophisme of the truth of the essence to the truth of the word, and of the word <hi>verus,</hi> to the word <hi>Verax,</hi> there being none so young a scholler, but knowes that to speake vniuocallie; whosoeuer is truly a man, is a true man, for as much as being, and truth, are conuertible, from whence it is that sainct AM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BROSE vseth these wordes, <hi>true Israelite, and trulie Israelite,</hi> as termes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiualent. And that sainct AVGVSTINE saith; <hi>Euerie soule is by that a soule, by which it is a true soule.</hi> And therefore as the Fathers affirme, that there is none but the Catholicke Church, that is a true Church. <hi>From thence,</hi> saith sainct AVGVSTINE, <hi>it appeares, that the true Church is concealed from noe bodie.</hi> Soe they also saie, that there is none but the Catholicke Church, that is truly a Church. <hi>If you did teach</hi> (saith sainct AVGVSTINE to the <hi>Manichees) that mariage were good, but virginitie better, as doth the Church, which is trulie the Church of Christ, the bolie Ghost had not predesigned you.</hi> And whereas it is replied, that a man for being lesse or more sound, leaues not to be a man: and soe that a Church for being lesse or more pure, leaues not to be a Church, it is an other manifest Sophisme, for health is not the essentiall forme of a man, nor sicknes the priuation of the essentiall forme of a man, but an accident which consequentlie may receaue more and lesse, whereas puritie of faith according to his maiesties owne confession, is the essentiall forme of the Church; and the impuritie of Faith, the priuation of the essentiall forme of the Church. By meanes whereof noe Societie can hold among the conditions of her Communion and doctrine impure in Faith, and contrarie to saluation, but shee looseth at the same time, the being and title of a Church. And therefore the diuersitie of the communions, whereinto the Church was deuided when <hi>Luther</hi> rose, must not be allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for a pretence to be ignorant where the true Church then was.

And in this sence saint AM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BROSE saith that his brother inquired if the Bishop of one of the citties of <hi>Sardica,</hi> where he desired to be baptised, consented with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Bishops, that is to saie, added hee, with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.

Not that the particular <hi>Roman</hi> Church, may not also in a certaine regard, be called Catholicke. For the word Catholicke is taken in three sortes, to witt, either formallie, or causallie, or participatiuelie. Formally the only vniuersall Church, that is to saie, the Societie of all the true particular churches, vnited in one selfe- same communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is called catholicke. Causallie, the <hi>Roman</hi> church is called Catholicke for as much as she infuseth vniuersalitie into all the whole bodie of the Catholicke church. That it is soe, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitute vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salitie, there must be two thinges, one that may analogicallie be insteede of matter thereto, to witt, the multitude; for where there is no multitude there can be noe vniuersalitie: And the other to be in-steede of forme thereto, to witt, vnitie; for a multitude without vnitie, makes noe vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersalitie: <hi>Take awaie</hi> (saith sainct AVGVSTINE) <hi>the vnitie from the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and it is a tumult, but bring in vnitie, and it is the people.</hi> And therefore<note place="margin">August. de verb.

And finallie particular Churches are called Catholicke, participatiuely, because they agree and participate in doctrine and communion with the catholicke Church.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale can not be without a cittizen, but in prioritie of nature; that is to saie, that the being of the cittizen dependes from that of the cittie, and not the being of the cittie, from that of the cittizen: from whence it appeares, that the forme that giues being in the first place to the cittie, and then by participation to the cittizen, must reside in the cittie, in the most perfect manner that it can reside, and not in the most imperfect. And soe although it suffice to preserue to a cittizen the being of a cittize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that in default of being able to participate actuallie in the communion of the common- wealth; as when he is hindred by anie locall obstacle, either of beeing in a strange prison, or remayning in a strange countrie, he commnicate there habituallie, and in desire, which is an imperfect manner of communicating; it sufficeth not that the communion where by the common wealth is framed and preserued in being, should be a simple habituall communion and in vowe; but it is necessarie that it should be a true and actuall communion. For when a Cittizen is hindred by anie locall impossibilitie from communicating actuallie with his Common wealth, he leaues not to preserue the being of a cittizen, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided that hee communicate therewith habituallie, that is to saie in vowe and in desire, and communicate not in a politicke communion with anie contrarie societie. But when the communion of the bodie of a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth comes to be dispersed, and that there is noe more anie comerce or actuall communion in the estate, then the common wealth is extinct and hath noe more being; and the communion that is habituall and in desire of the cittizens dispersed, and noe more communicating one with an other, cannot preserue it.

<pb n="418" facs="tcp:7769:223"/>
to saluation, in default of the other: Neuerthelesse the Church cannot be framed nor preserued, in the beeing of a Church, by a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion only habituall and in vowe, but by a reall and actuall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: The which as soone as it comes wholie to cease and to perishe in the Church, the Church perisheth, and ceaseth to be. And therefore this distinction of actuall communion, and communion in vowe, serues well to shewe, that anie one may be imputatiuelie in the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out participating actuallie in the visible communion of the Church; prouided, that this defect come from an imposibilitie of participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting therein actualie: but not to shew, that the bodie of the Church can subsist, and preserue the being and true title of a Church, without visible and actuall communion. For contrariwise, that this imperfect manner of being in the Church, serues to his saluation that is hindred by anie locall obstacle from being able to be there actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is because the true and actuall communion which as in the Church, is imputed to him by the desire that he hath to participate thereof, which could not be imputed to him, if it were not reallie some where; and besides, this desire of participation must be stript from all other impediments, sauing that which proceedes from lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and corporall imposibilities, in such sort, as all those which are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by distance of place, or other like obstacle ineuitable to them, from participating in the actuall communion of the Church cannot be said to communicate there in vow, nor to be there imputatiuely. For nothing dispenceth with men for communicating with the Catholicke Church onely in vow and in will, and not reallie and by effect, if it be not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of time and place, and besides in the article of death; noe more then anie thing can excuse a man from being baptised onelie in vow and in will, and not reallie and by effect; but the condition of being exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the impossibilitie of time and of place, and also in the Article of death from the meanes how to be baptised. And because, when the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle proceedes from externall impediments onely; &amp; that if there were local or temporall commoditie, he that communicates with the Church in vowe, would communicate therewith actuallie, this desire of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, may be imputed for true communion, and called a communion in vow. But when the obstacle proceedes from internall impediments from him that pretendes to communicate there in vow, as of repugnancie to the beleefe, and to the discipline, and the lawes, vnder the conditions whereof, the Catholick Church receiues into her communion those that she receaues thereinto, in such sort, as all corporall obstacles being taken awaie, and hee being in place where hee may assist at the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church, &amp; communicate with her, hee will not doe it; this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall desire of communicating with her, in case she would change the conditions of her communion, cannot be called communion in vowe, but discommunion; otherwise there would be no heretickes that would not communicate with the Catholick Church, for there is noe hereticke but would offer to communicate with her, prouided she would change the clauses and conditions of her communion, and would reforme her self to the conditions of his Sect. To communicate then in vowe with the Catholicke Church, is not to be hindred from communicating reallie therewith, by any obstacle proceeding from him that communicates the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewith in vowe; nor by anie condition that he reproues in the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cke Church, nor by being vnited in communion with anie other Sect, whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion is repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the doctrine of the Catholicke Church.

And then as this ecclipse according to them is ceased, and that they come to cast their eyes vpon anie companie which begins to hold visible, that which they beleeue their inuisible Church inuisiblie to haue held, then they constitute noe more but one Church and one communion of the visible Church, and of the inuisible Church.

                        </gap> c. 3</note> betweene the Catholicks and the <hi>Donatists,</hi> was to seeke the doctrine of<note place="margin">Ibidem</note> the Church in the scriptures; that is to saie, to examin by the scriptures the point of doctrine, which was contested betweene the Church and the <hi>Donatists;</hi> but to seeke the markes, and externall and visible characters of the Church in the scriptures; to the end, that the Church being discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by those markes, the truth of the doctrine contested, might be after knowne by the disposition of the Church. For the vnderstanding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it must be noted, that there were two questions betweene the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes and the <hi>Donatistes;</hi> the one, of the Bodie of the Church, to know on what party either of the Catholickes, or of them, the true societie of the Church resided: The other, of the doctrine of the Church; to witt, the which they, or the Catholickes held the true doctrine, concerning the Baptisme of heretickes. The first question then, which is, of the Bodie of the Church, saint AVGVSTINE wills it should be iudged by the scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re alone for as much as in the precise controuersie, wherein the question was, which of the two societies was the Church, the voice of the true Church cannot be discerned. But the second question, which is that of the doctrine contested betweene the Catholicks and the <hi>Donatists,</hi> he would haue it decided by the onlie deposition of the Church, as a faith full guardian and depositarie of the Apostolicke tradition. To seeke then according to saint AVGVSTINE betweene the Catholickes and the <hi>Donatists</hi> the Church in the Scriptures, was not to search the doctrine of the Church in the contentious points of Faith in the Scripture, but to seeke the visible markes and notes by which the Church ought to be exteriorly discerned in the Scripture. For the <hi>Donatists</hi> to proue that their Church was the true Church, and not the Catholicke Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged human actes, and human proofes, to witt, that the Catholicke Church had receaued into her communion, without anie expiation,

And saint AVGVSTINE contrariwise saith, that against all these words, which were human proofes and words; for if he that ordained <hi>Cecilianus,</hi> had deliuered vp the holy Bookes in persecution time, it was a thing to be proued by human testimonies, that is to saie, by actes of notaries and clerkes euen prophane; the Catholickes had the wordes of Christ, wherein the workes of the Church were described, to witt, that she ought to be visible, eminent, vniuersall, perpetuall, and that to examin the Church according to these markes it was to seeke her in the words of Christ: and to examine her according to the production of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> it was<note place="margin">Aug. de v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

is to denie, that in disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s against other heresies, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pointes are han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled which are heere esteemed to be expresselie treated of by the canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scriptures, but that hee often called vpon their iudgment. For who doubtes but that where the Scripture is cleere &amp; expresse, wee must haue recourse thereto? But wee said that he neuer thought, neither in generall that all things belonging to Religion, were treated off in scripture, nor in particular, that the contention betweene the Catholickes and the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists;</hi> concerning Baptisme, was of that quality. And wee maintaine, that for soe manie yeares, wherein hee combated with them about this article when there was que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stion of Searching the cause to the bottome, hee neuer produced one proofe out of Canonicall scripture. Indeede, he hath often alleadged places of Scripture, to make some approaches to it, and to beate downe certaine defences, to solue by scripture the arguments that the Donatists brought out of Scripture, to maintaine that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Church in the point contested was according to Scripture, in as much as <hi>(According)</hi> signifies not against the Scripture, to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie generall theses and preparatiues, to proue the propositions that had some simpathy and affinitie with that which hee disputed. As for example, he doth indeede proue by scripture, that what is sound<note place="margin">Aug. de Bapt. contr Donat. l. 2. 7.</note> and intire amongst heretickes, must not be repeated againe, when they returne to the Church; but that Baptisme is sound and intire amongst them, he doth noe were proue by Scripture.

receiued the keyes, and the authoritie, to remitt sinnes, that this can subsist amongst hereticks, who haue neither faith nor guift from heauen, nor the holie Ghost: you can neuer finde that in soe maine yeares as saint AVGVSTINE the principall opposite and ouerthrowe of this heresie hath contested her, he hath neuer manifested, nor could hee, nor he hath not pretended to proue by anie passage of Scripture, but by the only vnwritten traditions of the Apostles, and the generall practise and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall attestation of the Church. <hi>Wee must</hi> (saith hee) <hi>obserue in these thinges what the Church of God obserues; The question now betweene you and vs is, which of yours or ours, is the Church of God.</hi> And againe; <hi>Wherefore, although in truth there be noe example to be produced of this out of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>this custome ought to be beleeued to haue taken the originall there of, from their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as there are manie thinges which the vniuersall Church obserues, and which are therefore, not without cause beleeued to haue bene commaunded by the Apostles, although they be not written.</hi> From whence, the contrarie appeares to what his maiestie pretends to inferr from this passage; to witt, that the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture only destitute of the vnwritten Apostolicke tradition, cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidè all pointes of Faith, nor refute all heresies. For the point in agitation betweene the Catholicks and the <hi>Donatists</hi> concerning the truth &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the baptisme giuen by hereticks, was a point of faith, and wherein obstinate error would make an heresie. The proofe of this is, first that the doctrine of Baptisme importes so much to the faith, as where there is noe true baptisme, there is noe true Church: S, PAVL teaching vs, <hi>that</hi>

And if the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks erre in approuing the baptisme of heretickes, and in not rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe them when they came to them, they sinned against the Faith of the necessitie of Baptisme for the constitution of the Church, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently had noe Church.

The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that this marke to discerne the Church, he giues not to those, that are alreadie preoccupated with the opinion of anie of the Christian sects but to the Pagans which were not anticipated with passion, for anie of the parties that combated about the pointes of Christs diuinitie, and for this reason might seeme to iudge the more impartiallie. The third, that sainct CHRYSOSTOMES ayme is not to treate seriouslie there, of the markes of the Church with the Pagans, but to stopp their mouthes; and to shew, that whereas they said, that they would turne Christians, but that they knew not on which part to range themselues: these were but pretences, and not true language. The fowrth, that hee stopps not there, but acknowledging that this meanes, because of the subtletie and shiftes of hereticks, is not sufficient, requires and exactes an other, that is to saie, that hee reduceth in the last in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, all the summe of the question, to this point; that, that is the true Church which hath remained stedfast and immutable in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and from whence all the others are gone forth, and that came forth from none. <hi>A Pagan</hi> (saith hee) <hi>comes and saith, I would turne Christian,</hi>

Now the condition which concernes the character, which we will heere call sacramentall mission, may well be preserued out of the Church, for as much as the character cannot be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, and consequently may be giuen, though vnlawfullie, yet reallie out of the Church, by them that haue carried it out of the Church. But that which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernes authoritie, which wee will call, notwithstanding the barbarisme of the word, authoritatiue missio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be giuen in the Church without the other, yet it cannot be carried awaie nor giuen with the other out of the Church, and may be taken awaie by the Church from them, to whom she hath giuen it, when she shall iudge it necessarie to depose or degrade them. As the Councell of <hi>Sardica</hi> deposed <hi>Narcis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, Menophantus,</hi> and others, who notwithstanding, left not to preserue the character of the sacrament euen as the officers of a prince, when they ioyne themselues with a faction of rebells, may carry with them the Seale and the character of the Patent of their offices, and preserue it out of the state, and out of the common wealth; but they cannot carrie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And therefore, when they that haue bene degraded by the Church, or ordained out of the Church returne to the Church, the lawfull authoritie to exercise their function must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to them, either by a particular rehabilitation, or by a publicke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration that the Churches makes to receaue them into her communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the exercise of their charges, which serues them for a generall reha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitation: As when the <hi>Arrians</hi> returned to the Catholicke faith, the Church restored to their Bishops, the lawfull authoritie to administer the Bishop ricks whereof the ecclesiasticall lawes had depriued them, and rehabilitated them all at once, by the publicke declaration that she made to admitt them with the function of their charges. From whence it appeares, that they that are ordained out of the Church, and by an other societie then by the true Church, although they be indeede Bishops as for the Character of the Sacrament, neuerthelesse, they are not Bishops, as for the function of authoritie; and as manie times as they shall pretend to vse their authoritie without being rehabilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Church, soe often they commit sinn and sacriledge. <hi>Let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</hi> (saith S.

of hereticks who haue drawne their character from the Church, be not Bishops, as for the impression of the character, but that they are none as for the imposition of the authoritie. By meanes whereof, the <hi>English</hi> Bishops can pretend noe Episcopall succession from the Church of the antient Fathers, as for the succession of authoritie, for as much as if the Catholicke Church which was in <hi>England</hi> and in other places, when king <hi>Henry</hi> the eigth came to the crowne, were not the true Catholicke Church, the Bishops of the Catholicke communion, were not true and lawfull Bishops, as concerning authoritie, but only as concerning the character; and by consequence neither had themselues the succession of Episcopall authoritie, nor could transmitt it to those that haue taken it from them. <hi>By what right</hi> (saith sainct ATHANASIVS speaking of the <hi>Arrians) can they be Bishops, if they haue bene ordained by those men, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues doe slander with heresie?</hi> And contrariwise if the Church that was at the beginning of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eigth throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> and in manie other partes of the world, were the true Church, this selfe-same Church, hauing disannulled the episcopall authoritie in those from whom the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> at this daie pretend to haue had their mission, and hauing deposed and anathematized them, they had no more lawfull episcopall authoritie &amp; by conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce could not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferr it to others. And besides, if that Church were the true Church, the English Church at this daie which is gone out from her communion, can not be so, nor preserue in her the succession of Episcopall authoritie, which cannot be transferred out of the Church. And for the succession of the character, the <hi>English,</hi> according to their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, can in noe secte pretend to it; for they hold not (&amp; if they would hold, they cannot doe it; for as much as they make profession to agree in the faith &amp; in the sacraments with the Protestants of <hi>France)</hi> that order conferrs anie other thing then authoritie, nor that it imprints anie sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall character, which is that only, which in mission can be transferred &amp; giuen out of the Church. And so if by their doctrine they could haue the succession of the character, they are fallen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right of making vse thereof. For they communicate with the Puritans of <hi>France,</hi> &amp; hold their sheepe for true sheepe, and so their pastors for true pastors, and for their colleagues and fellowe bretheren. Now the ministers of <hi>France,</hi> are not ordained by anie Bishops, and so are noe Bishops, <hi>For hee</hi> (saith sainct<note place="margin">Cypr. ad Magn. ep. 76</note> CYPRIAN) <hi>cannot be a Bishop, who succeeding no bodie, hath bene ordained of himselfe:</hi> And not being Bishops haue noe Church, since as saith the same sainct CYPRIAN, <hi>The Church is in the Bishop, and the Bishop in the</hi>

I add to that, that to shew a Church to be successiuelie and representatiuely the antient Catholicke Church, it sufficeth not to shew that a part of that Church deriueth the personall successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of her Bishops from the missio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the antien Catholicke Church but all the Church that will prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the tittle of catholike, must haue the successio of her Bishops deriued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And finallie I saie, that since in all questions of Schismes wee must mount vp to the originall, following these wordes of saint AV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GVSTINE to the <hi>Donatists: The question betweene you and vs is, where the Church of God should be; wee must then begin at the originall, why haue you made a schisme:</hi> The accompt that the <hi>English</hi> Church will yeeld of the succession of her Bishops, ought to be brought to the originall of the Schisme. Now therevpon I will aske his Maiestie, where the first, after the rising vp of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> began in <hi>England</hi> to separate themselues from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church, to imbrace other forme of Religion which they now hold, where was this Societie, wherein there was together to be found, both the succession of Bishops vninterrupted from the first, and the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of doctrine? For to goe out from the Church, then intituled Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke, they must range themselues to an other Church, which must haue true doctrine, and true ministrie by adherence ad communion, to the which they might preserue the title of Catholicke, and transmitt it to those that should come after them. Now where was then this Societie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the true doctrine, and the true succession of Bishops, when the <hi>English</hi> first separated themselues from the Church intituled Catholike?

                  <p>THERE is great difference betweene similitude of doctrine, and succession of doctrine: Similitude of doctrine is a simple reporte of agreement betweene one doctrine &amp; an other; but the succession of doctrine properly take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is a deriuation of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

For as the fire of the high places, was indeede one in similitude with that which came downe from heauen to serue for a beginninge to the fier of the mosaicell sacrifices, but not one in vnitie of Succession, there being but the only fier preserued for this effect in the Altar of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> whicb was one in vnity of Succession with that: Soe a subsequent doctrine, may well be one in vnitie of Similitude with a precedent doctrine without anie flux of continuance to haue bene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them: but a Subsequent doctrine cannot be one in vnitie of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession with a preceding doctrine if it haue not bene deriued from it by a perpetuall channell of instruction, and by an vninterrupted traine of teachers and persons taught, which is that, that the Fathers as wee haue elswhere shewed; call consanguinitie or genealogie of doctrine; to witt a propagation of doctrine, deriued without interruption from Father to sonne, as by a tree of consanguinitie; euen as children are deriued by a perpetuall traine of generation, from their Fathers, from their Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, and from their great Grandfathers blood.

it hath bene a new refection and re-edification of the Church. For noe Societie in whose faith there is an auersion from Christ, and from the ancient Catholicke beleefe, can possesse the beeing and the name of a Church.

And consequently, that it was noe more necessarie to obtaine the title of Catholicke, and the participation of Saluation. to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with her but contrariwise was necessarie to be seperated from her and not to commnnicate with her.

                  <p>AND euen this confirmes our intention, to know that there is at this daie noe Catholicke Church; a thing directly against Gods promises, or that this that wee haue, is shee.

continuance, cannot be the same Church. For what Aristotle saith of Common-wealths, may also be said of the Church; to witt, that when a common-wealth hath interrupted the successiue continuance of her being, it is noe more one common wealth in number, but an other common-wealth. Soe if the antient Catholicke Church hath interrupted the successiue continuance of her beeing, she is noe more one, and not being one, shee is noe more a Church, for the Church is one or none. And therefore the Fathers cry out, that if the Church be once perished, she can noe more, be borne againe. <hi>If in</hi> S. CYPRIANS <hi>time</hi> (saith saint AVGVSTINE) <hi>the Church perished; from what Heauen it Donatus fallen? from</hi>

                     <hi>what Sea came hee forth? what earth hath sprunge him vp?</hi> For to saie that the <hi>English</hi> Church accounts not her separation from the faith and from the<note place="margin">Donat. l. 3. c 2,</note> discipline of the Pope, a defection from the antient Catholicke faith, but a returne to the antient Catholicke faith, and a conuersion to Christ, is not the question, viz. whether the <hi>English</hi> Church be conuerted to the antient Catholicke Faith. For as it hath bene aboue shewed, the name of catholicke, is not a name of simple beleefe, but of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion. By meanes whereof, the <hi>English</hi> Church might haue all Faith: euen to the remouing of mountaines, yet if she communicated not with the Catholicke Church she could neither obtaine the title of Catholicke, nor the reward of life eternall; but should be schismaticall, and excluded from saluation. And therefore the state of the question in this which is presented, is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>English</hi> Church be return'd to the true faith, but whether the Church which possesseth at this daie the name of the Catholicke Church hath lost the being of the Catholicke Church; which she cannot haue done if in things important to saluation, and constructiue or destructiue to the being of a Church, she haue not varied from that of the time of the fowre first Councells, which wee on both sides confesse to haue bene the true Church, that is to saie, if she haue not taken awaie from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the Church of those ages some thing necessarie to saluation, and without which saluation cannot be obtained; or if she haue not added to the practise of that Church something repugnant to saluation, and with which life eternall cannot be obtained. From whence it appeares, that the office of the <hi>English</hi> Church in this question, is to shew, not that she hath returned to the ancient Faith, which would alwaies exact the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of a preceding dispute, to witt that the Church from whence she went out, hath diuerted her selfe from it; for the proofe of the auersion should precede the proofe of reuersion: but that the Church which wee at this daie intitle Catholicke hath soe diuerted her selfe from the faith of the Church of the time of the fowre first Councells, which both they and wee hold to haue bene the true Church, as she hath lost being and the iust title of a Church, and that saluation can noe more be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in her. And our office is contrariwise to maintaine, that the Church which is at this daie, differs not in anie thinge that can destroy saluation, and make her loose the beeing and the title of a true Church, from the ancient Catholicke Church, and that all the points that our Aduersaries obiect against vs, as such, and for which they take occasion to separate themselues from vs, vnder pretence that in our communion Saluation cannot be obtained, haue bene holden by the ancient Church.</p>

But whether all thinges that they obiect to vs as repugnant to saluation, and as occasions sufficient to cause separation from our communion, haue bene holden by the Catholicke Church from the time of the first fowre Councells.

The first du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the which man liues onlie the life of plantes, and is yet touched with noe other instinct then simple appetite, which the Philosophers call na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, common to herbes aud trees, which seemes to correspond to the condition of the first period of the Church, wherein she had yet noe lawe or rule, but the simple lawe of nature. The second, during which he liues an animated and sensitiue life, which is proportioned to the state of the people of the <hi>Jewes;</hi> because as man in this second progresse, harh noe other knowing facultie but that of the sence, which is common to him with beastes; so all the obiects which were manifestlie propounded to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and all the promises which were literallie made to them, were of sensible thinges. And the last, wherein man takes possession of the life trulie human and reasonable, and is adorned and enobled with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall knowledge, which hath analogy with the state of the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church, where the faithfull are consecrated to God by a perfect &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full forme of religion, and sticke noe longer in terrestriall and materiall obiectes; but exalting their thoughtes and their hopes, doe nourish &amp; intertaine themselues with spirituall and incorruptible promises.
