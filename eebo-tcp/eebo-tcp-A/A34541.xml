            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The names of Unity and Schism should be rightly applied. True Church-Unity is the Unity of the Spirit; what is included therein. True Unity is primarily of the Church in its mystical, secondarily in its visible state. Holy love is the Life and Soul of this Unity. Church-Unity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in three points. 1. In the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials and all weighty matters of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith and Life. 2. In the essentials and integrals of Church-state. 3. In the accidentals of Religion. The different value of these different points of Unity. The Rule of Unity is Gods Word. Of the Scriptures sufficiency as a Rule thereof. Of things left to human determination, with the Pastors and Magistrates Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est therein. The Rulers Wisdom in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the right bounds of Unity. The burden of things unnecessary not to be laid on the Churches. Unity of external order is subservient to Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Schism truly so called.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>Schism is the violation of the Unity of the Spirit. Separation and Schism are not of equal extent. The violation of holy Love is the root of Schism. Schism lies primarily in a breach made upon the Unity of the Church as mystical, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily as visible. The highest point of Schism against the Church as visible, is that which is about the essentials and weighty matters of Christian Faith and Life. How both Persons and Churches may be guilty of it. The next point of Schism is about the essentials and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grals of Church state. This may be either against the Catholick or a particular Church; Instances of both kinds. The lowest point of Schism is about the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentals of Religion. How any are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or not guilty in this point. A prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous valuation made of the aforesaid different points, tends to Schism. The setting of other bounds of Unity, than Gods word allows, is to make a breach upon it. Terms of Unity may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

of God as to the Submitters, when they are not allowed as to the Imposers. The danger of acting against conscience rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally doubting. Tis a false Unity that is set up to the hindrance of Faith and Holiness; and not to adhere to it is no Schism but Duty; Instances hereof. Of the right of drawing together into new Congregations on such occasion. What endeavour of Reformation is unlawfull to Subjects. A difference between ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical separation and amicable necessary Segregation. The objected inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces against the amicable Segregation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. The import of the Text,</hi> Rom. 16. 17. <hi>opened.</hi>

            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Church is a Spiritual Common-wealth, which according to its primary and invisible State is a Society of regenerate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who are joyned to the Lord Christ their Head, and one to another as fellow Members by a mystical Union through the Holy Spirit, and are justified, Sanctified, and adopted to the inheritance of Eternal Life; but according to
<pb facs="tcp:105678:6"/>
its secondary and visible state, it is a Society of Persons professing Christianity or Regera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and externally joyned to Christ, and to one another by the Symbals of that Profession, and made partakers of the external priviledges thereunto belonging.</p>
            <p>There is one Catholick Church, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the invisible Form, is the whole company of true Believers throughout the World; and according to its visible Form, is the whole company of visible Believers throughout the World, or Believers accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to human judgment.</p>
            <p>This Church hath one Head and Supream Lord, even Christ, and one Charter and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem of Laws; the Word of God and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that are free Denizons of the whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and one Form of Admission or solemn Initiation for its Members, and one kind of Ministery and Ecclesiastical Power.</p>
            <p>This Church hath not the power of its own Fundamental Constitution, or of the Laws, and Officers, and Administrations intrinsecally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it, but hath received all these from Christ its Head, King and Lawgiver, and is limited by him in them all. Nevertheless, it hath according to the capacity of its acting, that is, according to its several parts a power of making Secondary Laws or Canons, either to impress the Laws of Christ upon its Members, or to regulate circumstantials and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105678:6"/>
accidentals in Religion, by determining things necessary in <hi>genere,</hi> not determined of Christ in <hi>specie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Scripture sets forth one Catholick Church, so also many particular Churches, as so many Political Societies distinct from each other, yet all compacted together as parts of that one ample Society, the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>Each of these particular Churches have their proper Elder or Elders, Pastor or Pastors, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving authority of teaching and ruling them in Christs name. An Ecclesiastical Order of Presbyters or Elders, that are not Bishops, is not found in holy Scripture. For all Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or Elders, being of a sacred Order in the Gospel Church that are any where mentioned in Scripture, are therein set forth as Bishops truly and properly so called, and are no where set forth as less than Bishops. These Elders or Bishops are Personally to Superintend all their Flock, and there is no grant from Christ to discharge the same by Delegates or Substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</p>
            <p>A distinction between Bishops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and a Superiority of the former over the latter, was after the Scripture times ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and generally received in the Christian Church. Yet it was not a diversity of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or Offices essentially different, but of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in the same Office, the essential nature whereof is in both. The Bishop of the first
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105678:7"/>
Ages was a Bishop not of a multitude of Churches, but of one stated Ecclesiastical So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety or single Church, whereof he was an immediate Pastor; and he performed the work of a Bishop, or immediate Pastor towards them all in his own Person, and not by Delegates and Substitutes; and he governed not alone, but in conjunction with the Presbyters of his Church, he being the President.</p>
            <p>Though several Cities in the same King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom have their different municipal Laws and Priviledges according to the diversity of their Charters, yet particular Churches have no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Laws and Priviledges diverse from each other, but the same in common to them all, because they have all the same Charter in <hi>specie</hi> from Christ. Therefore each of them have the same power of Government within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And the qualifications requisite to make men Members or Ministers of the Universal Church, do according to Christs Law suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently qualifie them to be Members or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of any particular Church, to which they have a due and orderly call.</p>
            <p>Local, presential Communion in Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, being a main end of erecting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, they should in all reason consist of Persons, who by their cohabitation in a vicinity are capable of such Communion, and there may not be a greater local distanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A Bishops Church was anciently made up of the Christians of a City or Town, and the adjacent Villages, who might and did Personally meet together, both for Worship and Discipline.</p>
            <p>All Christians of the same local Precinct are most conveniently brought into one and the same stated Church, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d invariable, but if there be some insupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable impediment thereof, the partition must be made as the state of things will admit.</p>
            <p>No Bishop or Pastor can by Divine right or warrant, claim any assigned circuit of Ground as his propriety for Ecclesiastical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as a Prince claims certain Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories as his propriety for Civil Government; so that no other Bishop or Pastor may without his Licence, do the work of the Ministery, in any case whatsoever within that Circuit.</p>
            <p>It is not the conjunction of a Bishop or Pastor with the generallity or the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the People, that of it self declares the only rightfull Pastor or true Church within this or that Circuit. For many causes may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and justifie the being of other Churches therein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105678:8"/>
Seeing particular Churches are so many integral parts of the Catholick Church, and stand in need of each others help in things that concern them joyntly and severally, and they have all an influence on each other, the Law of Nature leads them to Associations or Combinations greater and lesser, according to their capacities. And the orderly state that is requisite in all Associations, doth naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire some regular Subordination in the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts thereof, either in way of proper au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or of mutual agreement. And the Associated Churches and particular Members therein, are naturally bound to maintain the orderly state of the whole Association, and to comply with the Rules thereof, when they are not repugnant to the Word of God.</p>
            <p>A Bishop or Pastor and the People adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, are not declared to be the only true Church and Pastor within such a Precinct, by their conjunction with the largest Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Bishops or Pastors and their Churches. For the greater number of Bishops may in such manner err in their Constitutions, as to make rightly informed Persons uncapable of their Combination.</p>
            <p>A National Church is not a particular Church properly so called, but a Combination or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agmentation of particular Churches, united under one Civil Supream, either Personal as in a Monarchy, or Collective as in a Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
<pb facs="tcp:105678:8"/>
And the true notion thereof lies not in any Combination purely Ecclesiastical and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal, but Civil and Extrinsecal, as of so many Churches that are collected under one that hath the Civil Supremacy over them. The National Church of <hi>England</hi> truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes all the Churches in <hi>England</hi> united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Supream Civil Church-Governour, the Kings Majesty.</p>
            <p>Civil Magistrates as such, are no Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive parts of the Church. The Christian Church stood for several Centuries without the support of their authority. But Supream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates have a Civil Supremacy in all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical matters, and a political, extrinsecal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy over all the Pastors of the Churches in their Dominions, and may compell them to the performance of their Duties, and punish them for negligence and mal-Administration; and they may reform the Churches, when they stand in need of Reformation.</p>
            <p>The possession of the Tithes and Temples doth not of it self declare the true Pastor and Church, nor doth the Privation thereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare no Pastor and no Church. For these are disposed of by the secular power, which of it self can neither make, nor make void a Pastor or Church.</p>
            <p>A Diocess is a collective body of many Parishes under the Government of one Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan. If the several Parishes be so many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Bishops. If the Parishes be not a knowledged to be Churches, nor their Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters to be realy Bishops or Pastors, but the Diocess be held to be the lowest Political Church, and the Diocesan to be a Bishop of the lowest rank, and the sole Bishop or Pastor of all the included Parishes; I confess, I have no knowledge of the Divine right of such a Church or Bishop, or of any precept or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent thereof in Scripture. For every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church mentioned in Scripture was but one distinct stated Society, having its own proper and immediate Bishop or Bishops, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or Elders, Pastor or Pastors, who did Personally and immediately Superintend over the whole Flock, which ordinarily held either at once together, or by turns Personal, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Communion with each other in Gods Worship. But a Diocess consists of several stated Societies, to wit, the Parishes which are Constituted severally of a proper and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Presbyter or Elder having cure of Souls, and commonly called a Rector, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb facs="tcp:105678:9"/>
which are his proper and immediate charge or cure. And the People of the Diocess do not live under the Personal and immediate over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of their Diocesan, but under his Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates and Substitutes. Nor do they ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold Personal present Communion with each other in Gods Worship, either at once together or by turns. Nevertheless, which way soever a Diocess be considered, I have nothing to object against submission to the Government of the Diocesan, as an Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Officer established by the Law of the Land under the Kings Supremacy.</p>
            <p>There is nothing in the nature of the Office of Presbyterate (which according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a Pastoral Office) that shews it ought to be exercised no otherwise than in Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to a Diocesan Bishop. Christ, who is the Author and only proper giver of all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Authority in the Church, hath not so limited the said Office, and men cannot by any act of theirs enlarge or lessen it as to its nature or essential state, or define it otherwise than it is stated of Christ in his word.</p>
            <p>No power Ecclesiastical or Civil can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge any Minister of Christ from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of his Ministery in those circumstances, wherein Christ commands him to exercise it, nor any Christians from those duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to which the Command of Christ ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105678:10"/>
As the Magistrate is to judge what Laws touching Religion are fit for him to enact and execute, so the Ministers of Christ are to use a judgment of discretion about their own Pastoral acts; and all Christians are to do the same about their own acts of Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. The too common abuse of the judgment of discretion cannot abrogate the right use thereof, it being so necessary that without it men cannot act as men, nor offer to God a reasonable Service.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of true Church-Unity.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WHen the names of Unity and Schism are by partiality and selfishness com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and grosly abused and misapplied, the nature of the things to which those names do of right belong, ought to be diligently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, and clearly and distinctly laid open. For a groundwork in this inquiry I fix upon two very noted texts of Scripture. The one is <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3. Indeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace. The other is <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17. Mark them that cause Divisions and Offences contrary to the Doctrine that ye have learned, and avoid
<pb facs="tcp:105678:10"/>
them. The former guides us to the knowledge of true Church-unity, and the latter shews us the true nature of Schism.</p>
            <p>By the former of these Texts, all Christians are obliged to maintain that Spiritual Unity, which they have one with another under Christ their Head, by the Holy Ghost in all due acts of holy Communion in Peace and Concord. Several important things are here to be taken notice of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a Spiritual unity between all Christians in the form of one mystical Body, as there is a natural unity between all the members of the natural Body. The members being many are one body and members one of another. 2. This Unity is under Christ as the Head of it. What the head is to the natural Body, that is Christ and much more to his mystical Body the Church. 3. This Unity of Christians one with another under Christ, is by the Holy Ghost, and therefore called the Unity of the Spirit. The Spirit of Christ the Head, doth seize upon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side in all the Faithfull, by which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Christs mystical Body, and are joyned one to another as fellow-members. 4. This Unity of the Spirit among Christians is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed, maintained, and strengthened by their holy communion of Love and Peace one with another, but is darkened, weakened, and les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened by their uncharitable Dissentions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105678:11"/>
Hence it is evident that the Unity here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, is primarily that of the Church in its internal and invisible State, or the Union and Communion of Saints, having in themselves the Spirit, and Life, and Power of Christianity. Tis the unity of the Spirit we are charged to keep in the bond of Peace. But concord in any external order with a vital Union with Christ and holy Souls, his living members, is not the unity of the Spirit, which is to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the same new Nature and Divine Life. Secondarily, it is the Unity of the Church in its external and visible State, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent and subservient to the internal, and stands in the profession and appearance of it, in the professed observation of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties arising from it. Where there is not a credible Profession of Faith unfeigned and true Holiness, there is not so much as the external and visible Unity of the Spirit. Therefore a sensual Earthly generation of men, who are apparently lead by the Spirit of the World, and not by the Spirit that is of God, have little cause to glory in their adhering to an external Church order, whatsoever it be.</p>
            <p>Holy love, which is unselfed and impartial, is the Life and Soul of this unity, without which it is but a dead thing, as the Body without the Soul is dead. And this love is the bond of perfectness, that Cement, that holds altogether in this mystical Society.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105678:11"/>
For this being seated in the several members, disposeth them to look, not to their own things, but also to the things of others, and not to the undue advancement of a Party, but to the common good of the whole Body. Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wants this love, hath no vital Union with Christ and the Church, and no part in the Communion of Saints. The Church is much more ennobled, strengthened, and every way blessed by the Communion of holy love among all its living members, or real Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, than by an outside uniformity in the minute circumstances, or accidental modes of Religion. By this love it is more beautifull and lovely in the eyes of all intelligent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, than by outward pomp and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or any worldly splendor.</p>
            <p>The Unity of the Church as visible, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Catholick or particular, may be cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in a three-fold respect, or in three very different points. The first and chief point thereof, is in the essentials and all weighty matters of Christian Faith and Life. The second and next in account is in the essentials and integrals of Church state, that is, in the Christian Church-Worship, Ministery and Discipline, considered as of Christs insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and abstracted from all things super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added by men. The third and lowest point is in those extrinsecal and accidental Forms and Orders of Religion, which are necessary
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105678:12"/>
in <hi>genere,</hi> but left in <hi>specie</hi> to human deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
            <p>Of these several points of Unity, there is to be a different valuation according to their different value. Our first and chief regard is due to the first and chief point, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects Christian Faith and Life; The next regard is due to that which is next in value, that which respects the very constitution or frame of a Church; And regard is to be had of that also which respects the accidentals of Religion, yet in its due place and not before things of greater weight and worth. Things are of a very different nature and importance to the Churches good Estate; and a greater or lesser stress must be laid upon Unity in them, as the things themselves are of greater or lesser moment.</p>
            <p>The Rule or Law of Church Unity is not the will of man, but the will of God. Whosoever keeps that Unity which hath Gods word for its Rule, keeps the Unity of the Spirit; And whosoever boasts of a Unity that is not squared by this Rule, his boasting is but vain.</p>
            <p>An Hypothesis that nothing in the Service of God is lawfull, but what is expresly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in Scripture, is by some falsly ascrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a sort of men who earnestly contend for the Scriptures sufficiency, and perfection for the regulating of Divine Worship, and
<pb facs="tcp:105678:12"/>
the whole state of Religion. God in his Word hath prescribed all those parts of his Worship, that are necessary to be performed to him. He hath likewise therein instituted those Officers that are to be the Administrators of his publick Worship in Church Assemblies, and hath defined the authority and duty of those Officers, and all the essentials and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrals of Church state. As for the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials and accidentals belonging to all the things aforesaid, he hath laid down general Rules for the regulation thereof, the particulars being both needless and impossible to be enumerated and defined.</p>
            <p>In this point God hath declared his mind, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish ought from it. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 32. What soever thing I command you, observe to do it, Thou shalt not add thereto nor diminish from it. The prohibition is not meerly of altering the Rule, Gods written Word by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or diminution, but of doing more or less than the Rule required, as the precept is not of preserving the Rule, but of observing what is commanded in it.</p>
            <p>Such human institutions in Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as be in meer subserviency to Divine institutions, for the necessary and convenient modifying and ordering thereof, are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly additions to Gods commandments. For
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105678:13"/>
they are of things which are not of the same nature, end and use with the things which God hath commanded, but of meer circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantials and accidentals belonging to those things. And these circumstantials are in <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere</hi> necessary to the performance of Divine Institutions, and are generally commanded in the Word, though not in particular, but are to be determined in <hi>specie</hi> by those to whom the power of such determination belongs.</p>
            <p>They that assert and stand to this only Rule, provide best for the Unity of Religion, and the Peace of the Church. For they are ready to reject whatsoever they find contrary to this Rule, they are more easily kept within the bounds of acceptable Worship, and all war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable obedience, they lay the greatest weight on things of the greatest worth and moment, they carefully regard all Divine institutions and whatsoever God hath commanded, and they maintain Love, and Peace, and mutual forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance towards one another in the more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable diversities of Opinion and Practice.</p>
            <p>Those things that are left to human deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, the Pastors, Bishops or Elders, did anciently determine for their own particular Churches. And indeed it is very reasonable and naturally convenient, that they who are the Administrators of Divine institutions, and have the conduct of the People in Divine Worship, and know best what is most expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105678:13"/>
for their own Society, should be intrusted with the determination of necessary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances within their own Sphere. But foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Supream Magistrate is intrusted of God with the care of Religion within his Dominions, and hath a Civil Supremacy in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesiastical affairs, and a great concern in the orderly management of publick Assemblies, he is authorized of God to oversee the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations and actings of Ecclesiastical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and may assume to himself the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the aforesaid circumstantials for the honour of God, the Churches edification and the publick Peace, keeping within the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rules prescribed in Gods Word.</p>
            <p>For the maintaining of Church-Unity, that is according to Gods word, it is the part of Subjects to submit to what their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours have determined, so far as their submission is allowable by the said rule; and it is the part of Governours to consider well the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantableness of their determinations. More especially their wisdom and care is much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in settling the right bounds of Unity. In this regard the terms of admission to the Communion and Ministery of the Church must be no other, than what the declared will of God hath made the terms of those privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edges, and which will shut out none, whom God hath qualified for and called to the same. The setting of other boundaries, besides the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105678:14"/>
iniquity thereof, will inevitably cause divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
            <p>The Apostles, Elders and Brethren assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Jerusalem, Acts</hi> 15. 28. writing to the blieving Gentiles declare, <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things.</hi> From which it is evidently inferred that the burden of things unnecessary ought not to be laid on the Churches.</p>
            <p>The things injoyned by that Assembly were antecedently to their Decree, either necessary in themselves or in their consequents according to the state of things in those times and places. And whatsoever is made the matter of a strict injunction, especially a condition of Church Communion and Priviledges, ought to have some kind of necessity in it antecedent to its imposition. Symbolical Rites or Ceremonies instituted by man to signifie Grace or Duty, are none of those things, which being neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in general, are left to human determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for this or that kind thereof. They have no necessary Subserviency to Divine instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are no parts of that necessary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and order in Divine Worship, without which the Service would be undecent.

St. <hi>Paul</hi> resolves upon the cases of using or refusing of meats, and the observance or non-observance of days, which God had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commanded nor forbidden, and of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those meats which had been offered in Sacrifice to Idols, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and 1 <hi>Cor. 8. That no man put a stumbling block, or an occasion to fall in his Brothers way.</hi> The Command here given, extends to Pastors and Governours as well as to other Christians, and is to be observed in acts of Governments as well as in other acts. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Church Governour and of high authority, yet he would not use his own liberty in eating Flesh, much less would he impose in things unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to make his Brother to offend.</p>
            <p>In the cases aforementioned, there was a greater appearance of reason for despising, censuring or offending others, than there can be for some impositions now in question a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, <hi>viz.</hi> on the one side a fear of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in Idolatry, or of eating meats that God had forbidden, or of neglecting days that God had commanded, as they thought; on the other side a fear of being driven from the Christian Liberty, and of restoring the Ceremonial Law. Nevertheless, the Apostle gives a severe charge against censuring, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising or offending others of different Persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in those cases. And if it were a Sin to censure or despise one another, much more is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105678:15"/>
it a Sin to shut out of the Communion or Ministery of the Church for such matters.</p>
            <p>The word of God, which is the Rule of Church-Unity, evidently shews that the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of external order must always be Subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to Faith and Holiness, and may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired no further than is consistent with the Churches Peace and Edification.</p>
            <p>The Churches true Interest lies in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of regenerate Christians, who are her true and living Members, and in their mutual love, peace and concord, in receiving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon those terms which Christ hath made the bond of this Union. The true Church Unity is comprized by the Apostle in these following Unities; One Body, one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, one Hope, One Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God. But there is nothing said of one ritual or set Form of Sacred Office, one policy or model of Rules and Orders, that are but circumstantial and accidental in a Church state and very various and alterable, while the Church abides the same.</p>

the sin of Schism, and is as it were the heart root of it. Whosoever maintains love, and makes no breach therein, and whose dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or withdrawing from a Church is no other than what may stand with love in its extent, is no Schismatick.</p>
            <p>The Unity of the Spirit being primarily that of the Church as mystically, the breach thereof lies primarily in being destitute of the Spirit and Life Spiritual, much more in being opposite thereunto, under the shew of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; also in the languishing or lessening of Spiritual Life, especially of the acts of holy love.</p>
            <p>The Unity of the Spirit being secondarily, that of the Church as visible in its external state, and the first and chiefest point thereo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> said essentials or weighty matters. And it directly a violation of the Unity of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, and not of particular Churches only.</p>
            <p>Not only particular Persons, but Churches, yea a large combination of Churches bearing the Christian name, may in their Doctrine, Worship and other avowed Practice, greatly violate the essentials, or very weighty matters of Christian Faith and Life, and be found
<pb facs="tcp:105678:16"/>
guilty of the most enormous breach of Unity.</p>
            <p>It is no Schism to withdraw or depart from any the largest combination or collective bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Churches, (though for their ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude they presume to stile their combination the Catholick Church) that maintain and avow any Doctrine or Practice, which directly, or by near and palpable consequence overthrows the said essentials.</p>
            <p>The next point of external Unity being about the essentials and integrals of Church state, the Sacraments and other publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, the Ministery and Discipline of the Church considered as of Christs institution, the next chief point of Schism is the breach hereof. And this may be either against the Catholick, or a particular Church.</p>
            <p>Of such Schism against the state of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, there are these instances.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

Christians upon the face of the whole Earth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When there is an utter disowning of most of the true visible Churches in the World, as having no true Church state, no not the essentials thereof, and an utter breaking off from communion with them accordingly.</p>
            <p>Of Schism against a particular Church in point of its Church state, there be these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The renouncing of a true Church as no Church, although it be much corrupted, much more if it be a purer Church, though somewhat faulty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An utter refusing of all acts of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with a true Church when we may have communion with it, either in whole or in part, without our personal sin of commission or omission.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The causing of any Divisions or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers in the state or frame of a true Church contrary to the Unity of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>But it is no Schism to disown a corrupt frame of Polity, supervenient to the essentials and integrals of Church state in any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church or combination of Churches, like a leprosie in the Body, that doth grosly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave them, and in great part frustrate the ends of their constitution.</p>
            <p>The last and lowest point of external Unity lying in the accidental modes of Religion, and matters of meer order, extrinsick to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:105678:17"/>
essentials and integrals of Church-State, the violation thereof is the least and lowest point of Schism, I mean in it self considered, and not in such aggravating circumstances as it may be in.</p>
            <p>Those accidental Forms and Orders of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which are necessary in <hi>genere</hi> but left in <hi>specie</hi> to human determination, are allowed of God, when they are determined according to prudence, and charity for Peace and Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and accordingly they are to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to. Consequently it is one point of Schism to make a Division from or in a Church upon the accountal of accident Forms and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders so determined according to Gods al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance.</p>
            <p>But if any of the accidentals be unlawfull, and the maintaining or practicing thereof be imposed upon us as the terms of our communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is no Schism but Duty to abstain from communion in that case. For explicitly and personally to own errors and corruptions even in smaller points is evil in it self, which must not be committed that good may come. In this case not he that withdraws, but he that imposes causeth the Division. And this holds of things sinfull either in themselves, or by just consequence.</p>
            <p>And herein he that is to act, is to discern and judge for his own practice, whether the things imposed be such. For Gods Law supposeth
<pb facs="tcp:105678:18"/>
us rational creatures able to discern its mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to apply it for the regulating of our own actions; else the Law were given us in vain. Submission and reverence towards Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors obligeth no man to resign his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to their determinations, or in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with them to violate his own conscience. Persons meek, humble, peaceable and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conscientious and of competent judgment, may not be able by their diligent and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial search to see the lawfulness of things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, and tis a hard case if they should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon be declared contumacious.</p>
            <p>Seeing there be several points of Unity, the valuation whereof is to be made according to their different value, mens judgment and estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Unity and Schism, is very preposterous, who lay the greatest stress on those points that are of least moment, and raise things of the lowest rank to the highest in their valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and set light by things of the greatest moment and highest value; as indeed they do, who set light by soundness of Faith and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of Life, and consciencious observance of Divine institutions, where there is not also unanimity and uniformity in unscriptural Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and human ceremonies. And they that make such an estimate of things, and deal with Ministers accordingly, do therein little advance the Unity of the Spirit, or indeavour to keep it in the bond of Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:105678:18"/>
Seeing the word of God is the rule of Church Unity, a breach is made upon it, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bounds thereof are set than this rule al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. An instance hereof is the devising of other terms of Church-communion, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial liberty, than God hath commanded, or allowed in his Word to be made the terms thereof; Also any casting or keeping out of the Church or Ministery such as Gods Word doth not exclude from either, but signifies to be qualified and called thereunto.</p>
            <p>God doth not allow on the part of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser such tearms of Church communion or Ministerial station, as are neither Scriptural nor necessary to Peace and Edification, nor are any part of that necessary order and decency, without which the Service of God would be undecent, nor are in any regard so necessary, but that they may be dispensed with for a greater benefit, and the avoiding of a greater mischief. And they are found guilty of Schism that urge such unscriptural and unnecessary things unto a breach in the Church. Such Imposers are not only an occasion of the breach that follows, but a culpable cause thereof, because they impose without and against Christs warrant, who will not have his Church to be burdened, nor the consciences of his Servants intangled with things unnecessary.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, such unscriptural or unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary things, if they be not in themselves
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105678:19"/>
unlawfull nor of mischievous consequence, may be of Gods allowing as to the submitters. Thereupon they are guilty of Schism, who meerly for the sake of those unnecessary things yet lawfull as to their use, though wrongfully urged upon them, forsake the communion of the Church or their Ministerial station, where things are well settled as to the substantials of Religion, and the ends of Church order, and when they themselves are not required to justifie the imposing of such unnecessaries. Here I speak of contumacious refusers, who will rather make a breach than yield. But refusers out of conscience believing, or with appearance of reason suspecting the said law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things to be unlawfull, are either accquitted from Schism, or guilty but in a low degree, and much less culpable than the Imposers, who might well forbear to impose.</p>
            <p>Be it here noted that when Superiors sin in commanding a thing exempt from their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, it may be the Subjects duty to observe the thing commanded. In this case the said observance is not an act of obedience, for that can arise only from the Rulers authority to command. But it is an act of prudence, equity and charity, and it is good and necessary for the ends sake, and in that regard tis an act of obedience, though not to the Earthly Ruler, yet to God who commands us to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Peace and maintain Unity in all lawful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:105678:19"/>
In the judgment of the Apostle it is no slight matter to act against conscience ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally doubting, or suspecting a breach of Gods Law, <hi>Rom. 14. 5. Let every man be fully persuaded in his mind,</hi> v. 14. <hi>To him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean,</hi> ver. 23. <hi>He that doubteth, is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of Faith, for whatsoever is not of Faith is sin.</hi> The command of Rulers is no good security for acting against a rational doubting consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. When I am in doubt touching the lawfulness of the thing injoyned, I have no certainty of being on the safer side, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with Rulers. For though in general obedience to Rulers be a certain Duty, yet in the particular doubted case, I cannot be certain that my compliance is right and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable obedience, and not a breach of Gods Law. Is it plain that I ought to obey the commands of Rulers in things that have Gods allowance? so tis as plain that I ought not to obey their commands in things which God hath forbidden. Moreover, it is as plain that I ought not to act against my own conscience, which as being the discerner of the will of God concerning me, is of right the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate director of my actions. Indeed my conscience cannot alter Gods Law, or make that which God hath made my duty to be not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105678:20"/>
my duty, yet it will not suffer me to act in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity to its directions.</p>
            <p>Seeing the Unity of the Spirit is always in conjunction with Faith and Holiness, to which the Unity of external order is always to be subservient, it follows that when Unity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal order doth not tend to advance but hinder sound Faith and true Holiness, then a false Unity is set up, and the true Unity is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned, and divisions and offences are caused. And it is no Schism but a duty not to adhere to a Unity of external order so set and urged, as that it tends to the destruction or notable detriment of Faith and Holiness, which are the end of all Church Order. The means are good in reference to their end, and must never be used in a way destructive to it. Of the hinderance of the said ends, there be these following instances.</p>
            <p>Here laid down in general, without intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of particular application to any Churches now in being, which are left to be tryed and judged by that rule by which all must stand or fall.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When a Church or Churches, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation or Congregations have an establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of external Polity, and an ordained Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, and a Form of Divine Worship, but are destitute of such Ministers as are qualified to feed the Flock, and are burdened with such
<pb facs="tcp:105678:20"/>
as are altogether unfit to have the charge of Souls committed to them, who are either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to teach, or teach corruptly, either teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupt Doctrine, or abusing, mishand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and misapplying sound Doctrine, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Ungodly and discourage the Godly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Where there are some Ministers able and apt to teach and duly qualified; but their number is in no wise proportionable to the number of the People, and there be multitudes that cannot have the benefit of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, so that if they have no more placed among them than those few, they have in effect none.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Where sincere Christians, or credible Professors of Christianity are cast out of an established Church by wrong sentence, or are debarred from its communion by unlawfull terms injoyned them, or unnecessary terms which are to them unlawfull by real doubts of conscience, and which Christ hath not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized Rulers to injoyn as terms of Church communion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When Ministers, whom Christ hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished and called, are driven out of their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick station by unlawfull terms injoyned, or by terms unnecessary and to them unlawfull by real doubts of conscience, and which Christ hath not authorized Rulers to injoyn as terms of the publick Ministery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105678:21"/>
Upon the cases here mentioned, I inquire whether the said Ministers and People may not draw together into new congregations. Let it be considered whether the determinations of men may be a perpetual bar to true visible Christians, (it may be to multitudes of them) against the injoyment of those most important priviledges, to which God hath given them right. Yea, suppose their consciences were culpably weak in scrupling things imposed, yet they may suffer wrong by such an excess of punishment, as so great a deprivation. And Christ doth not reject them for such weaknesses.</p>
            <p>Let it be also considered, whether such injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Christians are wrongfully excluded from Gods Ordinances, and such neglected Souls as are left destitute of the necessary means of Salvation, may lawfully be deserted by Christs Ministers. Should not the Stewards of the mysteries of God indeavour to supply what is lacking to such by reason of the rigourousness or negligence of others? If it be said, we may not do evil that good may come, nor break the laws of Unity for such respects, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is, that this is not to do evil, but a good work and a necessary duty, and here is no breach of Unity that is of Gods making or allowing. The necessary means of saving Souls are incomparably more pretious than
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105678:21"/>
uniformity in external, accidental order, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when tis unwarrantably injoyned, and attended with such evil consequents. If with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any local bounds assigned for the Pastoral charge of any Ecclesiastick, the People be left destitude of competent provision for their Souls, it is no intrusion or breach of Unity if an other Pastor perform the work of the Ministery within those bounds.</p>
            <p>Subjects may not by coercive power reform the publick State and change the Laws, which is the work of the Supream Magistrate. But let it be considered whether they may not have their voluntary Assemblies for Gods Worship, when they are driven from the communion of the legal Churches by the imposition of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105678:25"/>
some Bishops remarkable for Wisdom an Godliness, and such as were consulted with by some of the chief of the Catholick Bishops, and that with good success for support of the Common Faith against the <hi>Arrians</hi> and such like Hereticks. Under a certain Persecution, wherein they were Companions of the self same suffering, it is said that the <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Novatians</hi> had Prayers together in the <hi>Novations</hi> Churches, and that in those time<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they were almost united, if the <hi>Novations</hi> had not utterly refused that they might keep up their old institutes; yet they bare such good will one to another, that they would die one for another. These and many other things of like nature are reported of them by <hi>Socrates,</hi> whom some indeed suspect to have been addicted to them, yet upon no other ground, but because he gives them their due upon evident proof. And besides what he hath reported, <hi>Sosomen</hi> thus testifies of them, <hi>L. 2. C. 30. That when other Sects expired, the Novatians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had good men for the Leaders of their way, and because they defended the same Doctrine with the Catholick Church, were very numerous from the beginning, and so continued, and suffered not much dammage by</hi> Constantines <hi>Law for suppressing of Sects;</hi> And <hi>Acesius</hi> their Bishop being much favoured by the Emperor, for the integrity of his life
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105678:25"/>
greatly advantaged his Church. Also <hi>L. 4. C.</hi> 19. He reports the great amity that was between them and the Catholicks in a time of common Persecution.</p>
            <p>Whether the case of the Dissenters from the Uniformity now required, be in point of Schism of the same or like reason with the above mentioned, or any other anciently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Schismaticks, is now to be considered. And it is the case of those that dissent not in the substance of Religion, but only in things pertaining to the Ecclesiastical Polity or exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Order in the Church, that it here taken into consideration. Of these, some being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded of the necessity of their own Church-Order, desire to remain as they are in their severed Societies; yet they do not nullify the legal Churches or Ministery, or the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of the Word, Sacraments and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er therein performed. Others being satisfied in the constitution of Parochial Churches, and in the substance of the Established Form of Worship, would gladly embrace a freedom of Communicating and Administring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, upon the removal of some bars that lie against them, and which they think may well be removed. Thereupon they seek an Accommodation and Union by a sufficient comprehensiveness in the publick constitution; and withall a reasonable indulgence towards
<pb facs="tcp:105678:26"/>
those Brethren, who for the straightness of their judgments cannot be comprehended.</p>
            <p>Neither Party of the Dissenters here des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed can be charged with any thing like the <hi>Donatistical</hi> fury before expressed. If <hi>Austin</hi> sought the suppression of that Sect by the secular power, in regard of the horrible outrages committed by them, it cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably be urged for a precedent (as it hath been by some) for the suppression of men Sober and Peaceable, and sound in the main points of Christian Faith and Life. Nor can either Party of us be charged with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable presumption and arrogance of the Donatists, in confining the Flock of Christ to their own Party, or the disannulling and utter denouncing of all Churches besides their own. Nor is the ground of our dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction like theirs, which began in a quarrel against a particular Bishop, and was maintained by animosity against those that would not condemn him. It is well known that another manner of account is to be given of our Dissents.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that those Dissenters whose principles bind them up to persevere in their severed Societies, seem in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to be as the <hi>Novatians,</hi> who would not admit a re-Union with the other Churches; it may be answered for them, that reasons
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105678:26"/>
have been offered in the foregoing parts of this Discourse for indulgence to conscientious People, who are intangled by the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their principles touching Church-Order. Besides, they do not stand off upon so harsh and rigorous a point as the <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> did, <hi>viz.</hi> The utter repelling of the lapsed, though penitent from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church. And they have ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communion in the Word and Prayer with Congregations that are not of their Church way, and occasionally in the Sacrament with those Congregations, where they apprehend a care of the exercise of Discipline. Nor may they be judged so irreconcilable to the Established Order, but that the holy lives of those in the publick Ministery, and their lively Preaching, and a greater care of true and real Church-Discipline, might do much to their recovery.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, why may not these be upon as good terms under the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as the <hi>Novatians</hi> were under the Government of their times? Church Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reports that they were cruelly Persecuted by the <hi>Arrian</hi> Emperours and Bishops, and that they had great indulgence under Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Emperours, and with many Catholick Bishops and Patriarchs, whose prudent and moderate Government did best provide for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105678:27"/>
the Peace of their Churches. But those Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Bishops, who took from them their Churches and Estates, were chiefly either such as took to themselves a Secular Power, and ruled imperiously and with violence, or such as with their zeal had more of wrath and rashness than of meekness and prudence. This can be easily proved in the particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, if need were.</p>
            <p>But this is not the case of all <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists.</hi> For part of them (and upon good experiment made, they may be found the greater part) do not seek to abide in a severed State, but desire a Union. It is well known they are as sensible of the evil of Schism, and as Studious of the Churches Peace and Concord, as any others. And though they have not the same latitude of judgment with others in some points, yet they have a right Catholick Spirit to promote the common Interest of Religion, and more especially the Protestant Reformation, and dread the weakning and shattering of it by needless Divisions, and are ready to go as far as conscience will allow in compliance with the injunctions of Rulers. But they are cast and kept out of the Established Order by the injunction of some terms, which in regard of their present judgment, they can not comply with, but under the guilt of so
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105678:27"/>
great a sin as dissembling in the matter of Religion.</p>
            <p>Touching Church-Government, they admit the Episcopacy that was of ancient Ecclesiastical custom in the time of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> yea, or of <hi>Cyprian.</hi> Bishop <hi>Usher</hi>'s model of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Bishops and Arch-bishops with their Presbyters, was by some of them presented to the Kings Majesty for a ground-work of Accommodation. They acknowledge the Kings Ecclesiastical Supremacy according to the Oath in that case required. His Majesty in his gracious Declaration concerning Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Affairs, gives a Testimony concerning the Ministers that attended him in <hi>Holland,</hi> in these words, <hi>viz. To our great satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and comfort, We found them Persons full of affection to Us, and of zeal to the Peace of Church and State, and neither Enemies (as they had been given out to be) to Episcopacy or Liturgy, but modestly to desire such altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in either, as without shaking founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might best allay the present Distempers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are ready to engage that they will not disturb the Peace of the Church, nor indeavour any point of alteration in its Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Rebellious Seditions, or any unlawfull ways. Those points of Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity wherein they are dissatisfied, are but some accidentals of Religion and external
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105678:28"/>
modes, and the Declarations and Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons importing an allowance of all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing contained in the Liturgy. And they think that these points are not so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in themselves or in their consequents, but they are very dispensable as the Wisdom of Governours shall see cause.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that if any thing should be yielded to them, there would be no end of their cravings, that which I have to say is, That reasonable men will be satisfied with reasonable concessions; and if Subjects know not what is fit for them to ask, Governours know what is fit for them to give. By granting the desired relaxation, the Church would not (as some alledge) be self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, as confessing the unlawfulness of her injunctions, or as justifying the Opinions of the Dissenters. For it can signifie from her no more than either her indulgence to the weak, or her moderation in things less necessary and more controverted, which would not turn to her reproach, but to her greater justification.</p>
            <p>I have here nothing to say to them that object against any relaxation after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if they desired not our Conformity but our perpetual exclusion. Such may be answered in due season. And I have here nothing to do with those that argue against

               </gap>s from Politick considerations, respecting a particular Interest too narrow for an adequate foundation of Church-Peace and Christian-Concord. But my scope is to consider what may be done by the Higher Powers and Church Guides for the healing of breaches, according to the Wisdom which is from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, which is first pure, then peaceable, gentle and easie to be intreated, full of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisie.</p>
            <p>I have made particular observation of those too most remarkable Parties, which have been looked upon as the chief instances of Schism in the more ancient times. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Schisms that I find of any remark in those times were raised, sometimes by Persons cast out of the Church for their Crimes, and thereupon drawing Disciples af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, as was that of <hi>Meletius</hi> a Bishop <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n <hi>Antioch,</hi> against another <hi>Meletius,</hi> an Orthodox and right worthy Bishop of that City, only because he was at first brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n by the <hi>Arrians;</hi> sometimes by the exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the People for injuries done
<pb facs="tcp:105678:29"/>
to them or their Pastors, and outrages com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by their opposites, as was that of the <hi>Johannites</hi> at <hi>Constantinople</hi> upon the banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Chrysostom;</hi> and somtimes by meer animosity and humor of discontentment, as was that of <hi>Lucifer</hi> a Bishop in <hi>Sardinia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Touching all the said Parties, it may be observed that they did not plead that any Opinions or Forms were imposed on them to which their consciences did reluctate, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now because the judgment and practice of antiquity is much insisted on, I pray that it may be considered, whether in the Primitive, or ancient times of Christianity, men, yea, many hundreds of men duly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for the Ministery by sound Faith and good Life, as also by their Learning and Industry, and offering all reasonable security for their submissive and peaceable demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, were or would have been cast and kept out of the Church for their Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to some Opinions, Forms and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, which at the best are but the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentals of Religion, and of the truth or lawfulness whereof, the Dissenters were wholly dissatisfied, and which the Imposers judged to be but things in themselves indifferent.</p>
            <p>And I further pray that it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, whether it be easier for the Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists to be self-condemned in Conforming to some injunctions against their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and in deserting the Ministery to

which they are dedicated, than for Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours either by some relaxation to make them capable of Conforming, or to bear with their peaceable exercise of the Ministery in a state of Nonconformity, while some of their injunctions confine them to that state.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of making a right estimate of the guilt of Schism, and something more of taking the right way to Unity.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe confused noise about Schism, and the unjust imputation thereof, that is commonly made, hath greatly disordered the minds of many. Some have been thereby swaid to an absolute compliance with the most numerous or the most prevailing Parties. Others discerning the abuse of this name, but forgetting that there is something truly so called, have made light of the thing it self, which is indeed of a heinous nature. I have been engaged in this Disquisition by a deep sense of the evil of Schism, and an earnest care of keeping my self from the real guilt thereof, and what is here written, I willingly submit to a grave and just exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. <hi>Errare possum, Haereticus, Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus esse nolo.</hi> I am liable to Errour as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are, but I am sure I am no wilfull Schismatick.</p>
            <p>It is commonly given to men to pass a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105678:31"/>
severe judgment upon every dissent from their own Opinions and Orders. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, as that hath had the character of Schism stamped upon it, which is not such indeed; so that which is Schism in a low and tolerable degree, hath been aggravated to the highest, and prosecuted against all rules of prudence and charity.</p>
            <p>To make an equal judgment of the guilt of Schism in Persons or Parties, the degree of the Schism is duly to be considered. Our Saviour teacheth that reviling language, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous words and rash anger, are breaches of the Sixth Commandment, yet in degree of guilt, they are vastly different from the act of wilfull Murther. And indeed in the kind of delinquency here treated of, there are as great differences of degrees as of any other kind. The case of those that are necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a non-compliance in some lawfull things by them held unlawfull, yet seeking union would gladly embrace a reasonable accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, is much different from theirs, who upon choice and wilfully sever themselves, because they love to be severed. In like manner the case of those who desire and seek the conformity of others, and would gladly have fellowship with them, yet through mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided zeal, are approvers of such unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105678:31"/>
impositions as hinder the conforming of many, is much different from theirs, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing the extrusion of others, contrive the intangling of them by needless rigors. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other instances might be given to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the great disparity of cases in point of Schism, all which may teach us in the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that we are to make thereof, to put a difference between honest minds, that by mistake are drawn into Division, and those that out of their corrupt minds and evill designs do wilfully cause Division.</p>
            <p>In many things we offend all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behoves us to consider one another, as subject to the like errours and passions. We should not judge too severely, as we would not be so judged. There be many examples of Schismatical animosities and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versnesses, into which in the ancient times such Persons have fallen, as were otherwise worthily esteemed in the Church. <hi>Cyril</hi> with the greater number of Bishops in the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Council, too rashly deposed <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and his Party of Bishops upon a quarrel that arose between them. And <hi>John</hi> with his Adherents returning to <hi>Antioch,</hi> did more rashly depose <hi>Cyril</hi> and his Party, and yet both Parties were Orthodox, and in the issue joyned in the Condemnation of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius.</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:105678:32"/>
But the most remarkable instance in this kind, is the disorderly and injurious proceeding of so venerable a Person as <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius,</hi> against so worthy a Person as <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom,</hi> to which he was stirred up by the instigation of that incendiary <hi>Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> The said <hi>Epiphanius</hi> goes to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and in the Church without the City held a sacred Communion, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a Deacon; and when he had entred the City, in a publick Church he read the Decree made by himself and some others in the condemnation of <hi>Origens</hi> Books, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated <hi>Dioscurus</hi> and his Brethren called the long Monks, worthy and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox men persecuted by the <hi>Anthromorphites.</hi> And all this he did without and against the consent of <hi>Chrysostom</hi> the Bishop of the Place, and in contempt of him. I may further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in the long continued division between <hi>Paulinus</hi> and <hi>Meletius,</hi> with their Parties at <hi>Antioch,</hi> though both of them were of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith; likewise in the long continued Separation made from the Church of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> by the followers of <hi>Chrysostom</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his banishment, because they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperated by the injuries done to their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Patriarch.</p>
            <p>These weaknesses in good men of old times, I observe not to dishonour them, but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105678:32"/>
that we may be thereby warned to be more charitable and less censorious towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in case of the like weaknesses and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, and to be sollicitous to maintain Peace, and to prevent discord among all those that are united in the substantials of Christian Faith and Practice, and for this end to be more carefull in avoiding unreasonable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, unwarrantable impositions, and all causless exasperations.</p>
            <p>True Holiness is the basis of true Unity. For by it the Faithfull cleave to God, and one to another in him and for him, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to receive one another on those terms, on which God hath received them all. And by it they are turned from that dividing selfishness, which draws men into several or opposite ways according to their several or opposite ends.</p>
            <p>Let not a carnal wordly Interest in a Church state, be set up against Holiness and Unity. Let the increase and peace of the Church visible, be sought in order to the increase and peace of the mystical. Let no one Party be lifted up against the common Peace of sound Believers; and let not any part of the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Children of Christs Family be ejected or harassed upon the instigation of others, but let the Stewards in the Family carry it equally, and so gratifie one part in their
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105678:33"/>
desired Orders, that the other part be not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. Let not them be still vexed, who would be glad of tolerable terms with their Brethren. In Church-Governours let the power of doing good be enlarged, and the power of doing hurt restrained, as much as will stand with the necessary ends of Government.</p>
            <p>Let the Discipline of the Church commend it self to the consciences of men. Let the edge of it be turned the right way and its vigor be put forth, not about little formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties but the great and weighty matters of Religion. Zeal in substantials and charitable forbearance in circumstantials, is the way to gain upon the hearts of those that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the true ends of Church-government, and what it is to be Religious indeed.</p>
            <p>Let the occasions of stumbling and snares of division be taken out of the way, and let controverted unnecessaries be left at liberty. Discord will be inevitable, where the terms of concord remain a difficulty insuperable. The Conscientious that are willing to bid high for Peace, cannot resign their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the wills of men, and humility and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berness doth not oblige them to act contrary to their own judgments out of reverence to their Superiors; they cannot help themselves, but their Superiors may. Tis the Spirit of Antichrist that is fierce and violent; but the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105678:33"/>
Spirit of Christ is dovelike, meek and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and that Spirit inclines to deal tenderly with the consciences of Inferiours. Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of conscience is not to be despised or exposed to scorn, because some may falsly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it. The Head of the Church and Saviour of the Body is compassionate towards his Members, and he hath said, <hi>Whoso shall offend one of these little ones, that believe in me, it were better for him that a milstone were hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the way of unity lies much in the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, equity and charity of Superiours, so in the humility and due submission of Inferiours, in their ready closing with what is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the publick constitutions, in their bearing with what is tolerable, in making the best improvement of what is therein im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable for their own and others Edification, in a word, in denying no compliance, which piety towards God and charity towards men doth not forbid.</p>
            <p>Matters of publick injunction, which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors stick at, may be considered by them either as in themselves unlawfull, or as inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient. Now it is not only or chiefly the inexpediency of things commanded, but the supposed unlawfulness of divers of those things that the Nonconformists generally stick
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105678:34"/>
at, whereof they are ready to render a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account, when it will be admitted. Howbeit a question may arise about the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantableness of submission to things not in themselves unlawfull but inexpedient, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in respect of scandal, the solution where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be requisite for the clearing of our way in such things.</p>
            <p>Upon this question it may be noted, That in those cases, wherein there is no right of commanding, there is no due of obedience. Nevertheless, things unwarrantably command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are sometimes warrantably observed, though not in obedience, yet in prudence, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Peace, and to shew a readiness to all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible compliance with Superiors. Moreover, Rulers have no authority to command that, which in it self is not unlawfull, when Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an charity forbids to do it in the present cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances by reason of evil consequents. For all authority is given for Edification and not for Destruction. Likewise our Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty includes no Licence to do that act at the command of Rulers, the doing of which in regard of circumstances, is uncharitable. But here it must be considered, how far the law of charity doth extend in this case, and when it doth, or doth not forbid my observance of what the Ruler hath unwarrantably, because uncharitably commanded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:105678:34"/>
True charity doth not wholly destroy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Liberty, though it regulates the use there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and it doth not extend it so far one way as to destroy it self another way. If I am bound up from doing every indifferent thing, at which weak consciences will take offence, my liberty is turned into bondage, and I am left in thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to other mens endless Scrupulosities. This is I think a yoke which Christians are not fit nor able to bear. This bondage is greater and the burden lies heavier upon me, if by reason of others weakness, I must be bound up from observing an indifferent thing at the command of Rulers, and by them made the condition of my liberty for publick Service in the Church, when my conscience is fully satisfied that it is lawfull, and otherwise expedient for me to do it. As for the warrantableness of enjoyning, the Ruler must look to that. Are some displeas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and grieved that I do it? As many or more may be displeased and grieved if I do it not. Do some take occasion by my necessary use of a just liberty, to embolden themselves to sin? My forbearing of it may be an occasion of sin to others, as their persisting in some troublesom Errour to their own and others Spiritual dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and in unwarrantable non-compliance with their Governours. And the loss of my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for publick Service consequent to such for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, must also be laid in the ballance.</p>

            <p>I mention my Ordination according to the Episcopal Form, because it is of greatest esteem with them, to whom this Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is more especially tendred. Nevertheless, I own the validity of Presbyterial Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and judge that Ministers so Ordained,
<pb facs="tcp:105678:36"/>
may make the same defence for exercising the Ministery, in the same case that is here represented.</p>
            <p>Christ is the Author and the only proper Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of this Office; and though he give it by the mediation of men, yet not by them as giving the Office, but as instruments of the desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or of the solemn investiture of the Person to whom he gives it. As the King is the immediate Giver of the power of a Mayor in a Town Corporate, when he gives it by the Mediation of Electors and certain Officers, only as instruments of the desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or of the solemn investiture of the Person.</p>
            <p>I am not conscious of disabling my self to the Sacred Ministrations, that belong to the Office of a Presbyter, by any Opinion or Practice, that may render me unfit for the same. Touching which matter, I humbly offer my self to the tryal of my Superiors to be made according to Gods Word.</p>
            <p>Nothing necessary to authorize me to those Ministrations is wanting that I know of. I am Christs Commissioned Officer; and I do not find that he hath revoked the authority which I have received from him; And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the warrant of his Law no man can take it from me. Nor do I find, that the nature of this Office, or the declared will of Christ

            <p>That I do not exercise the Ministery un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the regulation of the Bishop of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and in other circumstances according to the present established Order, the cause is not in me, who am ready to submit thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; but a bar is laid against me by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of some terms in the lawfulness whereof I am not satisfied, whereof I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give an account when it is required.</p>
            <p>I do not understand that I am under any Oath or Promise to exercise the Ministery, no otherwise than in subordination to the Bishop, or the Ordinary of the Place. The promise made at my Ordination to obey my Ordinary and other chief Ministers, to whom the government and charge over me is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, concerns me only as a Presbyter, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in relation to the Bishop or Ordinary, as one of the Clergy of the Diocess, or other peculiar Jurisdiction, in which relation I do not now stand, being cast out and made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable thereof. Moreover, in whatsoever ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity I now stand, the said Promise must be understood either limitedly or without limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If limitedly, as in things lawfull and honest, (as I conceive it ought to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood) then I am not bound by it in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent case. For it is not lawfull nor honest for

me to comply with the now injoyned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity against my conscience, or in case of such necessitated non-compliance, to desist from the Ministery that I have received in the Lord. If it be understood without limitation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
