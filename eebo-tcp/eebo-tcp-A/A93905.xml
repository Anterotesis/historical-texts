            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU may perceive by the incloſed Brief for rebuilding the Cathedral Church of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> how much His Majeſty is concerned to have this Work carried on, and in what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner He recommends it to the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> and therefore I am commanded, not only to ſend you the Briefs, but to excite you to a more than ordinary care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in promoting ſo good a Work, and which tends ſo much to the Honour of this City.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible what Objections a Work of this nature is like to meet with in our Age; wherein ſome love to cavil at whatever relates to God and his Worſhip; and eſpecially if it be like to coſt them any thing; others who ſeem very zealous for ſome kind of Religion, are for enjoying it on as cheap and eaſie terms as may be; and many of thoſe who declare a good will to this Work, yet expreſs great diſſatisfaction both as to this method of proceeding, and the time we have choſen, which they think very unſuitable to ſuch a deſign, if we either reſpect the preſent State of the City or Nation. So that till ſuch Objections be removed out of mens minds, there is little reaſon to expect they ſhould make any free and chearful Contributions; and if I can be any waies ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable therein, I ſhall think my time and pains well employed in writing and ſending this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to you.</p>
            <p>It is a principle among thoſe who love a thrifty and parſimonious Religion, that whatever is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds and meaſures of neceſſity and conveniency in the Worſhip of God, is vain and ſuperſtitious, and therefore deſerves no encouragement at all. I do not wonder at this principle in thoſe men who meaſure their Religion by their Intereſt, and chooſe that which brings them the beſt Trade, and ſaves them the moſt expence. But there are many well meaning perſons among us, who look on what is great and Magnificent as unſuitable to the times of the Goſpel, and only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for that diſpenſation, wherein God declared, <hi>That he loved the Gates of Sion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</hi> But I deſire ſuch to conſider that we Worſhip the ſame God, who gave order for the Building of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple; not meerly for the conveniency of that way of Worſhip; but with all the Splendour and Greatneſs which was agreeable to the Majeſty of that God who was Worſhipped therein. For ſince it was the Houſe of God, the ſenſe of nature did teach the Jews as well as Gentiles, that it ought to bear ſome proportion to the Greatneſs of Him who dwelt in it: And that is the reaſon given by <hi>Solomon</hi> to King <hi>Hiram, And the Houſe which I build is great, for great is our God above all gods.</hi> Hath not God made the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Temple for himſelf in Heaven, and adorned it after ſuch a manner, as all the Wit and Art of His Creatures can never exactly deſcribe or imitate? And the Jews think, not without reaſon, that the faſhion of their Temple was deſigned on purpoſe to repreſent in little, the far more Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Temple which God had framed for His own Glory in the Fabrick of the World. And certainly, it is no part of the Ceremonial Law, to Worſhip God in a way agreeable to thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of His Greatneſs, which the Works of His Hands ſuggeſt unto us. Under the Goſpel, I grant, that Chriſt hath altered the way of Worſhip which was uſed among the Jews; and now we are no longer tied to make any part of the places dedicated to God's Worſhip, a kind of <hi>Shambles</hi> by ſlaying the Beaſts for ſacrifice, but muſt we therefore make them <hi>Stables?</hi> There is a natural Decency and Fitneſs to be obſerved in theſe things which Chriſt hath never taken away, no more than he hath their ſeparation from common uſe; the deſtroying whereof brings ſuch rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Barbariſm into Religion, as even the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Scythians</hi> abhorr. And although Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in a low and mean condition in the World, as moſt ſuitable to the deſign of His coming, yet even when He lay in the Manger, He had <hi>Gold, and Frankincenſe, and Myrrhe offered him</hi> (which were all rich and coſtly preſents) and that by <hi>Wiſe Men</hi> too. And when He was to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, His Body was Embalmed before-hand with a coſtly Oyntment; and we know what a ſevere check Chriſt himſelf gave to him that ſaid, <hi>To what purpoſe is all this Waſte?</hi> although at the ſame time he pretended great Charity to the Poor. It was the Poverty and Perſecution of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians, which made them at any time to Worſhip God in Chambers and Grotts: For as ſoon as they had any reſpite and eaſe, they erected lofty and beautiful Churches, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> relates; and the firſt Chriſtian Emperours ſhewed their zeal in the Splendour and Magnificence of the Churches which they built; and not only the Emperours themſelves, but the beſt Chriſtians of thoſe times thought this to be for the Honour of Chriſt and of the Chriſtian Religion. And do theſe men indeed think, that building great Houſes for themſelves, and adorning them with the richeſt Furniture, or raiſing of Families, and heaping up vaſt Treaſures, is more agreeable to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Goſpel, than ſerving God in a Beautiful and Magnificent Church?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:152417:2"/>
But if none of theſe things will move them, let them conſider this Work, as a Deſign which will employ many poor men for many years (and this they cannot deny to be a Work of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.) Let them look on it as an Ornament of the City, as an Honour of the Nation, as like to be a ſtanding Monument of Proteſtant Affection to good and publick Works; and on ſuch Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts as theſe, we are ſure there can be no ſcruple of Conſcience againſt it.</p>
            <p>But others ſay, <hi>Their own Pariſh Churches are not built, and therefore it cannot be expected they ſhould do any thing yet towards the Cathedral.</hi> I am heartily ſorry for the occaſion of this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in any parts of the City; and God forbid that we ſhould hinder the Building of any of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Churches; but I do not underſtand how this will do it. All that we deſire is, That the <hi>Mother-Church</hi> may not be forgotten, while the others are riſing ſo faſt out of their Ruines, and ſo many of them are already finiſhed with extraordinary beauty and conveniency. For, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever length of time hath made the relation to be almoſt forgotten between the Mother-Church and the reſt; yet for ſome Ages of the Chriſtian Church, whatever other conveniencies they might have for aſſembling together, there was but one Church in a City which had a <hi>Baptiſtery</hi> belonging to it, that all the Chriſtians being there Baptized, might own their relation to the Mother-Church. And although, ſince the great increaſe of the number of Chriſtians, it hath been thought fit to have the Sacraments Adminiſtred in Parochial Churches, yet it ought to be conſidered, that this Church is properly the <hi>City Church,</hi> to which our Princes on extraordinary occaſions, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the City have alwaies reſorted, and where the Worſhip of God hath been more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly performed, and the Word of God ſet forth by Preachers choſen out from the Univerſities, and all parts of the Kingdom, to the great Honour as well as ſatisfaction of this City. And it ought not to be forgotten, that the emulous City to this for Trade and Riches, hath not only built a Stathouſe, but a Magnificent Church too at their own Charges; and it will be no great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to <hi>London</hi> to fall ſo much ſhort of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> in zeal for the publick Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But why ſhould the burden lie on the City which hath ſuffered ſo much of late by a dreadful Fire?</hi> This were indeed a terrible Objection, if it had been made in the Ruines of the City; but thanks be to the Wonderful Providence of God Almighty, we have lived to ſee the City riſe with a Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and Greatneſs ſo far ſurpaſſing whatever it had before, that this were enough to put us in mind of building the Houſe of God in a way ſuitable to the preſent Grandeur of the City. I do not think that in all reſpects the Prophet's Argument will reach our caſe, <hi>Is it time for You, O ye, to dwell in your Cieled Houſes, and this Houſe lie Waſte?</hi> but yet methinks, thoſe who have already laid out ſo many thouſands on a <hi>Monument</hi> of the dreadful <hi>Fire,</hi> ſhould think themſelves as much concerned to contribute freely towards a <hi>Monument</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> after it, and what can be more proper for that, that the Re-building St. <hi>Pauls?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Thoſe who have nothing elſe to Object againſt this Work, find fault with the <hi>Seaſon, as very ill choſen by us, when ſo many Burdens and Taxes lie already on the City, and men are ſtill afraid of more.</hi> As though the Seaſon were of our own chooſing! Whereas the true ſtate of the Caſe is this: As long as our Stock held out any waies proportionably to the expence, we went on chearfully and with great diligence; and we may ſay it without vanity, the Stock we had hath been managed with as much care and good Husbandry, as of any publick Buildng whatſoever: But when we found that we could not carry on the Work without farther Supplies; What ſhould we do? ſhould we let the Work ſtand ſtill without trying other waies? Then we might have juſtly ſuffered under the Clamours which would have been made againſt us, that the Work might have gone on, if we had not been careleſs and negligent; that the City would, no doubt, give very conſiderable Supplies, if they were but asked; that in the former repairs the <hi>Chamber</hi> of <hi>London</hi> gave two hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi> for ten years; beſides the liberal Contributions of the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and of the <hi>Wards,</hi> and <hi>Companies;</hi> that it was not to be ſuppoſed, the <hi>City</hi> ſhould be leſs able, or leſs willing than it was at that time; that a very eaſie Rate upon the New-built and Inhabited Houſes would ſerve to ſiniſh the <hi>Choire;</hi> that but a fourth part of the Rate for the Poor in all the Pariſhes of <hi>England</hi> would go very far towards the Body of the Church; that no Citizen of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> would ever refuſe doing ſomething towards it; that at leaſt it was but our trying this Way, and if it did not ſucceed, we need not doubt at laſt of the Kindneſs both of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament.</hi> Upon ſuch Diſcourſes as theſe, it was thought fit by the Commiſſioners to make an Addreſs to His Majeſty, for Authority to gather Contributions, which out of His Royal Clemency and great readineſs to promote this Work, He was pleaſed to grant us. <hi>And now the time is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſeaſonable!</hi> as though it were ever otherwiſe, to thoſe who have no mind to it! But is it ever <hi>unſeaſonable</hi> to do Praiſe-worthy, pious and generous actions? We do not deſire men to impoveriſh themſelves to Re-build St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, but to give freely and chearfully, and in ſuch a proportion as other publick occaſions will permit, and as will be no hindrance to the concernment of their Trade or Families. <hi>For our Fears of future burdens and Troubles,</hi> can we do better to prevent them than to be full of good Works? And if we were as full of <hi>Troubles,</hi> as we are of <hi>Fears,</hi> we may remember that the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were fore-told <hi>to be Built in troublous times:</hi> but thanks be to God, we yet enjoy Peace and Tranquillity; our Port is full of Ships, our City of Trade, and there is great ſtore of Riches among many, who without any conſiderable diminution to their Stock, may contribute freely to this great Work.</p>
