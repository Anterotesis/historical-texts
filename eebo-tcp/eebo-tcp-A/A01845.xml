            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>To let passe the examples of forreine Nations, which are many and terrible: what plagues, pestilences, famines, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, tempests, ouerflowing of waters both salte and freshe, and a number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther most prodigeous tokens happened successiuely long time together, before the displacing of the Britons by the hands of our auncetors, for their negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of Gods word preached and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many hundred yeres among them? Likewise, what gret warnings did God giue to our forefathers, in diuers Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces reignes, before the alteration of the State, both by the <hi>Danes,</hi> and also by <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror? Againe, euen
<pb facs="tcp:9080:4"/>
in these our dayes, how manifestly hath God threatned, and still doth threaten our contempt of his holy Religion, and our securitie and sound sléeping in sinne, shewing vs euident tokens of his iust displeasure néere at hande, both abroade and at home.</p>
            <p>I will not speake of the great ciuill Warres, nor of the horrible and vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall massacres of good men, betrayde vnder the holyest pretences, which haue bin of late yeares in the Countreys bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering vpon vs: bycause such dealings being pleasant to suche as séeke bloud, are taken for no wonders. Neyther will I stande vppon the rehearsall of the strange things that befell in the Realme of <hi>Naples</hi> in the yeare 1566. nor of the Earthquake, whereby a greate part of the Citie <hi>Ferrara</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> was destroyed in the yeare 1570. or of the miraculous sights that were séene in <hi>France</hi> about <hi>Mountpellier,</hi> the yeare 1573. or of the like terrible sight that appeared little more than a yeare ago at <hi>Prage</hi> the chiefe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Boemia:</hi> nor of diuers other things

whiche haue hapned in forraine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys within the compasse of these fewe yeares: bycause it will perchance bée thought, that those tokens concerne the Countreys where they befell, &amp; not vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Well, I will not say,</hi> That whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer things haue bin written aforetimes, were written for our learning, that wee might learne to beware by other mens harmes.</p>
            <p>We haue signes and tokens ynow at home, if we can vse them to our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite.</p>
            <p>What shall we say to the sore Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whiche hapned in the time of oure late soueraigne Lady <hi>Queene Mary,</hi> whiche was so greate, that men were faine to make bread of Acornes, and foode of Ferne rootes? or to the perticular Earthquake, in the time of oure most gratious soueraigne Lady that now is, which transposed the boundes of mens groundes, and turned a Churche to the cleane contrarie situation? or to the monstrous birthes both of Children and Cattell? or to the vnseasonablenesse of
<pb facs="tcp:9080:5"/>
the seasons of some yeares, altering (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a sort) Sommer into Winter, and Winter into Sommer? or to the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull new Starre so long time fixed in the heauen? or to the strange appéerings of Comets, the often Eclipses of Sunne and Moone, the great and strange fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned lights séene in the firmament in the night times, the suddaine falling, and vnwonted abiding of vnmeasurable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Snow, the excessiue and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely raynes and ouerflowing of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the greatnesse and sharpe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of sore frostes, and many other such wonderfull things, one following in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers necke? Shall we say that none of these also do concerne vs? or rather more truly, that bycause they be gone and past (O ouer-great securitie and blindnesse of heart) we haue cleane for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten them, or at leastwise make no great accompt of them, according to our common prouerb, that a wonder lasteth with vs but nine dayes.</p>
            <p>Therfore, least we should want eyther proofe of the certaintie of Gods irreuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:9080:5"/>
iudgements, or argument of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall mercifull dealing towards vs, or matter wherewith to conuicte vs of our excessiue vnthankefulnesse: beholde, he se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vs now lastly this Earthquake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> befel y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sixt day of this month, not so hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in present operation, as terrible in signification of things to come. For the tryed experience of all ages teacheth vs, and the wrytings of the wise and lerned (specially of holie Scripture) do assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly witnes vnto vs, that such tokens are infallible fore warnings of Gods sore displesure for sinne, &amp; of his iust plagues for the same, where amendement of lyfe ensueth not.</p>
            <p>And although there bée peraduenture some, which (to kéepe them selues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the due looking back into the time earst mysspent, and to foade them still in the vanities of this worlde, least they should sée their own wretchednesse, and séeke to shunne Gods vengeance at hande) wil not sticke to deface the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant working of God, by ascribing this miracle to some ordinarie causes in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<pb facs="tcp:9080:6"/>
Yet notwithstanding to the godlie and wel-disposed which look aduisedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the matter, pondering the manner of this Earthquake throughly, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the manner of our dealings from the late restitution of the Gospell vnto this day, and conferring the same wyth the manner of Gods fauorable dealing wyth vs, and with his ordinary dealing in cases where his truthe hath bin plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; groweth to bée contemned: it must néedes appeare to bée the very finger of God, and as a messenger of the miseries due to such deserts.</p>
            <p>For, firste of all, whereas naturally Earthquakes are sayde to be engendred by winde gotten into the bowels of the earth, or by vapors bredde and enclosed within the hollowe caues of the earth, where, by their stryuing and struggling of themselues to get oute, or being haled outwarde by the heate and operation of the Sun, they shake the earth for want of sufficient vent to issue out at: If this Earthquake had rysen of such causes, it coulde not haue bin so vniuersall, bicause
<pb facs="tcp:9080:6"/>
there are many places in this Realme, which by reason of their substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cial sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and massie firmnesse, are not to bée pierced by any windes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wythout, nor haue any hollowenesse wherein to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and bréede any such aboundance of vapors, specially in places farre distant from the Sea, or from Riuers, moores, marishes, fennes, or light &amp; open soyles.</p>
            <p>Neyther coulde it haue bene in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places vniuersally at one instant both by sea and lande. For the stryuing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of within the grounde, taking his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at some certaine place, and procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding forwarde to get a vent, would haue required some space of time to haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to so many places so farre off, or else haue broken out with great furie in some place that had bin weakest.</p>
            <p>Againe, wheras in Earthquakes that procéede of naturall causes, certaine sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and tokens are reported to go before them, as, a tempestuous working and raging of the sea, the wether being fair, temperate, and vnwindie, calmenesse of the aire matched with great colde: dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: long and thinne strakes of cloudes appearing after the setting of the Sun, the weather being otherwise cleere: the troublednesse of water eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the déepest welles, yéelding moreouer an infected and stinking sauour: and lastly, greate and terrible sounds in the earth, like the noise of gronings or thunderings, as wel afore as after the quaking: We finde not that any such foretoken happened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of this Earthquake. And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore we may well conclude (though there were none other reason to moue vs) that this miracle procéeded not of the course of any naturall causes, but of Gods only determinate purpose, who maketh euen the verye foundations and pillers of the earthe to shake, the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to melte lyke war, and the seas to dry vp and to becom as a drie field, when he listeth to shewe the greatenesse of his glorious power, in vttering his heauie displeasure against sinne.</p>
            <p>But putte the case that some naturall causes or secrete influences had their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
<pb facs="tcp:9080:7"/>
operations in this Earthquake, whereof notwithstanding there is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sufficient likelyhode: shall we so gaze vpon the meane causes, that we shal for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get or let slip the chiefe &amp; principall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses? Knowe we not (after so long hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and professing of the Gospel) that a sparrow lighteth not on the ground with out Gods prouidence? That the negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of his louing kindenesse, and the continuing in sin without amendement, prouoke his vengeance? And yet that he of his owne fatherlie frée goodnesse, doth euer giue warning before he stryketh? Surely we can not but know it, yea and sée it too, vnlesse the God of this worlde haue so blynded our eyes, that we will not sée it. For it is daylie and almoste hourely tolde vs by the Ministers of his word, and the Byble lyes alwayes open for vs to reade it our selues, that as the onely originall cause and welspring of al plagues and punishmentes is sin: to the plagues and punishmentes themselues, and the orderlie disposing, directing, and guiding of all causes to their due endes &amp;

And truly, as it is sayde in the Psalme, their spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and talking vnto vs, is not so softly and whysperingly, as that the voyces of them can not be hearde: but contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, they be so loud in our eares, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to our eyes, and so sensible to oure féeling: that (vnlesse we bée stonie and steelie hearted, or giuen <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Nowe then, shall we thinke this rare and vnaccustomed miracle, suche as no man lyuing, nor none of our forefathers hath euer séene or hearde of, to be a thing of no importance, as hapning by chance, or grounded vpon some naturall causes: and not rather as a messenger and sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner of vs to the dreadful Iudgement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seate
<pb facs="tcp:9080:8"/>
of the almightie &amp; euerliuing God?</p>
            <p>Let vs enter into our selues, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our time paste. Since the sharpe tryall which GOD made of vs in the raigne of Quéene Marie, (at which time we vowed all obedience to GOD, if he woulde voutchsafe to deliuer vs againe from the bondage of the Romishe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chryst, into the libertie of the Gospell of his sonne Iesus Chryste) he hearkening effectually to our requestes, hath gyuen vs a long resting and refreshing-time, blessed with innumerable benefites both of body and soule: For peace, health, and plentie of al things necessarie for the life of man, we haue had a golden worlde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all the residue of oure neyghbours rounde aboute vs.</p>
            <p>The worde of truth hath bin preached vnto vs earely and late without lette or disturbance. And bicause our prosperitie hath made vs to play the wanton childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against God, he hath chastized vs in the meane season with many fatherlie corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>Wée haue bin taught, instructed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted,
<pb facs="tcp:9080:9"/>
encouraged, allured, entreated, reprooued, rebuked, vpbrayded, warned, threatned, nurtured, and chastized. To be shorte, there is not that meane wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we might be woon to the obeying and louing of oure God, whether it were by fauourable mildnesse or moderate rigor, but he hath ministred the same most mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully and seasonably vnto vs. And what are we the better for all this?</p>
            <p>Haue we so profited in this schole, that of Couetous we bée become Liberall? of Proude and Enuious, méek and Lowly? of Leacherous, Chaste? of Gluttons, Measurable féeders? of Drunkards, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber? of Wrathfull and testie, Milde and patient? of Cruel and hard hearted, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and gentle? of Oppressors, Relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers? and of Irreligious, Seruisable to GOD?</p>
            <p>Haue we so put off the olde man, &amp; so clothed ourselues with the new, in liuing sincerely according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that neyther the enimies of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes Church, nor our owne consciences can reproue vs? Then néed we not to be

            <p>But alas, it is farre otherwise with vs: we haue growen in godlinesse as the Moone doth in light when she is past the full. For who sées not the emulation that remaynes stil among vs for excesse of apparell, fare, and building? Who perceyueth not the dysdaine of superiors to their inferiors, the grudge and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning of inferiors towardes their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, and the want of loue in al states one towardes another?</p>
            <p>Who complayneth not of corruption in Officers, yea euen in Officers of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and ministers of the Lawe?

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9080:11"/>I feare me that if the Prophete Esay were héere alyue, he would tell vs as hée sometime tolde the Iewes, that from the croune of our head to the sole of our foot, there is no whole or sounde parte in oure bodie, but that al is ful of sores, blaines, and botches. Thinke we then that such doing shal scape vnpunished, or such buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings stande vnshaken? Well may we deceyue our selues in so hoping: but God deceyueth not, neyther is deceyued.</p>
            <p>It is wrytten, that euery plant which our heauenlie Father hath not planted, shal be plucked vp by the rootes, and that euery trée which beareth not good fruite, shall be cut downe and cast into the fire.</p>
            <p>The Axe is layde to the roote of the trée: and the longer that Gods venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is in comming the, sorer it smyteth when it is come. Terrible and moste true is this saying of his by the mouth of Salomon: <hi>For as much as I haue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and you haue refuzed: and I haue stretched oute my handes, and you haue not regarded it: but haue despized al my counsel, and set my correction at nought:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:9080:12"/>
               <hi>therefore wil I also laugh at your destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and mock yee when the thing that yee feare commeth vpon you: euen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the thing that yee be afrayde of breaketh in vpon you like a storme, and your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie like a tempest. When trouble and heauynesse come vpon you on all sides: then shall ye call vpon me, but I wil not answere you, yee shal seeke me early, but yee shall not finde me: euen bicause yee hated knowledge, and didde not chooze the feare of the Lorde. Ye would none of my counsell, but hated my correction: and therfore shal ye eat the fruit of your owne ways, and be filled with your own inuentions.</hi> Soothly it is a dreadful thing to fall into the handes of the Lorde. For as he is merciful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so is he also iust, and in all his determinations he is vtterly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable. And (as the Prophet Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie sayeth) <hi>When sentence is once gone forth of his presence, it shal not retourne without performance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherfore let vs not be as horsses and Mules whiche haue no vnderstanding: neyther let vs tarrie till Iudgement be

sent forth vnto victorie. But let vs consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the time of our visitation, and whyle we haue time, let vs vse it to our benefit.</p>
            <p>So long as God calleth vnto vs, so lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as he entreteth vs, so long as he techeth, allureth, exhorteth or warneth vs, yea so long as he doeth as yet but threaten vs: so long the gate is stil open for vs, so as he will heare vs if we call, and be founde of vs if we séeke him. But if he once hold his peace, and begin too smite, then it is too late too call backe his hande, our cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wil not boote vs.</p>
            <p>Therefore while we haue respite, and while it is called to daie, let vs not harde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our hartes as in the prouocation, and as in the day of Temptation in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but let vs hearken to his voyce, &amp; forsaking the lustes and the wicked ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations and deuices of our own h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
