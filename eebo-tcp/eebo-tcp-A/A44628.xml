            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface of the Author.</head>
            <p>IF wit of this kind did always depend on success, there were little to be said (especially in this age) to justifie the best of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or modern Poesy, the latter of which though short of compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with our former Dramatique Poets, who brought the stage to such a <hi>non ultra</hi> of designe and wit, that it might have been in some sort their several Glories to have said according to that Poetical boast of <hi>Ovid—Jamque opus exegi.</hi> And from whom the English Stage alone has given the world, (whatsoever can be objected to the contrary) the best Dramatique Rules, and Plays together. Notwithstanding which, such is the disingenious Humour, or ignorance of the Age we live in, that not only the most deserving of these come to be unfrequented, and slighted by their Auditors, but likewise some few of our modern, that can so far Justifie themselves as to be Imitators of their vertues; and in stead of them obscene, ridiculous and indigested Plays, have their numerous Audiences; as if it were their due to receive a superior allowance, though they deserve not the name of good foils, to set off the beauties of the other; nor can it be denied, that wit (like other most remarkable things) has not generally past its <hi>Epochoreca,</hi> so that we may compute its renown rather backward than forward, a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that cannot be intail'd on posterity, who are observable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, (especially now a days) to be rather beholding to the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of former writers, than able to oblige the world out of their store again. And it is some wonder that such who can pretend to so little of invention and wit, are favourably allow'd to be Authors; and like Bankrupts (though breaking their credit with the world) are permitted to set up still; but if this be the good fortune of any, such as conceive themselves to have any title to desert, have the least cause to Repine, no more than to observe the common ingratitudes of fortune, which does seldome place merit on her right hand; nor is it otherwise to be expected, whilst her greatest Patrons are the most deprav'd, and ignorant of men: and I will presume to say that there was so much good fortune in the fate of this Play, to receive its condemnation from such, who wanted either capacity to receive it, or at least were resolv'd to joyn in a confederacy to oppose that esteem, which the more just and knowing might have probably al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
<pb facs="tcp:99237:3"/>
it, either being conscious, that it was better than they were willing it should be thought, or at least not inferiour to what the most celebrated amongst them could produce on the Stage; which consideration did perhaps industriously occasion the disturbance of the Actors in the Representation of this Play, as also the audience in the hearing of it, who could not with any quiet give their attention to the Action, and they had their end; for after this was done, the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> day, there were few of the sober spectators who would venture that disrespect to themselves to see it often. If there were any persons of quality who did submit to so mean a compliance, as to abet or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with so ungenerous a carriage, we will spare them the concern of reading themselves here, of whom it may be said as <hi>Juvenal,</hi> did of some degenerate in his time,
<q>Qui Curios simulant, &amp; Bacchanalia vivunt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But that which was said to sharpen the sting of this malice, was the undertaking concerning this Play, because in that there might be some pecuniary loss to add to this triumph. To which it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that if the adventure were imprudent (and possibly there may be as little reason to hazard mony on the success of wit as on any thing whatsoever) the carriage of such as oppos'd its reception was a far greater extravagancy and folly. And he must distrust his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities very much (considering some Plays which have had success) if he thinks his own not worth hazarding his mony as well as credit; as on the other side, there are some who would make such a monopoly of their wit, that it is their endeavour none may sell but theirs: though he may be a greater fool that writes ill and loses nothing by it, than he that values himself so far as to adventure on what he conceives merits an esteem. The truth is, not a few of our new Writers have scap'd much better, because their works have not been thought worthy of emulation, though in the apprehension of the Judicious, they have suffer'd enough without other loss than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit of their understandings: and I doubt not (in this extravagant, if not ridiculous Age of censure) a Poet may be condemn'd and yet no delinquent to <hi>Parnassus.</hi> 'Tis true it lies much within the power of such men, who have any reasonable allowance of judgment to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the works of others, but on the other side it deserves some admiration, that those who are but pretenders to it, and who rather keep up a Cabal, or faction of judging, than of abilities fit to sway
<pb facs="tcp:99237:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
others, yet notwithstanding it should lie in their power to suppress the esteem of any; insomuch that an ingenious man might scorn, or at least blush, in behalf of that brow, that should wear a leaf of Lawrel from the favour of these, who like under-graduates in the Schools of the Muses, are too inconsiderable to give Authority to Poesy; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Author of this play may with modesty enough slight the malevolent carriage, as well as impotent censure of those, who by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ass'd by prejudice, effected that injury which was given it in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation, and he doubts not it will be his sufficient vindication to all impartial, that he now commits it to their perusing in print, who could not receive that satisfaction in seeing it, (by reason of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption already mention'd) as he hopes they may by a judicious reading; which had he not cause to believe, he should have been far from presenting that publickly, which could with justice have been nauseated before; it being no less than a double folly, as well as offence, to occasion a second condemnation.</p>
            <p>Besides, it could not be other than imperfectly perform'd by the Actors, who finding the Play abusively treated, were apt enough to neglect that diligence required to their parts, (as I doubt not it was observ'd by many) there being little respect given by them to wit, (let it be never so deserving) if they find it be not so far succesful, as to be beneficial to themselves. In this somewhat resembling the Judgment of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who hold nothing good but what is fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; but as this providence is not always likely to accompany wit, so the Actors may be allow'd to esteem such Plays that get them most, though it be little credit to their judgments or their Playing, if the latter were not in some kind suitable to that wit, which has ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the good fortune to be receiv'd than good in it self.</p>
            <p>The humour of the age is so much inclin'd to favour low, and farce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Mimikry, together with common place wit, (not less underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing the Stage than the other) frequently observ'd from discourse in Taverns, French-houses, Coffee-houses, together with the loose and debauch'd carriages of men and women put together, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that the wit and beauty of Poesy consist rather in manners feign'd than in such of vulgar observation amongst men, that this Comedy, the humours of which are more remote and Satyrical, could not in reason meet with an applause equal to the former; which though I take to be in some part its commendation, I shall not so far justifie it, as not to give the Reader necessary satisfaction in what he may misconceive from the report or misapprehension of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<pb facs="tcp:99237:4"/>
In order to which before I speak of the parts against which I can gather any objection lyes, I will say something of the design, (which is the foundation of a Play) the deficiency whereof doth ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all Dramatique compositions neither profitable, nor pleasant, like a structure that is rais'd upon an unsound foundation, &amp; though there be never so many supporters applied of wit to keep it from falling, it will be observ'd so leaning, and tottering, that it cannot be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Architecture of the Muses, who are too much the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Science to admit incongruity and error in their works.</p>
            <p>And as to the contrivance of this Play, that it was new, its greatest adversaries will not, I suppose, deny, (I wish they could say as much in behalf of Plays they most esteem;) that it was not improper, I shall as easily manifest: For what can be objected against my introducing the several common-wealths of men, and women, grounded on sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd custome, by affirming it to be novel, and consequently una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable, the objection is not at all solid, because it is not more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that such a manner of rule might be practis'd, than that there were <hi>Amazons</hi> in one or more parts of the world, (if we will believe Authors) who had a supremacy over men, obtain'd by force of law or power, or at some time or other conferr'd on their ambition by a prevalent indulgence to that sex; or that some Countreys at this day admit of Queens as well as Kings, and perhaps it is more the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of usage and manners, than the law of nature, which does ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally incapacitate the Rule of women, there being not seldome to be found as great abilities in them (allowing for the disadvantage they have in not being suitably educated to letters,) as are to be observ'd in men of greatest comprehensions. But this is suggested not disputed here: their characters in this Play being rather made use of to confirm the judgement and practice of the world in rendring them more properly the weaker Sex, than to authorize their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; though the ambition of that Sex, as likewise the value they are apt enough to allow themselves, may call it a severe policy; but women have small reason to complain, if for their greater honour their beauty, and other attractions give them not seldom such a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent esteem that they command in many respects without being oblig'd to power and law, no less absolutely than men. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of this particular.</p>
            <p>For the Characters of this Play, I find those of <hi>Foppering</hi> and <hi>Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock</hi> occasion'd some scrupulous, or inconsiderate spectators to make more than needful objections against them; not but I conceive that
<pb facs="tcp:99237:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there are few characters in the most approved Plays, which keep so strict a decorum with nature and reason, as that there cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd any incongruities in them. Wherefore I shall not so far un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake their vindication, but rather shew how they were usefully to have been receiv'd in order to what was to be expressed by them.</p>
            <p>And first for <hi>Foppering;</hi> in whose Character the reader will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a Satyre against lyars heightn'd by several degrees of traducing of truth; not that every common Lyar keeps that road, or goes so high as the Moon for Fables, which had not been necessary in his case strictly to resemble, because it being satyrically intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this exorbitancy in men, it might be allow'd to be more bold with truth than they usually are, by reason the higher in that case a Character is rais'd, it is more comprehensive of whatsoever can fall under that notion; as we see in his, which doth not only correct vulgar lying, but by an extravagancy of humour ascends to Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, whose faults could not have otherwise been touch'd; as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanc'd in their erroneous computations of the motions of the Moon well known to the learned.</p>
            <p>The like may be said of the part of <hi>Peacock,</hi> whose vanity of self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love is heightned to introduce that Satyr which is usefully designed against the impossibilities pretended by Chymists, and he could be no otherwise than of an extraordinary humour to represent it, for what had been common could not have done it.</p>
            <p>And I differ from their judgments who think, that whatsoever is not vulgarly observ'd amongst men, to be therefore not Poetically allowable, which if true, the wit of Poetry were rather common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place and observation, than invention, in no case to be allow'd. Wherefore there needs no practicable authority for every Character that is produced, if what has been never before observ'd, answer the design of the Author in being useful and corrective to manners, the essential dignity of Comedy, and without which it has small title to that name or desert; besides a Satyr cannot be poetically expressed but it must be highly Hyperbolical, as may be seen in those of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal's,</hi> as also in most of the comedies of <hi>Ben Jhonson</hi> in which are very many characters of no being amongst men, as in his <hi>Devil's an Ass, Cinthio</hi>'s <hi>Revels,</hi> and others; nay in his more exact one of the silent Woman, I doubt not to affirm that there was never such a man as <hi>Morose</hi> who convers'd by a whisper through a Trunk, but the Poets authority in that case is sufficient for what is not probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was an extravagancy well applyed to the humour of such a
<pb facs="tcp:99237:5"/>
person, which is sufficient to direct us that things may be allow'd in a Poetical sence which are not naturally so. Who ever disputed against the wonders mention'd by the Poets, the Metamorphosis of <hi>Ovid, AEsop</hi>'s Fables and the like, by reason that the moral of them is more to be regarded than the truth; which consideration has been the best and general authority of introducing of Fables: wherefore to such as are different in opinion, there needs no other reply, but that they are little skill'd in the Muses, and must be beholding to their ignorance for their excuse.</p>
            <p>As there are few rules for the decision of wit, so it has not always a dignity suitable to its desert, nay very often so far from receiving Justice in that kind, that a judicious person would sooner esteem what generally has been disapproved or condemn'd, than submit his censure to the giddiness of vulgar applause, there being nothing more unstable or erroneous than <hi>vox populi</hi> in point of plays, as the observation of not a few now extant doth manifest; besides that the Major part of Audiences are neither all Poets nor critical enough to determine of approbation or censure, but rather a commixture of men of several capacities, no more fit to conceive judiciously of what they observe, than if a multitude were consulted about a peice of painting, the generality whereof can hardly distinguish betwixt the Trowel and Pencil: so that it is no wonder, if from the confus'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of their Judgment, or as they are decoyed by parties and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (which some to support their wit implore with more devotion than they pay their Muses, to which purpose they are industrious Orators to the Court and Town) we find the most irregular, and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate, obscene and insipid Plays crowded with audiences, where they with better exercise to their bodies sweat for company, than improve their wit, learning, or manners, to do all which should be the use of Plays; whilest the most fortunate of our present Poets may perhaps conceive themselves little less than sacred, in having this vogue, or stream of applause bestowed on their Plays, as if it were the only proper incense to be offer'd to <hi>Parnassus</hi> in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfs: but we may remember that the Red Bull writers, with their Drums, Trumpets, Battels, and Hero's, have had this success for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and perhaps have been able to number as many Audiences as our Theatres, (I will not presume to make the comparison other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise) so likewise the Sock of that stage as well as the Buskin is not so Rank but that it may in some degree tread with our present wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, witness the Farce, <hi>alias</hi> the comedy of <hi>Tu quoque,</hi> no less than a
<pb facs="tcp:99237:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mote for most of the modern of either denomination, and yet of happy memory, in point of audiences, as I doubt not many of ours of the like Genius will be, when they have liv'd as long.</p>
            <p>And though the ear be the principal sense to receive satisfaction from the Stage, yet we find, that of seeing has not seldome a greater predominancy, whilst Scenes, habits, dances, or perhaps an Actress take more with Spectators, than the best Dramatick wit, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of the Age, from whence we may prognosticate, that the enterlude of <hi>Punchinello,</hi> (having some resemblance of the same entertainment) may be as long frequented as either Theatre.</p>
            <p>Not that I instance this, as a froward reflection on the mean re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of this Play, or any concern depending on it, or that I would have any oblig'd to like what in their aprehensions they judge fit to condemn; which whether in this case, it has proceeded from mistake or prejudice, I doubt not the Reader will candidly consider.</p>
            <p>For what value can there be given to wit, that it should be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed worth contending for, or for which a man would so much as seem to take it ill of the world if he be not thought to write or speak so well as he does, or that one more inconsiderable in either should be allow'd to perform both better? wit being so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inseparable Talent of the wise, that it is observable in some degree, not only in men of mean converse, but in the extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Fools, and madmen, and what does little redound to the credit of any that has been most successful (I mean on the Stage,) it has seldome been thought weighty enough for applause by such as have been able to put it to the test of sober judgment, who being few in respect of the gaudy and illiterate numbers that resort to Plays, &amp; will take upon them to be at least so far acquainted with Poetry as to call themselves wits, (though they have little more Title to it than pretence, or as far perhaps as a Baudy, or Tavern Jest can give the denomination) the discerning sort of men are as much disabled from over-ruling their Censures, as the Principles of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, Prudence, and Vertue, are rendred too weak to resist the more prevailing practice of disorder and vice. Wherefore if such who are properly Judges have thought fit to give this Comedy any Credit with the world, the Author will not have cause to conceive its value impair'd by the condemnation of those (though the major part) who wanted either wit, or candor, to allow its repute. As on the other side, the respect of these several persons of ingenuity, and worth, who have thought it deserving
<pb facs="tcp:99237:6"/>
of the Ornaments of their Pens, I doubt not is enough to confirm the Reader that if it be not so good as the Author could wish, it wants not the vindication as well as attest of impartial and knowing appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions.</p>

            <l>THe <hi>New Utopia!</hi> Is't not pretty too</l>
            <l>If this our Comedy more strange things shew</l>
            <l>Than all <hi>Romantick</hi> Tales y'ave heard of old</l>
            <l>Of love and honour? (though more lately told.)</l>
            <l>And that you Ladies, see your Sex above</l>
            <l>The power of men, and so command their love?</l>
            <l>But where's the Art to form these gay things here,</l>
            <l>Led by that Angel Wit, you <hi>Criticks</hi> fear?</l>
            <l>Who (Devil-like) to Poets teach despair:</l>
            <l>Nay more; I'll thus of our men Actors say,</l>
            <l>They sleight perhaps how you'll receive this Play,</l>
            <l>Like lazy Hirelings having shar'd their Pay:</l>
            <l>But for us Women, we protest to Act</l>
            <l>Above the men (who are oblig'd by pact)</l>
            <l>And with that vigour will perform it too,</l>
            <l>You'l wish your own Amours were acted so:</l>
            <l>Tho' 'tis your int'rest to be pleas'd to day</l>
            <l>T' incourage Poets (after him) to pay</l>
            <l>As much beforehand ere we act new Play.</l>
            <l>And then 'tis Odds you'l find such cautious wit</l>
            <l>That few will venture who have ill ones writ,</l>
            <l>To be by <hi>Criticks</hi> and themselves cross-bit;</l>
            <l>Th' excuse the Poet gives, it was wit him</l>
            <l>Perhaps like such who in discourse and Wine,</l>
            <l>Think all they write and say is fine,</l>
            <l>Till wiser thoughts the past condemn<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

            <l>Yet he presumes that most of all you here</l>
            <l>Have been content to pay Six days as dear,</l>
            <l>When but a petty farce has been your Chear;</l>
            <l>But I'd almost forgot that you may take</l>
            <l>A forfeit for each bolder word I speak.</l>
            <l>Tho' it has past, nay held good Prologue sence,</l>
            <l>T' have dar'd you with less wit than confidence,</l>
            <l>Like those <hi>Romantick</hi> favours some dispence:</l>
            <l>'Tis here with Writers as with other men,</l>
            <l>Suppose them rich, their wit you make so then:</l>
            <l>Do the like now; and you perhaps may find</l>
            <l>You' are not Couzen'd more in being kind.</l>

                  <p>I judge you would Sir, but they require a dominion Somewhat more absolute I fear; besides most wives have A larger Prerogative already, than you mention.</p>

                  <p>I Confess it severe—but for such as have wives I suppose they may hold their Capacities, with the Assistance of some others, to serve their Cures: for us that Have none, We must do as well as we can: Women Are like fruitful-Fields; if they lie fallow 'tis our Own faults—but let that pass. You must remember Your utmost time is expir'd.</p>

                  <p>But Sir, I gave her to understand I would be in love With my self only, and that I was resolv'd to think that I am the <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Cupid,</hi> and not she.</p>

                  <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, by extracting of Essences, and Quintessences, with which He pretends to make Gold as fast as one will butter Eggs, or any thing out of nothing if he pleases.</p>

                  <p>That I forgot indeed, why he lives very near the Labour In vain, if you open your mouth in the next Street You'l hear of him, and withall let him know I Commend you to him.—I know hee's fool enough To believe as great an impossibility.</p>

                  <p>The vanity of his humour and weakness of his sence Does sufficiently comply to that purpose—Besides There's no better way to reform folly, than when it suffers By it's own Extravagance: Too much of self-love in any Kind deserves some punishment.</p>

Put it justly in our power to expect, not only that you Should first offer your affections; but with the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary humilities of men, when lying at the feet of Their Mistresses, as by saying, I am, Sir, your humble Lady To serve you—how happy were I to have the least Of your good opinion!
