            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Be pleaſed then to know, <hi>THAT IT IS AN UNDOUBT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED
AND FUNDAMENTAL POINT OF THIS SO

of the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament,
concerning the Commiſſion of Array; <hi>printed by their ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
Order <hi>of 12</hi> Januarii, 1642. <hi>wherein are theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable
paſſages. The</hi> main drift of the Anſwer is to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<hi>That the King by the Common Law may grant ſuch
a Commiſſion of Array as this is, upon this ground,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it's for the defence of the Kingdome: <hi>And, that the
power which he hath to grant it by the</hi> Common Law, <hi>is
not taken away by the</hi> Petition of Right, <hi>or any</hi> former Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
<hi>but the King, notwithſtanding any of them,</hi> may
charge the Subjects, for defence of the Kingdome, ſo as the
charge impoſed come not to himſelf, nor to his particular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>Theſe Grounds thus laid, extend not to the Commiſſion of
Array alone, but to all other Charges that his Majeſtie ſhall
impoſe upon his Subjects, upon pretence of Defence of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
for there is the ſame reaſon of Law for any other Charge
that is pretended for Defence, as for this. If his Majeſtie by
the Common Law may charge his Subjects to finde Arms, and
other things in the Commiſſion enjoyned, becauſe they are for
Defence of the Kingdom; by the ſame reaſon of Law, he may
command his people to build Caſtles, Forts, and Bulworks,
and after to maintain them with Gariſons, Arms, and Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
at their own charges: And by the ſame reaſon he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
his ſubjects to finde Ships, and furniſh them with Men,
Ammunition, and Victuals, and to finde Souldiers pay, Coat
and Conduct-Money; provide Victuals for Souldiers, and all
other things NECESSARY FOR AN<note n="*" place="margin">Do not the Army-Officers now enforce them to all this without a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament?</note> ARMY; theſe
things being as neceſſary for Defence, as any thing that can be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102097:11"/>
done in execution of this Commiſſion. And for that expoſition
of the Petition of Right, and other Statutes therein noted,
(if it ſhould hold) doth it not overthrow, as well the Petition
it ſelf, as all other Lawes that have been made for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
benefit against Taxes and other Charges, either in this or
any other Parliament?</p>
            <p>Theſe Poſitions thus laid down and maintained, <hi>DO
SHAKE THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF THE
KINGDOM, (THE ANCIENT BIRTH-RIGHT OF
EVERY SUBJECT) both for THE PROPERTY OF
HIS GOODS, AND LIBERTY OF HIS PERSON:</hi>
Nay, they ſtrike at the root of Parliaments: What need his
<note n="*" place="margin">Theſe Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulations reach to thoſe at <hi>White-Hall</hi> now, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to impoſe Taxes, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, Exciſes, and make bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Laws, which no Kings there ever did in like nature, nor their Counſels in any Age.</note> Majeſty call Parliaments to provide for Defence of the Realm,
when himſelf may compel his Subjects to defend it without
Parliaments? If theſe grounds ſhould hold, what need the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
grant Subſidies in Parliament for Defence of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in time of real danger, if the king for defence at any
times, when he ſhall only conceive or pretend danger, may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Charges upon his Subjects without their conſent in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>Upon that which hath been ſaid in this and our former <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,</hi>
we doubt not but all indifferent men will be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that this Commiſſion of Array is full of danger and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
to the Subjects of <hi>England, AND AGAINST
THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF THE LAND,
both for PROPERTY OF GOODS, AND LIBERTY
OF PERSON, &amp;c. 2.</hi> As it is against <hi>THE FUNDA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTAL
LAWS OF THE REALM,</hi> ſo no Statute
makes it good, &amp;c. And the Lords and Commons do upon
the whole matter here conclude, that they <hi>are very much ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved,
that after ſo many Declarations and ſolemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations
made by his Majeſty to rule by the known Laws
of this Land,</hi> his Majeſty by advice of his ill-Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
ſhould be perſwaded to ſet ſuch a <hi>Commiſſion on foot,
which is ſo clearly contrary TO THE FUNDAMEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAL

nature muſt needs produce many great enormities.
* Luſt will become a Law,<note place="margin">Nota.</note> and Envy will become a Law,
Covetouſneſſe and Ambition will become Lawes; and
what Dictates, what deciſions ſuch Lawes will produce,
may eaſily be diſcemed in the late Government of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
(and <hi>England</hi> too ſince this.) The Law hath a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to prevent, to reſtrain, to repair evils: without this
all kinds of miſchiefes and diſtempers will break it upon
a State. It is the Law that doth the King to the alegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and Service of his people: it intitles the people to
the Portection and Juſtice of the King, &amp;c. <hi>The Law is
the Bondary, the meaſure betwixt the Kings prerogative,
and the peoples liberty, whiles theſe move in their own Orb,
they are a ſupport and ſecurity to one another: but if theſe
Bounds be ſo removed that they enter into conteſtation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
one of theſe miſchiefs muſt needs enſue. If the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the King overwhelme the liberty of the people, it will be
turned into Tyranny: If liberty undermine the peprogative
it will turne into Anarchy. The Law is the ſafegard, the cuſtody
of all private intereſts, your honours, your lives, your liberties,
and eſtates are all in the keeping of the Law, without this eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102097:19"/>
man hath a like Right to any thing: and this is the condition
into which the Iriſh were brought by the Earle of</hi> Strafford,
(and the Engliſh by others who condemned him.) And
the reaſon which he gave for it, hath more miſchiefe
than the thing it ſelfe: THEY ARE A CONQUER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED
NATION (Let thoſe who now ſay the ſame of
<hi>England,</hi> as well as <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> conſider and
obſerve what follows,) <hi>There cannot be a word more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant
and fruitfull</hi> IN TREASON, <hi>then that word is,
There are few Nations in the world, that have not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
and no doubt but the Conquerour may give what Laws
he pleaſe, to thoſe that are conquered. But if the ſucceeding
Acts and agreements do not limit &amp; reſtrain that Right, what
people can be ſecure?</hi> England <hi>hath been conquered, and</hi>
Wales <hi>hath been conquered; and by this reaſon will be in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
better caſe then</hi> Ireland. <hi>If the King by the Right of a
Conquerour give Lawes to his people, ſhall not the people by the
ſame reaſon be reſtored to the Right of the conquered,</hi> To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
their Liberty if they can? What can be more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
more pernicious than ſuch Propoſitions as
theſe?</p>
               <p>2. It is dangerous to the Kings Perſon: and dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to his Crown: It is apt to cheriſh Ambition, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation
and Oppreſſion in great men: and to beget
Sedition, Diſcontent in the people, and both theſe
have been, and in reaſon muſt ever be cauſes of great
Trouble and Alterations to Prince and State. If the
Hiſtories of thoſe Eaſterne Countries be peruſed, where
Princes order their Affaires according to the miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Principles of the Earle of <hi>Straffords</hi> LOOSE and
ABSOLVED FROM ALL RULES OF GOVERN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT;
they will be found to be frequent in combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
full of Maſſacres, and of the tragicall end of
Princes. If any man ſhall look into our own Stories in
the times,<note place="margin">Nota.</note> when the Laws were moſt neglected, he ſhall
finde them full of Commotions, of Civil Diſtempers:
whereby the Kings that then raigned were alwayes
kept in want and diſtreſſe, the people conſumed with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102097:19"/>
CIVILL WARRES; and by ſuch wicked Counſels as
theſe, ſome of our Princes have been brought to ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
ends, <hi>As</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Note this all whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons-houſe Opinion then.</note> 
                  <hi>no honeſt heart can remember without horror</hi>
and <hi>earneſt Prayer, that it may never be ſo again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. As it is dangerous to the Kings perſon and Crown,
ſo it is in other reſpects very prejudiciall to His Majeſty,
in honour, profit and greatneſſe (which he there proves
at large, as you may there read at leaſure) and yet theſe
are the Guildings and Paintings, that are put upon ſuch
Counſells: Theſe are for your Honour, for your
Service.</p>
               <p>4. It is inconſiſtent with the Peace, the Wealth, the
Proſperity of a Nation. It is deſtructive to Juſtice,
the Mother of Peace: to Induſtry, the Spring of Wealth;
to Valour, which is the active vertue, whereby the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
of a Nation can onely be procured, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and enlarged. It is not onely apt to take away Peace,
and ſo intangle the Nation with warres, but doth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Peace, and powres ſuch a malignity into it, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
the effects of Warre: both to the<note n="*" place="margin">Is not this an experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal truth now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> NOBILITY
and others having as little Security of THEIR PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SONS
OR ESTATES, in this peaceable time, as if the
Kingdome had beene under the fury and rage of Warre.
And as for Induſtry and Valour, who will take paines
for that, which when he hath gotten, is not his own?
or who fights for that wherein he hath no other intereſt,
but ſuch as is ſubject to the will of another? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Shall it be Treaſon to embaſe the Kings Coine; though
but a piece of twelve pence or ſix pence, and muſt it not
needs be the effect of GREATER TREASON to
<note n="*" place="margin">And were they ever ſo baſe, cowardly, ſlaviſh as now?</note> embaſe the Spirits of his Subjects, and to ſet a ſtamp
and Character of Servitude upon them, whereby they
ſhall be diſabled to do any thing for the Service of the
King or Common wealth?</p>
               <p>5. In times of ſudden danger, by the Invaſion of an
enemy, it will diſable his Majeſty to preſerve himſelf and
His Subjects from that danger. When Warre threatens a
Kingdome, by the comming of a forreign enemy, it is no
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102097:20"/>
time then to diſcontent the people, to make them wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the PRESENT GOVERNMENT, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
to a change. The Supplies which are to come in
this way, will be unready, uncertain; there can be no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of them, no dependence upon them, either for time
or proportion. And if ſome money be gotten in ſuch a
way, the Diſtractions, the Diviſions, Diſtempers, which
this cauſe is apt to produce, will be more prejudiciall to
the publick ſafty, than the Supply can be advantageous to
it.</p>
               <p>6. This crime is contrary to the Pact and Covenant between

1 R. 2. in the two Caſes of <hi>Comines</hi> and <hi>Weſton,</hi> and in
the Caſe of the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> for ſurrendring <hi>Barwick</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle

to the <hi>Scots,</hi> in <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds time, though good
defence had been made by him, and that he had loſt his
eldeſt ſon in maintenance of the Siege: and yet the loſſe
of a <hi>Caſtle</hi> Ioſeph not the Kingdome, only the place and
adjacent parts, with trouble to the whole. But by the
<hi>Opinions,</hi> there is a Surrender made <hi>of all our Legall defence
of Property:</hi> that which hath been preacht is now <hi>judged;</hi>
that there is no <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum, between the King and people;</hi>

               <p>The Law is the <hi>Temple,</hi> the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> whether Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
out to run for <hi>ſhelter</hi> and <hi>Refuge:</hi> hereby it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>Templum ſine numine,</hi> as was the <hi>Temple</hi> built by the

Tutelares</hi> are gone. But this is not all the Caſe, that is,
<hi>That the Law now ceaſeth to aide and defend us in our Rights,</hi>
for then poſſeſſion alone were a good Title, if there were
no Law to take it away: <hi>Occupanti concederetur, &amp; melior

the worſt: for beſides that which is <hi>Privitive</hi> in theſe <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,</hi>
there is ſomewhat <hi>poſitive. For now the Law doth
not only not defend us, but the Law it ſelf,</hi> (by temporiſing
Judges and Lawyers) <hi>is made the Inſtrument of taking all
away.</hi> For whenſoever his <hi>Majeſty</hi> or his <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> ſhall
be pleaſed to ſay, <hi>that the good and ſafety of the Kingdome
is concerned, and that the whole Kingdome is in danger, the
when and how, the ſame is to be prevented, makes our perſons and
all we have liable to bare will and Pleaſure.</hi> By this means,
<hi>The Sanctuary is turned into a Shambles; the Forts are ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
that ſo they might neither do us good nor hurt; <hi>But
they are held againſt us by thoſe who ought to have held them for

            <p>and that by our own military Officers, Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,

Order) whoſe words I thought fit thus to tranſcribe at
large, becauſe not only moſt pertinent, but ſeaſonable for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102097:24"/>
the preſent times; wherein as in a Looking Glaſſe, ſome
pretended Judges and Grandees, of theſe preſent and late
paſt times, may behold their own faces and deformities;
and the whole Nation their ſad condition under them.
In the reſidue of that his printed <hi>Speech,</hi> he compares the
<hi>Treaſon</hi> of the <hi>Ship-money Judges,</hi> and of Sir <hi>Robert Treſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium</hi>
and his Complices in XI. R. 2. condemned and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted

<hi>Caſtle,</hi> not out of <hi>conſpiracy,</hi> but for <hi>fear of death</hi> and
corporall <hi>Torments</hi> wherewith they were menaced: whoſe
offence he there makes tranſcendent to theirs then in
ſix particulars, as thoſe who pleaſe may there read at
leiſure, being over large to tranſcribe, I could here inform
you, that the Fundamentall lawes of our Nation, are the
ſame in the Body politique of the Realm, as the Arteries,
Nerves, Veins, are in, and to the naturall Body, the Bark
to the tree; the Foundation to the Houſe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the cutting of them aſunder, or their Subverſion,
muſt of neceſſity, kill, deſtroy, disjoyne and ruine the
whole Realme at once: therefore it muſt be Treaſon in the
higheſt degree. But I ſhall only ſubjoyn here ſome materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
paſſages, in his <hi>Argument at Law,</hi> concerning the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder
of high Treaſon of</hi> Thomas <hi>Earl of</hi> Strafford, <hi>before a
Committee of both Houſes of Parliament in</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>Hall,</hi>
April 29. 1641. ſoon after <hi>printed and publiſhed by Order of
the Commons Houſe:</hi> wherein <hi>p. 8.</hi> he laies down his Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
recited again, p. 64.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> (Straffords) <hi>Endeavouring</hi> to ſubvert the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
Lawes and Government of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and inſtead thereof to introduce a tyrannicall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt Law, is Treaſon by the Common-Law.
<hi>That Treaſons at the Common-Law, are not taken away by
the Statutes,</hi> by 25. E. 3. 1. H. 4. c. 10. 1. Mar. c. 1. nor any
of them.</p>
            <p>The Authorities, Judgements in and out of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which he cites to prove it, have been already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102097:24"/>
with ſome others he omitted; I ſhall therefore but
tranſcribe his Reaſons to evince it to be <hi>Treaſon,</hi> ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added
to thoſe alledged by him againſt the <hi>Ship money
Judges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pag. 12. <hi>It is a Warre againſt the King</hi> (Let our Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Officers and ſouldiers conſider it) <hi>when</hi> intended.
<hi>The alteration of the Lawes or Government in any part of them.</hi>
This is a levying Warre againſt the King (and ſo <hi>Treaſon</hi>
within the Statute of 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> E<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3.)</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe the King doth maintain and protect the Lawes in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part of them.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe they are the Kings lawes. He is the Fountain from
whence in their ſeverall Channels, they are derived to the Subject.
Whence all our indictments run thus: Treſpaſſes laid to be done, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
pacem Domini Regis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> againſt the Kings Peace for exorbitant
offences; though not intended againſt the Kings Perſon; againſt
the King his Crown and dignity.</p>
            <p>Pag. 64. In this I ſhall not labour at all to prove,
<q>That the endevouring by words, Counſels and actions,
<hi>To ſubvert the Fundamentall Lawes and Government of the
Kingdome is Treaſon at the Common Law.</hi> If there be any
Common Law Treaſons at all left, NOTHING TREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON
IF THIS NOT, TO MAKE A KINGDOME
NO KINGDOME. Take the Polity and Government
away, <hi>England's</hi> but a piece of earth, wherein ſo many
men have their commerce and abode, without rank or
diſtinction of men, without property in any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than in poſſeſſion; no Law to puniſh the murdering,
or robbing one another.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Pag. 70, 71, 72. <hi>The horridneſſe of the offence in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to overthrow the Lawes and preſent Government,</hi> hath
been fully opened before. The <hi>Parliament</hi> is the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of the whole Kingdome, wherein <hi>The King as
Head, your Lordſhips as the more Noble,</hi> and <hi>the Commons,
the other Members are knit together in one body Polititick.</hi> This
diſſolved, the Arteries and Ligaments that hold the body
together, THE LAWES. He that takes away the Lawes,
takes not away the Allegiance of one Subject only, but
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102097:25"/>
of the whole Kingdome. It was made <hi>Treaſon</hi> by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of <hi>13. Eliz.</hi> for her time to affirm, <hi>That the Lawes
of the Realme doe not binde the deſcent of the Crown.</hi> No
Law, no deſcent at all, NO LAWES NO PEERAGE,
no ranks nor degrees of men, the ſame condition to all.
Its <hi>Treaſon</hi> to kill a Judge upon the Bench; this kils not
<hi>Judicem ſed JVDICIVM.</hi> There be twelve men, but no
Law; never a Judge amongſt them. <hi>Its felony</hi> to embe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel
any one of the Judiciall Records of the Kingdome:
<hi>THIS AT ONCE SWEEPS THEM ALL AWAY and
FROM ALL.</hi> Its <hi>Treaſon</hi> to counterfeit a twenty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
piece: here's a counterfeiting of the Law: we can
call neither the counterfeit nor the true coin our own.
Its <hi>Treaſon</hi> to counterfeit the Great Seal for an Acre of
Land: No property is left hereby to any Land at all,
<hi>Nothing Treaſon now, againſt King or Kingdome; No Law to

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My Lords, if the queſtion were asked in <hi>Weſtminſter
Hall,</hi> whether this were a Crime puniſhable in <hi>Star Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
or in THE KINGS BENCH, by Fine or impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
They would ſay, <hi>It were higher.</hi> If whether Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony?
They would ſay, That is an offence only againſt
the life or goods of ſome one, or few perſons. It would
I beleeve be anſwered by the <hi>Judges,</hi> as it was by the
Chief Juſtice <hi>Thirning,</hi> 21 R. 2. <hi>That though he could not
judge the Caſe TREASON there before him, yet if he were a
Peer in Parliament; HE WOVLD SO ADJUDGE IT.</hi>
(And ſo the Peers did herein <hi>Straffords,</hi> and not long after
in <hi>Canterburies</hi> Caſe, who both loſt their heads on Tower

            </p>
            <p>I have tranſcribed theſe paſſages of Mr. <hi>Oliver St. Iohn</hi> at

            <p>1. Becauſe they were the voice and ſenſe of the whole
Houſe of Commons by his mouth; who afterwards own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ratified them by their ſpeciall Order for their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
in print, for information and ſatisfaction of the
whole Nation, and terrour of all others who ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that, either ſecretly or openly, by fraud or force, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly

or indirectly, attempt the ſubverſion of all, or any
of our Fundamentall Laws, or Liberties, or the alteration
of our Fundamentall Government, or ſetting up any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytrary
or Tyranicall Power, Taxes, Impoſitions, or new
kinds of arbitrary Judicatories, and impriſonments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
theſe our Lawes and Liberties.</p>
            <p>2. To mind and inform all ſuch who have not only
equalled, but tranſcended <hi>Strafford</hi> and <hi>Canterbury</hi> in theſe
their <hi>High Treaſons,</hi> even ſince theſe <hi>Publications, Speeches,</hi>
and their <hi>exemplary executions,</hi> of the hainouſneſſe, in excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſableneſſe,
wilfulneſſe, maliciouſneſſe, Capitalneſſe of
their crimes; which not only the whole Parliament in
generality, but many of themſelves in particular, ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
proſecut, condemned, and inexorably puniſhed
of late years in them: that ſo they may bewail, repent
of, and reform them with all ſpeed and diligence, as much
as in them lies. And withall, I ſhall exhort them ſeriouſly
to conſider that Goſpel terrifying paſſage, <hi>Rom. 2. 1, 2,
3. Therefore thou art inexcuſable O man, whoſoever thou art that
judgeſt; for wherein thou judgeſt another, thou</hi> CONDEMNEST
THY SELF, FOR THOU THAT JUDGEST,
DOEST THE SAME THINGS. <hi>But we are ſure that the
judgement of God is according to truth againſt them which commit
ſuch things. And thinkeſt thou this, O man, that judgeſt them
which do ſuch things, and doest the ſame, that thou ſhalt eſcape the
Judgment of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. To excite all Lawyers, expecially ſuch who of late
times have taken upon them the ſtile and power of Judges,
to examine their conſciences, actions, how far all or any
of them have been guilty of theſe crimes and Treaſons, ſo
highly agravated, and exemplarily puniſhed of former and
latter times, in corrupt, cowardly time-ſerving, degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Lawyers and <hi>Judaſſes,</hi> rather then <hi>Judges,</hi> to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace

But to avoid prolixity, (the double <hi>Jury</hi> of irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable

more, wherewith I ſhall conclude this point.</p>
            <p>The firſt is a very late one, in a Treatiſe intituled, <hi>A
true State of the Common wealth of</hi> England, Scotland <hi>and</hi>
Ireland, <hi>and the Dominions thereunto belonging, in Reference
to the late eſtabliſhed Government, by a Lord Protector and a</hi>

expreſſions of them, p. 13, 14, 16, 17, 21, 22. <hi>But on the
contrary, it ſo fell out in a ſhort time, that there appeared many
in this Aſſembly of very contrary Principles to the intereſt afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
which led them violently on to attempt and promote many
things, the conſequence whereof woul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the fundamentall Laws of the Land, the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Property, and an utter extinguiſhment of the
Goſpel. <hi>In truth their Principles led them</hi> TO A PUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LING
DOWN ALL AND ESTABLISHING NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THING.
<hi>So that inſtead of the expected ſettlement, they were
running out into</hi> FURTHER ANARCHY and CONFU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SION.
<hi>As to the Laws and Civil Rights of the Nation, nothing
would ſerve them, but</hi> A TOTALL ERADICATION OF

a <hi>Summary</hi> of the chiefeſt and moſt conſiderable of
them, which our prudent Anceſtors in former ages, and
our lateſt reall Parliaments, have both declared to be,
and eagerly conteſted for, as <hi>Fundamentall</hi> and Eſſentiall
to their very <hi>being</hi> and <hi>well being,</hi> as a <hi>Free people, Kingdome,
Republick,</hi> unwilling to be enſlaved under any <hi>yokes</hi> of
Tyranny or arbitrary power, that ſo the whole Nation
may the more perſpicuouſly know and diſcern them, the
more ſtrenuouſly contend for them, the more vigilantly
watch againſt their violations, underminings in any
kind, by any Powers, or Pretences whatſoever; and
tranſmit, perpetuate them intirely to their poſterities, as
their beſt and chiefeſt inheritance.</p>
               <p>I ſhall compriſe the <hi>Summe</hi> and Subſtance of them all
in theſe 9. Propoſitions; beginning with the Subjects
Property, which hath been more frequently, univerſally
invaded, aſſaulted, undermined by our Kings, and their
evill inſtruments; and thereupon more ſtrenuouſly, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
and vigilantly maintained, retained by our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
Parliaments and the people in all ages (till of late
years) than any or all of the reſt put together, though
every of them have been conſtantly defended, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when impugned, or incroached upon by our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors

               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:102097:29"/>
1. That no Tax, Tallage, Aid, Subſidy, Cuſtome,

               <p>3. That no Freeman of <hi>England,</hi> unleſſe it be by Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Grant and Act of Parliament may or ought to be
compelled, enforced, preſſed or arrayed to go forth of
his own Countrey (much leſſe out of the Realm into

               <p>4. That no Freeman of <hi>England,</hi> may or ought to be

               <p>5. That the old received Government, Laws, Statutes,
Cuſtomes, Priviledges, Courts of Juſtice, legall Proceſſe
of the Kingdome and Crown ought not to be altered, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed,
ſuppreſſed, nor any new from of Government,
Law, Statute, Ordinance, Court of Judicature, Writs, or

the Free men of <hi>England,</hi> by any Perſon or Perſons, but
onely in and by the Kingdomes free and full Conſent in a
lawfull Parliament, wherein the Legiſlative Power ſolely
reſides.</p>
               <p>6. That Parliaments ought to be duly ſummoned, and

ſecluded thence. And that all Parliaments not thus duly
ſummoned, elected whilſt held, but unduly packed, and
all Acts of Parliament fraudulently and forcibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured

as void, and of dangerous preſident.</p>
               <p>7. That neither the Kings nor any Subjects of the

               <p>8. That all Subjects of the Realm are obliged by Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
