            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THe habitable Earth, by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine diſpoſal, beſtow'd upon the Children of Men, is but one great Iſland. And thoſe Four eminent Parts of it which divide the whole among them, not by equal portions, but by the caſual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of Seas, are not totally ſeparated one from another; but make one perpetual Continent. <hi>Africa</hi> is joyn'd to <hi>Aſia,</hi> by no very ſmall neck of Land betwixt the Mediterranean and the Red Sea: And is no more an Iſland properly ſo call'd, than <hi>Peloponneſus. Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> are joyn'd above the Lake of <hi>Maeotis</hi> with a large ſpace of ground betwixt the <hi>Hyperborean</hi> Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and that Lake. And <hi>Aſia</hi> is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>America,</hi> by the Streights of
<pb facs="tcp:95403:6"/>
               <hi>Anian</hi> in all probability. There has nothing yet been diſcover'd to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and the great Abſurdities that attend the peopling of it are no way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſily ſolv'd. Beſides this Main Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent which is mounted above the Face of the Waters in one entire continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of parts, there are many leſſer Iſlands, entirely ſurrounded by the Sea, and divided from all other ground. And all theſe are but ſmaller Siſters to that great product of Nature, the Main Continent, not differing from it in kind, but in bulk and ſize. Whether they owe their birth to the general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, or date their antiquity from the day of the Creation, the Scripture is ſilent, and ſo am I. The Opinion of ſeveral Iſlands being rent from the Main Continent, by the violent Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Seas, has been more forwardly embrac'd, than convincingly prov'd, and owes more to Poetical Fancy, than to any ſolid Foundations of Philoſophy. However, certain it is, that many Iſlands are of later Antiquity than either the Creation, or the Flood, as on the contrary, many have either
<pb facs="tcp:95403:7"/>
ſubſided, or been over-whelm'd.</p>
            <p>The ſame Earthquake does ſometimes produce both effects; and the ſame time brings Birth to one, and Burial to another. But theſe are the irregular miſcarriages of nature, labouring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Convulſion Fit, and teach us what may be, not what muſt be; what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may ſometimes ſuffer, not what ſhe always doth. As for the whole Globe of Earth and Water, the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable intermixture of them both for uſe and beauty, doth highly beſpeak the Wiſdome of the Maker, and doth no leſs merit our contemplation, than the Canopy of Heaven. And that the rather, becauſe the inferiour World doth more neerly approach our Senſes, and affords us clearer notice of their ſtate and condition. Among all the aſſociate Collection of Iſlands, that by reaſon of their mutual vicinity, paſs under one common name, there are none more remarkable than thoſe of the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea, or the <hi>Archipelago.</hi> Theſe were ſo eminent in the days of the Prophets of the Old Teſtament, that from them all the Weſtern parts of
<pb facs="tcp:95403:7"/>
the then known World that was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted principally by the Sons of <hi>Japhet,</hi> went under the common name of the Iſles of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the Iſlands of <hi>Chittim.</hi> The <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> the firſt eminent Navigators ſince the Flood, and the firſt Planters of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Civility, as well as Colonies, along the ſhores of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> and <hi>Atlantick</hi> Seas, began their diſcoveries in theſe Iſlands: And there they have left ſuch viſible Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of their firſt Plantation, that the names they bear to this day are moſt of them of <hi>Phoenician</hi> Extraction. The Colonies planted in theſe Iſlands by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> gave beginning to all thoſe Arts and Sciences for which the <hi>Greeks</hi> were afterwards ſo famous, and their Language been held in ſuch admiration to this day. The <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick</hi> Iſlands are known all by <hi>Greek</hi> names; but they are as far inferiour to the <hi>Cyclades</hi> in renown, as they are in number, having neither been the Scene of Actions recorded by ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal pens, nor the native Soil of perſons ſo eminent for Arts and Arms.
<pb facs="tcp:95403:8"/>
The conceit of <hi>Elyſium,</hi> or ſuch a future happineſs as the <hi>Heathens</hi> dream't of, was thought fit by their Poets to be fix'd upon ſome remote Iſlands; therefore call'd the <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> or <hi>Fortunate Iſlands.</hi> The <hi>Heſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides</hi> and <hi>Canaries</hi> have been Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors for the Title, and our modern ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers into <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Antiquity do ſtrain hard to make the <hi>Caſſiterides,</hi> or the <hi>Scilly</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> and <hi>Angleſey,</hi> put in for a claim. But the Poets have been more accurate in maintaining the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of an earthly Paradiſe, and deſcribing a felicity of ſtate beyond that of a <hi>Platonick,</hi> or <hi>Utopian</hi> Commonwealth, than in directing us by any rules of Geography, where it is to be found. And as they have left it indifferent to the Reader to fix the Local Situation of ſuch Iſlands where they will, ſo they have left it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to any Reader to find ſuch a place in the whole World. Indeed it is the high prerogative of great and laſting Wits to affix an eſteem and veneration upon thoſe places they make the Stage of their Stories, be they true or falſe.

But in this point of credit, the Iſlands of the <hi>Archipelago</hi> do far ſurpaſs any other in the World. And this is true, not only of the licentious and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Fables of their Romantick <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thologie;</hi> but alſo in the graver and more creditable Records of ſober Hiſtory. They did heretofore in a manner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs the Monopoly of all the Wit and Fancy both of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome:</hi> Inſomuch, that 'tis hardly poſſible for a man well vers'd in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues, to be a ſtranger to the antient Geography of theſe Places: And <hi>Pliny,</hi> who was in nothing leſs erroneous, than in this part of his natural Hiſtory of theſe Iſlands, does honour the Bay wherein they are ſituate, with the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Sinus claritatis literarum.</hi> A large <hi>Encomium,</hi> and ſuch as no other aggregate body of Iſlands had equal right to. The <hi>Japan, Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,</hi> and <hi>Molucco</hi> Iſlands in the <hi>Oriental Ocean,</hi> are far beyond theſe for number; but the only thing they are ſought for is ſome natural products peculiar to their Soil and Climate, in which commendation, they do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb facs="tcp:95403:9"/>
the late diſcoveries in the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> Ocean; but we find not that the World was ever beholding to the one, or the other, for the Propagation of Learning or Civility. Nor is it only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for the early riſe of Humane Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and civil Culture, in the days of <hi>Gentiliſm;</hi> but alſo for the early appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the more glorious Sun-ſhine of the Heavenly Doctrin of the Goſpel. St. <hi>John</hi> the Divine, honoured in the Oracles of God, with the peculiar Title of <hi>the Diſciple whom Jeſus loved,</hi> was once an Inhabitant of theſe Iſlands; where he founded the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and writ that Divine and Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Book, which was indeed to him <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> but to all future ages <hi>Apocrypha.</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that great Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> did often croſs this Sea, to plant the Doctrin of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all the neighbouring Shores of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia.</hi> And in future ages, when the Divine Providence rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Emperour to protect his Church from perſecution, theſe Iſlands were the very centre of once the moſt Orthodox and learned Church in
<pb facs="tcp:95403:9"/>
the World. To whom we owe not only the tranſmitting the Holy Scriptures to our knowledge; but alſo the digeſting the Doctrin of them into Articles of Faith, the defence of Truth againſt all invaſion of Errour, the faithful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of moſt pure and primitive Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the clear Expoſition of many obſcure paſſages, which without their direction, might have been at this day unintelligible, and the great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of many bearned and elaborate Volumes of Orthodox Divinity, both Polemical and Practick. And of all thoſe many different Sects of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> in the Eaſt, they have to this day moſt firmly retain'd the ancient Truths, and made the leaſt Deviation into Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. If that ignorance which thoſe barbarous extinguiſhers of learning, the <hi>Turks,</hi> keep them in, renders that afflicted Nation obnoxious to be impos'd upon, and incapable of knowing better, it deſerves rather our pity, than our contempt and ſcorn. It is rather a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of Gods gracious Providence, that under ſuch tyrannous Maſters, and ſuch proud and contemptuous enemies of
<pb facs="tcp:95403:10"/>
the common name of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> the light of Evangelical Truth is not only dim'd, but utterly extinct, as it has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church in <hi>Africa,</hi> once inferiour to none for purity of Doctrin, and piety and learning in their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours. Yet this cannot be deny'd them, but that they accord with us in many things wherein we differ from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Church. I may add this more, that in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, the <hi>Greek</hi> Church doth not bear that confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity or ſimilitude with the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, as the great Champions for <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> would affix upon them. And that will eaſily appear in theſe particulars. 1. They uſe not the Elevation of the Hoſt. 2. No carrying it in Proceſſion. 3. The People ſtand when they receive it. 4. They give it in both kinds to all. 5. The bread is of a common ſort before Conſecration. It is beſides, the buſineſs of this Preface, to enlarge upon the preſent State of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, which the reverend Author hath in ſome meaſure done in his account of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi> and Mount <hi>Athos:</hi> And that ſubject is more largely handl'd by a late

All that I ſhall add is, that ſcarce any part of <hi>Greece</hi> has leſs intermixture with the <hi>Turks</hi> than theſe Iſles, where the <hi>Greek</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Religion is leſs intrench'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There are no leſs than twenty Biſhops in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> ſome with the Title of <hi>Metropolite,</hi> as <hi>Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn</hi> and <hi>Methymia;</hi> others with the Title of Arch-Biſhop, as <hi>Samos,</hi> and <hi>Andros,</hi> and ſome with the bare Title of Biſhop, as <hi>Sciathus.</hi> Yet neither of the two firſt differ from the laſt in any thing, but in Title, or priority of Place. Their juriſdiction is alike, it being ordinary here for a <hi>Metropolite,</hi> and an Arch-Biſhop to be without a <hi>Suffragan.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe of the great Revolutions, many of the old Biſhopricks are loſt, and the ancient frame of Eccleſiaſtical Polity much alter'd. The Patriarch continues the Title of <hi>Metropolite</hi> upon all the places that formerly were ſo, and the litle of Arch-Biſhop, upon thoſe that depend immediately upon the Patriarch, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſubjection to a <hi>Metropolite,</hi>

The ruins which yet are to be ſeen

there are a Teſtimony of her former greatneſs and wealth. But this Iſland hath been ſubject to great changes and revolutions, even to utter deſertion of Inhabitants for many Years. Yet it being my main intent to give an account of its preſent State, I ſhall wave the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Tranſactions of Ancient times, whereof there is frequent mention amongſt Hiſtorians, and proceed to a ſurvey of its condition in theſe Modern Times, under the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire; how it is now Govern'd; what Revenues it yields, with a Geographical Deſcription of the Country.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that what time it pleas'd God for our ſins to permit the <hi>Turks</hi> to ſubdue <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> the Iſland of <hi>Samos</hi> was totally diſpeopl'd. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards one <hi>Kilitch Aly Baſha</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived here, and Landing with a ſmall Company to Hunt, was ſo taken with the place, that he was reſolv'd to ask leave of the Grand Signior, to re-people the Iſland:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95403:12"/>
Which having done, he tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeveral Families from all the Voiſinage eſpecially from <hi>Metelyne,</hi> ſo that by degrees, it became full of Inhabitants, and now counts to the number of 18 Towns and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, which I ſhall now deſcribe according to their Situation.</p>
            <p>The Iſle of <hi>Samos</hi> is 26, or 27 <hi>French</hi> Leagues in compaſs, and lies in length Eaſt and Weſt. At the Weſt end it has the Iſle of <hi>Nicaria,</hi> ſome twelve Miles diſtant: The Eaſt end is ſo near the Continent of <hi>Aſia,</hi> that in ſome places men can Diſcourſe one with another from the two Shores. This near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Eaſt end of <hi>Samos</hi> to the Continent of <hi>Aſia,</hi> cauſes a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Frith about ſix Miles in length, no where above 3 Miles in breadth, which by reaſon of little Iſlands in it, is a great Neſt of Pirats, whom no Ships that come into this Strait can eſcape, but by putting to Shore on each ſide, where they are in equal danger of being made a Prey. Theſe Pirats for the moſt part are

            </p>
            <p>At the entrance into this Streight, which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Dardbogazy, i. e.</hi> The Mouth of the Streight, lies all along the Mountain for the ſpace of a Mile, the place where the Old City of <hi>Samos</hi> ſtood, remarkable<note place="margin">

            <p>And being once Impriſon'd upon ſuch a pretence, they are ſure to lye faſt till all they have be ſeiz'd.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95403:15"/>
the <hi>Aga</hi> and <hi>Caddee,</hi> gave permiſſion to the Iſlanders to pay a yearly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of 80000 Dollers or Crowns to the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Yet after the Peace made, when the <hi>Turks</hi> were re-eſtabliſh'd, they would neither repair their batter'd Moſque, nor build a new one, for fear of ſome ſuch caſualty.

            <p>In former times, the greateſt part of the Iſles of the <hi>Archipelago</hi> were under the Juriſdiction of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Rhodes;</hi> and this Iſle had a Biſhop that was Suffragan to that Arch-Biſhop.

And in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it continu'd for an hundred years, 'till the People of the Iſle did petition the Patriarch to let them have an Arch-Biſhop, which accordingly he did, and appointed them the Biſhop of <hi>Nicaria</hi> for their Suffragan; but that Iſland being too
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95403:27"/>
poor to maintain a Biſhop at this day the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Samos</hi> has now no Suffragan at all.</p>
            <p>When a new Arch-Biſhop comes, he ſhews his Patent from the Grand Signior to the <hi>Caddee;</hi> then ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons all the <hi>Proeſti</hi> of the Villages, to whom having read his Patent, he has it Regiſter'd in the publick Records of the Iſland. This done, they all accompany him to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Church, where after the Reading of his Inſtitutions, given by the Patriarch, he is plac'd in the Archiepiſcopal Throne, where eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one comes to kiſs his Hand, and he beſtows upon them his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; and then makes them a Speech (if he find himſelf of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient capacity to do't.)

            <p>At his firſt coming, the <hi>Papas,</hi> or Pariſh Prieſt of the Church of his Reſidence preſents him 15, or 20 Dollers; they of the other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches according to their Abilities.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95403:28"/>
The firſt year of his coming, every Pariſh Prieſt pays him 4 Dollers, and the following years 2. Every Lay-man pays him 48 Aſpers, and the following years 24. The reſt of his Revenues comes in by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations and Marriages.

After he had been Arch-Biſhop 15 years, upon a Complaint made againſt him by the Iſlanders to the <hi>Capitan Baſha,</hi> or Admiral of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet, he was clapt into priſon, whence being releas'd by a ſum of Money, he became afterwards Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia.</hi>

               <hi>Cornelius</hi> of <hi>Metelyne</hi> was depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> after he had ſat ſix years.</p>

               <hi>Chriſtophorus</hi> a <hi>Samian,</hi> was clapt into the Galleys by the <hi>Venetian</hi> Admiral, for not paying Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time; for hapning to be Arch-Biſhop in the beginning of that War between the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> (ſo calamitous to all the <hi>Greek</hi> Iſles) the <hi>Venetians</hi> then Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters at Sea, forc'd all the <hi>Archipelago</hi> to contribution.

And not only thoſe <hi>Greek</hi> Prieſts that live under the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> but alſo thoſe <hi>Greeks</hi> that in <hi>Sicily, Calabria,</hi> and in the Iſlands under the State of <hi>Venice</hi> do em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, are by allowance of the Pope permitted to Marry. And ſuch Men (though

Marry'd) are commonly Ordained Prieſts at <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, by ſome <hi>Greek</hi> Biſhop of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion in the College of <hi>Greeks</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in that of <hi>Spain,</hi> and in that called <hi>Madonna del Populo:</hi> Yet the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, for that eſteem they have of a Monaſtick Life, do never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a Pariſh Prieſt to a Biſhoprick, except his Wife be Dead, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorc'd from him, and he take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the Habit and Profeſſion of a <hi>Caloir.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Marry'd Man, that would take Orders, is required to declare, that he has been but once Marry'd, and that his Wife was neither a Widow, nor a Slave, nor the Daughter of a Slave, or under the reproach of an Harlot: This done, he comes to a Confeſſour, who among other Sins, doth particularly put him upon the Confeſſion of thoſe Sins that by the Canon would exclude him from entring into Orders. And though his Confeſſour give him a good Teſtimony, yet a Week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ordination, the Biſhop
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95403:31"/>
doth openly in the Church charge all the Aſſembly under the Peril of Excommunication, if they know him guilty of any Crime that may render him unworthy of Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to reveal it before the next Sunday: Which if any Man do, and make good his Accuſation, he is denied Holy Orders; if the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer be found to Impeach him falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he is Excommunicated for his falſe Accuſation, and the other Ordain'd. After the <hi>Candidate</hi> for Holy Orders has thus made his way, the day before he enters into Prieſts Orders, he comes to the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, who having try'd whether he Read and Write without falſe Pronuntiation, or miſ-ſpelling; and being ſatisfied in that point, doth preſently Ordain him Sub-dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con and Deacon, and the next day Prieſt, if he be of ſufficient Age. The Age for a Reader is 18; For a Sub-Deacon, 20; For a Deacon, 25. For a Prieſt, 30; Nevertheleſs it is left to the Diſcretion of the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polite, to diſpenſe with the Canon,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95403:31"/>
as he ſhall ſee occaſion, according to the example of <hi>Anicetus,</hi> who Ordained St. <hi>Eleutherius</hi> a Prieſt at 18, and Biſhop of <hi>Illyrium</hi> at 20. If a <hi>Papas</hi> Marry a ſecond time, he is deprived of his Orders, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ever after <hi>Apopapas.</hi> But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinders the Widow of a Prieſt to Marry again.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Papas</hi> is obliged to Read Prayers, and Adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament every Sunday and Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. The day before a Sacrament, he is to ſing the Veſpers, and after Supper, to rehearſe a Prayer call'd the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; if after that Prayer ſaid, he chance to Eat or Drink that Night, he is oblig'd to go to Church, and ſay that Prayer again: Likewiſe that Night he is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to lye with his Wife.</p>
            <p>Every Pariſhioner is obliged to bring to Church a Loaf to the Weight of ſeven or eight pounds, which is mark'd with theſe three words; <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>If any man deſire the Sacrament upon other days than Sundays or Holidays, he ſends to the Prieſt the day before, to prepare himſelf according to the Canon. The next Morning the Prieſt ſends to him to bring with him what is neceſſary for Celebration, <hi>viz.</hi> a Loaf, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked as before, a Wax Taper of two Aſpers, and Incenſe of one Aſper, (for they never Celebrate without a lighted Taper, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe) and a Quart of Wine, and three Aſpers in Money: What is left of the Bread and Wine, goes to the Prieſt with three Aſpers. He that leaves it to the Prieſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide neceſſaries, brings with him 15 Aſpers.</p>
            <p>The Pariſh Prieſts, excepting thoſe that are very ancient, or Widowers, never confeſs any. That employment is left ordinarily to the <hi>Caloirs</hi> of the Order of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> whereof there wants not ſome every where diſperſed throughout
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95403:32"/>
the whole <hi>Greek</hi> Church, to beg Almes for the Monks of <hi>Athos,</hi> from whence they are ſent. Yet neither they, nor any Pariſh Prieſt confeſs any without a particular Licenſe from the Metropolite, who doth enjoyn them under a Mortal Sin, not to exact any Money for Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But if after Abſolution, the Penitent offer any thing, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. If the Penitent deſires any Prayers to be ſaid for him in ſome Monaſtry of Mount <hi>Athos,</hi> he gives Money in conſideration of the Prayers to be ſaid for him.</p>
            <p>If the Pariſh Prieſt have any Lands, he thinks it no ſhame to Till them himſelf. But he reſides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in the Pariſh, to be ready up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions for the Sick, to whom he ſays the Prayers appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Church for Sick people.</p>
            <p>If a Woman be in Child-birth, he is ſent for to ſay ſome Prayers appointed for that occaſion; nor can the company that come to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Woman in her Travail leave the Houſe, 'till the Prieſt come and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95403:33"/>
perform the Sacred Ceremonies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Church, for Women in Child-bed; accounting it a great contempt of God, and a thing ominous and of ill foreboding to the ſucceſs of the perſon in Labour, to neglect their ſolemn addreſs to God in the prayers appointed by publick Authority for that Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency.</p>
            <p>A Woman <note n="a" place="margin">Of their Women in Child-bed.</note> after Child-birth ſtirs not abroad, neither to Church, nor to other Houſes, till 40 days be expir'd.

            <p>The Children ordinarily are not <note n="b" place="margin">Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm.</note> Baptiz'd till 40 days after Birth, ſometimes, under pretence of the Parents or Goſſips abſence, not till half a Year, a whole Year, or more.

            <p>In private Baptiſm they uſe only Water, Oyl, and a Lamp burning before the Picture of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> For there is no Houſe ſo poor, which has not the Picture of the Bleſſed Virgin, or ſome other Saint, before which they pray, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Night, after they have lighted a Lamp.</p>

After the third Bathing, he pours ſome of the Water upon the Child's Head: Then delivering the Child into the hands of the God-Fathers, he puts a Shirt on the Child, with theſe words; <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our merciful God, cloathed with Light, give thee a bright Garment.</hi>

After the Reading of that part of the Liturgy which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Marriage, and the parties enterchanging a Ring, the Prieſt takes two Garlands made like Crowns, and ſigning them with the ſign of the Croſs, he puts one on the Bridegrooms Head, with theſe words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Servant of God</hi> N. N. <hi>is Crown'd to the Servant of God</hi> A. A. <hi>in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, henceforth and for ever.</hi>

            <p>This Bread is laid up till the firſt Sunday after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and then the Prieſt in all his Formalities, ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the Lamps of the Altar, perfumes the Bread with Incenſe, and cuts it into pieces as ſmall as a Grain of Wheat. Then being put up in a certain Veſſel, it is laid up for all occaſions of the Sick for that year. When any is Sick, he takes one of theſe Grains of Bread, and putting it into the Chalice, he carries it in his hand to the Sick Man's Houſe: All that meet him by the way, go back with him to the ſick Man's Houſe: But at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and other Cities where the <hi>Turks</hi> are numerous, the Prieſt carries it ſecretly under his Arm, for fear of ſome affront.</p>
            <p>The Prieſt is oblig'd to carry this Sacrament to thoſe that have the Plague, in which caſe, he puts the Grain of Bread into a Raiſon, and gives it him at the end of a long Cane.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:95403:35"/>When any perſon <note n="a" place="margin">Burial of the dead;</note> dyes, a Lamp is lighted over the Corps, and the Houſe is perfum'd with Incenſe. Then the Corps being ſtript, they dip a Sponge or Lint in warm Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and draw it over the Face, Knees, and Feet, in form of a Croſs: Then taking a white Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Cloth, they make a Hole in the middle, large enough for the Head to come out, and ſewing it up cloſe at the Feet, they cloath him again with the beſt Garments the Party Deceaſed had. When the Corps are ready to go to Church, the Prieſt goes before the Corps with a Croſs and a Taper in his hand, ſinging certain Prayers. At the Church, the Office for the Dead being ended, the Friends and Kindred of the Party Deceaſed, come and kiſs the Corps. The Corps being brought to the Grave, the Prieſt takes ſome of the Earth, and ſprinkling upon the Head, and the Feet, and the two Sides, in form of a Croſs, ſaying theſe words:</p>
            <p>

               <hi>The Earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof; Take O Earth, that which is form'd of thee by the hand of God, who hath received that which was made according to his likeneſs, and do thou take the Body which belongs to thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Prieſt throws upon the Corps ſome Water, or Oyl, out of one of the Church-Lamps, and a piece of flaming Incenſe, and ſo the Corps are covered. In <hi>Samos</hi> they give Bread and Wine at the Church, to thoſe that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Corps to Church.</p>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95403:36"/>
ſpite the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> commanded all the Bakers to raiſe their Paſte with the Blood of Beaſts that were Sacrific'd to Idols. The <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ignorant of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, were about to buy the Bread, till St. <hi>Theron,</hi> that was a Martyr under <hi>Maximin,</hi> appearing to the Patriarch <hi>Eudoxius,</hi> admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd him to forbid the <hi>Greeks</hi> to Eat any Bread of the Bakers ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, becauſe it was mix'd with the Blood of Beaſts offer'd to Idols.

            </p>
            <p>Moreover they have another Commemoration for the Dead, nine dayes after Burial, at the Houſe where the Party dy'd. Then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain forty days; then at the end of three Months; then of ſix Months; then of nine Months,

            <p>Every Pariſh hath an anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Feaſt, in Commemoration of that peculiar Saint or Patron, to whoſe memory that Church is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, and by whoſe name it is called.

<pb facs="tcp:95403:39"/>
were here kept Priſoners. But they are given to a Credulity of new reports more inconvenient than that of old Fables, and that the belief of Treaſures hid in all old Ruins ever ſince the taking of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where ſo much was found long after it was burn'd. This conceit blown up by various reports; and the Itch of talking on one ſide, and the great creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ignorant People on the other, hath encreaſed into a vulgar Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, very incommodious to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and whereat the <hi>Turks</hi> take great advantage againſt them, in caſe they meddle with any Ruins, either for Curioſity or Uſe. And theſe Iſlanders have a common Tradition, that about this old Tower of <hi>Icarus</hi> lyes a great treaſure, whereof part, though not all, they ſay, was carri'd away ſome 40 years ago, by ſome <hi>Aſiaticks,</hi> that came over by ſtealth, and in the Night, dug up all the ground; And an old Man, whom I ſpoke with, that ſaw them at work, but durſt not come neer
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95403:40"/>
till they had all gone aboard, and ſet Sail, upon his approach, found the dead Carkaſe of a Man newly ſlain; whom they ſuppoſe was ſacrific'd to the Genius of the place, or the Guardian Angel of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. They add beſides, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this adventure of the <hi>Aſiaticks,</hi> the place was haunted with a Spirit, which alwaies appear'd in black, and deſtroy'd their Oxen, at leaſt one in a year. But ſince that time, the place was no more haunted, nor did the Labourers ever complain of the loſs of an Ox.</p>
            <p>About this Shore are the beſt Cockles of all the <hi>Archipelago.</hi> The principal Villages are 1. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choria,</hi> of 100 Houſes, and two or three <hi>Ches.</hi> 2. <hi>Steli,</hi> famous for great abundance of Nut-Trees. 3. <hi>Muſara,</hi> beſides which is an Hermitage, and a Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are kept the Reliques of St. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>octiſtes,</hi> who was of <hi>Lesbos,</hi> and whom the People do think yet does Miracles at this day. Here are in the Iſle, the Ruins of a greater
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95403:40"/>
Town than any now is. The Church is yet ſtanding, and goes by the name of St. <hi>Hellens.</hi> The Beauty of its Fabrick, is a clear ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, it was built in the days of the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Emperours; and though it has no Houſe neer hand it, yet great reſort is made hither for Devotion; and from time to time there never wants a <hi>Papas</hi> to ſay the Prayers of the Church in it.</p>
            <p>There are beſides theſe three al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready nam'd, a great many little Villages ſcatter'd up and down through the whole Iſland, which for the number of Houſes, are lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of extent than thoſe in <hi>Samos;</hi> for here every Houſe is environ'd with its proper Garden, Orchard; but the Houſes in <hi>Samos</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly built cloſer, and their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and Orchards at a greater diſtance.</p>
            <p>The whole Iſland is for the moſt part Mountainous, and Rocky. The Valleys are few, and little in compaſs; ſo that with great labour,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95403:41"/>
and difficulty, they force out of ſo barren a Soil, that little Corn they have; which is not ſufficient to feed the Inhabitants above one half the year; and lays a neceſſity upon the <hi>Nicarians</hi> to traffick abroad for ſupplies elſewhere. But principally they trade to <hi>Scio</hi> for Corn, whither they carry Wood from <hi>Samos,</hi> and the neighbouring parts of <hi>Natolia.</hi> They are very expert in making Boats, and ſmall Veſſels, which are in ſuch eſteem, that they are bought up by all their Neighbours. Beſides their Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick in Wood and ſmall Veſſels, they vend good ſtore of Sheep and Goats, wherewith their Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are well ſtor'd. And yet their care to keep them is ſo ſmall, that without either milking them, or driving them into Coats, or Folds, or making any limits or bounds, they only viſit them twice a Year, to count the number of their Flocks, and to imprint the Marks of the proper Owners. Some there are, and thoſe of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95403:41"/>
Richeſt, that are at the trouble of milking ſo many, as may ſupply their Family with Cheeſe. They vend likewiſe good ſtore of Swines Fleſh. Wax, and Honey they have great plenty of, but their Honey is in no great eſteem, becauſe of that bitterneſs of taſte which it receives from their Bees feeding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Firr leaves, which Tree that Iſland abounds with.</p>
            <p>The moſt commendable thing of this Iſland is their Air and Water, both ſo healthful, that the People are very long liv'd, it being an ordinary thing to ſee perſons in it of an 100 years of Age, which is a great wonder, conſidering how hardily they live. There is not a Bed in the Iſland, the Ground is their Tick, and the cold Stone their Pillow, and the Cloaths they wear is all the Coverlet they uſe. They provide no more Apparel than what they wear all at once, when that is paſt wearing any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then think of a new Suit. Betwixt their ordinary times of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95403:42"/>
Eating, there is not a piece of Bread to be found in the Iſle. A little before Dinner, they take as much Corn as will ſerve that Meal, grind it with a Hand-Mill, bake it upon a flat Stone; when 'tis Bak'd, the Maſter of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily divides it equally among the Family; but a Woman with child has two ſhares. If any Stranger comes in, every one parts with a Piece of his own ſhare to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the Stranger. Their Wine is always made with a third part Water, and ſo very weak and ſmall. When they drink it, ſo much as is thought ſufficient is put into one large Bowl, and ſo paſſes round. The <hi>Nicarians</hi> are the only Iſlanders of all the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keep Wine to ſell, nor lay it up in Wooden Veſſels, but in long Jars, cover'd all over in the Ground. When they have a mind to Tap it, they make a Bung-hole in the top, and draw it out with Canes. Their Houſes are ſo plain, that all the Furniture you can ſee is an
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95403:42"/>
Hand-Mill, beſides this, there is nothing but bare Walls: That little they have beſides is all hid under Ground; not ſo much for fear of the <hi>Corſairs</hi> (from whom their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty is a ſure guard) as out of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome. Nor are they all ſo poor, as not to be able to buy Beds, but cuſtom has brought them into a contempt of Beds, as meerly ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous; inſomuch, that when they Travel into other Iſlands, they refuſe the offer of a Bed. A Prieſt of <hi>Nicaria</hi> coming into <hi>Samos,</hi> was courteouſly entertain'd by thoſe of his Order, and at Night was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd a Bed to lye in; he thank'd them, but refus'd, nor could by any importunity be prevail'd upon, but told them the Earth was his Mother, from whence he would not keep a diſtance; beſides he was afraid of being Sick, if he ſhould lye in a Bed; and therefore if they had a kindneſs for him, they muſt give him the liberty of ſleeping after his own Country way.</p>
            <p>When I went to viſit them as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95403:43"/>
Arch-Biſhop, and ignorant of the cuſtom of the Country, carry'd no Bed. At Night, where I firſt lodg'd, asking for a Chamber, they told me they had no other than that where I firſt came; then asking for a Bed, they told me it was not the Cuſtom of the Country; then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to borrow ſome Bed Cloaths for Love or Money, all they brought me was one Smock made of courſe Dimity.</p>
            <p>They have no great communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation one with another, any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the publick times of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Solemnities, or Civil Buſineſs doth cauſe them to come together. At other times they keep ſtrictly within the narrow Sphere of their own affairs. Formal Viſits, Treats, and Entertainments, are things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. If any buſineſs do put them upon a Viſit to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, they come not cloſe to his Door, but ſtand off at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and call aloud to him; If he make them anſwer, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe the Buſineſs they came about,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95403:43"/>
ſtanding off at the ſame diſtance; except they be earneſtly invited to come in. And this way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing at a diſtance they practice more in the Fields and Mountains; their Voices being ſo ſtrong, that 'tis ordinary to talk at a Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; ſometimes at four or five, where the Valleys interpos'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two hills, give advantage to the Voice. Sometimes they can diſcourſe at that diſtance, that the carriage of the Sound through the Winding of the Valleys, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire half a Quarter of an Hours time; and yet they make diſtinct, and proper Anſwers, both audible and intelligible, without the help of a <hi>Stentorophonical</hi> Trumpet.</p>
            <p>Their Habit for the Men, is a Shirt, and over it a ſhort Caſſock, down to the Knees, to which, in Winter they add only a ſhort Veſt, that reaches a little below the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. Stockings they never wear. There Shoes are only a piece of thin Copper, bow'd to the ſhape of their Feet, and every one is his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95403:44"/>
own Shoe-maker. The Women have nothing but one Smock, but ſo large, that they wrap it double, or treble down to the Girdle, but below the Girdle ſingle. The Prieſts, for greater reverence in the Church, ty two Towels about their Legs, the one is their uſual Bonnet, and the other their Girdle: ſo that they perform ſacred Offices un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guirt, as well as uncover'd.</p>
            <p>Of all the Iſles of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> this only admits of no mixture with ſtrangers in Marriage, nor admits any ſtranger to ſettle with them: They being, as they pretend, all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of the Imperial Blood of the <hi>Porphyrogenneti,</hi> muſt not ſtain their noble Blood with inferiour Matches, or mixtures with <hi>Choriats,</hi> or Peaſants, for ſo they term all the other Iſlanders.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Porphyrogenneti,</hi> were thoſe of the Blood Royal, in the Days of the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours, ſo call'd, from their wearing of Purple, which was a Badge of Royalty, and allow'd only to Princes of the

Blood; and not from an houſe call'd <hi>Porphyra,</hi> where the Empreſſes were wont to <hi>lie in.</hi> But Purple was throughout the Eaſt, the known Badge of Royalty. Hence came that unſanctify'd Wit, and learned'ſt Writer that ever oppos'd the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion with his Pen, to be call'd <hi>Porphyrius:</hi> For his true name in the Language of <hi>Syria,</hi> his native Country, was <hi>Malchus,</hi> or King; but the <hi>Greeks</hi> did para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe it <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> or Purple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robed; that being a Colour pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Kings.</p>
            <p>They have a great Happineſs, by reaſon of their poverty, in not being moleſted by the <hi>Turks,</hi> who think it not worth their while to come among them, nor if they ſhould, were they likely to enjoy any quiet, without keeping a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Guard than the Revenues of the Iſle would maintain. Once they ſlew a <hi>Caddee,</hi> ſent by the Grand Signior, and being ſummon'd to Anſwer for their Crime, they by common conſent own'd the Fact,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95403:45"/>
but would name no particular Man. So that the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Officers looking upon their beggerly Cloaths, thought there was neither gain nor glory in puniſhing ſuch Miſcreants, and that in Juſtice, they muſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all, or none, diſmiſs'd them untouch'd. From that time no <hi>Turk</hi> ever troubled them: For they take all courſes imaginable to ſeem poor; and whereſoever they come abroad, they count it no ſhame to beg Alms: Yet they make a ſhift every year to levy 300 Crowns for the Arch-Biſhop. They are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by a <hi>Proeſti</hi> of their own chuſing, who alſo levys their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratch or Tribute to the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, and takes care to carry it to the <hi>Aga</hi> of <hi>Scio.</hi> As for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it is the ſame with that of <hi>Samos;</hi> but their Prieſts are more ignorant.</p>
            <p>Thus you have an account of a ſmall Iſland, the Pooreſt, and yet the Happieſt of the whole <hi>Aegaean</hi> Sea. The Soil is Barren, but the Air is Healthful; their Wealth is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95403:45"/>
but ſmall; but their Liberty and Security is great. They are not moleſted with the Tyrannous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Officer, nor with the frightful Incurſions of barbarous and mercileſs Pirates. Their Diet and Apparel is below the Rate of Beggars in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys, and their Lodging is a thing of no more care, or coſt, than that of the Beaſts of the Field, yet their Bodies are ſtrong and hardy, and the People generally long liv'd. They live with as little forecaſt, as if they expected not to ſurvive a Day, being contented to ſatisfy the preſent neceſſities of Nature. They do properly <hi>In diem vivere,</hi> or as we ſay, From Hand to Mouth. They have but little, yet they never Want. Their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is equal to their Poverty, and contributes much to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. And how well they eſteem of their own condition, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their Neighbouring Iſlands, and ſcorning to mix with them in Alliance by Marriage, is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95403:46"/>
a manifeſt ſign. Whence we may learn, that they approach the neareſt to Contentedneſs is this Life; whoſe deſires are contracted into the narroweſt compaſs.</p>

            <head>A DESCRIPTION Of the ISLE of PATMOS.</head>
            <p>THe Iſle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> now call'd <hi>Patino,</hi> is 36 Miles in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, 40 Miles from the Continent of <hi>Aſia,</hi> towards <hi>Epheſus;</hi> as many Miles diſtant from <hi>Samos</hi> North Eaſt of it; 30 from <hi>Nicaria,</hi> North; 60 from <hi>Paros,</hi> and <hi>Naxos,</hi> Weſt; 60 from <hi>Amurgos,</hi> South.</p>
            <p>The Figure is neither round nor ſquare, but irregular, by reaſon of unequal Promontories and Bays. It is furniſh'd with very commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Havens, to which it owes its being inhabited, though not ſo well as in former times, as appears by the many and great Ruins in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:95403:47"/>This Iſland was eminent for thoſe wonderful Revelations which the Bleſſed Apoſtle, and Evangeliſt St. <hi>John</hi> had in it, during his baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thither in the time of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution under <hi>Domitian.</hi> The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what is related in that Life of St. <hi>John,</hi> that goes under the Name of <hi>Prochorus,</hi> is generally believ'd in <hi>Patmos</hi> to this day. And though the Author might be of later years than <hi>Prochorus,</hi> the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of St. <hi>John,</hi> as the moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Hiſtorians of later days do pronounce him to be: Yet that the whole contents of that Book ſhould be a meer Fable, and nothing but the Product of the Authors invention and fancy, is very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. For though he might take great liberty in the Manner and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of what he relates, yet the Matter and Subſtance were built upon ſome foundations of real Truth, and ſuch as many Books now not extant, and the Streams of Tradition then nearer the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but now run dry, might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95403:47"/>
him with. That the Iſland, at St. <hi>John</hi>'s firſt coming were all Idolaters, had people poſſeſſed with Devils, and were miſ-led with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians, is more than probable. That St. <hi>John</hi>'s caſting a Devil out of young <hi>Apollonides,</hi> had a great influence on the peoples Converſion, and rais'd him the Enmity of a Magician, and all that he could draw after him, is a thing reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly credible. The Name of <hi>Cynops</hi> the Magitian, is known to all the People to this day; yea, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome very improbable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Story, that St. <hi>John</hi> ſhould cauſe him to jump twice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea, and the ſecond time to be turn'd into a Rock, which now bears his name. However it is no ſmall credit to a Place, otherwiſe very inconſiderable, that that great Apoſtle, once the peculiarly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Diſciple; who of all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, did alone ſurvive our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours judicial coming into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Power and Vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation: that he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95403:48"/>
ſhould be for no ſmall time an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of this Iſland, and there Pen that Myſterious and Sublime Book, which to him indeed was <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> but to all others <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha,</hi> to him a Revelation, but to us yet an hidden Myſtery: like the former Prophecies of the Old Teſtament, that were never right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood till actually fulfill'd. The Tradition of this Iſland is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſitive, that he writ his Goſpel here likewiſe, and that upon the Requeſt of the Iſlanders, who at his departure, after ſeven years abode in the Iſland, did importune him to leave them in writing what they ought to believe: Whereupon he ſtaid eight days longer, to dictate the Goſpel to his Diſciples that writ it.</p>
            <p>They add more, that as he was beginning the Work, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a great Thunder and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, whereupon, looking up to Heaven, he ſpake thoſe words; <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The Original of this Iſland, as it is at this day, is aſcribed to St. <hi>Chriſtodoulus,</hi> in the Days of <hi>Alexius Comnenus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was <hi>Alexius Comnenus,</hi> the firſt of that name, in whoſe dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the Holy War, who reigned the 20 laſt years of the tenth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, and the 18 firſt of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, and was contemporary with <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, and <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> of <hi>Bulloigne.</hi> This <hi>Chriſtodou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> was Abbot of <hi>Latros,</hi> and had juriſdiction over ſome 20 Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in <hi>Aſia,</hi> near a great Lake about a days Journey and half from <hi>Epheſus.</hi> He being moleſted by the <hi>Turks,</hi> (whoſe power now mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encreas'd in <hi>Aſia</hi>) obtained leave of the Emperour to build a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry in <hi>Patmos:</hi> Whither having tranſported his Wealth and Family, he built a Monaſtry near the Port
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95403:49"/>
of <hi>Neſtia,</hi> and named it <hi>Rouvali.</hi> But not liking the place, (and as the Tradition goes, being warned by a Viſion, and a Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,) he quitted that Monaſtry, and built another in the higheſt part of the Iſland, and fortifi'd it with a ſtrong Caſtle, environ'd with high and ſtrong Walls: And there he built a Church. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants that lay ſcatter'd in the Iſle, deſired leave to build Huts neer the Monaſtry, for their better Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and defence, in caſe of any ſudden Attaque by Pirats. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time, theſe Huts were chang'd into fair Houſes, and by Trade and Commerce, became a great Town, to the number of 800 Houſes, and there Inhabited by rich Merchants, that traded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all parts. But the many Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions that have happen'd ſince, have eclips'd the former Glory of the place: And their Ships of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe are all dwindl'd into ſmall Fiſher Boats, and the Inhabitants are all extremely poor.</p>

            <p>Let us now return to the State and Government of the Place. The whole Iſland was given by (<hi>a</hi>) <hi>Alexius</hi>

               <hi>Comnenus</hi> to <hi>Chriſtodoulus,</hi> and his ſucceſſours in the Monaſtry, and the Iſlands near about, that were not inhabited. And what Culture they beſtow on the little Iſlands, or what Cattle they put to Grazing there, becomes all a Prey to the <hi>Corſairs;</hi> ſo that the Revenues of this Monaſtry are now much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh'd, and the Monks become extremely poor. And his Son <hi>Calo Johannes,</hi> gave alſo fourteen Villages in <hi>Candie:</hi> But the <hi>Turks</hi> left them but one ſmall Hoſpital in <hi>Candie,</hi> which yields them 200 Dollars a Year, whereas their Revenues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were at leaſt 13000. Beſides the great Monaſtry, there is a little Nunnery, containing 40 Nuns. This was built but an age ago. They purchaſe their living by their labour, for they have no Revenues; only the Abbot of the great Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
<pb facs="tcp:95403:52"/>
is oblig'd to ſupply them with a Reverend Ancient Monk, to do all Sacred Offices among them. Beſides theſe, there are ſome ſmall Hermitages that maintain ſome few Monks. 1.

They have certain Chappels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated for the Labourers, at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Hours, to hear Prayers, and ſo return to their Work.</p>
            <p>And this is the preſent Condition of the Iſle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> once famous for the Reſidence of that great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle St. <hi>John,</hi> and for the great and myſterious Revelation he had in it. But now groaning under the Yoke of ſuch Lords as are common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Chriſtian Faith, by whom they are both kept in great

Then ſhe bid him take no care for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, ſhe would provide, and did avow her ſelf to be the Patroneſs of that Monaſtry, and of the whole Mountain. This Monaſtry is about a Mile from the Sea, on the Eaſt ſide, and hath a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Channel, that brings up Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to their very Walls; where they have a ſtrong Magazin, and a Sentinel perpetually ſtanding to give notice of any <hi>Corſairs.</hi> It hath likewiſe a very fair Church, and in their Hall, where they eat in

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95403:56"/>
Picture, by the report of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was found floating by the Shore. This Monaſtry has good Revenues in <hi>Imbrus,</hi> and maintains 400 Monks.</p>

Here alſo dwells the <hi>Aga,</hi> with two or three other <hi>Turks,</hi> who protects them from all injuries of other <hi>Turks,</hi> eſpecially of the Sea-men from <hi>Barbary,</hi> whom they call <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents.</hi> The <hi>Boſtangy-Baſha</hi> appoints this Officer from amongſt the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtangies.</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:95403:56"/>
He is to ſtay in his Office two years, and then another ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds him. He is maintained at the common charge of the <hi>Caloirs,</hi> who give him a yearly Penſion. And beſides, upon every Church Feſtival, he is invited from Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry to Monaſtry, by courſe, and there, beſides the Entertainment of him and his Retinue, he is always preſented with a Purſe of Money, according to the abilities of the Monaſtry.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Stauro-Nikita,</hi> or <hi>The Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Croſs.</hi> This maintains but 30 Monks. Their Church is dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> where they have in great eſtimation his Picture upon a Board, that was found ready painted, as a Wreck, and devoutly taken up by the Monks of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>

               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:95403:57"/>10. <hi>Touſimenou</hi> has but 80 Monks; the Church is dedicated to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion. It is the pooreſt of all the Monaſtry, not for want of Lands, but of Men to cultivate them. For the ſoil about, is the beſt in all the Mount. It bears Olives of a ſingular largeneſs, and wants no other ſort of Fruit Trees. But the number of the Monks in it amount but to 80, who being not able to make the beſt advantage of ſo much good ground continue poor in a plentiful Soil.</p>
            <p>In the middle of all the Mount ſtands 11. <hi>Chiliantary,</hi> a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> who ſpeak here their own Language, and have their Prayers (though the ſame with the <hi>Greek</hi>) in the <hi>Bulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Language. This is the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Monaſtry of the whole Iſland, and maintains 800 Monks. They have much Land abroad, which they ſend their own Monks to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate.</p>
            <p>12. <hi>Touzographou,</hi> or the <hi>Painters Convent,</hi> from the Founder, who

was a Painter. The Church is conſecrated to St. <hi>George,</hi> it main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains 200 Monks, all <hi>Bulgarians.</hi> There is a little Church not far from this Monaſtry, that ſtands alone, and now is uſeleſs; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a fair Picture of St. <hi>George</hi> in it, the Monks thought fit to bring it into their own Church; but to no purpoſe, for ſo often as they brought it, ſo often it takes its leave, and is found the next day in the Church.</p>
            <p>13. <hi>Xenophon,</hi> a <hi>Burgarian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtry, has but 30 <hi>Caloirs.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>15. <hi>Archangeli,</hi> which had before another name, but changed to this upon this occaſion. A young <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loir,</hi> that was tilling the Ground abroad, found a Treaſure in an old Urn, and brought the news of it to the Superiour of the Convent; he ſent with the young Man two other <hi>Caloirs,</hi> who finding the Treaſure, agreed between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95403:58"/>
to kill the Boy, and ſhare it betwixt them; and ſo they ty'd a Stone about his neck, and caſt him into the Sea, and hiding the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, came to the Superiour, and told him the Boy had deceiv'd them, and was run away. Next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sexton found the Boy and the Stone about his neck in the Church, who diſcover'd all, and told that the Angels <hi>Gabriel</hi> and <hi>Raphael</hi> brought him thither. The two <hi>Caloirs</hi> thus convicted, were baniſh'd, and this ſtone ſet up as a Monument to this day.</p>
            <p>16. The Monaſtry of <hi>Ruſſicon</hi> has a Church dedicated to <hi>Panteleimon,</hi> and maintains 20 <hi>Caloirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. <hi>Xeropotamou,</hi> dedicated to the Memory of 40 Martyrs that were drowned in the Lake of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſte.</hi> This Monaſtry has 300 Monks, and being by the Sea ſide, has a Magazin and a great Watch-Tower. Over againſt this Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, on the Continent of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> ſtands a great Village of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits and religious Perſons, though

without the bounds of the <hi>Caloirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>18. <hi>Simo-Petra,</hi> ſo called, from the Founder and the Foundation. It is ſituate on a Rock, and was founded by one <hi>Simon,</hi> an Hermit, who by his Prayers having cured the Daughter of a Governour of <hi>Caſſandria,</hi> did move him to beſtow enough for to build this Monaſtry, and 200 Monks. They ſhew here an hand for a ſacred Relique of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>'s body, but the Fingers of it are extraordinary great.</p>
            <p>19. <hi>Gregorios,</hi> near the Sea, and much infeſted with Pirats for want of Fortification, and men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, having but 60 Monks.</p>
            <p>20. <hi>Dioniſiou,</hi> conſecrated to St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> whoſe Forehead they pretend to ſhew here as a ſacred Relique. Beſides they ſhew the Bones of one <hi>Nymphus,</hi> once Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who being weary of publick employment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd hither, unknown to any who he was; ſo they looking upon him as a poor Vagabond, that wanted
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95403:59"/>
work, employ'd him as their Mule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer, to fetch in their wood; in which employment he continued with great humility and faithfulneſs many years, not offering to ride any of the Mules going or coming, and kept all the Church Faſts ſtrictly in the midſt of all his drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery. At his death-bed he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to the Superiour who he was, and that he choſe that manner of Life to mortifie his proud Fleſh. Whereupon, looking upon him as a Saint, they keep his Bones as a ſacred Relique.</p>
            <p>21. <hi>Hagios Paulos,</hi> ſo named from the Founder, who was reputed a Saint. It maintains 200 Monks, all <hi>Bulgarians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Paſs we now to the Hermitages, which are very ſmall, but common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo neer one another, as to make the appearance of a Village. There are two places where they lye in great numbers. 1. <hi>Hagia Aena,</hi> or St. <hi>Ain,</hi> from a Church dedicated to that Saint. Theſe are the reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring places of ſuch Hermits as live
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95403:59"/>
by Manufacture, as particularly, the making of Croſſes and Figures that repreſent our Saviours Paſſion, and Seals and Marks proper for the conſecrated Bread. The <hi>Caloirs</hi> that are ſent abroad to confeſs Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to gather Alms for pious Uſes, buy up all theſe Manufactures to preſent unto people among whom they come. Theſe Hermits live more retired and melancholly, being not above two or three, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times but one in an Houſe. And they do imitate the Lives of thoſe antient Monks in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> about <hi>Thebais,</hi> that were imitators of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> who did himſelf, as did all his followers, live and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves by hand labour and manufactures, though of a very mean ſort, yet enough to earn them Food and Raiment. This St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> was the firſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Monk of the World, his Food was only Bread and Water; yet he liv'd 150 years: His fame was ſo great, that <hi>Helen,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, did by letters ſent to him,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95403:60"/>
recommend Her ſelf and her Son to his Prayers. He dy'd in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 361. 2. <hi>Kera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> another plot of Ground, all ſtrew'd with ſuch Hermitages as are at St. <hi>Aine,</hi> and they live in the very ſame manner.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe Hermitages that lye ſo neer in voiſinage, there are above 1000 more diſperſed up and down the Iſland, which do all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to ſome one of the Monaſtries. If a Man deſire to live in a Cell, he gives a certain Rate to that Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry to which it belongs, and ſo is empowr'd to enjoy that Cell, and the Land belonging to't for his life: when he dies, it returns to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtry, and the Monaſtry is Heir to all that he leaves behind him. There are Cells of all rates, from 5 Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to 150. One thing is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that Idleneſs is utterly baniſh'd here, no man lives in the Iſle, who is not ſome way employ'd.</p>
            <p>As for the maintenance of theſe Monaſtries, though their Lands be ſufficient to ſeed them, and their
<pb facs="tcp:95403:60"/>
Mountain furniſh them with Wine enough to drink; yet as the matter is order'd, they commonly want Money to pay their <hi>Haratch,</hi> or yearly Tribute of 3 Dollers <hi>per</hi> Poll, and buy themſelves Cloaths and Furniture for tilling their Land. So that every year they ſelect ſome of their <hi>Caloirs</hi> to go abroad, and beg the Charity of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> People, towards the relief of the reſpective Monaſtry. And theſe are always by two and two together. And the Monaſtries agree before-hand to what particular places they will ſend their reſpective Emiſſaries, who continue ordinarily two or three years in their perambulation. At their coming home, the Money is delivered to the <hi>Skenaphylax,</hi> or the Steward of the Monaſtry; for it is againſt the Rule of their Order, to meddle with Money. He layes it out upon neceſſary occaſions, and what is left, is kept to defray the Charge of another Voyage. They have a Regiſter of thoſe that beſtow any thing, and they pray for
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95403:61"/>
them conſtantly in the Monaſtry.</p>
            <p>When they are choſen to go abroad, the Chief of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry names one of the <hi>Caloirs:</hi> The Perſon named, in token of his obedience, doth proſtrate himſelf on the Ground before the Superiour of the Monaſtry, and riſing, kiſſes the Superiours hand. Then the Perſon firſt nam'd, names thoſe that ſhall go along with him, who in like obedience, firſt proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Superiour, and kiſs his hand, then do the like to the <hi>Caloir</hi> firſt nam'd by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and own him for their Father and Superiour, to whom they owe all obedience during their miſſion. When they go abroad, they firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to the <hi>Metropolite</hi> of the Dioceſe, and ſhew him their Letters of Obedience from their Superiours. Whereupon the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolite</hi> gives them Letters of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to ask Charity, and confeſs Penitents throughout his Dioceſe. Where they Confeſs any, they exact nothing of them by way of pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95403:61"/>
Penance, but only receive what in charity they freely beſtow.</p>
            <p>The beginning of Monks in Mount <hi>Athos,</hi> was from the time that the <hi>Mahometans</hi> invaded <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> where the Monks in thoſe places enjoying no ſecurity of their lives, came into <hi>Gyeece,</hi> and deſired of the Emperour a Place to live in, according to their Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick way. He appointed them Mount <hi>Athos,</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, was the firſt that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a College here. They profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at firſt the imitation of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and St. <hi>Sabas;</hi> but now the Rules of their Order are taken from St. <hi>Baſil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At their firſt coming to Mount <hi>Athos,</hi> they were a Colony of the Monks of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the Rules of St. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and St. <hi>Sabas;</hi> but chiefly the Rules of St. <hi>Sabas,</hi> who liv'd long after St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> when Monkery began to alter its mode and faſhion, and from a caſual Retirement of ſome few men to a rude and ſimple
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95403:62"/>
way of life in the Wilderneſs, to become ſubject to Rules and Orders, to incorporate into Societies, to change their Caves into Cloiſters, and to remove from Deſerts to good dwelling Houſes, and places of better convenience and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. This St. <hi>Sabas,</hi> by his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and ſingular ſtrictneſs, did highly advance the Fame and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of a Monaſtick life. He was by birth a <hi>Cappadocian,</hi> of the Village of <hi>Mutalaſca,</hi> in the Dioceſe of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> and being left Heir to a good Eſtate, under the Care of his Uncle <hi>Hermias,</hi> the perverſeneſs of his Aunt made him quit that Uncles Houſe, and go to <hi>Scandos,</hi> to live with another Uncle, whoſe name was <hi>Gregory.</hi> This breeding a Diſſention between the two Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, he, to avoid all occaſion of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, betook himſelf to the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of <hi>Flavianae</hi> near <hi>Mutalaſca;</hi> whence at the eighteenth year of his Age, he went to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to viſit thoſe places which our Bleſſed Saviours life and death hath made
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95403:62"/>
ſo memorable. At that time the Fame of <hi>Euthymius,</hi> then Abbot of <hi>Laura</hi> by <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> was very great in the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> This enflam'd young <hi>Sabas</hi> with great deſire to be admitted into his Monaſtry: Wherefore one day as <hi>Euthymius</hi> was going to receive the Sacrament, he fell down at his feet, begging leave to be entred into his College: But <hi>Euthymius</hi> gave him the Repulſe, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him it was not fitting that ſo young a Man ſhould be admitted into <hi>Laura;</hi> yet he would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to a ſmaller Monaſtry hard by, where St. <hi>Theoctiſtes</hi> was Abbot: Where having ſtay'd ten years, <hi>Euthymius</hi> admitted him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Cave by his own Monaſtry for five years. Then <hi>Euthymius</hi> ſelected him, and <hi>Domitian</hi> to vye <hi>asketick</hi> Severities in a ſolitary Place for four years, which having perform'd to great admiration, about the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of his Age he retir'd to a Cave by the Brook of <hi>Siloe.</hi> By that time he had liv'd here five years he had a College of Diſciples, to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95403:63"/>
the number of 70, amongſt whom was <hi>John</hi> the Silentiary, Biſhop of <hi>Colonia</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into his Monaſtick life, and afterwards Abbot of this College, which was call'd <hi>Nova Laura.</hi> There were afterwards more Monaſtries of this name in <hi>Palaeſtin. Laura Pyrgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum</hi> by <hi>Jordan,</hi> built by one <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus. Laura Maliſchae,</hi> built by <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,</hi> and <hi>Laura Marichae,</hi> by <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianus,</hi> and <hi>Laura Elcerebae,</hi> by <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus.</hi> But this <hi>Laura,</hi> built by St. <hi>Sabas,</hi> was the moſt Famous, where in his life-time the number of his Monks encreas'd to 150. He was eminent in the time of <hi>Anaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Juſtinus,</hi> and <hi>Juſtinianus,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and dy'd in the 94<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his Age. His name is yet very remarkable among the Eaſtern <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> eſpecially at Mount <hi>Athos,</hi> whoſe firſt Monks were but a Colony of his Diſciples, and whoſe ancienteſt College is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Laura,</hi> from his <hi>Laura</hi> in <hi>Palaeſtine.</hi>

This God-father brings him to the Church door, where he is ſtrip'd to his Shirt, and proſtrates himſelf, then he makes a ſecond proſtration in the middle of the Church, and a third at the Altar, and a fourth to the Superiour. Then upon his knees he anſwers to all the Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories made him by the Superiour, which are commonly theſe.</p>

            <p>After theſe and ſome more Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of like nature, ſome Prayers are ſaid out of the <hi>Euchologion,</hi> and the Superiour ſhewing him the Book of the Goſpel, doth conjure him by it, if he come to that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his own proper motion. He anſwering in the Affirmative, the Superiour gives him a pair of Sciſſers, bidding him deliver them back into his hand: Which done,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95403:64"/>
the Superiour cuts off a little of his hair in the form of a Croſs, ſaying,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Brother</hi> N. N. <hi>hath his head ſhaven, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The reſt that ſtand by ſay three times <hi>Kyrie Eleeſon.</hi> Then his Monaſtick habit is put on in order.</p>
            <p>1. his <hi>Caſſock,</hi> whereat the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour ſays,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Brother</hi> N. <hi>puts on the Garment of gladneſs, in the name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c. The Company ſay thrice <hi>Kyrie Eleeſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. His Girdle with theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Brother girds his reins with the ſtrength of truth, to mortifie his Body, and to renew his Spirit, in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c. Then follows the <hi>Kyrie Eleeſon</hi> thrice.</p>
            <p>3. His Bonnet with theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Brother puts on the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met of Hope and Salvation, in the name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>4. His Mantle, with theſe words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He puts on the Mantle as the</hi>

               <hi>earneſt of Angelique apparel, and of incorruptible Glory, in the name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>5. His Sandals, with theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He puts on the Shoes of the preparation of the Goſpel of Peace, in the name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c. with the <hi>Kyrie Eleeſon</hi> thrice, as in all the reſt. Then after the rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of an Epiſtle and Goſpel, and ſome Prayers, they put a Croſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hand with theſe words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Saviour ſaith, if any man will be my Diſciple, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs, and follow me.</hi> Then a Candle lighted is put into his hands, with theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Lord hath ſaid, Let your Light ſo ſhine before men, that they ſeeing your good works, may glorifie your Father who is in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This done, the other <hi>Caloirs,</hi> every one ſalute him with a Kiſs, and ſo the Ceremony is ended.</p>
            <list>
               <head>The Rules are theſe,</head>
               <item>1. To renounce the World, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95403:65"/>
all that is near, and dear to them in it, as a Father and Mother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to that of our Saviour.</item>
               <item>2. To continue in the Monaſtry in obedience to the Superiour and his Brethren.</item>
               <item>3. To ſuffer all afflictions, and torments for the Love of God.</item>
               <item>4. To have nothing of their own, but all in common among their Brethren.</item>
               <item>5. To keep themſelves unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all carnality.</item>
               <item>6. To be always ready to go to Prayers at the appointed Hours. At Midnight; before Day; at Noon; at three a Clock after Noon; at Sun-ſet; and after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: And after all this, when they go to their Cells, where they lye, to make 60 Proſtrations, which they call <hi>Metánoia's,</hi> or Pennances, with a ſhort Prayer to every one for the Superiour; for their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; for the Benefactors of the Monaſtry, and in general, for all <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>7. Not to eat or drink in ſecret,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95403:66"/>
but in common with their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and this is ſo obſerv'd, that in caſe they are pinch'd with thirſt betwixt Meals, they drink at the Window, or Door of the Cell, that all may ſee them, and before they drink, they cry aloud, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. <hi>Give thanks.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>8. Not to eat Fleſh all their lives, which is ſo ſtrictly obſerved in Mount <hi>Athos,</hi> that in no ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they are permitted to break this rule; but the Monks that Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, in caſe of ſickneſs, may eat Fleſh, if the Phyſician adviſe them to't. But in Mount <hi>Athos</hi> they are allow'd on <hi>Sundays, Tueſdays, Thurſdays,</hi> and <hi>Saturdays,</hi> to eat Eggs, Butter, Cheeſe, and Fiſh; the other days they eat none of theſe, nor drink any thing but Water only; and thoſe other days they have only a Dinner, at Night they eat a piece of Bread, and drink a little water at the Church-door, and ſo to Prayers, and thence to their Cells, where they remain in great ſilence. But the Sick, Aged,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95403:66"/>
and ſuch as have newly come from a Journey, are allow'd to eat in the common Refectory.</item>
               <item>For the better Government of the Monaſtry, the Superiour goes in perſon to every man's Cell, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſome of the elder <hi>Caloirs,</hi> and if he find any man out of his Cell, or two or three together in another man's Cell, this is a Crime, after three reproofs very puniſhable. The younger <hi>Caloirs</hi> ſtand in great dread of this noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Perambulation, and have that ſaying of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17.</item>
               <item>The Burying of the Dead is much like the way of Burying, deſcribed at <hi>Samos,</hi> with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that a Year after Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they take up the Scull, and waſh it with Wine, and put it in a Charnel, inſcribing the name of the Deceaſed upon the Charnel.</item>
               <item>Thus much of Mount <hi>Athos,</hi> wherein is a thing remarkable, beyond all example, that in a
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95403:67"/>
ſpace of ground, 160 Miles in compaſs, where no leſs than 6000 men conſtantly live, there ſhould not be ſeen a Woman.</item>
