         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſinceritie in iudgement, and of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie
in conuerſation, as this booke
preſently doth witnes, &amp; the practiſe

tranſlatour is faithfullye to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
to Engliſhe men, this treaſure
taken oute of the Frenche tongue,
(obteyning the copye oute of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter

that thereby they may beholde as in

employe them ſelues to the imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as farre forthe as they ſee beſt for

Hereby maye not bee gathered that
the Tranſlatour is a newe lawe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
or authour of any innouacion, or
that his induſtrie and diligence is in
any wyſe preiudiciall to the lawes of

Plutarche, Ariſtotle, Liuye,
and ſuche other, and wyſhe them to
bee tourned into knowen and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier

peruſe and vnderſtande the lawes,
faſhions and ordinaunces of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes,

howe muche more ought men

forein tongue, a forme &amp; patrone, not
only of a wel inſtituted co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale
but of a well reformed churche, not
for Heathen to gaſe on, but for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
to folowe, not ſo much for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation

fruite of my laboure, God graunte

our heauenly father may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,

And further, this worke maye
ſerue for matter of anſwere to thoſe
that inueying agaynſte the lyues of
men of our profeſſion, do more falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpeake euill of vs, than they can

            <p>Firſt of all there are fower orders
of officers which oure lorde hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtytuted

            <p>As concerning paſtors whiche the
ſcripture nameth ſome times watche
men, and ſometyme miniſters, theyr
offices are to declare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of god,
to teache, to admonyſhe, to exhorte,
to reproue as wel publikly as priuat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly,

ought to thruſt him ſelfe into this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
withoute lawfull callyng: in the
which there are to be conſidered three
thinges, that is to ſaye, examinacion
whiche is principall, afterwarde, to
whom it apperteyneth to inſtitute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
myniſters: thirdly, what Ceremonye
or maner of doinge is good to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of them to their office.</p>
            <p>The examinacion conteyneth two
partes, the fyrſt is touching the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
that is to ſaye yf he which ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
appointed to the office haue good
knowledge in the holye ſcriptures,
and more if he be ſufficient and meete
to communicate it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people to their
edification.</p>
            <p>Alſo, to put away or eſchew all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
that he whiche ſhalbe receyued
holde no euel opinions, it ſhalbe good
that he doe proteſt to receyue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne

            <p>To knowe if he be meete to teache,

of the doctrine of oure lorde god.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3163:11"/>
The ſeconde parte is of lyfe: that is
to ſaye, if he haue good conditions, &amp;
if he haue alwaies gouerned him ſelfe
withoute reproche. The rule to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
by is very well declared by S.

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of the auncient church
