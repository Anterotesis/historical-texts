            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>
               <hi>THE PREFACE TO THE</hi> Expoſition of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Song, by way of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; that the Expoſition ought to be Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.</head>
            <p>THAT This Book of Holy Scripture hath been under a high Character of Honour in the Church of God, and hath Imprinted an Awe and Veneration of it ſelf upon the Minds of Wiſe and Holy Men, is out of doubt, both among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is enough known, that the <hi>Jews</hi> prohibit any to read it, till the Sacerdotal or Thirtieth Year of Age; Now though this may ſavor of an over Fear, which in Religious Matters dwells at the next door to Superſtition; Yet ſtill it ſhews of how ſublime a Majeſty and Eſtimation this Song appear'd to them.</p>
            <p>And with the ſame profound Reverence all Chriſtians approach it, who have any ſerious Senſe of the Dread due to Sacred Oracles; This Thing therefore is not of any doubt.</p>
            <p>But it is a Queſtion of much greater Intricacy and Perplexity, what the drift, ſcope, and deſign of ſo unconteſtably a Divine and Spiritual Song is.</p>
            <p>The generality of Interpreters look upon it, as a Catholick ſeat, or Univerſe of Allegories, repreſenting the Myſtical Communion betwixt Chriſt, and his Spouſe the Church, and every Believing Soul in it.</p>
            <p>Now although I defer, as much as Any of the moſt Devoted to ſuch Holy, Spiritual, and Heavenly Meditations, as are deriv'd with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Piety and Prudence from this ſtupendious Allegory, Yet I cannot, for this very great Reaſon, Reſt in that Expoſitory Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that makes it the grand ſcope of the Holy Spirit to give Riſt to ſuch Meditations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48123:3"/>
And this is my Reaſon; All parts of Scripture have ſome ſo limited, determinate, defined ſcope and end, that they cannot be miſled from it by any Interpretation; But it cannot be imagin'd, or with any ſemblance ſuppos'd, that from this Song, there can be drawn a Frame or Platform, either of the ſtate of the Church, or of particular Souls in Relation to their Communion with Chriſt, or of Religious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, or Rules of Life, that ſhould traverſe and cut with variety of Motions, backward and forward, that ſo Indefinite variety, that theſe ſo manifold, both new and repeated Emblematiſms require.</p>
            <p>If then there be not a Frame and Model to ſtint and confine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, this Song muſt be left to the differing Phantaſies of all its Interpreters, how many ſoever, and nothing left to controll or correct them, who do but keep to the general Analogy of pious Senſe, and natural Knowledge.</p>
            <p>For when the whole Univerſe ſerves the Images of thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Sacred Poeſie, and that every Sprig may ſome way reſemble God; It may conſequently be made ſerviceable to ſome ſpiritual Meditation, and moral Document; and ſo proportionably ſeeing the Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and his Church, is of the ſame Divine, Spiritual, and Holy Nature, every Particle of Nature uſed in this Song, ſhall be ſubject to as many Deſcants upon it, as there are Ingenies to extract them, agreeably to that foreſaid Analogy of Faith, and common Philoſophy: And ſo the Song, and the ſeveral parts of it, <hi>unſtable as Water,</hi> having no conſiſtent Figure of their own, ſhall receive ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ape from every Veſſel the Interpreter brings to it.</p>
            <p>But it ſurpaſſes my Underſtanding or Belief, that ſo infinitely Wiſe, and divinely Prudent an Author, as the Holy Spirit, ſhould write in ſuch a Laxity as this, Known to whom are all his Works of Scripture from the beginning to the end; and all the various Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Senſes each <hi>Iota</hi> of them ſhall undergo, and hath ſupreme and determinate Counſels of his own, which ſhall Over-rule them all. And ſo in this Song.</p>
            <p>And indeed, if this Liberty, and Largeneſs of Interpretation were allowed, It would yet be never poſſible to give any decent and congruous Agreement betwixt the Spouſe of Chriſt, and a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Horſes in</hi> Pharaohs <hi>Chariot, Teeth like a Flock of Sheep bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Twins, Eyes as Fiſh pools, Locks buſhy, and black as a Raven,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48123:3"/>
that ſhould expreſs the Communion betwixt Chriſt and his Church, without ſome other Key of Interpretation, that keeps the whole Tight to ſuch a Frame and Model of things, as was before deſir'd.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Interpreters therefore (though ſo very few as hardly to eſcape the Note of ſingularity) and of very Venerable Name, who have underſtood by it a portraicture of the various States, through which the Kingdom of Chriſt hath paſs'd in relation to his Church, and ſo reciprocally of his Church in relation to his Kingdom. And from theſe, I confeſs, I receiv'd the firſt Thoughts, that ſuch a Table is moſt agreeable to this Divine Compoſure.</p>
            <p>And herein I am not aſham'd to acknowledgde, I have borrowed moſt light from that very Admirable Man, Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi> with whom Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> that great Light of the Church of God in <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Symboliſes.</p>
            <p>And yet I have retired from them, in a careful Avoidance, to preſs theſe Divine Figures too hard, leſt wringing them ſhould bring forth Blood; or to make the purſuit too far, leſt the Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be too curious and minute: For in all Prophetical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, I think, there is moſt ſafety of Truth in reſting upon the Bulk and Body of <hi>Scripture Prophecy,</hi> and of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> when only <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Hiſtory</hi> leads the Application; but when <hi>Sacred Hiſtory</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts it, One may be much more bold, or where the Inſtance is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and notorious, as in <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, as I have retired in theſe particularities of Interpretation, from thoſe two, by me ſo honoured Expoſitors of this Song; ſo I have as freely diſſented from them, whereſoever I ſee Reaſon.</p>
            <p>And upon this occaſion, I take liberty to make this Digreſſion, and to obſerve; It is a very frivolous Undertaking, to attempt to bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt the Interpretation of Prophetical Interpreters, as of Mr <hi>Mede,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi> and that to me above all others moſt Indear'd Name of the moſt Learned, Pious, and Honoured Dr. <hi>More,</hi> on <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> and Others; Becauſe either Events have not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Calculations, or becauſe they differ among themſelves.</p>
            <p>For herein is the great Miſtake, Men are angry Theſe Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Expoſitors do not, as inſpired Writers, give Oracles; Whereas God may wonderfully, and beyond the ordinary ſtandard, aſſiſt his Servants in ſome grand Points, to bring Light into the World, and
<pb facs="tcp:48123:4"/>
to make great Efforts into the retired parts of Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Prophecies,</hi> and yet leave them in many Particulars, to the Fallibility of their own Minds, and ſo to Miſtakes.</p>
            <p>For this is the Diſtinction betwixt the immediate Aſſiſtances of God, vouchſafed to the Sacred Pen-men, and Thoſe, whom he leads by the Mediation of their own Learning, Search and Judgment: To the one, He dictates wholly from himſelf, To the other, by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation of their Faculties to make a due Inquiry, and then to adjoin themſelves to greateſt Evidences of Reaſon: Together with which, he may as he pleaſes extraordinarily awaken, inject, infuſe into their Minds, but ſo that the whole Aſſurance they have depends upon Evidence, and all they claim to of Aſſent, is upon the ſame Evidence; where this then fails, Miſtake enſues, and Aſſent is not due.</p>
            <p>From hence it follows; As they may miſtake, ſo they may differ, and One be in the right upon better Evidence, where another is in the wrong upon no Evidence, or inſufficient Evidence; Or Both may be Right, or in an Errour on the ſame accounts, and yet Both theſe may be in great Things eminent Miniſters of the Truth of God to his Church, and agree therein, being excited and conducted beyond the ordinary level of Men, to attain Evidences true and firm in ſuch Points; where the generality, yea, where very few enter at all. And therefore thoſe Miſtakes and Differences, ſhall not in the leaſt invalidate the great Truths, wherein they have Evidence, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they Agree: For all is to be valued by Evidence; And Ignorance, Inapprehenſiveneſs, Want of Diligence in others, in Trying and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Evidences, to diſtinguiſh between Miſtake and Truth, and their Rejection of all for want of ſuch Infallibility and Agreement, makes no alterations in things themſelves, which neither will deceive, nor can be deceived.</p>
            <p>And withal obſerve, here are no more Grains of Allowance requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this Caſe, than in all kinds of Learning, Knowledge, Science, and Arts in the World, which do not proceed upon Infallibility, nor determine in any greater Univerſality of Conſent. No not Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy it ſelf, beyond the very expreſs Aſſertions of Scripture: If Men have a greater Antipathy and Averſion to make out after, to try or to receive Prophetical Knowledge, and to think it Reaſon enough to do ſo, becauſe Men miſtake and differ, (which ſame thing they
<pb facs="tcp:48123:4"/>
do in all things) and though their Agreements in grand Points (as in all other Caſes) is ſo valueable, It cannot be helped, till a better State of the World cure this ſo general Malady.</p>
            <p>But to return from this long, but moſt neceſſary Digreſſion upon this Occaſion. Although I do with all Thankfulneſs acknowledge the Helps I have received, yet I humbly avow with lowlieſt Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings to God; I have proceeded upon theſe peculiar Grounds, deriv'd from his Word alone.</p>
            <p>I find no way of Interpretation ſo like to Circumſcribe and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the Sacred Senſe of this Song, as a Prophetical Courſe of Time, which the Church paſſing through under the various Elevations and Depreſſions of the Kingdom of Chriſt, it becomes capable of theſe ſo various Pictures; And, as in the Courſe of Time, God requires and calls back what is paſt into wonderful Agreements with what is preſent and to come, upon which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>There is no new thing under the Sun;</hi> So in this Song, ſuppoſing it ſuch a Table of Time, the Figures and Allegories in which thoſe paſt things are pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd, may be requir'd and repeated; For the States come to be repeated in their likeneſſes alſo, and ſo the old Emblems are often recall'd, and no new ones choſen for them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This then laid in the Foundation, I farther obſerve; From the very Beginning to the End of this Song, there are under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems of Spices of ſweeteſt Smell, and richeſt Perfume, couch'd a preparation to a Royal <hi>Annointing,</hi> in agreement with the Great Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Chriſt, <hi>Meſſiab,</hi> or <hi>Annointed,</hi> and alſo in alluſion to <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> the Palace Royal of his Kingdom; in all theſe there is a Deſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Kingdom, who is the Bridegroom, and the Beloved of his Church, His <hi>Spouſe,</hi> and <hi>Bride,</hi> which makes this Song <hi>Panegyrical</hi> or Inaugurative.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again therefore I obſerve, There is from the Beginning to the End of this Song a conſtant Deſign of drawing all the Preparations to a Marriage and Nuptial Solemnity, by the holieſt, pureſt, and moſt ardent Affections, and all kind of Ceremonies, and Retinue, and Courtſhip for Eſpouſals, and for the Glories and ſolemnization, that agree to the Nuptial Love and Honour Chriſt is pleas'd to put upon his <hi>Spouſe</hi> and <hi>Bride,</hi> the Church; And that as Marriage (which is a great Myſtery, as the Apoſtle ſays, ſpeaking concerning
<pb facs="tcp:48123:5"/>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Church)</hi> was inſtituted in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and there had its Beginning; So in the <hi>Paradiſe of God</hi> it hath its Complement and Perfection. Now hereunto agree the ſo often mention of <hi>Flowers, Gardens,</hi> Virgins, a Bed, Eſpouſals, and innumerable the like: by which this Song looks ſo like an <hi>Epithalamium</hi> or <hi>Marriage-Song</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and his Church, <hi>Revel. c.</hi> 19. <hi>c.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Further, Becauſe as the Grandeur of a Kingdom was by the Ancients addulced and ſweetned with the Emblems of the Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Care and Propriety of a Shepherd in his Flock; and that the Entertainments of Love and Amorous Contemplations were agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Shepherd's Life: Therefore in this <hi>Song,</hi> there is ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mention of <hi>Kids, Sheep, Goats, Roes,</hi> and <hi>Hinds, Lyons, Leopards, Roes</hi> and <hi>Hinds of the Field</hi> of a wilder Race; of <hi>Shepherds,</hi> and the <hi>Mountains</hi> They and their Flocks walk upon, whereby this Song hath ſo much of a <hi>Paſtoral</hi> in it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And laſtly, Becauſe Enemies are oft to be overcome, before Kingdoms can be enjoyed in Peace and Luſtre; there is therefore ſo often mention of Valiant <hi>Men, Arms, Armory,</hi> and <hi>Armies,</hi> by which this Song becomes Heroic and Triumphal.</p>
            <p>And all theſe things are drawn into Song, according to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Uſage in ancient Times to Compoſe into Poeſy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both their Wars, the Glory of their Kings, and alſo their Amours, and Paſtoral Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements.</p>
            <p>From theſe Conſiderations then, we may have a general proſpect and view upon the Frame and Model of this Song, and ſo as to fix it, and not leave it to the Pleaſure of every <hi>Mercurial</hi> Phantaſie.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Seeing every Courſe of Time, that is to be limited and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and pourtrayed, as in a Model and Table, muſt have a Point, when it begins, and when it ends, and a medium or middle Line, in which it runs along; I obſerve there are great Inducements, as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly we can deſire, to begin the Song in <hi>David,</hi> who was the firſt Royal Anceſtor of Jeſus Chriſt, the King of his Church, and the moſt Eminent <hi>Typical Meſſiah,</hi> or <hi>Annointed of the Lord, Annointed with holy Oyl:</hi> A King raiſed from a Shepherd to be ſo, wherein he was as it were by Education fitted to a Paſtoral Government, and prepared to become the <hi>ſweet Singer of Iſrael,</hi> in agreement ſo far with this Song, and a moſt renowned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Warrior, who Atchieved by
<pb facs="tcp:48123:5"/>
Conqueſt his Kingdom, and was therein eminently a <hi>Prophet</hi> and a <hi>King,</hi> and not without ſome providential Reſemblance of a Prieſt, in being girded with the <hi>Prieſtly Ephod</hi> before the Lord; Thus eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way in ſo Eminent a Perſonage, this Song was to begin, who was ſo great a Type, and alſo in his <hi>Pſalms</hi> ſo great a Prophet of Chriſts Kingdom, as therein to give the <hi>Kiſſes of Chriſts mouth,</hi> as he in his ſeveral Annointings, diffus'd the <hi>ſavour of Chriſts Oyntments,</hi> and drew <hi>the Virgins after him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Union with <hi>David, Solomon</hi> his Son is to be joyn'd, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in Splendor, Peace, and Magnificence the Kingdom that was the Acqueſt of <hi>David</hi>'s Wars, whoſe many <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Concubines,</hi> like the ſixty Queens, the eighty Concubines, and <hi>Virgins without number, [c.</hi> 6. 8.] which make the Spouſe of Chriſt, and eſpecially his <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s Daughter</hi> with Royal Eſtate, are greatly ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this Song, and to the Repreſentations it gives of the Spouſe of Chriſt, and of his Marriage to it: For that moſt Illuſtrious and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Queen, <hi>Pharaohs Daughter,</hi> (undoubtedly a Convert to the God of <hi>Iſrael,)</hi> was not only a Type of the <hi>Gentile Church</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral but particularly of its State in the <hi>Philadelphian Interval,</hi> ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Honoured, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>And for her, as a Type of the Church in that ſtate, that Divinely Prophetick <hi>Fourty fifth Pſalm</hi> was compoſed in ſo much Agreement with <hi>this Song; a Song of Loves,</hi> ſet to a Muſical Inſtrument, or Tune, called <hi>Shoſhannim,</hi> or the <hi>Lillies,</hi> among which, this Song Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents ſo often Chriſt and his Church Feeding; an Emblem of Purity at laſt ſet in Glory and Luſtre.</p>
            <p>Now the Principal Intention of that <hi>Pſalm,</hi> is under the Type of <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter to Repreſent Chriſt Annointed, as on the Mount of Spices, for his Appearance on his Royal Throne; and taking his Church in the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> ſtate to Himſelf, as his Bride, agreeable with the cloſe of this <hi>Song:</hi> agreeable with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to the <hi>Philadelphian Church,</hi> agreeable with <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. and <hi>c.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p>And the very ſilence of <hi>Solomon's Iſraelitiſh Wives,</hi> ſeems not to be without a Myſtery; but to expreſs that long Deſolate ſtate of the whole <hi>Seed of Iſrael</hi> under the Goſpel, and yet there is a Revival at laſt in the <hi>Shulamite,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> had undoubtedly <hi>Iſraelitiſh Wives,</hi> and in his Repentance Return'd to them, c. 6. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48123:6"/>
And even in thoſe Wives of the Idolatrous Nations, <hi>Solomon</hi> took, who <hi>Turn'd away his Heart from God,</hi> He may be thus far a Type of the Love of Chriſt to the <hi>Heathen Idolatrous World,</hi> and alſo of that great Scandal, This hath againſt him the True <hi>Meſſiah</hi> given ſo long to the <hi>Jews,</hi> from which yet Chriſt ſhall be vindicated at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of ALL, as <hi>Solomon</hi> is by <hi>this Song,</hi> together with the Book of <hi>Eccleſiastes,</hi> Vindicated from the Infamy of his Idolatry; It being ſo Royal a Monument of his Repentance: This <hi>Solomon</hi> was alſo He, who Built the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> and his own Houſe of State, that ſerve alſo in this <hi>ſong</hi> as Types; who laſtly was a great Prince in Wiſdom, and the <hi>Largeneſs of his Mind.</hi> This ſo great a Type, yea ſo great a Prophecy of Chriſt in his own Perſon and Reign, and Marriages, is commiſſion'd as the moſt Elect Perſon to <hi>ſing this ſong,</hi> this <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſong</hi> of the Kingdom of Chriſt, as <hi>David</hi> did in ſo many <hi>Pſalms.</hi> And ſuch a Song was to be expected from ſo great a Prince, and ſuch a Son of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> whoſe Wiſdom had not been perfect in Honour, without ſuch a Prophecy of the Kingdom of Chriſt; Seeing Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Prophecy of Chriſt was the higheſt point of Wiſdom; And it ſtands with <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> as a Monument of the Repentance of this Great King after his Fall.</p>
            <p>Let then the <hi>Epoch</hi> of this <hi>Song</hi> be <hi>David</hi>'s and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Reign in Conjunction, and the beginning of the Courſe of Time to Chriſts Kingdom in this <hi>Song,</hi> fix'd here; And immediately after <hi>Solomon</hi>'s death begins not a new Courſe, but a new Character of this Courſe of Time, carried on from Time to Time in the moſt Known, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and Chronicular Events, of greateſt Renown in Scripture-Hiſtory, or Prophecy, or Both; or <hi>Scripture Prophecy,</hi> and <hi>Humane History</hi> that cannot be denyed, nor to have been ſuch noble Events.</p>
            <p>Now then if in the very ſame order theſe Events keep with the Courſe of Time, They have alſo ſuch fit Emblems and Reſemblances of them in <hi>this Song,</hi> and in the ſame order that They have all along to this very Day in the Courſe of Time, I cannot account this leſs than great Evidence, This <hi>Song</hi> is ſuch a Frame or Table of Time, as I aſſert it.</p>
            <p>And that theſe may ſtand Fair, Viſible, and Together; I have Calendar'd them in the Annexed Table, and Referr'd them to each part of this <hi>Song,</hi> together with their References to each Page of the Book; and alſo according to their Scituation, and Place in the
<pb facs="tcp:48123:6"/>
Courſe of Time, and according to that Settlement I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to vindicate to them that in Courſe of Time, by <hi>My Line of Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I cannot but add, as a farther Evidence of the <hi>Epoch of this Song,</hi> and that it deſigns a Courſe of Time, of which I gave Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion juſt now, <hi>viz.</hi> That after the Reign of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> In the Diviſion of the <hi>Ten,</hi> and the <hi>Two Tribes,</hi> making <hi>a Houſe of Judah,</hi> and <hi>a Houſe of Iſrael, Ezekiel's Days for Years Began,</hi> as an Introduction of <hi>Prophetical Time,</hi> and, as ſhall be declared a <hi>Medium,</hi> or <hi>Mediation</hi> betwixt <hi>Historical</hi> and <hi>Prophetical</hi> Time: and on which the whole Courſe of Prophetical Time Runs; Upon this very point of Time, This <hi>Song</hi> gives thoſe two Remarks. 1. Of that Diviſion, by the <hi>Tents of Kedar,</hi> and <hi>the Curtains of Solomon,</hi> And then of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam</hi>'s Servitude under <hi>Shiſhak, King of Aegypt,</hi> where to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh, or rather to make moſt notorious that Time; There is a more Uncouth Reſemblance, than is to be found in the whole <hi>Song</hi> beſide, <hi>viz. I have compared Thee, O my Love, to a Company of Horſes in</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s Chariot,</hi> c. 1. 5. 9. as is Declared in the Expoſition.</p>
            <p>A Second Thing I cannot but add in Confirmation of the Cou rſe of Time, is, That foraſmuch as it was Fore-ſeen, there would not be after the <hi>History of the Acts of the Apoſtles, Scripture Hiſtory</hi> to bear up the <hi>Prophecy of Daniel,</hi> looking beyond that Time; nor of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> Given after that Time, We have therefore <hi>before the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical</hi> Time a Precedent of depending upon the moſt undoubted Humane Hiſtory, for one of the moſt Remarkable Prophecies in the Judgment of all Expoſitors, and in which ſome would fain Abſolve all <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prophecy, <hi>viz.</hi> the Tyranny of <hi>Antiochus, Taking away the Daily Sacrifice;</hi> as great a Tyranny and <hi>Deſolation</hi> of their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for the ſhort time it laſted, or greater than any the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> ſuffered till their <hi>Final Deſolation;</hi> And This, though ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly prophecied of by <hi>Daniel,</hi> we have only the <hi>Hiſtory of the Maccabees</hi> and of <hi>Joſephus</hi> to depend upon for the Expoſition of it; And it is counted ſo enough, that no Interpreter doubts it.</p>
            <p>Why then ſhould we not be as well ſatisfied in undoubted <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Hiſtory</hi> concerning the <hi>Roman Antichriſt,</hi> the Antitype to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi> that he is that <hi>Man of Sin</hi> in 2 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2. and the <hi>Beaſt, Rev.</hi> c. 13. c. 17. And it is very remarkable, how much in the ſame Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems <hi>This Song</hi> may be fairly ſuppos'd to Deſcant on Both, as it were the <hi>Type</hi> and the <hi>Antitype;</hi> The <hi>Type,</hi> c. 3. before the <hi>Incarnation.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48123:7"/>
The <hi>Antitype,</hi> c. 6. before the preparation of All Things, and their running on to the Glory of Chriſts Kingdom, in <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 8. And while there is an Agreement, the due Diſtances are alſo maintain'd.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Epoch,</hi> and ſo much of the Running on of the Courſe being Remonſtrated upon, let us conſider the Period and Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſee if the Song does not draw all things to their Conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Glory of Chriſt's Kingdom, as into the Time of the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Confluence of all to the True Church of Chriſt, as <hi>one Gentile Church,</hi> viz. <hi>the Fulneſs of the Gentiles;</hi> The <hi>Antichristian Converts;</hi> and the <hi>Reformed Churches;</hi> Then the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>two Tribes</hi> Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it, as the <hi>Princes of the Eaſt looking out as the Morning;</hi> and at laſt the Ten Tribes; And then the <hi>whole Mountain of Spices</hi> flows into an Everlaſting Unction of Chriſt into his Kingdom, who is then Annointed <hi>with the Oyl of Joy above his Fellows:</hi> A Kingdom above all Kingdoms, and beyond which, There is nothing but Eternity.</p>
            <p>And Concurrent with this End, is the Higheſt Purity, the moſt Ardent Love betwixt Chriſt and his Church, the fulleſt Enjoyment, as in not only a Supreme, but an only Kingdom; and, as in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe of God; as is ſo Remarkable, that it cannot be miſs'd in the latter part, or the three laſt Chapters <hi>of the Song:</hi> What then can, if This does not deſerve to be the Period and Point of the Courſe of Time, and of this Song Commenſurate to it; and ſo Adequate to <hi>Daniel</hi>'s laſt Words of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and the drawing up all to an End in the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole then, There cannot be a greater proof of a Frame, <hi>ſyſtem,</hi> or Model in any Writing, that doth not openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it ſelf to be ſo, than to find out a juſt Order and Series, and due Connexion in the Parts; Nor in a <hi>Myſtical</hi> Frame, than that the Parts do fairly Expreſs and Expoſe the Things, that in ſuch a Frame, They are ſuppoſed to Expoſe: And if it be accounted in <hi>Philoſophy</hi> a good Diſcharge to give an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> or Scheme of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture agreeable, and to keep All Appearances ſafe in Relation one to another; I hope it will be Eſteemed a good Acquittal of my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, not only to Project a Frame or <hi>Syſtem</hi> of this, but to find that Frame laid in <hi>Scripture-Hiſtory,</hi> and <hi>Prophecy,</hi> or in <hi>Scripture-Prophecy,</hi> and Unconteſtable <hi>Humane Hiſtory,</hi> as of <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny juſt now to this purpoſe Inſtanc'd, and to find the Images of <hi>Prophetick Song</hi> all along Agreeing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48123:7"/>
And I hope, it will be no more diſallowed to Expound <hi>this Song</hi> into a continued Parable without dowright Demonſtration, than it is to Expound the Parts of <hi>this Song</hi> in ſeveral and particular Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, with as little Demonſtration as General Interpreters do: In fine, that the whole Song ſo laid into a Parable, may be Accepted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as any other Theological Parable, of which there are Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſeeing all the Parts and Lines on which it is grounded, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly Divine, and the Expoſition ſo fairly put for, to be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as Divine alſo.</p>
            <p>For I acknowledge, That which enabled me to bring this Song into the Contexture, wherein it is now Preſented, and that which gave me alſo the occaſion, and the Engagement to do it, is, <hi>The Scripture-Line of Time,</hi> I lately Publiſhed, To which I have in the Title declared, It is Adjuſted; and which I have purſued along in the Expoſition of the Song, both in the Signification of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems, and in the Notes of Time.</p>
            <p>And it is upon This Hope, that Theſe two may give Light and Strength, one to another.</p>
            <p>For the ſame Things variouſly Repreſented, make them clearer and eaſier to general Apprehenſion; Some Things being plainer to ſome in one Dreſs, to ſome in another, and each gives Light to the other, when They are Compar'd.</p>
            <p>And in this Song, and its Expoſition, Things lye much nearer and cloſer one to another; They are more ſuddenly ſeen and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, more eaſily Graſp'd, and more eaſily Remembred: And what requires either fuller Diſcourſe, or Proof, may be ſought in thoſe larger Prophetical Diſcuſſions of the Line of Time.</p>
            <p>But above All, The Compare of theſe Three Great Prophets, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides others) <hi>viz. Solomon, Daniel, John,</hi> the Three Beloveds, does exceedingly inlighten and ſtrengthen my Prophetical Scheme; For when the Three Frames differ in Circumſtances, and yet agree in Eſſentials; There can be no greater Conviction of a Deſign'd Scheme of Prophecy, nor happier Conduct into it, than their compare one with another: And ſuch a three-fold Cord is not eaſily broken. And in the Mouth of not Two but Three Witneſſes, every word is Eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>I have choſen to Preſent this Song in Verſe, in Conformity to the Divine Poeſy, not pretending to Excel herein, much leſs to come
<pb facs="tcp:48123:8"/>
within any diſtance of the Original; but to come ſomething nearer the High Spirit, and Lofty Air of this Song, than plain Expoſition in Proſe could do; I am alſo in Hope, that the Diverſion and Acceptableneſs of Words in number and meaſure, may Invite to the Conſideration of the Matter ſo convey'd, and that while the Poetry is Cenſur'd and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, yet the Senſe may ſlide in, and lay hold of the Judgment.</p>
            <p>And leſt any Difficulty in ſuch a ſtinted Form of Words ſhould occur, I have by brief Notes Explaining Words and ſenſe, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to Illuſtrate ſuch Difficulties.</p>
            <p>And, as I deſire, This Poem ſhould look backward to the Line of Time I have already, or ſhall with this offer to any Hand, ſo I deſire It ſhould look forward to a ſecond Part, now in the Preſs, and wherein I Beg the aſſiſtance of all who ſhall be induc'd to favour the Undertaking.</p>
            <p>To conclude, That all Things may be made moſt plain, I have plac'd this Table, as in Entrance to the Expoſition of this Song; That every one may run and Read thoſe great Heads of Prophecy in their order, and in the Series of Time, wherein they are ſet; the Events themſelves none can deny to be the greateſt, that can be found in <hi>Scripture-Hiſtory,</hi> or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in <hi>Scripture-prophecy,</hi> nor call in queſtion their ſucceſſive Order in Time; So that every one may compare the Images, which are undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly Divine, and then ſet them cloſe to the Expoſition, which is in the <hi>Line of Time</hi> endeavour'd to be prov'd Divine alſo, by immediate Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Conſequence; and when their place in Time cannot be conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted what can be doubted;</p>
            <p>There is but one grand Event, which I can think of, which can in this Song be ſuppos'd to be omitted; And that is the Deſolation of the <hi>Jews</hi> by the <hi>Romans:</hi> But that, asunfit for a <hi>Song of Loves</hi> is glided over, and rather ſuppos'd by the <hi>Gentile Church,</hi> entring into the whole play of the Song then deſcrib'd, even as Gods <hi>Caſting</hi> the <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> out of <hi>his ſight,</hi> is ſilently made known by the Songs Reference to the Houſe of <hi>Judah</hi> only: And obſerve, thoſe <hi>Jewiſh Deſolations</hi> are ſhaded over in the <hi>Red Horſe</hi> of War in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> and <hi>given</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> but in the way of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendage to the Cutting off the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> But moſt fully given <hi>Ezek.</hi> c. 16. c. 23.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, as I humbly Beg the Prayers of All, who have Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for Endeavours in the Clearing of <hi>Prophecy;</hi> So I moſt Humbly and Ardently Pray for Bleſſing from Above, upon what is here Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, that we may Read and Underſtand this Prophecy, <hi>and may wait and come to the End of the</hi> 1335 <hi>Days, For the Time is at Hand.</hi>
