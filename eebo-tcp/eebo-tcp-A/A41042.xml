            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not be doubted, but that the Papiſts (againſt whom the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Penal Laws were moſt ſharp) are and will be watchful to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove to their utmoſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, His Majeſties Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Indulgence; wherein he grants Liberty to all ſorts of Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their Religions, and ſuſpends the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Penal Laws in force againſt them.

If the induſtry we expect from them meet not with a proportionable

zeal in all true Proteſtants, it will not he hard to conjecture what the Succeſs will be, when the Attaque is vigorous and induſtrious, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence faint and negligent. And therefore I think it cannot be unſeaſonable to offer a few Motives to the ſtirring up the zeal, and awakening the prudence of all ſuch Proteſtants as fear God, and love the King, the Church, or themſelves; as well as to arm them with ſome Arguments for their own confirmation in the grounds of Proteſtancy, in oppoſition to Popery.</p>

Univerſal Church: and we ſhew the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of our Biſhops to the Apoſtles of Chriſt, as fully as it can be ſhewn in any other Church at this day.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, We are members of a Church, which above all other Conſtitutions in the Chriſtian World enforces the great duties of <note n="m" place="margin">Art. <hi>37.</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> Letter to the Prince.</note> obedience and ſubmiſſion to the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and teaches to be ſubject not only <hi>for Wrath, but Conſcience ſake.</hi>

            <p>As we paſs not ſevere cenſures on other Churches, though exceedingly erroneous, and are for that charity unworthily repaid by the moſt criminal, that of <hi>Rome</hi>: So are we excommunicated by none that we know of, but Her; The Pope herein dealing with us as he does with all other Chriſtians in the <note n="n" place="margin">Bulla Caenae.</note> World, namely, with moſt of the European Churches, and in other parts, except thoſe few whom he has gained of late by his Miſſionaries.</p>
            <p>The common Cauſe for which we ſuffer is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the defence of <hi>the</hi>

            <p>The difference between our caſe and that of our
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94063:4"/>
fellow Chriſtians who ſuffer with us is only this; that they are ſhut out from Heaven as far as the Popes Cenſures can do it, for they know not what; many of them, even Millions in the remoter parts, having never ſo much as heard of him, or his pretenſions; whereas we konw them too well by woful Experience.</p>
            <p>It is not ſo much more than an hundred years ſince that our Anceſtors were under his Tyranny: which as their Fathers had inſenſibly drawn upon themſelves, by their deference to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence the <hi>Saxons</hi> had partly <note n="p" place="margin">

            <p>Notwithſtanding all that has been ſaid, there are a ſort of pacific Writers, who repreſent the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> under a fairer light, and would have us believe they have a better meaning than is uſually ſuggeſted.

not part with for all the tempting charms of Charity and Love: and God knows, in the preſent caſe 'tis evident, that the excuſes which are fram'd in the Romaniſts behalf are ſhort and frivolous; nor beſides can any man be eſteem'd a Roman Catholic by admitting the Doctrines of that Church in his own private or ſome more probable Doctors, but in the public ſenſe. And had theſe undertakers in the Catholic Cauſe power to diſpenſe therein according to that Candor which many of them make ſhew of, we might attend to what is ſaid; but we are well aſſur'd, that all theſe fair words can ſignifie nothing, but are merely a bait and ſnare laid to draw in the eaſie Proſelyte: for when he's reconcil'd and brought into the boſom of the Church, theſe painted ſhews are preſently waſht off; and all conceſſions immediately retracted; the Convert muſt then learn the Colliers Creed, believe as the Church believes, and St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Key which threw the gate open to admit into the Church, will ſhut the Priſoner in: and the Child which had a piece of money given him to keep him quiet, ſhall ſoon after have it call'd for back again, and be aw'd with the rod, if he repine or murmur.

When they ſhall have adher'd to their Prince in ſpight of the commands of their holy Father the Pope, and defended their Sovereign and his Rights, when it was not their intereſt to do it, they will have ſomewhat worth the boaſting: As the caſe now ſtands, they had better hold their peace, and remember that the Sons of another Church ſerved their King as faithfully as they, though they talk leſs of it.

The Church is ever a Minor, and cannot be preſcribed againſt by time, or barr'd in her claims, and our holy Father out of his Paternal care will find himſelf concern'd to vindicate the Orphan committed to his truſt.

And that the numbers in thoſe Societies may be ſure to be full, it is a known and cuſtomary practice to entice and ſpirit away Children from their Parents into their Covents, from whence they cannot be withdrawn without Sacriledge.

            <p>So that Vice being brought to this eaſie rate, beſides all other miſ-adventures, unleſs we will ſtand for the honour of being Cuckolds, and have our Poſterity ſhare the Title which is proverbial in Popiſh Countries, to be <hi>fils de Preſtre</hi>; it will concern us to look about us, while 'tis time, and prevent theſe vile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours which are preparing for us. If it ſhall be ſaid, that 'tis not imaginable men ſhould pervert ſo ſacred an action, as the receiving of Confeſſions to thoſe purpoſes of villany that are ſuggeſted. I anſwer firſt, That we may without breach of Charity ſuppoſe that thing poſſibly to be done, which is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly known to have been done: as alſo, that the horror of the crime is competently allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Doctrine, who think only Marriage, and not <note n="e" place="margin">Sleid. <hi>comm: l.</hi> 4.</note> Fornication inconſiſtent with the dignity of a Clergy-man.

ſo many circumſtances concur together to betray it.</p>
