            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the Inhabitants of the Territory of the <hi>Birnes</hi> Countrey in the County of <hi>Wickloe,</hi> and thoſe under whom they derive their Eſtates, were for above 300. years ſeized thereof, as of their Freehold and Inheritance, doing the ſervice of Freeholders; Yet for further confirmation of their Eſtates, King <hi>James</hi> 26 <hi>Junii,</hi> 1611. by his Letters under the Privie Signet, directed to the then Deputy of <hi>Ireland</hi> to accept Surrenders from the ſaid Inhabitants, and to agree with them at ſuch Rent as they would give. In purſuance whereof they compounded for two hundred pounds yearly rent during the lives of Sir <hi>Henry</hi> and Sir <hi>William Harrington,</hi> and after their deceaſes for one hundred and fifty pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> to be paid for ever, which hath beene duly paid ever ſince: And Surrenders were to be accepted, and Patents granted accordingly, As by an Act of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in <hi>Ireland</hi> dated the 11 of <hi>November</hi> 1611. may appeare, which Act of Councell was approved of by King <hi>James,</hi> as by his Letters may appeare. And moſt of them did ſurrender and accept of Letters Patents.</p>
            <p>That the late King <hi>Charles</hi> taking into his conſideration the Intention of King <hi>James</hi> for ſetling the Eſtates of all the Inhabitants, by his Letters of the 24 <hi>Maii</hi> 1628. directed that effectuall grants ſhould be made to the Inhabitants and their heirs, and declared his expreſſe Will, that by occaſion of no new doubts that might be rayſed, the ſaid Inhabitants be not againe moleſted or diſquieted; And in the ſame yeare the ſaid late King in conſideration of 120000. li. did grant certaine graces to the people of <hi>Ireland;</hi> Of which one was, that at the next Parliament there to be holden, there ſhould paſſe the like Act for limitation of the Kings Title as paſſed here 21 <hi>Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of the <hi>Birnes</hi> Countrey, paid their ſhare of the 120000. li. but the late Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> in the next Parliament, being in the tenth year of the late King, would not ſuffer any ſuch Act to paſſe.</p>
            <p>That your Petitioners father upon the many engagements aforeſaid, ſold five hundered pounds land <hi>per annum</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and ſeated himſelf in the County of <hi>Wickloe,</hi> where he laid out near 10000. li.</p>
            <p>That about <hi>April</hi> 1638. by the power and procurement of <hi>Thomas</hi> late Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> then Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and others of his Adherents, a Commiſſion iſſued to perſons of their nomination, and unindifferent to enquire what title the late King had to the ſaid Territory: And the ſaid Earle being preſent, none daring to oppoſe him without pregnant Evidence, It was found that King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond was ſeized in Fee of the ſaid Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and that it immediately deſcended to the late King.</p>
            <p>And whereas upon former Commiſſions of intituling only a fourth part was ſeized, and that planted with Engliſh Proteſtants, yet was your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners father being of Engliſh extraction, and a Proteſtant, by direction of the ſaid Earle and his Councell dated the 9th of <hi>July</hi> 1639. by the Sheriffe of the County of <hi>Wickloe</hi> diſpoſſeſt of all his Eſtate in the <hi>Birnes</hi> Countrey <hi>(viz.) Tyne</hi> Parke, <hi>Kilne</hi> Parke, <hi>Galligoure, Garriduff,</hi> and two <hi>Ballihorſes,</hi> and a faire ſtone built houſe. a Moety of the towne of <hi>Leybegge,</hi> two third parts of <hi>Ballinehone,</hi> and his certaine ſhare in the townes of <hi>Gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, le moore, Ballinotin, Killorter, Garricho,</hi> and <hi>Rodonaghmoore,</hi> worth above three hundred pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> whileſt he was offered in liew there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Lands not worth above ſixty or eighty pounds <hi>per annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which premiſſes (except two parts of <hi>Ballinehone</hi> granted to Sir <hi>William Parſons,</hi> and one other part granted to Maſter <hi>John <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher)</hi> were by the late Kings Letters of the fifth of <hi>Iune</hi> 1639. granted to Sir <hi>Adam Loftus,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Meredith,</hi> and Sir <hi>Philip Percival</hi> Knights, at ſuch rents as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty ſhould think fit, and a Patent paſſed accordingly at the yearly rent of 212 li. 8 s. 3 d. ob. q. So that though many were ruined by this Plantation, the late King gained but 62 li. 8 s. 3 d. ob. q.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid Deputy, and other his Complices, knowing the weakneſſe of the Title, a Bill was certified hither to be paſſed in Parliament there, wherein the premiſſes amongſt divers old Plantations of that Countrey were inſerted, and other lands called <hi>Towerboy</hi> and <hi>Shelelagh,</hi> which were no Plantation lands, nor contained in the ſaid Inquiſition (as your Petitioner is informed) were for the private ends of the ſaid Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> incerted in the ſaid Bill; And the ſaid Bill paſſed the houſes of Parliament in that Country, not underſtanding of the engagements, either of the late King <hi>Iames</hi> or King <hi>Charles,</hi> or of the weakneſſe of the grounds whereupon the Office was found, or of the extreme inequality of the ſeveral diſtributions; And was an Act only intended for ſecuring the Eſtates of the Freeholders and reputed Inheritors.</p>
            <p>That upon your Petitioners Fathers Petition to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> the ſaid late Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> knowing the ſaid proceedings, muſt needs come to light, and how ſmall an increaſe of rent came to the late King by this plantation; It was deviſed that all the ſaid lands ſhould be paſſed to <hi>George Carre, William Billingſly,</hi> and others in truſt for the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and to be paſſed upon the Commiſſion of Grace for remedy of defective Titles at the rent of two thouſand pounds, which was accordingly paſſed by the late Kings Letters of the nineteenth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 16 <hi>Car.</hi> Although your Petitioners Father did exhibit his Complaint againſt the proceedings in <hi>Ireland:</hi> And his Cauſe then depended in the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That your Petitioners Father was denied the Copie of the Inquiſition, though he petitioned for it, intending to Traverſe it.</p>
            <p>That the Commiſſioners for Plantation demanded ſight of his Writings, and kept them from him, till your Petitioners Father petitioned to the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> for them, and then they were delivered.</p>
            <p>That the like Inquiſition to ſeveral Counties in <hi>Conaught</hi> and <hi>Munster</hi> were vacated by the late Kings Order, dated 3. <hi>Apr.</hi> 17. <hi>Car.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Petitioners Father in <hi>November</hi> 1640. petitioned the late Parliament for relief, who referred the ſame to a Committee, where his Cauſe was heard in <hi>February</hi> following. And upon Maſter <hi>Pyms</hi> Report the 19. of <hi>March</hi> following. It was reſolved the Cauſe ſhould be tranſmitted to the Lords; yet Maſter Speaker by direction of the Houſe by his Letter of the ninth of <hi>September</hi> 1641. recommended the Caſe to the Commons in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to be righted, But before any thing done therein, the Rebellion broke out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Petitioner therefore humbly prayeth, That out of your love to Juſtice and Zeale to Equity, you would vouchſafe to look upon the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion your Petitioners Father ſuffered by being wreſted out of his Eſtate by the Potency of the late Earle of</hi> Strafford, <hi>It being the fitter Object of your Care in regard of the former Applications to Parliaments. And that no other Court of Iuſtice can do your Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner right; And that injuſtice may not prevaile above one Age together: And that your Petitioner may be reſtored unto that which his Father was ſo unjuſtly deprived of, with damages and coſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <closer>And your Petitioner ſhall ever pray.</closer>
