            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Ver. 1. <hi>BY night on my Bed, I sought him whom my Soul loved,] q. d.</hi> My Lord and Saviour (whom I do love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly, and above all other things) having (in my sence and feeling,) with-drawn himself from me, I sought earnestly, and laboured to recover my comfort in, by serious meditations and tryal of mine own heart, and crying ùnto him upon my bed in the night, when I was most
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65652:19"/>
free from all other distractions, <hi>Psal:</hi> 4. 4. and 77. 2, 3. but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>I will rise now, and go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the City in the streets; and in the broad wayes, I will seek him whom my Soul loveth,]</hi> I then resolved with my self to spare no pains, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, whereby I might recover my comfort, and therefore to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and use the help of others, whose knowledge and experience might be better then mine own. And that which moved me to take this pains, to seek my Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and to recover the comfort and feeling of his gratious presence, was the truth and unfainedness of my Love to him, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>[I sought him, but I found him not,]</hi> Though by this means also, I sought him earnestly, making the best use of the conference and prayers of such as I could meet withal, yet
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65652:20"/>
neither could I this way recover my comfort.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>The Watchmen that go about the City found me,] q. d.</hi> At length, while I was thus seeking for my beloved, the Pastors and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church, whom the Lord hath appointed to be as Watchmen to this Citty, <hi>Isa.</hi> 62. 6. <hi>Ez.</hi> 3. 17. and who go about, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently look into the Estate of all Gods people committed to their charge, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 20, 31. <hi>[found me]</hi> came to enquire into mine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, <hi>[to whom I said, saw yee him whom my Soul loveth,] q. d.</hi> my heart was so full, that I stayed not till they questioned or demanded any thing of me, but I required of them, and sought help of them to recover my comfort, in my Lord and Saviour: and could not conceal from them, the unfeigned and fervent love my my Soul bore unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:65652:20"/>
Ver. 4. <hi>It was but a little, that I passed from them, but I found him whom my Soul loveth,] q. d.</hi> Though while I was with the Watchmen, and faithful Ministers of the Lord, and enjoyed Gods Ordinances in their Ministry, I seemed in my own feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to receive no benefit by it, yet within a while after I did: I lost not my labour in seeking and using all Gods means, for I recovered the comfort which I had lost, I found and felt the gracious presence of my Lord and Saviour, whom my Soul dearly and unfeignedly loveth, <hi>[I held him, and would not let him go,] q. d.</hi> The great vexation of Spirit, that I found all the while that I thought him to be absent from me, made me more highly to prize him, and to lay the faster hold on him, by renewing my faith, to make him the more sure unto my self, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve with my self, that I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65652:21"/>
through my carnal security, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other sin lose him again, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive my self of the comfort I found in him, <hi>[until I brought him into my Mothers house, and into the Chamber of her that conceived me,]</hi> until, (in the publick assembly, where I was regenerate by the immortal seed,) I had testifyed my Love to him, and my thankfulness for this great mercy I had received in the recovering of my comfort.</p>

               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Who is this that cometh out of the Wilderness, like Pillars of smoak, perfumed with Mirrhe and Frankinsense, with all powders of the</hi>

of <hi>Solomon,</hi> though it were very glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, <hi>[threescore valiant men are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, of the valiant of Israel,] q. d.</hi> Though <hi>Solomons</hi> bed was so guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by threescore of the choicest for valour of all <hi>Israel,</hi> yet is thy bed (O my Lord and Saviour) far more glorious, for it is attended with 20000 of Angels, whereof every one excelleth in strength the mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est host of men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 17. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 11. <hi>Psa.</hi> 103. 20. <hi>Isa.</hi> 37. 36.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>They all hold swords, being expert in War, every man hath his sword upon his thigh, because of fear in the night,] q. d.</hi> And as the valiant men that guard <hi>Solomons</hi> bed, were ever ready with their Weapons to defend him, from any treason that might any way be attempted against him in the night, so are those glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and mighty Angels that attend the bed and throne of my Lord and King, ever ready prest to do his will,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65652:22"/>
and use all their strength and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in his service.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>King Solomon made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Chariot (or Bride-bed) of the wood of Lebanon,] q. d. Solomons</hi> stately bride-bed, was made of the goodly Cedars that grew in <hi>Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> which was a very durable wood; but this bed that I speak of, this bed of my Lord and King, is far more durable, and shall never decay, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 10. 2 Cor. 5. 1.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>He made the pillars thereof of Silver, the bottom thereof of Gold, the covering of it of Purple, the midst thereof being paved with Love, for (or of) the Daughters of Ierusalem,] Solomons</hi> bride-bed was indeed very rich, having pillars of Silver, the bottom of Gold, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of Purple, all embroidered, as it were in the midst paved with needle-work, which the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> out of their love and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65652:23"/>
wrought for him: but those hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly mantions wherein I shall, as in his bride-bed, continually rest with my Lord and Saviour, doth beyond all comparison, excell it in riches and glory, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21, 11, 18, 24.</p>
               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Go forth O ye daughters of Zion, and behold King Solomon with the Crown, wherewith his Mother crowned him in the daies of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart,] q. d.</hi> O ye members of the visible Church that live in <hi>Zion,</hi> go forth of your houses, and behold King <hi>Solomon</hi> riding in his Princely Chariot through <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in great state and glory, having on the Crown which his Mother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon him, in the day of his contract, which was the day of his greatest joy; and consider that all the glory of <hi>Solomon,</hi> was but a Type and representation of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Royal Majestie of my Lord

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65652:32"/>
of the sweet familiarity that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us, I account as my special Friend, and am ready to reveal all the secrets of my Fathers will unto; thou which for thy simplicity and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and for that care thou hast to keep thy self undefiled from all spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Fornications, I do so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in; open thou unto me, give me free access into thy heart, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my comforts and promises with more affection, love, and delight; for I have endured many sorrows and afflictions for thy sake, and that I might enjoy thee.</p>

answer unto him, when in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of his word he sought to raise me out of my security; I did well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough discern it was he that spoke to me, and what it was that he required of me, but I had reasonings within my self against it: and what did I answer to him? what did I object against him? Surely that it would be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of too great painfulness and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and cause me to forgoe a great deal of worldly ease and delight, for me, thus to open unto him, and to give him all my heart, to yeild to him such absolute obedience in all things, and to serve him with all the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my heart; for this sleep that I was fallen into, was not upon the ground, or in my chair, but in my bed; I had washed my feet, and put off my cloaths, and lay'd down qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly to take my rest; I had entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a resolution within my self to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the entertainments and ease of this world.</p>

Ver. 4. <hi>My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the doore, and my bowels were moved for him]</hi> My dear Lord and Saviour did not only call upon me, and knock to awaken me, and get me to open to him, but sought to open my door himself, putting in his hand by a hole that was in it, to that end, <hi>i. e.</hi> stirring me up also by the good motions of his spirit, to yeild more chearful and resolute obedience unto him; which when I did perceive, and consider with my self, my heart did then begin to smite me, and I was much troubled in my self for my sluggishness and security, and for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering him as I had done.</p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>I rose up to open to my beloved, and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet-smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock] q. d.</hi> I did not only see my own folly, and grieved for it, but I did also rowse up my self to go and open to my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65652:33"/>
I resolved with my self to entertain him better, and receive him into my heart; which so soon as I had done, I found marvellous sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and comfort in that which he had left behind him, in the graces of his holy spirit, which his calling on me in so comfortable a manner, by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of his Gospel, had stirred up and revived in me.</p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>I opened to my Beloved, but my Beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone; my Soul failed when he spake; I sought him, but I could not find him; I called, but he gave me no answer] q. d.</hi> I did at length unfain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly affect my dear Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and was willing to open my heart unto him, and give him the full possession of it; but he had now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from me the comfortable feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his gratious presence, and then was I brought to the brinck of despair, by remembring how gratiously and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65652:34"/>
lovingly he had spoke unto me; and how ungratiously I had rejected him; and being in this case, I did both by meditation and fervent prayer, labour to recover my former feeling of his sweet and comfortable presence, but could not prevail.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>The Watchmen that went about the City, found me; they smote me, they wounded me; the keeper of the wall took away my vail from me] q. d.</hi> Whilst, I thus not only by my private prayers and meditations, sought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my feeling of the comfortable presence of my Lord and Saviour, but by going abroad, and making use of the helps from others the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Governours of the Church, whose office is to watch the city of God, and to keep the walls of it, and who did accordingly go about the City to over-see and take heed to all the flock, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 28. found me out, and in their Ministry met with my
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65652:34"/>
foul sin, whereby I had so rejected my Saviour; and by the power of the word, and the rebukes thereof, did even smite me, and wound my heart, humbling me much more deeply for my sin; yea, they took away my vaile from me, laid me open, shamed me, and exposed me to all reproach, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24, 25. <hi>Psal.</hi> 145. 5.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>I charge you O Daughters of Ierusalem, if ye find my Beloved, that ye tell him that I am sick of Love] q. d.</hi> Finding no more comfort in the publique Minister of the Word, I sought help by the Prayer and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of such of the faithful as I could meet with, and earnestly charged them, that if themselves did meet with my Beloved, and find any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in him, they would be earnest with him in their prayers for me, and make known unto him my case, that the love I bear unto him, maketh me languish with grief, and anguish of

heart for his absence from me.</p>
               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>What is thy Beloved more than other beloved, O thou fairest among Women? What is thy Beloved more than other Beloved, that thou doest so charge us?]</hi> O thou, in whom we see and acknowledg more grace, and goodness, than is to be found in any other, and whom in that respect we honour; tell us what is the cause of this affection thou bearest unto Christ, which seemeth strange unto us; what excellency is there in him above all other things, that men use to set their hearts and affections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Yea, we pray thee tell us what thou hast seen in him; that thou doest thus importune us.</p>

               <p>Ver. 11. <hi>His Head is as the most fine Gold; his Locks are bushy, and black as a Raven] q. d.</hi> In respect of his Kingdom and Soveraignty, he is the God of Gold; not only most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and precious, (the being King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 16.) but most pure also and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent; his Throne is for ever and ever; a Scepter of Righteousness, is the Scepter of his Kingdom, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 8. His hairy-locks, the multitude of the faithful that hang and depend upon him, as upon the head; as they

can find no terms or comparisons sufficient to express it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>This thy Stature is like to a Palme-Tree, and thy Breasts to clusters of Grapes] q. d.</hi> Thou art in thy whole body like to the Palme-Tree, which besides the pleasant fruit it beareth, cannot be kept from growing, or flourishing, by any waight or burden that is laid upon it; no affliction or persecution can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy growth, but it will rather cause thee to flourish the more, <hi>Psal.</hi> 92. 12, 14.

               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Set me as a Seal upon thine heart, as a Seal upon thine arm, for love is strong as death, jealousie is cruel as the grave, the coales thereof, are coales of fire, which hath a most vehement flame] q. d.</hi> be thou never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of me, but let me be as the impression of a Seal, both in thine heart, and in thine eye continually; for love requires love, and my love to thee, is so Ardent and strong, that I can no more resist it, then a man is able to resist, and withstand Death it self, against which it a were a solly for any to strive, and contend; and my jealousie, lest any should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave me of thy love, or any thing

strengthen, and bless their labours, work with, and by them; if I be from them, they can do nothing. And therefore, whereas thou O <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> received'st but five parts of the increase of thy Vineyard, how fruitful soever it be, and are fain to allow a sixth part thereof to them that dress and keep it; the whole profit and fruit that my Vineyard, (my Church) doth yeild, redoundeth wholly to my Self; and my Servants that labour in it, work not for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but Me alone.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>Thou that dwellest in the Gardens, the Companions hearken to to thy Voyce, cause me to hear it] q. d.</hi> O my dear Church and Spouse, who hast thy chief aboad, and art most seen in the Assemblies, where my people meet together to worship me, which both for the pleasantness and fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, are like to the choicest and sweetest Gardens; all the faithful
