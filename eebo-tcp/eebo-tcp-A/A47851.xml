            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The <hi>Observator,</hi> tending to the Advancement and Introduction of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> and to the Suppression and Extirpation of the <hi>True Protestant Religion</hi> within his Majesties Realms and Dominions:</q> And this Terrible <hi>Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was Usher'd into the World with this Preface, <hi>[We the Grand-Jury,</hi> Sworn <hi>to</hi> Enquire of <hi>Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces committed within the City of</hi> London, <hi>do upon our</hi> Oaths, Present, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there are <hi>Three Quaeres</hi> (Gentlemen) which (if I durst be so bold) I would presume to offer ye upon this Prologue. <hi>First,</hi> Being <hi>Sworn</hi> to <hi>Enquire:</hi> Have you <hi>Impartially Enquir'd,</hi> or <hi>not? 2ly.</hi> If ye have <hi>Enquir'd,</hi> Are these Three Pamphlets all the Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that you have <hi>Discover'd</hi> upon that <hi>Enquiry? 3ly.</hi> What's become of all the <hi>Rest?</hi> for you are as well <hi>Sworn</hi> to <hi>Present,</hi> as to Enquire.</p>
            <p>These are <hi>Quaeres</hi> that I have sometimes formerly mov'd; and the Answer was, That these Three Papers were thrown in your Porridg-dish. Now if ye stumbled upon 'em by <hi>Chance,</hi> where's your <hi>Enquiry</hi> upon <hi>Oath?</hi> Or if ye found any <hi>thing else,</hi> what's become of your <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Presentment?</hi> If ye had but taken me to your Assistance, I'de have carry'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Dick Janeway's</hi> Paper says that, <hi>First, He hath Wickedly and Maliciously Endeavour'd to Sow Dissention and Discord amongst</hi> Protestants, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to render them an easier prey unto their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemies the</hi> Papists.</p>
            <p>Pray Gentlemen, d'ye call this the <hi>Presentment</hi> of a <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> or a <hi>Final Verdict</hi> upon the <hi>Merits</hi> of the <hi>Cause,</hi> to say <hi>First,</hi> that a Man has <hi>done</hi> such a <hi>thing,</hi> and then to Pronounce that he did it with such an <hi>intention,</hi> or to such an <hi>end?</hi> But now to the Article.</p>
            <p>So far has the <hi>Observator</hi> been from Labouring <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention</hi> and <hi>Discord,</hi> that no man has more declar'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self against it, or taken more pains to lay open the Moral Impossibility of Peace in the State according to this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, without a strict Uniformity in the Church: But if you would have fix'd your Presentment aright upon this Head, you should have presented <hi>the Enemy in the Parable that Sow'd the Tares:</hi> And if you will but look into the <hi>Third Section</hi> of this Book, for your better satisfaction, you will find that the <hi>Dissention</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi> that you talk of, was <hi>Sow'd Forty years ago;</hi> and that what we see now, is only an <hi>After crop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Point is, <hi>Countenancing and Abetting the Villanous Contrivances of the Popish Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, who have endeavoured to cast Fictitious Plots upon Protestants, thereby to make way for their own Hellish Plot to take effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is to say, The <hi>Observator</hi> is in the <hi>Popish</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55750:4"/>
               <hi>Plot.</hi> Why do ye not inform against him to the King and Council then, and say <hi>Where,</hi> and <hi>When,</hi> and <hi>How,</hi> and <hi>What?</hi> Why do ye not <hi>Name</hi> the <hi>Contrivances,</hi> and say who are the <hi>Conspirators?</hi> Or what if ye should set forth your Grievances in a <hi>Protestant Mercury,</hi> or get little <hi>Hancock</hi> to open your Case in one of his <hi>News-Letters?</hi> He'l do't for <hi>Pence a piece,</hi> and that's just <hi>Eighteen pence</hi> for his <hi>Reward.</hi> I do assure ye Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, I am in no other Contrivance then to do the Part of an <hi>English Protestant,</hi> a <hi>Loyal Subject,</hi> and an <hi>Honest man,</hi> towards the Upholding of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and I was once within a Trifle of a Halter, for being in that <hi>Popish Conspiracy</hi> (as they call'd it once before) with the <hi>Late King:</hi> And if the same Word, and the same Humour be now taken up again, I am in just such another Plot.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Charge is <hi>the Vilifying and bringing into the Disesteem of his Majesty, and the whole Nation, the Commons of</hi> England, <hi>when Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Parliament, by Arraigning and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently Condemning their Proceedings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You forget (my Masters) that <hi>Impudence</hi> is the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name</hi> of the Greatest Phanatique in the Three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; and that the Epithete, <hi>Villanous,</hi> fits him too as if it had been made for him.

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> better language. And now to the <hi>Accusation,</hi> The <hi>Observator</hi> does first defie ye to shew One Line in all his Writings that will
<pb facs="tcp:55750:5"/>
bear the sence you have Impos'd upon't. And <hi>2dly,</hi> The late Long Parliament which the Fanatiques have Loaden with so many Reproaches, had at least as many Good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, Protestants, and Subjects in it, as any Parliament since. Nay, there is One of your Number (at least) who has said Positively that <hi>L'Estrange</hi> is a <hi>Papist,</hi> which is as False, as if Mr. <hi>Presenter</hi> had gap'd, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil himself had spit in his mouth. But it is come to that pass now, that a man cannot speak a word in favour of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Order</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> but it comes presently to be <hi>an Arraigning of the Commons in Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Observator</hi> is Charged with <hi>Endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Render his Majesties Protestant Subjects in general, and more particularly those in this City, suspected to him by mis-representations of, and odious Reflexions upon their Legal proceedings in their</hi> Common-Halls, <hi>and</hi> Common-Councils; <hi>as also by False and Ignominious Reflexions upon some of their Magistrates; and by Arraigning the Integrity of Juries of this City, for bringing in Verdicts according to their Judgments and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be you your selves now the Iudges (my Masters) which are the rather to be Complaind of; Those that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame the most Eminent of your Citizens, or those that <hi>Vindicate</hi> them: Those that make it a Crime to be Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to the King and the Church; or those that Assert the
<pb facs="tcp:55750:5"/>
Honour and Conscience of that Obedience? And this is the very Case betwixt those <hi>Seditious Scriblers,</hi> whom you have not touch'd at all, and the <hi>Observator.</hi> And which is yet more Remarkable; After all your seeming Fierceness against Popery, <hi>ye have not so much as Presented one single Papist.</hi> What ye mean by <hi>odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reflexions</hi> upon your <hi>Common-Halls</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Councils</hi> I cannot Imagine, unless it be that some Notice has been taken of the Freedom of a Gentleman that said <hi>he knew before-hand,</hi> London <hi>was to be Burnt,</hi> and had several Checks (as is reported) from the Court it self for't. If that be the Point, I shall take the freedom to tell ye, that it is wonder'd at to this day, that it was never put home to him, how he came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it. And though I am not Conscious of any one Disrespectful thought toward this Famous City in my whole Life; saving in the Late Rebellion, when the Fanatique Rabble had torn the Government of it to pieces by the same Methods that are now Prescrib'd and Practic'd over again by Hundreds of Enflaming Libels; yet if such a thing had been, I do not know how your <hi>Common-Halls,</hi> and <hi>Common-Councils</hi> come to be more <hi>Sacred</hi> than the Debates of the House of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> and of his Majesties <hi>Privy Council;</hi> which are daily abus'd by Malicious Forgeries; by Contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Defamatory Reflexions without Controll: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided only that the Misrepresentation be made on the Right side; as in the Printed Copies of several Loyal
<pb facs="tcp:55750:6"/>
Speeches, and Unanswerable Reasonings in the Right of the Crown, where only the general drift of the Speech is set forth without any thing mention'd of the Argument.</p>
            <p>As to the Abusing of your <hi>Magistrates,</hi> I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they would have found it out themselves, if any such thing had been. And then for your <hi>Juries</hi> bringing in <hi>Verdicts according to their Consciences,</hi> they are <hi>Sworn</hi> to <hi>find</hi> according to <hi>Allegations</hi> and <hi>Proofs,</hi> and not when the <hi>Law</hi> determines <hi>one</hi> thing, for them to <hi>think another;</hi> for at that rate, 'tis at their Choice to make an <hi>Honest</hi> man <hi>Guilty,</hi> or a <hi>Criminal Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> and at once to overthrow the Reason and the End of Government. The <hi>Law</hi> says 'tis <hi>Treason</hi> in the People to Conspire the Death of the <hi>King;</hi> but the <hi>Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques</hi> make it <hi>Treason</hi> in the <hi>King</hi> to deny the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> as you will find abundantly, and particularly clear'd in several Sections of this Pamphlet. But neither is the <hi>Observator</hi> Chargeable even with this Article.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Observator</hi> is <hi>lastly Presented</hi> for <hi>Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to Disgrace and Discountenance Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it self, by an Ironical, Immoral, and Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal of writing against such as he endeavours to Stigmatize by the name of</hi> True Protestants.</p>
            <p>Now if I were well enough acquainted with ye, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, I would most humbly beseech ye to Expound this word <hi>Religion.</hi> Is it <hi>one Persuasion</hi> that is <hi>single</hi> and <hi>true</hi> to it <hi>self?</hi> Or is it a <hi>Medley</hi> of <hi>Various</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55750:6"/>
and <hi>Disagreeing Opinions</hi> in the matters of Holy Worship? Tell me now (I beg of ye) how it is possible to bring one and the same Truth to a Consistence with a hundred and fifty Divided, Implicated, and Inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Errors: Nay, and they are Boundless too; for there are <hi>Monsters</hi> in <hi>Heresies</hi> as well as in <hi>Bodies,</hi> which by a <hi>Promiscuous Liberty</hi> of <hi>Mixture</hi> and <hi>Confusion,</hi> must necessarily produce still New and New Diversities to the end of the world. But you shall have this Religion better Decypher'd by some of your own Doctors in the following Papers; and I shall particularly remit ye to the Oracles of Dr. <hi>J. O. W. J.</hi> and <hi>R. B.</hi> And you will find in the Conclusion that the <hi>Uniting</hi> of <hi>Dissenters</hi> is just such another piece of Non-sence, as the <hi>Separating</hi> of your selves <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the Appellation of a <hi>TRUE Protestant,</hi> It is but calling of those People by the name, which they have given themselves: And not with any Regard to the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> neither; but in a Reflecting way of Discrimination from those of the <hi>Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> for in the naming of themselves <hi>True Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi> and taking the whole <hi>Schism</hi> into that <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,</hi> what is this but to intimate that those of the <hi>Church</hi> are <hi>False Protestants,</hi> from whom they have divided. This is the first step toward the explaining of those <hi>False Protestants</hi> to be <hi>Papists.</hi> But what they are they will tell you themselves, if you will but
<pb facs="tcp:55750:7"/>
consult their <hi>Sayings:</hi> And I do not find that there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs any great matter of Complement to this sort of <hi>True Protestants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I should not have been thus free with ye, Gentlemen (before Company) if the <hi>Observator</hi> had not prevail'd upon me to follow your Example, in giving Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the Publishing of so many thousand Copies up and down the City, at the Election on <hi>Michaelmas day last,</hi> and <hi>all over</hi> the Kingdom, by a Scum of Mercenary Intelligencers: Insomuch, that whosoever gives Credit to those Papers, must necessarily believe the <hi>Observator</hi> to be one of the greatest <hi>Rascals</hi> upon the face of the Earth: And I do confidently Affirm, that they are infinitely greater that Publish him so to be. If the <hi>Presentment</hi> had taken place, and the matter gone on in a due form of <hi>Law,</hi> a man might have had a Speech yet for his money, but this way of Proceeding runs to the Tune of <hi>Four and Forty,</hi> and Condemning the poor Rogue to the Gallows over again, without a <hi>hearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would not be Ungrateful to any man, any manner of way; and I could not tell how to pitch upon a more suitable acknowledgment than by this Dedication. First, It was your Pleasure to set your Presentment abroad with a kind of a <hi>Noverint Universi;</hi> and I have taken the best care I could here, to make it twice as Publique as it would have been otherwise. <hi>2dly,</hi> You were pleas'd to
<pb facs="tcp:55750:7"/>
do Honour to the <hi>Observator,</hi> by Printing your <hi>Names</hi> to the <hi>Scandal;</hi> and for that Reason they are here like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Exposed with his <hi>Vindication. 3dly,</hi> In regard that ye are men of <hi>Bus'ness,</hi> and not at leisure perhaps to turn over Books; and zealously affected over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove to the Reputation of an odd sort of Christians that style themselves <hi>True Protestants,</hi> what more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Present in this World could I make you, than this Collection of <hi>True-Protestant-Sayings,</hi> ready drawn up to your hands, where you shall see all their <hi>Virtues Common-plac'd,</hi> their Graces drawn to the life, their Agreement among themselves, their Affection to the King and Church; the Moderation of their Principles, and the tenderness of their hearts towards their Sovereign, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and Impartially set forth and transmitted to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity by <hi>themselves,</hi> and effectually <hi>Sign'd, Seal'd,</hi> and <hi>Deliver'd</hi> to the <hi>World,</hi> for the use of <hi>future Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations</hi> by their own <hi>Rabbies.</hi> Gentlemen, I am with all Reciprocal Affection,</p>

            <p>(1) <hi>TOleration</hi> hath done much more toward the Rooting of Religion out of the Hearts of many men in seven year, then the Enforcing of <hi>Uniformity</hi> did in <hi>Seventy years. Cawdrys Independency,</hi> a great <hi>Schism,</hi> 1657. P. 14.</p>
            <p>(2) A <hi>Toleration</hi> hath <hi>All Errors</hi> in it, and <hi>All Evills. Edwards Gangreen.</hi> P. 58.</p>
            <p>(3) A <hi>Toleration</hi> would be the putting a Sword in a Mad man's hand; a Cup of Poyson into the hand of a Child, a Letting loose of Madmen with Firebrands in their hands; An appointing a City of Refuge in mens Consciences for the Devil to fly to; a lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a stumbling Block before the Blind; a Proclaiming Liberty to the Wolves to come into Christs Fold to Prey upon the Lambs. Neither would it be to Provide for <hi>Tender Consciences,</hi> but to take away <hi>all Conscience. The Harmonious Consent of the</hi> Lancashire <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters with their Brethren in</hi> London. Subscribed by 84. 1648. P. 12.</p>
            <p>(4) A Toleration would make us become the Abhorring, and Loathing of all Nations, and being so palpable a Breach of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, would awaken against us the Lord of Hosts to bring a Sword upon us, to Avenge the Quarrell of his Covenant. Mr. <hi>Noise</hi> of <hi>New England</hi> of the <hi>Power of Magistrates.</hi> P. 13.</p>
            <p>(5) That Doctrine that cryeth up <hi>Purity,</hi> to the Ruine of <hi>Unity,</hi> is Contrary to the doctrine of the Gospel. <hi>Vindication of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Government and Ministry.</hi> 1649. P. 124.</p>
            <p>(6) That Religion which carries in the Front of it a <hi>Toleration</hi> of Different <hi>Religions,</hi> and not sufficient to keep the Body of Christ in <hi>Unity,</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> is not the Government of Christ. <hi>Ibid.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:55750:9"/>(7) Liberty in all matters of <hi>Worship</hi> and of <hi>Faith,</hi> is the open and Apparent way to set up Popery in the Land, <hi>Bax. Non-Con. Plea. Pref.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(8) Must he have his <hi>Conscience,</hi> that makes <hi>no Conscience?</hi> What? he that hath sin'd away his Conscience? If <hi>Conscience</hi> be a sufficient Plea, the <hi>Papists</hi> may come in for a Childs part. If Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science goes against the word; <hi>Deponenda est talis Conscientia.</hi> Get Conscience better Enform'd. The Conscience of a Sinner is Desil'd. 1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 15. <hi>Conscience</hi> being <hi>desil'd,</hi> may <hi>Erre; Conscience erring</hi> may suggest that which is <hi>sinfull.</hi> There is nothing can bind a man to sin. <hi>Watson to the Commons. Dec.</hi> 27. 1646. <hi>P.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>(9) A Toleration of <hi>Independent Churches,</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> with Opinions and Practise, against the Magistrates Duty lay'd down in Scripture. <hi>Edwards Full Answer.</hi> P. 237. [It is against the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn League and Covenant for <hi>Reformation.</hi> P. 238.] [A shrew'd Temptation to make many fall, and a means of Confirmation in the way of Errour. P. 244.] [A Toleration of One or more Different ways of Churches and Church-Government, from the Church, and Church-Government Establish'd, will be to this Kingdom very Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, Pernicious, and Destructive. P. 247.] [It hath ever been from first to last, a Fountain of Evil, and a Root of Bitterness, of many bitter Divisions and Separations among themselves, of Manifold Errors and other Mischiefs in those Churches and Places where they liv'd. P. 248.]</p>
            <p>(10) Will Mercifull Rulers set up a Trade for Butchering of Souls, and allow men to set up a shop of Poyson, for all men to Buy, and take, that will: yea, to Proclaim this Poyson for Souls in streets, and <hi>Church-Assemblies,</hi> &amp;c? <hi>Baxters Self-Denial. Epist. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(11) We must either Tolerate all men to do what they will, which they will make a matter of Conscience, or Religion, and then some may offer their Children in Sacrifice to the Devil; and some may think they do God service in Killing his servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or else you must Tolerate no Errour or Fault, in Religion; and then you must advise what measure of Penalty you will Inflict. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Church-Divis.</hi> P. 363. 364.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:55750:9"/>(12) I have known too many very honest hearted Christians, Especially Melancholique Persons, and women, who have been in great doubt about the opinions of the <hi>Millenaryes,</hi> the <hi>Separatists,</hi> the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> the <hi>Seekers,</hi> and such like; and after Earnest Prayer to God, they have been strongly resolv'd for the way of <hi>Errour,</hi> and Confident, by the strong Impression, that it was the Spirits Answer to their Prayers; and thereupon they have set themselves into a Course of sin. <hi>Ibid.</hi> P. 162. [It is very ordinary with poor Fantasticall Women, and melancholique Persons to take all their deep Apprehensions for <hi>Revelations. Ibid.</hi> P. 167.</p>
            <p>(13) If we do through weakness, or Perverseness, take Lawfull things to be Unlawfull, that will not excuse us in our disobedience. Our Errour is our sin, and one sin will not excuse another. <hi>Baxters</hi> 5. <hi>Dispute.</hi> P. 483.</p>
            <p>(14) <hi>Oh what a Potent Instrument for Satan is a Misguided Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence!</hi> It will make a man kill his Dearest Friend, yea Father or Mother, yea the holyest Saint, and think he doth God good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice by it. And to Facilitate the work, it will first blot out the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of their Holiness, and make them take a <hi>Saint</hi> for a <hi>Devil. Bax. Saints Rest,</hi> P. 133.</p>
            <p>(15) Take heed how you tolerate <hi>Schism;</hi> for in little time without great care it will open the door to <hi>Heresy. Hodges to the Commons. Mar.</hi> 10. 1656. P. 55.</p>
            <p>(16) Divisions, whether they be Ecclesiasticall, or Politicall, in Kingdoms, Citys, and Familyes, are Infallible Causes of Ruine to Kingdoms, Cityes and Familyes. <hi>Calamy to the Commons.</hi> Dec. 25. 1644. P. 4.</p>
            <p>(17) Lyes would not take, if they were not Commended by the Holyness of the Person, and Guilded over as a Rotten Nutmeg with Gold. <hi>Vines to the Commons. Mar.</hi> 10. 1646. P. 27.</p>
            <p>(18) We must not Judge of <hi>Faith</hi> by the <hi>Person,</hi> but of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> by the <hi>Faith. Ibid.</hi>
            </p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55750:10"/>
of which, the Devil hath in Former times made War against the Church, is slain under him, and now he is mounted upon a Fresh Horse of another Colour, called <hi>Liberty of OPINION;</hi> falsly call'd <hi>Liberty of CONSCIENCE. Ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(20) If Conscience be warrant enough for Practices and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; and Liberty of Conscience be a sufficient License to Vent or Act them, I cannot see but the Judicatories either of Church or State may shut up shop, and be resolved into the Judicatory of Every mans Private Conscience, <hi>Ib. P.</hi> 60.</p>
            <p>(21) The severall Bands of <hi>Anabaptists, Antinomians, Familists, Libertines</hi> and <hi>Separatists</hi> are so multiply'd, that they begin to threaten and speak Big words. <hi>Walker to the Commons.</hi> Jan. 29. 1644. P. 18.</p>
            <p>(22) The Hand of God is apparently gone out against your ways of <hi>Separation</hi> and <hi>Anabaptism. Baxter to the Separatists. April.</hi> 20. 1655.</p>

            <p>(1) WHEN the Supream Magistrate will not Execute the Judgment of the Lord, those who made him Supream Magistrate under God, who have under God, Sovereign Liberty to dispose of Crowns and Kingdoms, are to Execute the Judgment of the Lord, when Wicked men make the Law of God of none Effect, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 32. so <hi>Samuel</hi> killed <hi>Ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>(2) Shall it Excuse the States to say, <hi>We could not judge the Cause of the Poor, nor Crush the Priests of</hi> Baal, <hi>and the Idolatrous</hi> Mass<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, <hi>because the King forbad us?</hi> Lex Rex. <hi>p.</hi> 175.</p>
            <p>(3) The Kings Power is <hi>Fiduciary,</hi> and put in his hand upon
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55750:31"/>
Trust, and must be Ministerial, and borrow'd from those who put him in trust, and so his Power must be Less, and derived from the Parliament. <hi>Lex Rex.</hi> p. 177.</p>
            <p>(4) The Magistrate hath no Power to suppose things Doubtful and Disputable, upon the Practice of any in the Service of God; and therefore it cannot be lawful for any to obey him when he so Imposes. <hi>E. Bagshaw of things Indifferent.</hi> Part. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>(5) Our Fundamentals were not made by our <hi>Representatives,</hi> but by the <hi>People themselves;</hi> and our Representatives themselves limited by them; which it were Good that <hi>Parliaments</hi> as well as <hi>People</hi> would observe and be faithful to: For no Derivative Power can Null what their Primitive Power hath Established. <hi>The English-man.</hi> p. 11.</p>
            <p>(6) Royal Primogeniture alone, without the Peoples consent, is no Rightful Title to the Government; nor hath the Eldest Son, or Heir of the King, any Right to the Government by Birth, unless the People consent to chuse him thereto. <hi>Mene-Tekel.</hi> p. 10.</p>
            <p>(7) The Parliaments of <hi>England,</hi> and often the People without the Parliament, have (in their Addresses to the King) given him the Title of <hi>Lord,</hi> in a way of Honour and Respect; but when he hath refused to perform his Duty to them, and endeavoured by his Unlawful Prerogative to abridge them of their Liberties, they have made him understand his Relation, and by force of Arms Asserted their own Privileges, and sometimes compelled the King to Perform his Duty, other times Deposed him from the Government; as the People of <hi>Israel</hi> did <hi>Rehoboam</hi> upon the same account; and so have most, if not all the Nations in the World done the same. <hi>Ibid.</hi> pag. 36.</p>
            <p>(8) Rising up against Authority it self, the Ordinance of God, and Disobeying the Powers therewith vested, standing and acting in their Right Line of Subordination, is indeed Rebellion, and as the sin of Witchcraft; but to Resist, and Rise up against Persons Abusing Sacred Authority, and Rebelling against God, the Supream, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to adhere to God as our Liege Lord, and to Vindicate both our selves and his Abused Ordinance from Man's Wickedness and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. <hi>Naphtali.</hi> p. 157.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:55750:31"/>(9) The Power of the King Abused to the Destruction of Laws, Religion, and Subjects, is a Power contrary to Law, Evil, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical, and Tyeth no man to subjection. <hi>Lex Rex.</hi> p. 261.</p>
            <p>(10) If we consider the Fountain-Power, the King is Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to Parliament, and not <hi>Co-ordinate,</hi> for the Constituent is above that which is Constituted. <hi>Lex Rex.</hi> p. 377.</p>
            <p>(11) Whensoever a King, or other Supream Authority Creates an Inferiour, they Invest it with a Legitimacy of Magistratical Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to punish themselves also in case they prove evil doers; yea, and to act any other thing requisite for the Praise and Encouragement of the Good. <hi>Io. Goodwins Right and Might well met,</hi> 1648. p. 7.</p>
            <p>(12) The People is not King formally, because the People is eminently more than the King; for they make <hi>David</hi> King, and <hi>Saul</hi> King. <hi>Lex Rex.</hi> p. 156.</p>
            <p>(13) The Laws are in the hands of the Parliament to Change or Abrogate as they shall see best for the Common-wealth; even to the taking away of Kingship it self, when it grows too Masterful and Burdensome. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>(14) The Parliament sit in that body, not as his Subjects, but as his Superiors, call'd, not by him, but by the Law; not only twice every year, but as oft as great affaire require, to be his Counsellors and Dictators, though he stomack it, nor to be Dissolved at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but when all Grievances be first removed, all Petitions heard and answered. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 110.</p>
            <p>(15) Our Covenant was not taken without the Royal Authority of the King, though it be Condemn'd by his Personal Command; for as long as this Parliament of <hi>England</hi> continueth, the Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power is annexed to it, by vertue of that Act of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance: So that the King of <hi>England,</hi> in his <hi>Power,</hi> may still be at <hi>Westminster,</hi> though King <hi>Charles</hi> in his <hi>Person</hi> be at <hi>Oxford,</hi> or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. <hi>The Covenanters Catechism,</hi> 1644. p. 16.</p>

The best that can be said for them, is, that the Broil went farther then they intended; or otherwise, that they were misled into a mistake of the question in hand: But even in this point also, they have left themselves without excuse; for 'tis a clear Case, that their Zeal and Confidence increas'd with their Successes. And all their care was at first for his Majesties <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Safety,</hi> and to bring him home to his <hi>Parliament,</hi> out of the hands of <hi>Cut-throats</hi> and <hi>Papists.</hi> They were up at every turn, with the Maxim, that <hi>the King could do no wrong;</hi> and all the blame was laid upon his <hi>Ministers.</hi> This way of Pretended Tenderness for his Majesties <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Person,</hi> implys their secret Consciousness of a Legal Duty; only 'twas too early days yet to take off the Masque. Now their judgment upon the Point was the same <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,</hi> as at <hi>first;</hi> but as they gather'd <hi>Strength</hi> they grew <hi>Bolder</hi> too, and the <hi>last Violence</hi> was no more than the putting of their <hi>first Thoughts</hi> in <hi>Execution.</hi> And whoever observes the method and the scope of their Proceedings, will find their Principles varying with their Fortunes; and the deepest Professors of Veneration for the Dignity of the King, and his Government in the <hi>Beginning</hi> prove the most daring Insulters upon his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Regalities and Honour in the <hi>Conclusion.

               <p>You have in the <hi>First Section</hi> a full and unanimous Testimony of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> against <hi>Toleration;</hi> nay against <hi>any sort</hi> of <hi>Toleration,</hi> either in <hi>Doctrine</hi> or in <hi>Discipline,</hi> and in <hi>what Degree</hi> or <hi>Measure so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi> as a thing utterly <hi>Impious,</hi> and therefore <hi>Insufferable.</hi> This, me-thinks, should be sufficient to stop the mouth of a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> when he demands a <hi>Toleration;</hi> that he himself pronounces it a <hi>wicked thing</hi> to <hi>grant</hi> it.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Second Section,</hi> he sets forth the <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Consequences</hi> of it to be not only the certain <hi>Destruction</hi> of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> but an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let to Licentious Prostitution of Manners, and the most Blasphemous of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refies.

               <p>In the <hi>Third Section,</hi> the Dissenters do not only make it a matter of Conscience, to disagree among themselves, but fall even to Cutting of Throats upon the very Question. What is the meaning then of their pressing for a <hi>Union</hi> among men of so many several Persuasions not to be United? And what do they talk of Brotherly Love, and Agreement for, among men of Principles as Inconsistent as fire and water?</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Fourth Section</hi> you may observe the Rude and Implacable <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities</hi> of the <hi>Dissenters</hi> toward the <hi>Ecclesiastical State,</hi> where they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themselves tyed in <hi>Conscience</hi> to do their utmost endeavours towards the overthrowing of it.

               <p>The <hi>Eighth Section</hi> advances the Authority of the <hi>Kirk</hi> to a more abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Degree of <hi>Sovereignty</hi> over King and People, than ever the <hi>Papacy</hi> it self pretended; and supported upon the same Pretensions too; so that to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a <hi>Toleration</hi> of the <hi>Presbyterial Government,</hi> is only to desire his Majesty that he will d'off his Imperial Crown, and strike to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Ninth Section</hi> lies fairly expos'd the hazard of abating any thing in the strictness of <hi>Ecclesiastical Discipline,</hi> in regard of the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> and <hi>Positions</hi> of these People, even if the <hi>Men themselves</hi> were <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly inclin'd.</hi> Take notice of the <hi>Positions,</hi> and never doubt it, but Men of <hi>Deposing Principles</hi> will proceed (if they have opportunity) to <hi>Deposing Actions;</hi> and reckon that they do God and their Country good Service too: Especially when it seems no more to them than the placing of Authority upon the right Foundation.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Tenth Section</hi> you will find the Operation of the former Principles in the Animating, Pressing, and Irritating of the People to Commotions and Tumults, and still the Dissenting Divines in the Head of the Controversie; and the Pulpits and Presses the Fountains of our Calamities. Never did any People speak fairer at first, or do fouler things at last, then those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Peaceable Ministers of the Gospel: And had they but come into the World time enough, <hi>Boccalini</hi> would never have drawn his Intelligence from <hi>New-Spain</hi> of the <hi>Shepherds Dogs</hi> being all turn'd into <hi>Wolves,</hi> when he might have found so much a more lively instance nearer home of those that were set to Guard and Defend the Sheep, transform'd into the Merciless Devourers of them.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Eleventh Section</hi> you will find a <hi>Rebellion Justifi'd,</hi> by the same lips that had call'd God a thousand times over, to witness the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55750:47"/>
of their hearts, and the Loyalty of their intentions: And with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations also, not to be mention'd without trembling. Iudge what Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit now is to be given to the fair Professions of this sort of People.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Twelfth Section</hi> you would take these <hi>Godly Ministers</hi> (as they style themselves) to be Members rather of a Corporation of <hi>Common Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners,</hi> then of an Assembly of Divines, by their Outragious and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable Thirst of Blood; and yet th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>se practices are recommended to the multitude, as the Inspirations and Duties of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>And it is not <hi>Common Blood</hi> will serve their turns neither; nor any thing less than the <hi>Sacred Life</hi> of their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> to appease their Holy Wrath (<hi>Section 13.</hi>) and to Attone for the sins of the Nation.</p>
               <p>And in the <hi>Last Section,</hi> (as if it were to put themselves beyond the Possibility of Repentance, and to Preclude the ordinary course even of God's Boundless Mercies) they pass an Approbation upon the whole Tract of their proceedings, and ascribe to Almighty God, one of the most execrable acts of Cruelty and Injustice that ever was committed upon the face of the Earth, since the Crucifixion of his Blessed and only Son. New as to the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the Principal Actors and Asserters of this Unexampled Wickedness, what clearer Evidence can ye desire then what is here deliver'd unto ye in <hi>their own Words</hi> and <hi>Writings?</hi>
