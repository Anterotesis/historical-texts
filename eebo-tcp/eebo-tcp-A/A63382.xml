            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. IT is hereby declared that this is to be a private conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Students of Divinity (ſo called) of the Colledges of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> and the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as a fulfilling of any Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge wherein theſe Students may be included, within the Theſes ſet forth by <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> (or may have received from any of that People) but abſtract from the Publick Challenge given to the Preachers in general in the end of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Theſes; becauſe it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with particular condition of having the Publick places to diſpute in, before the Auditories, before whom they conceive they have been miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is provided that when any of either Party is ſpeaking, if any of their company offer to ſpeak, he that is ſpeaking is to be ſilent; but if two of a Party ſpeak at once, he that is ſeen to obtrude himſelf, ſhall be judged im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38050:4"/>
and excluded thereby from farther acceſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That each ſpeaker on any of the ſides have full liberty, and time to ſpeak, without interruption of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Party; and that he that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts ſhall be debarred from farther ſpeaking.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That each ſide abſtain from School-terms and diſtinctions (as much as poſſible) but if any uſe them, that they may be opened to the People in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſo that any of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry capacity (that are not educated in Colledges) may underſtand them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As for Retortions they muſt not be impertinent, and from the purpoſe; and none ſhall be ſo inſiſted on as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert us from the point, or turn the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent into the Reſpondent.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The day appointed for the Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, is the fourteenth of <hi>April,</hi> in the Year, one thouſand ſix hundred ſeventy five, (being the day called <hi>Wedneſday</hi>) the place is to be at <hi>Alexander Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> Houſe or Cloſe (in caſe the <hi>Gray-Fryers</hi> Church (ſo called) cannot be obtained) and that the Conferrence
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38050:4"/>
is to continue from two to five a Clock in the After-noon.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Both Parties ſhall endeavour to procure a Praeſes to moderate, but not to have any deciſive judgement; yet if ſuch a one cannot be procured, the Conference is not to be broken up.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And it is hereby declared that both Parties intend this for mutual edification; and therefore intend to abſtain from any thing that may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct ſo good an Event.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It is likewiſe agreed, that none ſhall have liberty to ſpeak, but thoſe that have, or ſhall Subſcribe before the Diſpute begin, theſe aforeſaid Articles.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Alex. Skein</hi> one of our Friends choſen Praeſes for Us (becauſe we could not at that time procure ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) ſtanding up with the other Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <hi>Studient,</hi> It was condeſcended that no <hi>Quaker</hi> ſhould be a Praeſes. <hi>Quaker,</hi> We are wronged; for we never condeſcended to any ſuch thing: and ſeeing ye have choſen one of your way, how can we be hindered to chooſe one of ours.</p>

                  <hi>Thomſone</hi> their Praeſes, There
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38050:5"/>
needs no debate in this matter; for we are choſen not to have any deciſive judgement, but only for the Moral part, to take notice if the Rules be obſerved; or whether ye keep to the purpoſe. Then <hi>John Leſlie</hi> had a long and tedious diſcourſe, concerning what was fit to be done, and how we ought to diſpute.</p>

               <p>I deſire to be heard, we being a People ſo generally miſrepreſented, as heretical and erroneous, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves obliged to give a true and faithful account of our Principles; which I did in a certain Paper now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der debate, and that our innocency therein might appear, there was a Challenge added to the end of it, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to defend theſe our Principles, if we might be allowed ſo to do in theſe Publick places where we have been ſo much miſrepreſented, and againſt thoſe Perſons who had there ſo often traduced us: To which having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no Anſwer, ſome of the Studients
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38050:5"/>
of Divinity come to us; and ſignified that they looked upon themſelves as concerned; becauſe mention is made of ſuch in the beginning of that Paper. To whom we anſwered, that they were not the Perſons challenged by Us; as not being the Publick Preachers that had miſrepreſented Us: But ſeeing they were deſirous to debate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we were not unwilling to render to any, a reaſon of the hope that is in us; and therefore ſhould not decline it. And foraſmuch as ſome did object, that we were at a loſs, as engaging with them; becauſe there would be little advantage in caſe we had any victory and a greater reflection, ſhould we appear to be at any loſs. To ſuch we had, and have this to ſay; that as we are not afraid to meet with the greateſt and ableſt of the Preachers themſelves: ſo the Truth leads us not to deſpiſe any. As <hi>R. B.</hi> was going on, he was interrupted.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38050:6"/>
of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> though <hi>R. B.</hi> pretends in his Preface to be againſt School-Divinity; yet his Theſes are full of it: and there are many other contradictions, which I will not now take notice of, The Preachers and Miniſters of the Word, not finding themſelves concerned; we Young-men, and but Students, have offered to diſpute: in the Articles the <hi>Quakers</hi> have been very unreaſonable; and particularly, <hi>G. K.</hi> did refuſe any Article ſhould be put in, againſt railing; becauſe he ſaid, that might be railing in me, which was not in him; becauſe he (to wit, <hi>G. K.</hi>) was immediately led by the Spirit. We have concluded, that being Young men, in caſe the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhould have any advantage, it will not be of great conſequence, and if we have advantage, we hope it may be uſeful; becauſe theſe are the great Prophets and Preachers, of the <hi>Quakers.</hi>

The one is the inward evidence of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, by its own immediate Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony in our hearts. The other is the Teſtimony of the Scriptures, which I affirm in the Name of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> is the beſt external and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward evidence, and rule that can be given: And my reaſon why we have the Teſtimony of the Scriptures, as an evidence that we have the Inſpiration of the Spirit, is this. All Men have a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38050:9"/>
meaſure of the Inſpiration of the Spirit of God according to the Scriptures teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, That Chriſt the true Light inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth every man that cometh into the world; and that a manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal: But this univerſal Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or minifeſtation is inſpired; and if all men be in meaſure inſpired, then conſequently we who are men are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired.</p>

               <speaker>A. Shir.</speaker>
               <p>I prove it. If there be no ſuch Seed in men, as a ſubſtantial, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Principle, diſtinct from the Soul, that can be heard, ſeen, ſavoured, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, aad felt, then there is no ſuch Seed in men as the <hi>Quakers</hi> maintain: But the firſt is true, therefore the laſt. And then the ſaid <hi>Alexander Shirreffe</hi> read a paſſage at length out of <hi>G. K.</hi> his Book
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38050:13"/>
of immediate Revelation, <hi>page</hi> 6, 7. that the Seed was ſuch a living, ſubſtantial Principle, and that in the Seed theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations were only received.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. B.</speaker>
               <p>This is a digreſſion from the matter, and a paſſing from the Theſes, which ſhould have been the ſubject of this days debate, to <hi>G. K.</hi> his Book of immediate Revelation.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt now appear to defend my Book, and Apologize to <hi>R. B.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am neceſſitated to put my hand in anothers harveſt; Therefore I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh upon the word <hi>ſuch</hi> in the firſt Propoſition. If by <hi>ſuch,</hi> thou meaneſt a ſubſtantial Principle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay, that is altogether extrinſick to the ſubject of the debate; and beſides it will engage us into the greateſt nicities and obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Philoſophy and School divinity, that is not proper for this Auditory. But if by ſuch thou meaneſt, An Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Principle of Gods ſaving Grace in men, whereby they are capacitated both to know and do the will of God; I affirm and am ready to maintain there is ſuch a Principle in all men.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Al. Shir.</speaker>
               <p>But I prove that that Seed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:38050:13"/>
in men is not of a ſubſtance, or ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Principle.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
               <p>I am ready to defend, that it is a ſubſtantial Principle. But that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſecond Propoſition, we ought not to come to it before the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of the firſt Propoſition be diſcuſſed. Here the Students made a great noiſe. And <hi>G. K.</hi> appealed to the Praeſes <hi>And. Thomſon,</hi> who anſwered diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, that <hi>G. K.</hi> did not refuſe to defend that the Seed of God was a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Principle; but this was not its proper place, until the diſtinction of the former Propoſition be diſcuſſed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Al. Shir.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhall wave the word ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and I offer to prove, that there is not a Seed of God in men, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> affirm, if there be ſuch a Seed, it is either created, or uncreated: But it is neither created, nor uncreated, chuſe you whether.</p>

               <p>I hope ye underſtand it, and I ſhall explain it to them, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it not. A Concrete Term com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth two things; the one in <hi>recto</hi> (as they ſay) the other in <hi>obliquo,</hi> that is to ſay, the one hath the other belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, as merciful is a Concrete Term, which is as much as to ſay, one that hath mercifulneſs in him, and ſo mercifulneſs is the Abſtract, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth that one thing belonging to the Concrete. Now to apply: If we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>Seed</hi> as the Concrete, it is both uncreated and created; for it is God himſelf diſcovering himſelf to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures capacity, in his work of manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, which work is created; but he who doth manifeſt himſelf in that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation is uncreated. And becauſe he manifeſts himſelf at firſt in a low and ſmall degree unto the Soul; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he in that manifeſtation is compar'd unto a <hi>Seed</hi>; even as <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt compared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a grain of Muſtard-ſeed in his inward appearance in mens hearts.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Al. Shir.</speaker>
               <p>The Seed is not a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Principle, becauſe it is the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:38050:14"/>
of God; but the manifeſtation of God is not a ſubſtantial Principle, but accidental.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
               <p>That may be ſubſtantial or a ſubſtance, which in another reſpect is accidental, as Gold is a ſubſtance, ſo Silver, Houſes, Lands are ſubſtances; but they are accidental to me, becauſe I may want them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Al. Shir.</speaker>

               <p>I prove that manifeſtation is not a ſubſtance.</p>

               <speaker>R. B.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>I. L.</speaker>
               <p>I prove that manifeſtation is not created. Whatſoever is of God, is God: But this manifeſtation is of God, Therefore it is God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G.K.</speaker>
               <p>Take notice of this young mans blaſphemy; for if whatſoever is of God be God, then all the Creatures are God, as ſtones, Horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Scripture ſayes, of him, and through
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:38050:15"/>
him, and to him are all things. Here the Students made a noiſe, and fell a laughing to cover this: ſome of them ſpeaking irreverently of God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
               <p>I beſeech you, yea, I charge you all in Gods fear, that when you ſpeak of that Holy and Dreadful Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ye do it with fear and reverence.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A. Shir.</speaker>
               <p>Ye ſay then, this Seed is God in a manifeſtation: I prove it is not. That is not God which can be meaſured in meaſures, and can grow from a leſſer meaſure to a greater, can be formed and grow up in men. But God cannot be meaſured in meaſures, nor grow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore this Seed is not God in a manifeſtation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
               <p>After he had repeated the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, I anſwer, God as in himſelf, or as in his own Being cannot be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured or grow up, it is true. But as in reſpect of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>manifeſtatione quoad nos</hi> (or as to us) that is to ſay, as he comes forth as to us, diſcovering himſelf, he or his Spirit may be ſaid to have meaſures. And this I ſhew from Scripture: As where it is ſaid in <hi>John</hi> concerning Chriſt, God gave not the Spirit by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38050:15"/>
meaſure unto him; implying he gave it forth in meaſures unto others; and where <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Elijah,</hi> Let a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble portion of thy Spirit in upon me.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>J. L.</speaker>
               <p>He ſaith God cometh forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Creatures: I prove he cannot come forth into the Creatures, becauſe he is in himſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
               <p>He doth come forth into the Creatures, and yet is ſtill in himſelf; for he is not limited as Creatures are, who go from one place to another; but he is in all Creatures, and in himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; but this young man, as I perceived by him the other day, is a nullibiſt in his Opinion, as they term them; ſo that according to his Principle, the Soul of <hi>John Leſly</hi> is as much in <hi>France,</hi> even now as in his body, or in this place, that is to ſay, neither here nor there; but herein I ſpeak according to Scripture-words, which ſaith, God boweth the Heavens and cometh down; yet not that he leaveth his own Being; but it is ſpoken after the manner of men, who is every where in all his Creatures; but manifeſteth himſelf in ſeveral meaſures unto them.</p>

               <p>There is nothing in the Seed but God; therefore God in his own Being is meaſured forth according to the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrine; for the Seed <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               <p>We will go from this to the eleventh <hi>Theſis,</hi> which <hi>R. B.</hi> read out, and is as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All true and acceptable worſhip to God is offered in the inward and immediate moving and drwaing of his own ſpirit, which is neither limited to places, times, or perſons; for, though we be to worſhip him always, in that we are to fear before him; yet as to the outward ſignification thereof in Prayer, Praiſes or Preachings, we ought not to do it where and when we will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but where, and when we are moved thereunto by the ſecret Inſpirations of his Spirit in our hearts, which God heareth &amp; accepteth of, and is never wanting to move us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, when need is, of which he himſelf is the alone proper Judge. All other worſhip then, both Praiſes, Prayers, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which man ſets about in his own will, and at his own appointment, which he can both begin and end at his pleaſure, do or leave undone as himſelf ſees meet, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be a preſcribed Form, as a Lytur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38050:17"/>
or Prayers conceived</hi> ex tempore, <hi>by the natural strength and faculty of the mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are all but Superſtition, will-worſhip, and abominable Idolatry in the ſight of God, which are to be denied re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and ſeparated from in this day of his ſpiritual ariſing. However it might have pleaſed him who winked at the times of ignorance, with a reſpect to the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and integrity of ſome, and his own innocent Seed, which lay as it were buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the hearts of men, under that maſs of ſuperſtition to blow upon the dead and dry bones, and to raiſe ſome breathings, and anſwer them, and that until the day ſhould more clearly dawn and break forth.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Al. Sh.</speaker>
               <p>By this Theſis ye affirm, that no man ought to go about any duty without a particular impulſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R B.</speaker>
               <p>Impulſe is not a word uſed by me, but an obſcure word; therefore ſay, Inſpiration, or Influence.</p>

               <speaker>Al. Sh.</speaker>

               <speaker>A. Sh.</speaker>
               <p>This contradicts <hi>G. K.</hi> who in his Book of immediate Revelation, ſaith, That in all things whatſomever, we ought to have an inſpiration of the Spirit for the doing of the ſame; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we cannot do in faith.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. B.</speaker>
               <p>This is another digreſſion and going from the purpoſe; for the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not how far I contradict ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but what in Reaſon ye can ſay againſt what I have here affirmed: for when I ſhew you before how ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted your Maſter, <hi>viz. John Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies</hi> in another matter, ye would not admit it as relevant, though the Caſe be alike, alledging it was a Retortion, ye undertook to diſpute againſt the Theſes; but it ſeems you find not room enough there, but ye muſt ran to <hi>G. K.</hi> his Book for further matter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
               <p>I ſee it is more againſt <hi>G. K.</hi> than <hi>R. B.</hi> his Theſes that you ſet your ſelves. And therefore <hi>G. K.</hi> muſt defend <hi>G. K.</hi> But I ſay, in this there is no contradiction between <hi>R. B.</hi> and me, for there is a two-fold ſort of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38050:18"/>
Inſpirations or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences,<note place="margin">N<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>te, divers of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors were diſpleaſed with their going from the Theſes.</note> the one General, the other Special. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Influences are given in general, or common for the doing of all common or ordinary Actions, and by the ſpecial influences of the Spirit we are enabled to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe ſpecial duties, as of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Thanksgiving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now of theſe ſpecial inſpirations or influences <hi>R.

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. B.</speaker>
               <p>To which I have this to add, there is a difference betwixt the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Spirit, as we are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly acted by them in ſingular and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Acts of Worſhip, and as we are generally influenced by the Spirit, in ſo far as we come habitually to live and walk in the Spirit, for in that reſpect we may be ſaid to do every thing in the Spirit, as we grow up into that ſtate, though there be more particular influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences requiſit in matters of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>

               <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
               <p>I ſay further, particular Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences or inſpirations of the Spirit are of ſeveral ſorts, which are analogous or proportional to the ſeveral<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſorts of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as Preaching, and Praying are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of duties. Now the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular influence to Pray, is not to Preach, and ſo on the contrary. Alſo the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which ſerve to duties only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as to wait, fear, and love God, do not ſerve without a ſuperadded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to the performance of outward duties. Therefore every influence is to reſpect the duty that it is given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>

               <speaker>A. Shir.</speaker>
               <p>I prove that ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar influences are not needful to acts of worſhip; thus: If ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar influences of the Spirit were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto outward acts of Worſhip, then they were alſo needful unto inward du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as to waiting, deſiring, loving, and feeling God: but the laſt is abſurd, therefore the firſt.</p>

               <p>I prove the laſt is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd: If the inſpirations of the Spirit be neceſſary to inward duties, as to wait, deſire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then we muſt not wait with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them; but this is abſurd, therefore is the other.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
               <p>Having repeated the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I deny that this is abſurd; for we cannot ſuppoſe, that ever at any time an influence or inſpiration can be wanting to wait upon God, to deſire, and fear, and love him; and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular influences to particular duties, ſuch as Praying, Preaching, Thanksgiving is not wanting, whenever the ſeaſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to go about them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Al. Shir.</speaker>
               <p>If ye have theſe particular influences, why do ye not make uſe of them? Why do ye not ſay the Grace?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. B.</speaker>
               <p>It will not follow that we do not pray, nor make uſe of thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar influences, becauſe at ſometimes we
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:38050:19"/>
do not take off our Hats, or ſpeak words, which are not eſſential to true Prayer.</p>

               <p>I prove that that diſtinction concerning general and particular influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences is not ſufficient, That which may be a ground for a Heretick to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear Prayer for a whole year is not a ſufficient diſtinction; but this may be a ground for a Heretick to forbear Prayer for a whole year; Therefore it is not a ſufficient diſtinction.</p>

               <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
               <p>Though an Heretick may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, yet he has no ground from our, Principle to pretend to any ſuch thing becauſe theſe particular influences can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wanting, neither for one year, nor for any time that the particular duties ought to be gone about; and if any did pretend the want of particular influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are to be judged as guilty and deceitful, as giving that for an excuſe which is not ſufficient, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

               <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
               <p>He doth not command us in all things in which we are inſpired; for ſome Inſpirations are Mandatory, and commanding, ſome Permiſſory, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting; and ſome forbidding; ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt commanding and forbidding, the midſt is permitting.</p>

               <speaker>J. L.</speaker>
               <p>But a Permiſſion cannot be an Inſpiration, otherwiſe ye might ſay, a ſtone doth inſpire you as much as God, becauſe a ſtone doth permit or not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
               <p>I deny the Conſequence; for I offer to ſhew from Scripture, that <hi>Paul</hi> when he did a thing by permiſſion was inſpired, as when he ſaid, <hi>I ſpeak this by permiſſion and not by Commandment.</hi> Here he was writing Scripture by inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the very time.<note place="margin">See 1 Cor. 7.6. &amp; compared with 40. verſe. See Acts 16.7.</note> And again, where he ſaid, I aſſayed to go to ſuch a place, but the Spirit permitted not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A. Shir.</speaker>
               <p>This was not a permiſſion, but a hindering, or not a permitting him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
               <p>But I gather out of theſe words by the Rules of Contraries, that if the Spirit did not permit <hi>Paul</hi> at ſometimes, it did permit him at other times, and this permiſſion was by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and I hope it is lawful for me to make this obſervation or note upon this Scripture; ſeeing your Maſters will
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38050:21"/>
make half a dozen not ſo much to the purpoſe. But for the further opening of this matter, I diſtinguiſh of permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thus: There is a negative permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a poſitive permiſſion: A ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative permiſſion is a ſimple forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or not medling in any caſe; and ſuch a negative, permiſſion is no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent warrant to us to do any thing. The poſitive permiſſion is when God by ſome inward evidence or ſignification of his Spirit by words or otherwiſe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us know that he alloweth us to do ſuch a thing, although he command it not. As for Example, if a Scholar ſhould go forth out of the School with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out getting of his Maſters leave, this is a negative permiſſion, and is not a ſufficient ground for the Scholar to go forth: but when the Scholar cometh, and ſaith. Let me go forth; and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter anſwereth, thou mayeſt go, this is a poſitive permiſſion, and not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>

particularly at what time they were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.

               <p>AS in this late Rencountre it was ſpecially provided, that it ſhall be abſtract from the Challenge made to you, and ſo no fulfilling of it; ſo now this being paſt, of which you have here preſented to you a good and faithful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, which we hope being ſeriouſly weighed by your more mature Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, may allay any haſty joy that might have proceeded from the windy Triumphs the Students might have poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed you with a belief they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, who at every turn to the nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeating of the more ſerious and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Auditors, were proclaiming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Victors, we think you more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; and indeed we are the more deſirous to meet and debate it with your ſelves; for either this is all ye have to ſay, which ye have put in their mouths,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:38050:28"/>
or ye have more to ſay; if this be all, then indeed it may be your wiſdom not to accept this offer; but if ye have more, we ſhall be willing to hear it, and endeavour to anſwer it; and as your appearing your ſelves would be more ſatisfactory to the people, and is moſt deſired by them as well as us; ſo divers inconveniencies that hath in this, or may fall in the like would be avoided; for firſt, it being in your publike houſes, there would be leſs occaſion of tumult, becauſe the houſe is capable to hold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers thouſands. Secondly, as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable ye would not ſo readily be put to a ſtand as they, if it ſhould happen ye were: we are hopeful ye would not by raiſing a laughter and clamour amongſt the people, and crying out three or four at once, ſeek to cover it, or boaſt of Victory, and cry out your Argument is pungent before we have time allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to anſwer it. Thirdly, you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging we are hopeful to procure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, Learned, and perſons every way conſiderable to be Judges conſultative upon our part, though not profeſſing our way, to help to moderate and keep
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:38050:29"/>
good order. Fourthly, it is probable, that by the ſolemnity of ſuch an action and the influence of your preſence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as other perſons of condition being there, might ſecure us from the hazard of clods, and ſtones; for I do truly aſſure you, I conceive my ſelf more able to anſwer the moſt pungent of your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than defending my ſelf from the ſtones and blows of your unreaſonable and brutiſh Church-Members. It is by ſome of your people objected to us (whether it come from you or not I will not affirm) that it is below you to engage with us; but as this is altogether unſutable to Chriſtian Miniſters, whoſe Mr. diſdained not daily to debate, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Queſtions of ſuch as oppoſed themſelves unto him, and taught his Diſciples to leave the ninety and nine, and go ſeek after the odd one. Next it is moſt unreaſonable, for ſince ye take liberty to ſpeak againſt us in your Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, and particularly to deſigne us, yea &amp; ſometimes to ſpeak untruths of us. I deſire then to know whether it be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Rules of Chriſtianity, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of common honeſty, to take liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:38050:29"/>
to ſpeak ill of men behind their backs, abuſe their Principles and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and yet ſay it is below them to prove theſe Charges to the mens own faces. Secondly, it is objected, that it is againſt the Laws to call the faith e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by Law into queſtion; but may not the ſame be ſaid againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in thoſe Nations where Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Mahomitiſm are eſtabliſhed by Law; yea, is not this the very pretence and put off whieh the Papiſts both in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France</hi> gave the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Proteſtants, when they deſired pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like conferences with them? And was not both the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and his Brother <hi>Ferdinando</hi> ſorely checkt by divers Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> for granting theſe Conferences? and the Queen-Mother of <hi>France</hi> openly reproved and cried out againſt by Cardinal <hi>Turnon</hi> and other Clergy-men, for giving way to that of <hi>Poyſy,</hi> as ſuffering the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal faith of the Church to be called in queſtion, which had been eſtabliſhed by many Laws, &amp; for a far longer time than the Profeſſion we oppoſe. It ſeems ye defend your ſelves chiefly by Popiſh
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:38050:30"/>
Weapons, as will anon further appear: in order whereunto I ſhall ſpeak a word or two to <hi>John Menzies,</hi> and ſo make an end. The greateſt and frequenteſt Argument that both thy Scholars and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers make againſt us, is, that we have no certain evidence by which we can make known that we are led by the Spirit that Hereticks and others cannot pretend to. Now if this may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as relevant or ſtrong againſt us, I deſire thou wouldſt be pleaſed to ſhew me how thou canſt extricate thy ſelf out of the ſame difficulty, when urged by the Jeſuit <hi>Dempſter,</hi> that the Scripture which thou aſſigned as the ground of the Proteſtant Religion is an evidence for you, ſeeing all Hereticks alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it? Let me ſee what difficulties occur in our Caſe as to the Spirit, which likewiſe occurs not the ſame very way in yours, as to the Scripture. For (beſides that we have as good ground to lay claim to the Scriptures as your ſelves, and are ready, and I hope able to prove our Principles from them as well as your ſelves. If ye ſay men may be deceived by a ſeducing Spirit, What
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:38050:30"/>
then? will it therefore follow that the Spirit of God will deceive any, or that men ought not to be guided by it, more than becauſe many men have been and are deceived by a miſunderſtanding and wrong uſe of the Scripture, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture doth deceive people, or ought not to be the Rule? If it be ſaid divers men pretending to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit contradict one another, doth not the ſame recur as to the Scriptures? What greater contradictions can there be than there is betwixt certain Churches both acknowledging the Scriptures to be the Rule? Haſt thou forgotten (<hi>John</hi>) how thou and thy Elder Brother <hi>Andr. Cant,</hi> who both affirmed the Scripture to be the only certain Rule, &amp; yet oftentimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame Auditory in the ſame Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit did from the very ſame <hi>ver.</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Pſ</hi> 93.5. <hi>Holineſs becometh thy houſe O Lord, for ever,</hi> draw different and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory Doctrines, Uſes and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations? If that then will not infer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to you the Scriptures to be an uncertain Rule; neither will the other as to the Spirit. If it be ſaid that the ſame man pretending to be guided by
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:38050:31"/>
the Spirit, hath been of different Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, doth not the ſame alſo recur as to the Scriptures? Or need we go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>John,</hi> than thy ſelf to prove this, who hath all along acknowledged the Scripture to be the Rule, and yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time judged the Congregational way to be preferable to the Presbyterian, &amp; then the Presbyterian better then Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and now the Epiſcopal preferable to both? Or tell me, <hi>John,</hi> honeſtly, did the Scripture deceive thee when thou preached upon that Text, <hi>Why mourneſt thou for Saul?</hi> If thou ſay thou only here miſunderſtood the place, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied it; yet is the Scripture for all that true and certain; may not the ſame he ſaid, if one pretending the Spirit to be the Rule, ſhould fall in the like error that the Spirit were not to be blamed, or thence termed uncertain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the man that miſtook the voice thereof, or took his own imaginations inſtead of it, as thou didſt thy miſapprehenſions for the ſenſe of that Scripture. If thou canſt extricate thy ſelf out of theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, ſo as to ſatisfie me, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rational and indifferent perſon, I
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:38050:31"/>
may ſeriouſly ſay to thee according to the Proverb, <hi>Eris mihi magnus Apollo.</hi> And really thou mayſt not be without hopes of making a Proſelyte. But if it appear to all judicious and unprejudicate perſons that <hi>John Menzies</hi>'s Arguments againſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> are no other than the Jeſuits againſt him; and whatever way he can defend himſelf againſt the Jeſuites, ſo the <hi>Quakers</hi> can do againſt him, and impugn and ſtraiten him the ſame way, ſo that his Argument is like the Vipers brood, that deſtroys him that brings it forth. I ſay, if this appear, what may candid perſons judge of <hi>John Menzies</hi> honeſty that has aſſerted in Print, that Quakeriſm is Popery un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a diſguiſe; and the Papiſts and <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> are one.</p>
               <p>The ſtate of the Controverſie in the firſt place then both upon our part and yours is in <hi>Theſis</hi> and not in <hi>hypotheſi,</hi> that is not whether or not we be truly ruled by the Spirit, or can give an evidence of it, more than whether ye be truly led by the Scriptures, or can give any evidence that ye are; but whether we do well in ſaying the Spirit is the principal Rule of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:38050:32"/>
Faith; for though divers Sects now, to wit, <hi>Lutherans, Calviniſts, Epiſcopalians, Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptiſts, Antinomians, Arminians,</hi> &amp;c. do all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel one another, each laying claim to be led by the Scripture, &amp; denying it of the other; yet do they all agree in this, that the Scripture is the only Rule, will it therefore follow that the Scripture is not the Rule or certain, becauſe none of theſe can give a certain evidence convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their reſpective oppoſers, that they are led by it? So on the other hand, though ſuch as affirm the Spirit to be the principal Rule, cannot give any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to convince their Oppoſers, that they are led by it; it will not follow that it is not the Rule, or that they err in affirming it ſo to be.</p>

            <head>A Poſtſcript.</head>
            <p>AS the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid concerning the Spirit of God, that <hi>there are diverſity of operations, but one Spirit, and one body of Chriſt, which is his Church</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo I may ſay concerning Antichriſt, and his ſpirit and body. The body of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is but one, having many members<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the ſpirit of Antichriſt is but one in the root, though in different operations, &amp; appearances. And what is this body of Antichriſt, but all theſe (whether <hi>Papiſts</hi> or others, though pretending to Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under whatſoever deſignation, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal, Presbyterian, Independent, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> or any elſe) who oppoſe the Spirit of Chriſt in his ſpiritual appearances and operations in the body of Chriſt, which is his Church. A manifeſt inſtance of the truth of this, I my ſelf of late have been an ear and eye witneſs of. For not many months ago I had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at <hi>London,</hi> both to ſee with my eyes,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:38050:33"/>
and hear with my ears, how the people called <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> ſome of their chief Teachers, oppoſed, denied, ſlighted, and (by all means their earthly and deviliſh wiſdom could invent) laboured to make of none effect the inward evidence of the Spirit of God in his people, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing openly in the faces of thouſands, That whoever <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ould not give an evidence to their Adverſaries, that they were inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Spirit of God ſuch as no hereticks could pretend to, were no Chriſtians but deceivers. So theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts lately argued againſt us at <hi>London</hi> in an open Aſſembly. And ſo now ſince in my own native Country within theſe few days, I have ſeen the ſame Spirit to appear in men profeſſedly very much differing from Anabaptiſts, and ſlighting them as a ſort of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, yet one with them in the ground; and in this particular work and ſervice alſo, to carry on the great deſigne of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.

were ſober and judicious, did oppoſe the inward evidence of the Spirit of God in his people, as not being a ſufficient evidence unto them, unleſs they could give an evidence of it unto others, even their very Adverſaries, that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired; and ſo if we the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> could not give an evidence of this unto theſe our oppoſers, we were but deceivers. After it had been ſhewn them, that Papiſts &amp; Jeſuits uſed the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt all the Proteſtants, that indeed did more militat againſt them, out of the Papiſts Quiver, than out of theſe our Adverſaries Quiver againſt us. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Teſtimony of the Scripture, as the beſt and moſt convincing outward evidence that could be given, as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Doctrine and Principle of Immediate Revelation and Inſpiration of the Spirit of God, owned by us, as being in all men in ſome meaſure, and conſequently in us. This is, I ſay, not the the beſt and moſt principal evidence, nor the greateſt, that we have unto our ſelves, or unto one another, who are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into the ſame Faith, Spirit, and Power, for that is the immediate evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:38050:34"/>
of the Spirit in our hearts, which witneſſeth both to our ſelves and to one another, that we are the Children of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is (I mean the Scripture) the greateſt outward and viſible evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that can be given unto our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, who in words own the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as their only Rule, and chiefeſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences. And in doing ſo, I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the example of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who while he reaſoned againſt the Jews, who profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to own the Scriptures, but denied him; he brought a teſtimony for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of the Scriptures, which they in words owned as their Rule; <hi>Search</hi> (ſaid he) or ye <hi>ſearch the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and theſe are they, which teſtifie of me.</hi> Now thoug<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Chriſt his own immediate Teſtimony ſhould have been received as greater than any of his Servants, ſuch as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets were, yet he uſed this, as an Argument againſt them, as bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to their own Rule; and ſaid he, <hi>had ye believed Moſes, ye would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved me, for Moſes wrote of me.</hi> And he laid again, <hi>I have a greater teſtomony than
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:38050:34"/>
that of John</hi>: and yet <hi>John</hi> was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of all the Prophets. So in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we ſay, We have a greater teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to Chriſt Jeſus by his Spirit, and Power revealed in us, than the teſtimony of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, even than <hi>John,</hi> who was the greateſt. But when we produce the Teſtimony of <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; the Prophets and Apoſtles as an evidence to the truth of what we affirm, I ſay it ſhould be received by our Adverſaries who own the Scriptures as their chief and only Rule. For either they ſhould receive it, or not receive it; if they ſhould receive it then they are faulty, who in the late Diſpute at <hi>Aberdene</hi> did refuſe to receive the evidence of the Scriptures, as from us, only becauſe we ſay we have a greater, to wit, that of the Spirit within us, although we own the Scripture as the greateſt viſible and outward evidence that we can give to our Adverſaries. If they ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Scripture evidence and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony as from us, becauſe we ſay we have a greater, to wit, that of Chriſt himſelf immediately in us by his Spirit, then they muſt needs alſo ſay, for the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:38050:35"/>
ſame reaſon, that the Jews ought not to receive the teſtimony of the Scriptures as an evidence for Chriſt, becauſe he ſaid he had a greater; and certainly he had a greater, though they would not receive it, nor could not, as they ſtood in their prejudice and malice, werewith they were filled againſt him, who did not receive him.</p>
            <p>Now this I ſay with freedom and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit to all thoſe whether Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, Anabaptiſts, Prelatical or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Profeſſors, who with one mouth require of us an evidence that we are inſpired, or have a meaſure of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Spirit of God and Chriſt in us; I offer unto all of you <hi>the Scriptures</hi> for an evidence of this truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſo called have a meaſure of the Inſpiration of the Spirit of God and Chriſt in them; for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scriptures teſtimony, Chriſt the true Light enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world; and his il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination is his inſpiration; I profeſs ſincerely in Gods fear, that the Scriptures Teſtimony is to me as full and plain, and convincing to prove this Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:38050:35"/>
an Illumination, Manifeſtation, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Spirit of God is given to every man, is in every man; as to prove this truth, that Chriſt, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was the promiſed <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi>; now if we can prove from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that all men have in them a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of this Divine Illumination and Inſpiration by the Spirit of Chriſt, we have gained our point, which is, that we have alſo a meaſure of the ſame in us; for <hi>ALL MEN</hi> doth comprehend us called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as well as other men: I ſee not what our Adverſaries can with any colour object againſt this evidence from Scripture, but this, that they will deny that the Scripture bears teſtimony to this Univerſal Illumination or Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit of God in men. But this brings the matter of the debate from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſonal to be doctrinal, &amp; ſo puts us upon equal terms at leaſt, with all our Adverſaries, eſpecially Prelatical, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtiſt, and Presbyterian, &amp; Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent oppoſers whatſoever, who ſay, the Scriptures are their chief and only Rule.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:38050:36"/>
And though our Adverſaries ſay, the Scripture doth not teſtifie to that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Inſpiration of the Spirit of Chriſt in men, that moveth us not more then when the Jews denied that the Scriptures bore teſtimony to him, that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to be the Chriſt. We are able by the help of God to prove from Scripture the truth of this Doctrine of Divine Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Inſpiration in all men, and conſequently in the <hi>Quakers</hi> as much as they, or any profeſſing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity upon earth, can prove any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or Doctrine of their Faith. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we are able, and do offer by the Grace of God againſt all our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers whatſoever, to prove from the Scriptures Teſtimony, that this univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Inſpiration and Illumination of Chriſt by his Spirit in men is a ſufficient evidence of Truth, and Rule of Faith and Life in all men, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in us called <hi>Quakers.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this Divine Inſpiration and Illumination, where it is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reſiſted and rejected, but regarded and attended, is a greater evidence
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:38050:36"/>
than the Scripture is, and witneſſed by the Scriptures. Fourthly, and yet the Scripture is the greateſt viſible and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward evidence that either we or they can give of their Rule.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with a reaſonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to theſe Young men, Maſters of Arts, their Maſters and Teachers, which is this, Whether they own theſe Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Affirmations and Arguments of their Scholars in the late Diſpute, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>viz. That whatever is of God is God, that the Scriptures according to the</hi> Quakers <hi>is fallacious, and can beguil us, that the Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt is ceaſed,</hi> and the reſt of their Diſcourſe inſerted in this foregoing Treatiſe. If yea, Let them declare ſo much to the people, who are greatly ſtumbled at theſe their expreſſions, even divers of their own Church; if nay, then let them publickly reprove and diſown thoſe words, otherwiſe not only we, but many others will ſay, ye have both taught and allowed them ſo to affirm.</p>
