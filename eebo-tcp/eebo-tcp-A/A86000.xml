         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in our Places &amp; Callings,
the preſervation of the Reformed
Religion in this Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline,

Uniformity in all theſe, together with the extirpation
of Hereſie, Schiſme, and whatſoever ſhall be found
contrary to ſound Doctrine: And conſidering withall
that one of the ſpecial means which it becometh us in
our Places and Callings to uſe in purſuance of theſe
<pb facs="tcp:114797:3"/>
ends, is in zeal for the true Reformed Religion, to
give our publick teſtimony againſt the dangerous te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
of <hi>Eraſtianiſme, Independency,</hi> and which is falſly
called <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> which are not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

received Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as to the Work of Reformation and Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

upon theſe conſiderations, having heard publickly
read the CXI following Propoſitions exhibited and
tendered by ſome Brethren who were appointed to
prepare Articles or Propoſitions for the vindication
of the Truth in theſe particulars, Doth unanimouſly
approve and agree unto theſe eight generall Heads of
Doctrine therein contained and aſſerted. <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That
the Miniſtery of the Word, and the Adminiſtration
of the Sacraments of the New Teſtament, Baptiſme
and the Lords Supper, are ſtanding Ordinances inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by God himſelf, to continue in the Church to
the end of the world. 2. That ſuch as adminiſter the
Word and Sacraments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ought to be duely called and
ordained thereunto. 3. That ſome Eccleſiaſticall
cenſures are proper and peculiar to be inflicted onely
upon ſuch as bear Office in the Kirk; Other cenſures
are common, and may be inflicted both on Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and other Members of the Kirk. 4. That the
cenſure of Suſpenſion from the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper, inflicted becauſe of groſſe ignorance,
or becauſe of a ſcandalous life and converſation; As
likewiſe the cenſure of Excommunication, or caſting
out of the Kirk flagitious or contumacious offenders,
<pb facs="tcp:114797:3"/>
both the one cenſure and the other is warrantable by
and grounded upon the Word of God, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
(in reſpect of Divine inſtitution) to be in the
Kirk. 5. That as the Rights, Power and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Civill Magiſtrate are to be maintained ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Word of God, and the Confeſſions
of the Faith of the Reformed Kirks, So it is no leſſe
true and certain that Jeſus Chriſt, the onely Head and
onely King of the Kirk, hath inſtituted and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Kirk Government diſtinct from the Civill Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
or Magiſtracy. 6. That the Eccleſiaſticall
Government is committed and intruſted by Chriſt to
the Aſſemblies of the Kirk, made up of the Miniſters
of the Word and Ruling Elders. 7. That the leſſer
and inferiour Eccleſiaſticall Aſſemblies ought to be
ſubordinate and ſubject unto the greater and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Aſſemblies. 8. That notwithſtanding hereof,
the Civill Magiſtrate may and ought to ſuppreſſe by
corporall or civill puniſhments, ſuch as by ſpreading
Errour or Hereſie, or by fomenting Schiſme, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſhonour God, dangerouſly hurt Religion, and
diſturb the Peace of the Kirk, Which Heads of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
(howſoever oppoſed by the authours and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters
of the foreſaid Errours reſpectively) the
Generall Aſſembly doth firmly beleeve, own, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and commend unto others as ſolid, true, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,
grounded upon the Word of God, conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the judgement both of the ancient, and the
beſt Reformed Kirks. And becauſe this Aſſembly
(through the multitude of other neceſſary and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
buſineſſe) cannot now have ſo much leaſure as
to examine and conſider particularly the foreſaid
<pb facs="tcp:114797:4"/>
CXI Propoſitions: Therefore a more particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
thereof is committed and referred to the
Theologicall Faculties of the four Univerſities of
this Kingdom, and the judgement of each of theſe
Faculties concerning the ſame, is appointed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to the next Generall Aſſembly. In the mean
while, theſe Propoſitions ſhall be printed, both that
Copies thereof may be ſent to Presbyteries, and that
it may be free for any that pleaſeth to peruſe them,

            <p>Thirdly, Thoſe powers are differences in reſpect of their
formes, and that three wayes: For firſt the civill Power, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in reſpect of God it bee Miniſteriall, yet in reſpect of the
Subjects it is Lordly and Magiſteriall. Eccleſiaſticall power is
indeed furniſhed with authority, yet that authority is liker the
Fatherly then the Kingly authority; Yea alſo tis purely Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall,
much leſſe can it be lawfull to Miniſters of the Church to
bear dominion over the flock.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="59" type="proposition">

            <head>59.</head>
            <p>Emperors, Kings and other Magiſtrats are indeed appointed
fathers of they countrey, but the are withall Lords of their
People and Subjects; Not as if it were permitted to them to
bear rule and command at their owne will and as they liſt (for
they are the Miniſters of God for the good and profit of the
Subjects) yet it belongs to their power truely and properly to
exerciſe dominion, to hold principality, to proceed imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.
It is indeed the duety of Miniſters and Rulers of the
Church to overſee, to feed as ſhepherds, to correct and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie,
to bear the keyes, to be Stewards in the houſe of Chriſt,
but in no wiſe to be Lords over the houſe, or to governe as
Lords, or Lordlike to rule; yea in brief, this is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the civill Magiſtrate and the Eccleſiaſticall Miniſtery,
in reſpect of thoſe that are committed to their truſt, that the lot
of the former is to be ſerved or miniſtred unto, the lot of the
latter to miniſter or ſerve.</p>

         <div n="60" type="proposition">
            <head>60.</head>
            <p>Now we have one onely Lord which governes our ſouls,
neither is it competent to man, but to God alone to have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and authority over conſciences. But the Lord hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his owne Stewards over his owne Family, that according
to his commandment they may give to every one their allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

to them hee hath delivered the keyes, or power of letting in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

will have let in or ſhut out. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19. and 18. 18. <hi>Luk.</hi>

            <p>Next, the civill power is indued with authority of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling;
But it belongs not to the Miniſtery to compell the
diſobedient; if any compulſion be in or about Ecleſisſticall
matters, tis adventitious from without, to wit, from the
help and aſſiſtance of the Magiſtrate, not from the nature of
Eccleſiaſticall power, from which it is very heterogenous;
and therefore if any Suſpended or Excommunicate perſons
ſhould be found, who ſhall be ſo ſtiffe-necked, and ſo impudent
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114797:17"/>
that at once he caſt off all ſhame, and make no account at all

do more and more contradict and blaſpheme; the eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Miniſtry in ſuch caſes hath nothing more to do by way of
juriſdiction: But the Magiſtrate hath in readineſſe a compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
juriſdiction and externall force, whereby ſuch ſtubborn, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious

            <head>62.</head>
            <p>Laſt of all, the power of the Magiſtrate worketh onely
politically or civilly, according to the nature of the Scepter
or Sword, maketh and guardeth civill Lawes, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

               </gap>cteth with a ſecular power: But the eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
power dealeth ſpiritually, and onely in the Name of our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by authority entruſted or received from
him alone: neither is it exerciſed without prayer or calling on
the Name of God: nor laſtly, doth it uſe any other then ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
weapons.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="63" type="proposition">
            <head>63.</head>
            <p>The ſame ſinne therefore in the ſame man may be puniſhed
one way by the civill, another way by the eccleſiaſticall
Power; By the civill Power under the formality of a crime,
with corporall or pecuniary puniſhment: By the eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

ſpirituall cenſure; even as alſo the ſame civill queſtion is one
way deliberate upon and handled by the Magiſtrate in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
or place of Judgement; another way by the Miniſter of
the Church, in the Presbytery or Synod: By the Magiſtrate,
ſo farre as it pertaineth to the Government of the Common-wealth;
by the Miniſter, ſo far as it reſpects the conſcience;
for the eccleſiaſtiall Miniſtery alſo is exerciſed about civil
things ſpiritually, in ſo far as it teacheth and admoniſheth the
Magiſtrate out of the Word of God what is beſt and moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
unto God; or as it reproveth freely unjuſt judgements,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114797:17"/>

         <div n="66" type="proposition">
            <head>66.</head>
            <p>Fourthly, they differ in the end: The immediate, neareſt end
of civil power, is, that the good of the Common-wealth may
be provided for and procured, whether it be in time of Peace,
according to the rules of Law and counſel of Judges; or in
time of War, according to the rules of Military prudence: and
ſo the temporall ſafety of the Subjects may be procured, and
that external Peace and civil Liberty may be preſerved, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <head>67.</head>
            <p>But the chiefeſt and laſt end of civill Government is, the
glory of God the Creator, namely, that thoſe which do evil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by a ſuperior power reſtrained or puniſhed, and thoſe which
do good, getting praiſe of the ſame, the ſubjects ſo much the more
may ſhun impiety and injuſtice: and that Vertue, Juſtice and the
Morall Law of God (as touching thoſe eternal duties of both
Tables, unto which all the poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> are obliged) may
remain in ſtrength, and flouriſh,</p>

         <div n="68" type="proposition">
            <head>68.</head>
            <p>But whereas the Chriſtian Magiſtrate doth wholly devote
himſelf to the promoting of the Goſpel and Kingdom of Chriſt,
and doth direct and bend all the might and ſtrength of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to that end: This proceedeth not from the nature of his
office and function, which is common to him with an Infidell

         <div n="69" type="proposition">
            <head>69.</head>
            <p>For every member of the Church (and ſo alſo the faithful and
godly Magiſtrate) ought to referr and order his particular vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
faculty, ability, power and honour to this end, that the
Kingdom of Chriſt may be propagated and promoted, and
the true Religion be cheriſhed and defended: So that the
advancement of the Goſpell, and of all the Ordinances of the
Goſpell, is indeed the end of the godly Magiſtrate: not of

            <p>But the end of Eccleſiaſtical power, yea the end as well
of the Miniſtry it ſelf, as of the godly Miniſter, is, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

Lord be made ſtraight, that his holy myſteries may be
kept pure, that ſtumbling-blocks may be removed out of the

         <div n="71" type="proposition">

            <p>And ſeeing this power is given of the Lord, not to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but to edification; Therefore this ſame ſcope is propounded
in Excommunication, (which is the greateſt and laſt of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical

            <p>Fiftly, they are diſtinguiſhed by the effect. The effect of civil
power is either proper or by way of redundance: The proper
effect is the ſafety temporal of the Common-wealth, externall
tranquillity, the fruition of civil Liberty, and of all things which
are neceſſary to the civil Society of men. The effect, by way of
redundance, is the good of the Church, to wit, in ſo far as by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of Juſtice and good Laws, ſome impediments that uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

his office in puniſhing the wicked, and cheriſhing and
encouraging good men, taking away thoſe things which
withſtand the Goſpell, and puniſhing or driving away the
troublers and ſubverters of the Church; ſo much the more the
orthodox Faith and Godlyneſs are reverenced and had in eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
ſins are hated and feared: Finally, and all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
contained (as much as concerneth the outward man)
within the liſts of Gods Law: Whence alſo by conſequence
in happeneth, by Gods bleſſing, that the Church is deſiled

Peace.</p>

            <p>But the proper effect of the Eccleſiaſticall power, or keys
of the Kingdom of Heaven is wholly ſpirituall; for the act
of binding and looſing, of retaining and remitting ſins, doth
reach to the ſoul and conſcience it ſelf (which cannot be ſaid
of the act of the civill power:) And as unjuſt Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

The politick power is committed ſometimes to one, ſometimes
to more, ſometime by right of election, ſometime by right of
ſucceſsion: But the Eccleſiaſticall power is competent to none
under the New Teſtament by the right of ſucceſsion, but he
who hath it, muſt be called, by God and the Church, to it; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was it given by Chriſt to one, either Paſtor or Elder, much
leſs to a Prelate, but <hi>to the Church,</hi> that is, to the conſiſtory of
Presbyters. 'Tis confeſſed indeed, and who can be ignorant of
it, that the power (as they call it) of <hi>order,</hi> doth belong to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

            <p>Seventhly, they differ as touching the correlative: God
hath commanded, that unto the civil power, every ſoul, or all
Members of the Common-wealth, of what condition and eſtate
ſoever, be ſubiect; for what have we to do with the Papiſts,
who wil have them, whom they call the Clergy or Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
perſons, to be free from the yoke of the civill Magiſtrate?
The Eccleſiaſticall power extends it ſelf to none other ſubiects,
then unto thoſe which are called Brethren, or Members of the

            <head>77.</head>
            <p>Eightly, there remaineth another difference in reſpect of
the diſtinct and divided exerciſe of authority. For either
power ceaſing from its duty, or remitting puniſhment, that
doth not (ſurely it ought not) prejudice the exerciſe of the
other power; namely, if the Magiſtrate ceaſe to do his duty,
or do neglect to puniſh with ſecular puniſhment, thoſe male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
which by profeſsion are Church Members: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
it is in the power of the Governors of the Church, by the

though they doubt, but that unto the wicked and contentious

take care that this wholeſom medicine, thrown out of the

that is, that ſcandalous ſins be puniſhed: fon this is
the very end of Excommunication, that mens manners may
be well ordered, and the Saints flouriſh, the prophane being
restrained, lest wicked men by their impudency and impiety
increaſe and undo all. It is our part, ô brethren, with

to be in the mean time a juſt Diſcipline amongst Ministers,
for the doctrine and life of Miniſters is diligently to be enquired

be depoſed, and like wolves driven away from the floek of the
