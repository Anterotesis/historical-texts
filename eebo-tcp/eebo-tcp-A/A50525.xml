            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Many yeers agoe I was acquainted with it, by the Authors own hand: For such was his scholasticall ingenuity; I found him most free in communicating his studies; right like unto the description of the Scholar in <hi>Chaucer</hi>:
<q>
                  <l>Sounding in morall vertue was his speech,</l>
                  <l>And glady would Learne, and gladly teach.</l>

            <p>And sometimes he dealt plainly with me, in telling me the reason why; and that was, because he found me so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive after his meditations, whereas those with whom he familiarly conversed, were nothing so. The truth is, I was exceedingly taken with his notions; for he had a Critical wit, and affected to correct common errours: and herein he seemed to me exceeding happy, Demonstrating not onely acutenesse of wit, and clearnesse of conceipt, but solidity of judgment. And therfore from the first time, that I grew acquainted with him, I made bold to improve my acquaintance to the uttermost of mine owne advantage scholasticall, encouraged thereunto by his facility and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy condescension to my requests.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:93201:3"/>
               <hi>2</hi> The beginning of our familiaritie was occasioned by a rumour spread of his opinion, concerning the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Kingdome of Christ here on earth, which many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd yeeres agoe was cryed downe, as the Errour of the <hi>Millenaries</hi>: and <hi>Augustine</hi> himselfe, though confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that at first he liked the same, yet sheweth how that afterwards he was taken off from it, and upon what ground. And it seemed wondrous strange to us, that such an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion should after so many hundred yeeres be revived; and that in so strange a manner, as now we finde, both amongst us, and amongst outlandish Divines. Neverthelesse my selfe being firmely set upon studies of another nature, I had no great edge so much as to hearken to it, much lesse to take it into consideration. But a friend in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey sometimes urged me to write to an acquaintance in <hi>London;</hi> and to entreate him to enquire of Master <hi>Mede,</hi> whether he were of the same opinion with <hi>Piscator</hi> and <hi>Alstedius</hi> concerning the first resurrection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kingdome of Christ. And hereupon shortly after, word was sent me, that he did agree with <hi>Piscator</hi> in this, that some shall rise a thousand yeeres before others, but he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from him in this, that <hi>Piscator</hi> thought this Reign of Christ should be in heaven; but I (said Master <hi>Mede</hi>) agree rather with <hi>Alstedius</hi> and conceive, that the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d yeeres reigne of Christ shall be on earth. Yet herein he differed from <hi>Alstedius;</hi> that whereas <hi>Alstedius</hi> was of opinion, that the thousand yeers reigne of Christ should be after the day of judgment, Master <hi>Medes</hi> opinion was that it should be <hi>in &amp; Durante die judicii,</hi> in an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the day of judgement; which day of judgement should continue a thousand yeeres, beginning with the ruine of
<pb facs="tcp:93201:3"/>
Antichrist, and ending with the destruction of <hi>cog</hi> and <hi>Magog.</hi> And that <hi>Camerarius</hi> writing upon <hi>Plato's Alcinous,</hi> testifies that the <hi>Rabbines</hi> among the <hi>Iews</hi> write, that the seventh thousand yeeres shall be the great day of judgement, or the judgement of the great day. And <hi>Hierome</hi> upon the sixty fifth chapter of <hi>Esay</hi> confesseth, that it was a tradition among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias should reigne a thousand yeeres in new <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> When I heard this, my Spirit was stirred up in me to lay aside for a while my ordinary studies, and to take this into consideration; and I prayed Master <hi>Mede</hi> to give me leave to propose my reasons against this opinion of his. And the truth is, the improbability of it seemed very pregnant unto naturall reason; and diverse arguments that way offered themselves, which seemed to be of very difficult (if at all possible) solution. And over and above it seemed very contradictious to diverse plaine passages of holy Scripture. Master <hi>Mede</hi> very redily enterteyned the motion, and prescribed me a time after which he should be at leasure for me; and in a letter after this, in his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner asked me saying; when come your <hi>Queries?</hi> I accepted his courteous answer, and sent up unto him, first and last, twelve arguments against that opinion of his; and at the first I sent him ten, with an answer devised by my selfe to nine of them; for so I had promised him, namely that I would bethinke my wits of what possibly might bee said in the solution of them, according to the straitnesse of my invention, leaving it to him to approve, or correct, or adde, as he thought good. And whereas I could devise nothing at all in answer to my tenth argument, he sent me a large answer thereunto in three sides of a sheet of Paper;
<pb facs="tcp:93201:4"/>
whereby I well percieved, that my best arguments had been known to him, and examined before I devised them.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> After this, I came acquainted with many discourses upon the same argument, one Printed at <hi>Hanow</hi> in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, De die novissimo, Of the last day;</hi> a few onely were Printed; Two copies (and no more) were brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England;</hi> Master <hi>Mede</hi> bought them both, and sent me one of them to Copy it out, which we did After this, no lesse then seven manu-scripts were sent me from one Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, treating of this and other mysteries. Now here I cannot but confesse my corruption, for I received them by way of a bribe. And indeed I was to doe him a favour (which yet was never done, the death of a speciall Friend preventing it) and I dealt plainly wiih him, and told him I would not sell my favours <hi>Gratis;</hi> I would be well payd for them. And therefore whereas I heard he had strange no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the Revelation, and touching the mysteries of the first resurrection, and Christs Kingdome; I looked to be see'd with the communication of them; with promise to return them safely, after I had suckt the honey out of them, though he had never a whit the lesse for that, such is the nature of spirituall commodities. The good man sent me word, that such bribes would never make me rich: But I returned answer, that they would make me more rich then the enjoying of all the treasures of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and the hill <hi>Amara</hi> to boote: And here I found rich mines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, even all the mysteries belonging to Christs glorious kingdome set downe apart, by way of question, and a solemn resolution thereof, with proofes adjoyned out of holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Since that, I have met with diverse choyse pieces of the same argument; some prosecuting a few parts thereof only,
<pb facs="tcp:93201:4"/>
and others more. But l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t that passe, I returne to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Mede.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many letters passing betweene us, he had occasion some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to touch upon somethings, whereof he had written more at large, either by occasion of Chappell exercises, as he called them, or in more operous and large discourses. I was glad to observe such pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ious birds of Paradise spring; and thereupon insinuated with him further, entreating him to communicate such exercises of his to me. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I found such exemplary favour with him, that he would scarce deny me any thing. Thus I came to be partaker of divers Chappell exercises of his, one whereof was a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble discovery of the common errour, about <hi>Zipporahs</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcising of her childe, as if she did it in discontent and in spleene, throwing the foreskin at <hi>Moses</hi> feete, and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thou art a bloody husband.</hi> But Master <hi>Mede</hi> brings it about to signifie the ordinary forme of expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on used in that Sacrament, which was to this effect, <hi>Thou art my blood, sonne;</hi> and he proves it both out of notable circumstances of the story of <hi>Moses,</hi> and out of the Rabbines, acknowledging that forme, and applying it to that fact of <hi>Zipporah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5</hi> I confesse there hath been some difference between us about ceremonies, as about the lawfulnesse of bowing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Altar, and about the holinesse of Churches, whereof he was as zealous as his Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or rather more; for he held it unlawfull to pull downe Churches, they being places separated for Gods use, and his peculiar: wherein he followed Master <hi>Hookers</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, in the fifth Booke of his <hi>Ecclesiasticall Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</hi> But his Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> did not hold it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
<pb facs="tcp:93201:5"/>
to pull downe Saint <hi>Gregories.</hi> That axiome, <hi>Eadem est ratio loci &amp; temporis,</hi> There, is the same reason of time and place, deceived him, as it deceiveth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for where it doth hold, it holds only in reference to time, and place, naturall. And indeed, time is only naturall; but place may be artificiall, and such is a Temple. That is for the generall notions of them; then as touching the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notions of them, herein is a vast difference. For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of time is very considerable for the advancing of Gods service; as one day in seven, rather then one day in a fortnight, or one day in a moneth; the like cannot be said of the proportion of place. And lastly, the time of Gods worship is defined by God still even under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, namely, the Lords day; not for any place defined by him. And truely the Lord seemed to me by speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to cast us upon a debate about the holinesse of Churches. And it was high time to enquire into it, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition in this kinde of late strangely encreasing. The <hi>Austine</hi> disputations in <hi>Oxford,</hi> which were wont to be kept in Saint <hi>Maries</hi> of late I heare, are excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thence. I wonder the Act, and the exercises thereof, are not translated to some other places, for feare of propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: and the <hi>Terrae-filius,</hi> or <hi>Praevaricator,</hi> must take heed of observing the old forme of exercising their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant wits in facetious discourse, for feare of prophanation, which cannot he salved by ought but Doctor <hi>Cozens</hi> his <hi>Devotions</hi>: Yet were not the same kinds of exercises performed at the same time, and in the same place, in the time of Popery? Whence it followes, that either they were mrre prophane than we now adayes, or we more superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than they.</p>

               <hi>6</hi> But whereas some were too forward in censuring Master <hi>Mede,</hi> as complying with the times in this, it is well knowne, that twenty yeares and more, before that last Sermon of his, whereat divers took great offence, he had maintained his opinion that way, and upon a text very plausible at first sight to justifie it, <hi>Lev. 19.30. Ye shal reverence my Sanctuary,</hi> which text may easily mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry an honest man, and a good schollar, into an opinion of reverence due unto Churches, either civill or religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or of a middle size betwixt them, as some (I heare) have very unhappily set their wits on work to devise; as if man, made after Gods image, were bound to performe reverence to the worke of his own hands. But if we seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously consider the two parts of the text, and duly weigh and compare them together, we shall soone finde, how the meaning of the one, will give light to cleare the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the other: for thus it runs, <hi>Ye shall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my Sanctuary.</hi> Now the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sabbath is clearly no other, than the reverence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God upon the Sabbath: so say I, the reverencing of the Sanctuary is no other, than the reverencing of God in the Sanctuary. In all this I have spoken nothing of the vast difference between the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and our Temple and Chappels; every one where of amongst us, for devotion thereunto, is compared with the Temple of King <hi>Solomon;</hi> whereas there was but one Temple for all the Scribes, and into that Temple none presumed to come but the Priests and into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> no Priests, but the High Priest, and that but once a yeare. The truth is, both the Sanctuary, at the first, and the Temple throughout, were Ceremoniall, both whole and part, and
<pb facs="tcp:93201:6"/>
all the services thereof; and so God made use of it, as of sacrifices to communicate mysteries of godlinesse unto his people. Yet I confesse I have heard some in great state, to professe that the Temple was morall, that is, the building of it a morall duty: But I prove it was not; if it were morall, then all the Church of God for <hi>1600.</hi> yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the floud, and some <hi>1200.</hi> after, till the building of the Temple, failed of the substance of a morall duty; for till then they had none. Againe, if it were a morall duty, then God commanded it from the first, either by word, or by writing it in mans heart; not by word, as appeares by Gods owne profession made to <hi>David, 2 Sam. 7.7. In all the places wherein I have walked, with all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel, spake I one word with any of the tribes of Israel, when I commanded the Judges to feed my people Israel; or said I, Why build ye not me an house of Cedar trees?</hi> If written in mans heart, then all along so many ages, the people of God sinned against their consciences, in not building a Temple unto God.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>7.</hi> But perhaps there is some colour at least, or shew of reason to prove this? and what may that be? is it that of <hi>Solomon</hi> to the King of <hi>Tyrus? 2 Chron. 2.5. The house which I build is great, for great is our God above all gods.</hi> Here seemes to be an intimation, that the house must be answerable to the greatnesse of God: whereto I answer: Then belike it is a morall duty to build an house answerable to Gods greatnesse. But, say I, this was utterly impossible to man in the state of Innocency; therefore this is no morall duty. Such an house had need be as bigge as all the world, from the outermost cope of heaven, to the center of the earth, yet that not answerable;
<pb facs="tcp:93201:6"/>
for as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, verse <hi>6.</hi> The heavens of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens cannot conteyne him; but I do it to burn incense be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. Yet it became <hi>Salomon</hi> in undertaking it to goe through with it answerably to the glory, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God had adorned him: But the patterne of it was delivered to him by <hi>David</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his Father received it by revelation. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it hath been in the power of heathens since that time to build temples exceeding the glory of the Temple built by Salomon: witnesse the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Ephesus</hi>: and that of <hi>Fez</hi> at this day. Surely the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher Potentates are, the more they are enabled to build more glorious Temples: And the greatest States of the world at this day are heathenish, not Christian.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <hi>8</hi> But to the matter in hand, Amongst the cheife pieces which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mede</hi> was pleased to communicate unto me, this of the Apostasie of Latter times, as it was the largest of all the rest, so it gave me greatest content; both for the interpretation he makes of the text in <hi>Paul,</hi> different from all former interpretations of course, which he shews to bee most agreeable to the text; and that it affordes new and more plentifull matter of meditation, both as touching the doctrines of Daemons, opening the meaning thereof, &amp; shewing what they are: and as touching the description of those persons, who were the founders of them; which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a large field of discourse, and that so pertinently and fully exemplified by the Author, as cannot but give great content to the Protestant Reader; the foule superstitions and corruptions in use among the Romanists, being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the life, and that with great variety of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, together with the explication, and illustrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:93201:7"/>
of some very obscure passages in <hi>Daniels</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <hi>9.</hi> I had sometimes a dispute with Doctor <hi>Sibs</hi> about Master <hi>Medes</hi> explication of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> phrase, <hi>the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Daemons,</hi> which he took to be somewhat violent and strayned, But I professed freely, I saw no just reason for such a censure. It is true we commonly conceived the word <hi>Daemoniorum,</hi> to be <hi>Genitivus efficientis,</hi> a geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive case noting the Author or efficient cause. But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Mede</hi> takes it to be <hi>Genitivus materiae,</hi> the genitive case noting the matter, or subject. Now all the learned and judicious know it to be as usuall to take the genitive case in this latter sense, as in the former; and therefore no racking of the text is committed by him in this: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the other side, <hi>Beza</hi> despaires of making <hi>Paul</hi> speake true Greeke, unlesse by <hi>Daemons</hi> we understand false Prophets. But Master <hi>Mede,</hi> by his interpretation is driven to no such shift, but preserves the integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the language, as well consisting with his interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <hi>10.</hi> I have heard others highly commend this discourse of Master <hi>Medes,</hi> as a choice piece, as Master <hi>Steven Marshall</hi> by name, that worthy Preacher. My opinion is, that never was the defection of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the native <hi>genius</hi> thereof more lively, and clearely, and learnedly set forth, as most exactly answereable to that which the Scripture hath foretold, then by Master <hi>Mede</hi> in the opening and expounding of this text, whereupon he insists, and accommodating the manners of the Church of Rome in the latter dayes thereunto; and by Master <hi>Potter</hi> in his learned and accurate discourse of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb facs="tcp:93201:7"/>
of the Beast <hi>666</hi> whereof Master <hi>Medes</hi> judgement was, that it was the greatest discovery that hath been made since the world began. Much adoe I had to draw him to peruse it, and give me his judgement of it: for he feared it would prove but a fancy; but after he had perused it, he sent me word, that he did not think it possible that a matter of such reality and solidity could be wrought out of it.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He words I have read, are a prophesie of a revolt of Christians from the great mystery of Christian Worship, descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the last verse of the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which according to the division of the Ancients, should bee the first of this: for that last verse, together with the first six verses of this and halfe the seventh verse, make the seventh title or main Section of this Epistle, expressed in the Edition of <hi>Robert Stephen</hi>; and so supposed, from the grounds of that division, to belong all to one argument. The words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of my Text, depend upon the last of the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the second part of a discreet proposition; that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the mystery of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is, <hi>God manifested in the Flesh, justified in the Spirit, seene of Angels, and assumed into glory:</hi> Though this mystery was a great one, and at that time preached and beleeved in the world; neverthelesse, the Spirit (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) speaketh expresly, <hi>that in the later times there shall be a revolt or departing from the faith,</hi> though not in all parts of it, yet from a main and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall part thereof, namely, the assumption of this God and Man to the throne of glory, and the incommunicable majesty in Heaven, where he hath a name given him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove every name, and whereof no creature in Heaven or in earth can be capable: which connexion is the reason why the Apostle putteth this <hi>assumption into glory</hi> in the last place of his description, which should else in the true order have followed the words, <hi>justified in the spirit,</hi> and beene before <hi>preached unto the Gentiles,</hi> and <hi>beleeved on in the world.</hi> But it is the method of the Scripture, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93201:10"/>
to translate the proper order, and to mention that in the last place whereunto it is to joine, and from whence it is to inferre the next words that follow after. And unlesse this reason be allowed here, there will hardly be found any other reason of this misplacing. But more of this shall be both spoken and made better to appeare hereafter.</p>
            <p>I come now more neer to my Text; the words whereof I divide into two parts: First, a description of this solemne Apostasie, in the first verse. Secondly, the manner or means whereby it was to come to passe in the following verse, <hi>viz. through the hypocrisie of lyars, who had seared consciences, forbidding to marry, and commanding to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from meats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the description of the Apostasie it selfe, we shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> finde it first generally and indefinitely expressed both in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> they shall apostatize or revolt; and in the next <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> shall attend to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Doctrines, or Doctrines of errour.</p>
            <p>Then particularly, 1 what these erroneous Doctrines <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> should be for the kinde or quality, namely new Doctrines of Daemons, or a new Idolatry. 2 The persons who should thus apostatize, not all but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> some. 3 The time when it should be, in these later times. 4 The proofe or warrant of this prophesie, it is that which the Spirit hath elsewhere long agoe foretold <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the written word verbatim, <hi>totidem verbis</hi> or in expresse words. For the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part (<hi>viz.</hi>) the means; Consider first the manner or method used, <hi>by lying hypocrisie or hypocriticall lying</hi>; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the quality and description of the authors and furtherers thereof, they should be such as <hi>had their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences seared, who forbade marriages and meats.</hi> Where, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I go any further, I must give an account of thus tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slating these later words which I make the second part, because they are commonly translated otherwise, (<hi>viz.</hi>) intransitively, as referring the words of the two last verses to the persons mentioned in the first (<hi>viz.</hi>) those <hi>some</hi> who
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93201:11"/>
should apostatize and give heed to erroneous spirits and doctrines of devils, as they usually translate it: so that the words of the second &amp; third verses should be the expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by particulars of that which was before generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized under erroneous spirits and doctrines of devils, which should consist partly in forbidding lawfull mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and partly in commanding abstinence from meats, thereby abridging Christian liberty. But this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion seemes very unlikely; for first, since S. <hi>Paul</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth here to describe that great apostasie of the Christian visible Church, as is evident by the pointing out of the time <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the later times; who can beleeve that he who aymeth at this, would instance only in the smaller and almost circumstantiall errours, omitting the main &amp; fundamental, which the Scripture elswhere telleth us should be Idolatry or spirituall fornication. Secondly, as for errours about marriages and meates, they were not proper to the last times, but found more or lesse in the Apostles owne times, as may be gathered by some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of their Epistles: why should then our Apostle, here speaking of the Apostasie of the last times, instance only in these things which the first times in some measure were never free from? Lastly, which I take alone to be sufficient, the Syntax of the words will not beare it, to have them so translated; for the persons in the first verse <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> are expressed <hi>in casu recto,</hi> whereas the persons in the verses following <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, are in the genitive: now by what Syntax can these be construed intransitively? how will <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> agree with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp;c. without breach of Grammar, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sampled in our Apostles Epistles? If any say, they may be referred then and agree with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that indeed would be a strange sense, and nothing to their purpose, to say that Devils lie, have seared consciences, and forbid mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages and meates. But to construe it transitively, and to make all these genitive cases to be governed by <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>

I returne now unto the first part of my Text, the description of that solemne Apostasie; where I will consider the five parts or points thereof as I have propounded them, though it be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of the words. And first in the more generall expression of the words, as I called it: I say in these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp; <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) is as much as to say, they shall make an Apostasie; now <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> in Scripture use, when it looks towards a person, signifies a revolt or rebellion; when towards God, a spirituall revolt from God or rebellion against divine Majesty, whether totall, or by Idolatry and serving other gods; for the Seventy, whence the new Testament borrows the use of speech, usually translates by this word the verb <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to rebell, and <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93201:12"/>
meane nought else but Idolatry and serving of other gods, as may appeare <hi>Josuah</hi> 22.19. where the Israelites supposing their brethren the Rubenites and Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites, in building another Altar upon the banks of Jordan, had meant to have forsaken the Lord and served other gods, they said unto them, <gap reason="foreign">

the Scripture useth, but in the better and more indifferent sense, as it was supposed and taken among the Theologists and Philosophers of the Gentiles, and as it is also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken in Scripture, as I shall shew in due time.</p>
            <p>Mean while let us first see what the Gentiles and their Theologists understood by Daemons: which when you have heard, I doubt not but you will confesse the dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and worshipping of Saints and Angels, with other parts of their Idolatry, which doe this, to be as lively an image of the doctrine of Daemons as could possibly be expressed; and such a one, as whereby the apostasie of the later times is as by a character distinguished from the heresies, false doctrines, and corruptions of all other times whatsoever.</p>
            <p>Daemons, in the Gentiles Theology, were <hi>Deastri</hi> or an inferiour sort of deified powers, as a middle betweene the Soveraigne Gods and mortall men: so saith <hi>Plato in Symposio</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now these Soveraigne Celestiall Gods they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed so sublime and pure as might not bee prophaned with approach of earthly things, or with the care or mannaging of mortall mens businesses; and therefore they bring in that middle sort of divine Powers which they call <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> to be as mediatours and agents betweene the Soveraigne Gods and mortall men: thus saith <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Symposium</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> God is not approached by men, but all the commerce and inter-course betweene Gods and men is performed by the mediations of Daemons. Will you see the particulars <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; Daemons are reporters and carriers from men to the Gods, and againe from the Gods to men; of the supplications and prayers of the one, and of the injunctions and rewards of devotion from the other. And <hi>Apuleius</hi> in the place forequoted describes them, <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diae potestates per quas &amp; desideria nostra &amp; merita ad Deos commeant, inter mortales Coelicolasque vectores, hinc precum, inde donorum; qui ultrò citróque portant hinc peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones, inde suspetias seu quidam utrinque interpretes &amp; salutigeri:</hi> For, saith he, <hi>neque enim pro majestate Deûm Coelestium fuerit haec curare,</hi> it beseems not the majesty of the Soveraigne Gods to mannage these things of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.

               <hi>Celsus</hi> as some others did, acknowledges but one Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne God.</p>
            <p>By reason of this office of mediation, <hi>Plutarch</hi> calls the order of Daemons <gap reason="foreign">

This was the Occumenicall Philosophy of the Apostles times, and of the times long before them: <hi>Thales, Pythagoras,</hi> all the Academicks and Stoicks, and not many to be excepted, unlesse the Epicures, taught this Divinity. Hee that had rather read a Father of the Church, let him but turne over the eighth and ninth books of S. <hi>Austin de Civ.

            <p>This Philosophy therefore so generall was that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> admonisheth the Colossians to take heed lest they were spoyled with the vaine deceipt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93201:15"/>
thereof, as being after traditions of men, and rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For some Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans even then under a pretence of humility, of not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching too neerly and too boldly to God, would have brought in the worshiping of Angels in stead of this of Daemons; but S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells them, that as in Christ dwelleth the fulnesse of the Godhead bodily, so that he needed no colleagues of mediation; so also were they compleat in him, and needed therefore no agents besides him. <hi>Let no man therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>beguile you of your reward through humility, and worshipping of Angels, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding into those things which he hath not seene, and not holding the head.</hi>

            <p>And thus have I shewed you, though but briefly in regard of the abundance the argument would afford, the nature and office of these Daemons according to the doctrine of the Gentiles: I come now unto another part of this doctrine, which concernes the originall of Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,<note place="margin">Tertult. <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria parentatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis est species, cap.</hi> 12.</note> whom you shall finde to be the deified soules of men after death; for the canonizing of the soules of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased worthies is not now first devised among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but was an idolatrous trick even from the dayes of the elder world, so that the devill, when he brought in this Apostaticall doctrine amongst Christians, swarved but little from his ancient method of seducing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>Hesiod</hi> speak in the first place, as being of the most knowne the most ancient, he tells us that when those happy men of the first and golden age of the world were departed this life, great <hi>Jupiter</hi> promoted them to bee Daemons, that is, keepers, and protectors, or patrons of earthly mortalls, and overseers of their good and evill works, givers of riches; and this, saith he, is the kingly royalty given them.

            <p>But I goe on, and my next authour shall be <hi>Hermes Trismegistus,</hi> whose antiquity is said to be very neere the time of <hi>Moses</hi>; I will translate you his words out of his <hi>Asclepius</hi> which <hi>Apuleius</hi> made latine. There having named <hi>Aesculapius, Osyris,</hi> and his grandfather <hi>Hermes,</hi> who were (as he saith) worshipped for Daemons in his owne time; he addes further, that the Aegyptians call them (namely the Daemons) <hi>Sancta animalia,</hi> and that amongst them (namely the Aegyptians) <hi>per singulas Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitates coli eorum animas, quorum sunt consecratae virtutes.</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:93201:17"/>
And here note by the way, that some are of opinion, that the Aegyptian <hi>Serapis,</hi> whose Idoll had a bushell upon his head, was <hi>Joseph,</hi> whose soule the Aegyptians had ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized for a Daemon after his death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philo Byblius</hi> the translator of <hi>Sancuniathon</hi> the ancient Phaenician Historian, who lived before the times of <hi>Troy,</hi> and wrote the Acts of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Jewes (saith <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>) very agreeable to the Scripture, and faith, he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his story of <hi>Ierom-baal</hi> a Priest of the God JEVO: <hi>Philo Byblius</hi> (I say) in a preface to his translation of this Author, setteth downe what he had observed, and learned out of the same story, and might serve to help their understanding who should read it: namely, that all the Barbarians, cheifly the Phaenicians and Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, of whom the rest had it, accounted of those for <hi>Dii maximi,</hi> who had found out any thing profitable for the life of man, or had deserved well of any nation, and that they worshipped these as Gods, erecting Statues, Images, and Temples unto them, and more especially they gave the names of their Kings (as to the elements of the world, so also) to these their reputed Gods: for they esteemed the naturall Deities of the Sunne, Moon, and Planets, and those which are in these, to be only and properly Gods: so that they had two sorts of gods, some were Immortals, and others were Mortals.</p>
            <p>Thus saith <hi>Philo Byblius</hi> out of the Phaenician History, from which testimony we may borrow some more light concerning those Baalims in Scripture. <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>But that we may returne againe more close to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand, this order of Daemons, or soule-gods, as I may call them, found place in the Religion of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Romans, who called them <hi>Penates, Lares,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii Dii</hi>; and when once they began to canonize their deceased Emperours, which was from the time of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi> they called them <hi>Divi,</hi> which word before that time was more generall. <hi>Tully</hi> in his second booke <hi>de Legibus,</hi> shall be my witnesse, that his countrey-men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged this distinction of Soveraigne Gods, and Soule-deified powers, for there you shall finde this law; <hi>Divos &amp; eos, qui coelestes semper habiti, colunto; &amp; illos, quos in coelum merita vocaverint.</hi> And againe, <hi>Deorum Manium jura, sancta sunto.

               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:93201:18"/>Yea, so strongly was this doctrine embraced amongst the Gentiles, that some of their later Theologists thought, that even the soules of wicked men and Tyrants had a power after death, and that of these came <hi>mali Daemones,</hi> which hurt men; and yet to these they ordained Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and sacrifices to keepe them from hurting them, as well as to the good Daemons for helping them; but the Ancients gave this honour to the soules of vertuous men onely.</p>
            <p>Thus have you heard the originall of Daemons, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the most ancient, and generall opinion of the Gentiles. But besides these Daemons, whose originall you have heard, I meane besides soule-Daemons, and canonized mortals; their Theologists bring in another kinde of Daemons more high and sublime, which never had beene the soules of men, nor ever were linkt to a mortall body, but were from the beginning, or without beginning, alwayes the same <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>I might further adde to these Oecumenicall doctrines of Daemons, that monstrous one of the Egytians, for which their fellow Gentiles derided them, who worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped living bruit beasts, yea, onyons and garlick, and water it selfe, with divine worship, as supposing some Daemon or other to dwell in them; such were their Cow-god <hi>Apis,</hi> and their Bull-god <hi>Mnevis,</hi> and their Water-god <hi>Nilus,</hi> which it shall be enough onely to have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to make the former compleat, and that from it, and the rest of that kinde of abominations, we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this conclusion once for all, that since the Soveraigne
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93201:21"/>
and Celestiall gods, (as you heard before) might not be approached nor polluted by these earthly and materiall things, but kept alwayes immoveable, without change of place or presence, their heavenly stations; therefore the adoring or worshipping of any visible or materiall thing, for any supposed presence, or other relation of a divine power therewith, is to be accounted amongst the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Daemons.</p>
            <p>And thus have you seene the Theologie of Daemons; first, for their nature and degree, to have beene supposed by the Gentiles an inferiour, and middle sort of divine powers, betweene the soveraigne, and heavenly gods, and mortall men. Secondly, their office to be as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and agents betweene these soveraigne Gods, and men. Thirdly, their originall, to be the deified soules of worthy men after death; and some of an higher degree, which had no beginning, or ever were imprisoned in mortall bodies. Fourthly, the way to worship them, to finde and receive benefits from them, namely, by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate Images and Pillars, wherein to have, and retaine their presence at devotions to be given them. Fifthly, to adore their reliques, and to Temple them.</p>
            <p>Now therefore judge impartially whether Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> prophesie be not fulfilled already amongst Christians, who foretold that the time should come that they should Apostatize and revive againe <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Daemons? whether the deifying and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Saints, and Angels, whether the bowing downe to Images, whether of men, or other things visible, breaden Idols, and Crosses like new Daemon-Pillars, whether the adoring or templing of reliques, whether these make not as lively an image of the Gentiles Theologie of Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons (<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) as possibly could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed? and whether these two words comprehend not the whole pith and marrow of Christian Apostasie, which was to consist in spirituall fornication or idolatry, as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93201:21"/>
appeares by that name and denomination thereof given by Saint <hi>John</hi> in his <hi>Revelation, The whore of Babylon?</hi> Is not she rightly termed the Babylonish whore, which hath revived and replanted the doctrines of Daemons, first founded in the ancient <hi>Babel.</hi> And is not this now ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled which Saint <hi>John</hi> foretels us, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.

            <p>But perhaps I am yet too forward in my application; some things in our way must first be cleared, for howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the resemblance indeed be evident, yet first the Text seemes not to intend or meane it, because the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is in the Scripture never taken in the <hi>better or indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent sense,</hi> howsoever prophane Authours doe so use it, but alwayes in an <hi>evill sense</hi> for the <hi>devill,</hi> or an <hi>evill spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>; now the signification of words in Scripture is to be esteemed and taken only according to the Scriptures use, though other Writers use them otherwise. Secondly, for the charge of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> though much of that wherein we have instanced, may be granted to be justly suspected for such indeed, yet neverthelesse, that whereupon this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication mainly relieth, namely, the <hi>praying to Saints glorified, as Mediators and Agents for us with God,</hi> should not seeme to deserve so foule a name; for suppose it were a needlesse, yea, and fruitlesse Ceremony, yet what reason can be given why this should be more tainted with <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> then is the <hi>like honour</hi> given to <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>holy men</hi> whilst they live on earth, whom to desire to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and pray to God for us, was never accounted so much as an <hi>unlawfull matter?</hi> when these two scruples are answered, I will returne to continue my former ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
            <p>To the first therefore, for the use of the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:93201:22"/>
in Scripture, I say, that because those which the Gentiles tooke for <hi>Daemons,</hi> and for <hi>Deified soules</hi> of their <hi>Worthies,</hi> were indeed no other then <hi>evill spirits,</hi> counterfeiting the soules of men departed, and masking themselves under the names of such supposed Daemons, under that colour to seduce mankinde; therefore the Scripture useth the name Daemons for that they were indeed, and not for what they seemed to be; for no blessed soule or good Angell would admit any honour which did derogate from the honour of the <hi>onely true God,</hi> who made them: neither doe the glorified Saints in heaven, or the blessed Angels, though Apostate Christians now invocate and worship them, accept of this honour, heare their prayers, or conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to their devotions, by any signe or act whatsoever; but whatsoever is made seeme to be done by them, is done by the selfe same wicked spirits, which heretofore were masked under the names of Daemons; and therefore in this regard the one may as well beare the names of Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons as the other, and be as likely to be intended by the use of that word. Secondly, though the Scripture often useth this word in the <hi>worst sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The time which it concernes must needs fall into the last times, for it is the last Trumpet save one.

               </gap> in my text for a <hi>doctrine of worshipping of dead men</hi>; you may read him in the seventy eighth Heresie towards the conclusion, where, upon occasion of some who made a <hi>Goddesse</hi> of the <hi>blessed Virgin,</hi> and offered a cake unto her as the Queene of heaven, he quotes the place of my text concerning them, saying, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which in English sounds thus, <hi>that also of the Apostle is fulfilled of these, some shall apostatize from sound doctrine, giving heed to fables and doctrines of Daemons, for</hi> (saith he) <hi>they shall be worshippers of dead men, as they were worshipped in Israel</hi>; are not these last words for an exposition of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>? But what (will you say) doth he meane by dead men worshipped in Israel? I suppose he meanes their <hi>Baalim,</hi> who (as is already shewed) were nothing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93201:24"/>
else but <hi>Daemons,</hi> or <hi>deified Ghosts of men deceased</hi>: yet he brings in two examples besides; one of the <hi>Sichemites,</hi> in his time, who had a <hi>Goddesse</hi> or <hi>Daemonesse</hi> under the name of <hi>Jephta's daughter</hi>; another of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> who worshipped <hi>Thermutis,</hi> that <hi>daughter</hi> of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> which brought up <hi>Moses.</hi> Some, as <hi>Beza,</hi> would have these words of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> to be a part of the text it selfe in some copy which he used. But how is that likely, when no other Father once mentions any such reading; nay it appeares moreover, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> intended to explaine the words as he quoteth them, as he doth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>. Otherwise wee must say he used a very corrupt copy, or quoted very carelesly. But grant that <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> read so, either this reading was true, and so I have enough; because then the Apostle with his <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Now I come to the second point, to maintaine and prove, that <hi>praying to Saints glorified, as mediators and agents for us with God is</hi> justly charged with <hi>Idolatry</hi>: for this is the hinge whereupon not the application only of my text, but the interpretation thereof chiefly turneth: for this is that which I told you in the beginning, that my text depended upon the <hi>last words</hi> of the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and verse; <hi>received into glory</hi>: which were therefore out of their due order, put in the last place, because my text was immediately to bee inferred upon them; the

            <p>That as <hi>God</hi> is <hi>most one,</hi> and without <hi>all multiplicity,</hi> so must the <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>service</hi> which is given unto him have <hi>no communicability: Esa.</hi> 42.8. <hi>I am the Lord, that is my name, my glory will I not give unto another, nor my prayse to graven Images</hi>; for the <hi>one-most God</hi> must have an <hi>one-most service</hi>; Therefore in that action whereof God is the object, nothing must be an object but God, or in the Scripture phrase thus, in those actions which look towards the <hi>face of God,</hi> nothing may come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene, whose <hi>face</hi> such actions may look upon besides him, whether by way of <hi>subordination</hi> to him, or <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation</hi> of him: for <hi>I am the Lord thy God</hi> (saith hee) <hi>thou shalt have no other Gods before my face.</hi> Secondly, this <hi>face of God</hi> is not only the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>his person,</hi> but also the <hi>place</hi> of <hi>his presence,</hi> where his glory is revealed

            <p>I say not, that a man may not turne his <hi>face</hi> upon the <hi>face of any other thing</hi> when he turnes his <hi>face</hi> towards the <hi>face of God</hi>; for how then should we worship him at all, seeing which way soever we turne us, something will alwayes bee before us? but it is not the <hi>face</hi> of our <hi>bodies,</hi> or their <hi>posture,</hi> but the <hi>face</hi> and <hi>posture</hi> of the <hi>act</hi> wee doe, which must not have the <hi>face</hi> turned upon any thing else, when it is directed at the <hi>face of God</hi>: namely, that action in which God is <hi>faced,</hi> must <hi>face</hi> nothing else but God, where God is the <hi>object,</hi> whether in regard of his <hi>person</hi> when we pray unto him, or of his <hi>throne</hi> of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> when we would approach it or direct our supplica-towards it, there nothing is to have any respect of an object, but God alone. So although when we pray unto God, wee turne the <hi>face</hi> of our bodies towards Heaven, the Sunne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Moon, and Starres, yet doe we not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the host of heaven therefore, because our <hi>action</hi> hath no <hi>relation</hi> to them as to an <hi>object,</hi> but to <hi>God alone</hi>; and howsoever they are betweene God and us in place, yet as an <hi>object</hi> of our <hi>devotion</hi> neither they nor any thing in them come any way betweene us and him: Now for the reason (if you ask it) of this <hi>incommunicablenesse</hi> of all <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>services</hi> directed to <hi>God-ward,</hi> you shall have it, because the <hi>Lord</hi> whose name is <hi>jealous,</hi> is a <hi>jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God, jealous</hi> not only lest he should not be honoured as <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>jealous</hi> lest he should not be honoured as <hi>one God</hi>; for as by honouring him, we acknowledge him <hi>God,</hi> so by the <hi>incommunicablenesse</hi> of honour we acknowledge

him <hi>one God:</hi> For this cause, God being to give us a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, by whom we should have accesse unto his presence, and whom, without his jealousie, wee might interpose in our devotions and supplications unto himselfe, or offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the throne of his majesty and glory in the heavens, provided that admirable <hi>mystery</hi> of <hi>communicating</hi> to the nature of a man borne of a woman, the <hi>hypostaticall union</hi> of the <hi>second Person</hi> of the <hi>Deity</hi>: and <hi>him,</hi> after he had vanquished death, to <hi>exalt,</hi> to <hi>sit at his right hand</hi> of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and power, in the heavens, there in his owne presence and throne, to receive our requests, and to deale as an <hi>agent</hi> betweene us and him.</p>

alone, but <hi>favourable intercession</hi> to pray for us, not so: and therefore for this, wee may without derogation to Christ sollicite either Saints or Angels; I could say, that this ragge is too too narrow and short to cover their nakednesse, who lay hold of it, in whose supplication to Saints and to God too in their names, nothing is more usuall than the expresse mention of their <hi>merits, blood,</hi> and <hi>sufferings,</hi> as motives to God to heare them; but we shall not need this answer; for we have demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that as in the Law, none but the <hi>high Priest alone</hi> was to doe office in the <hi>holiest place</hi>; so Christ Jesus now is the <hi>only agent</hi> for whatsoever is to be done for us in the <hi>holiest Tabernacle</hi> of heaven: besides, wee read that none but the high Priest alone was to offer Incense, or to incense the most holy place when hee entred into it: But Incense is the Prayers of the Saints, sent thither from this outward Temple of the militant Church as the Incense of the Law was fetched from without the vaile: This therefore none in heaven but Christ alone must receive from us, to offer for us; and this is that Angel with the <hi>golden Censer, Revel.</hi> 8. who there offers the Incense of the prayers of the Saints there given him to offer upon the <hi>golden Altar before the Throne,</hi> alluding expresly to the <hi>golden Altar</hi> before the <hi>Testimony.</hi>

jealousie, which could never have brooked the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this glory to any other, which should not have beene the selfe-same with himselfe, was by this condition of his person prevented and secured.</p>
            <p>Neverthelesse and notwithstanding, all this capability of his person, it was the will of his Father in the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the mystery of our redemption, not to conferre it upon him, but as purchased and attained by suffering and undergoing that death which no creature in heaven or in earth was able to undergoe but himselfe, being a suffering of a death, whereby death it selfe was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and vanquished, to the end that none by death save Jesus Christ alone might be ever thought or deemed ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the like glory and sublimity; but that it might appeare for ever to be a peculiar right to him.</p>
            <p>And this, I think, is not only agreeable to the tenour of the Scripture, but expresse Scripture it selfe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. <hi>But we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the Angels by the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour:</hi> for it became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sonnes to glory, to make the captaine of their salvation perfect by sufferings. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. <hi>And being found in fashion of a man, he humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Crosse:</hi> and the ninth verse, <hi>Wherefore God hath also highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, Heb.</hi> 10.12. <hi>But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sinnes, for ever sate down on the right hand of God.

            <p>Lastly, for that particular parcell of this glory of Christ (<hi>viz.</hi>) to be that only name in which we are to ask at the hands of God whatsoever we have to ask, is not this also annexed and ascribed to his triumph over

            <p>How is it then that some extenuate that kinde of Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship, wherein prayers are not made unto them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, but God is prayed unto in their names, and for their mediation sake to grant our requests. Is it not a deniall of Christs prerogative, to ascribe unto any other, for any respect of glory or neernesse to God after death or otherwise, that whereof he alone is infeoffed by his unimitable Death, triumphant Resurrection, and glorious Ascension? certainly that which he holds by incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable title, is it selfe also incommunicable. To conclude therefore with the words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>There is but one God and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus</hi>: as God is one, so the Mediator is one, for it is a God-like royalty, and therefore can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long but to one: There is but one God in heaven, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other gods subordinate unto him; therefore but one Mediator there, without any other mediators besides him: as for the Angels and blessed Saints, they have indeed a light of glory too, but they are but as lesser lights in that heaven of heavens: And therefore as where the sunne shines, the lesser stars of heaven, though stars, give not their light to us: so where this glorious Sunne Christ Jesus continually shineth, by his presence, sitting at the right hand of God; there the glory of the Saints

            <p>The way being now cleared, I may (I hope) now safely resume my application which I have already given some taste of, that the doctrine of Daemons comprehends in most expresse manner the whole <hi>idolatry of the mystery of iniquity, the deifying, and invocating of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the bowing downe to Images, the worshipping of Crosses as new idol-columnes, the adoring and templing of reliques, the worshipping of any other visible thing upon supposall of any Divinity therein</hi>: what coppy was ever so like the sample, as all this to the doctrine of Daemons? and for the Idolatry of the Eucharist or bread-worship, though it may be reduced to Image-worship, as being the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a signe or symbole; yet let it bee considered whether for the equality thereof it may not be taken ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for an <hi>idolatry of reliques,</hi> the body and blood of Christ in the Sacrament being the <hi>mysticall reliques</hi> which he left us as monuments of his death till he come: which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it bee I must confesse it hath a straine above the abomination of the Gentiles, who though they supposed some presence of their Daemons in their Images and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, yet were they never so blockish, as to think their Images and reliques to be transubstantiated into Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: But to come to the maine againe, I will confesse for my selfe that I cannot think of this <hi>Daemon-resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance</hi> without admiration, nor doe I beleeve that you will heare without some astonishment, that which I am now to adde farther: That the advancers of Saint-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the beginning did not only see it, but even gloried
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93201:29"/>
               <hi>(sed gloriatione non bona)</hi> that they had a thing in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian practice so like the doctrines of Daemons: we heard before, that <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Repub.</hi> would have the soules of such as died valiantly in the battell, to be accounted for Daemons after death, and their Sepulchers and Coffins to bee adored and served as the Sepulchers of Daemons. <hi>Eusebius lib.</hi> 13. <hi>Praepar.

            <p>Even as whores are seldome without other great faults, which yet are no part of whoredome: so hath the spirituall whore many other heresies, but her whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is only Idolatry and the doctrine of Daemons.</p>
            <p>Neither is heresie of it selfe, no though damnable he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, a character whereby the great Apostasie can bee knowne from other sects and blasphemies.</p>
            <p>Fowle heresies were in the first ages of the Church, yet Antichrist and his time were neither of them yet, come; when his time approached neerer, the Arrians, Macedonians, Nestorians, Eutychians, were abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heretiques.</p>

Which that I may not seem to ground only upon the exposition of my text, which whatsoever the probability thereof be, may yet be thought alone too weak to support the weight of so maine a conclusion: I desire you to take these arguments for a full confirmaiion thereof; some of them have already beene intimated, but now all are mustered up together.</p>
            <p>First, that <hi>Babylon</hi> is entitled in the Revelation of S. <hi>John,</hi> not the <hi>Lyar of Babylon,</hi> not the <hi>Tyrant of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> not the <hi>Heretique of Babylon,</hi> nor the <hi>Murdresse of Babylon,</hi> but the <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> yea that <hi>Great Whore</hi> and the <hi>Mother of fornications, and abominations of the earth.</hi> Doth not God (think we) give the name as he accounts the nature? or is there any one will deny that this <hi>Babylon</hi> is that mystery of iniquity which our Apostle so calleth, as being in opposition to the great <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>mystery of true worship and Religion?</hi> if any should <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>mystery Babylon</hi> in her forehead, would help to reclaim him: And what <hi>Whore</hi> is that with whom <hi>the Kings and Nations and Kingdomes of the earth commit fornication<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> can it be any other but a <hi>spirituall Whore?</hi> Without question therefore S. <hi>John</hi> meanes no other thing here than what he foretold in the eleventh chapter, That the <hi>Second and outmost court of the Temple</hi> (which is the second state of the Christian Church) <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the holy City, should bee trodden downe, and overtrampled by the Gentiles forty two moneths,</hi> that is, overwhelmed with the Idolaty of the Gentiles, which is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as long as power shall bee given to the Beast to make warre with the Saints, as long as the witnesses must weare sackcloth, and the woman which escaped the fury of the Ethnicall Dragon, be fed in the wildernesse.</p>
            <p>Secondly, S. <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, that the great Apostasie
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93201:31"/>
should enter by strong delusions, by signes and lying wonders; consider then what corruptions of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith were thus ushered in to begin with the begining and first corruption of that kinde; Invocation of Saints; with the adoration of their shrines; and reliques; how were these advanced in the Church, was it not by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous cures of the sick, healing of the lame, restoring of the blinde, yea raising of the dead (as seemed) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the only touch and aire, sometimes of the shrines and reliques of soules deceased? was it not still confirmed by strange apparitions, and other meanes wonderfull to heare? for discovery of bones and reliques unknowne and forgotten, yea of men whose names they never heard of before. And which I shall shew better hereafter: no such experience for thirty yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther observed in the Church, untill the totall and fixed time began to enter. The worshipping of Images, the second, for time, of the Churches fornications: was not this also allowed and at length fully ratified by like signes and miracles, shewed upon those who approached them in their devotions? Read the legend, and see what store there is of strong delusions and lying wonders. That which for time came in last, but deserves a place among the foremost, I meane the Idolatry of the Masse, and adoration of the breaden god; search and see if it be not also thus attented!</p>
            <p>If all this be true, then would I know what doctrine of theirs besides was installed with these solemnities; there is but one only left for exception, and it is Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; but what if all the delusions of Purgatory, with all the apparitions of Purgatorian Ghosts, were but an indirect device of Satan ayming partly to advance the Masse into an Idoll by the miraculous efficacy (forsooth as the Ghosts report) of the oblation thereof for them; partly to install the Sonne of perdition (a Daemon I yet speak not of, and yet a Daemon) <hi>to sit as God in the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93201:32"/>
Temple and Throne of Christ, with the keyes of</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Apocal. 1.13.</note> 
               <hi>Hades and death,</hi> to deliver them? what stronger presumption can there be of this than the event; and that the errour of Purgatory had so long beene working before the Devill seemed to know how to make this use of it, which at length he spied out and plied lustily with signes and wonders. If all this be true, then it followes still that it is spirituall fornication which the Holy Ghost in Scripture intendeth, and the event hath marked out for the soule of Antichristian abomination and impiety; But of the matter of miracles and lying wonders more in the second part of my text, which is the proper place thereof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and lastly, the great Apostasie is a thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>the latter times</hi>; which I will shew (when I come at it) to be the last times of the fourth kingdome of <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 7.25. <hi>&amp; alibi</hi>; but amongst all other corruptions, only the spirituall fornication of the Church and spouse of Christ will bee found pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to these times.</p>
            <p>But you will say, if Idolatry and Spirituall fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bee the matter, why should not this rather be laid upon Painims, and Turks, and Saracens, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not Christ, rather than upon Christians who doe?</p>
            <p>I answer, S. <hi>John</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> prophesied of things to come, not of that which was in being when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied. But Ethnicall and Painim Idolatry at that time overwhelmed the whole earth, yea and persecuted and made warre with the Saints, and no time hath yet beene when this Idolatry was not to be found. It must needs be then some other whoredome (for whoredome it was to be) which was prophesied of to come.</p>

            <p>Why was thy God then so unkinde and cruell unto thee, to call thee <hi>Whore,</hi> and <hi>Prostitute Whore,</hi> so often?

of God himselfe against Israel, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Heare the word that the Lord hath spoken against you, O chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel, saying, You onely have I known of all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the earth, therefore will I punish you for all your iniquities.</hi> And the same will be the judgement of the <hi>Christian Jezabel</hi> (howsoever Painims and Infidels speed) when <hi>Great Babylon shall come in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fiercenesse of his wrath.</hi> This I would have well considered and weighed by those whom the Mahumetan blasphemy hath so dazeled, that they can hardly beleeve that so hated and execrable a name of <hi>Babylon</hi> should belong unto any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unlesse there be yet to come some other like barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tyrant and Seducer after them: the cause of which errour is, That men have fancied another manner of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist</hi> than the Holy Ghost meant of, and placed their eyes farre wide of the ground of Gods hatred, and of the nature of that mysterie of abomination. But Israels Apostasie, Gods Iealousie, and their unparalled punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therefore, such as no Nation in the world, how Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous soever, endured besides themselves, are in this case the onely Polestarre to direct us.</p>
            <p>But even this mistake, which is and hath beene of the <hi>mystery of iniquity,</hi> is it selfe a kinde of <hi>mystery,</hi> or not without one; for <hi>Antichrist</hi> is a <hi>Counter-Christ,</hi> and therefore his <hi>comming</hi> to be a <hi>counter-resemblance</hi> of the <hi>comming of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Christ was both to come, and accordingly looked for <hi>in the last times</hi> (that is) in the time of the fourth king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Daniel</hi>; so Antichrist and his mystery of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety was to be, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the <hi>latter times of these last times,</hi> that is (as I shall better shew hereafter) in the last times, or last Scene (as I may so speake) of the fourth kingdome of <hi>Daniel.</hi> When <hi>Christ</hi> came the <hi>Scepter</hi> was to depart from Judah, and that <hi>Commonwealth</hi> to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved: so when <hi>Antichrist</hi> was to come, the <hi>Roman
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93201:35"/>
Empire</hi> was to fall, and <hi>he that hindered was to be taken out of the way,</hi> 2 Thes. 2.8. The Jewes expected Christ to come when he did come, and yet knew him not when he was come, because they had fancied the manner and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his comming like some temporall Monarch, with armed power to subdue the earth before him: So the Christians, Gods second Israel, looked the comming of Antichrist should be at that time when he came indeed, and yet they knew him not when he was come, because they had fancied his comming as of some barbarous Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, who should with armed power not onely persecute and destroy the Church of Christ, but almost the world, that is, they looked for such an Antichrist as the Jewes looked for a Christ.</p>
            <p>Wherefore as Christ came unto his owne, and his own received him not; so Antichrist came upon those who were not his owne, and yet they eschewed him not: but yet as some Jewes, though few, knew Christ when he came, and received him; so did some Christians, though but few, keep themselves from the pollution of Antichrist. Lastly, as the Jewes ere long shall acknowledge, and run unto him, whom they pierced as not knowing him; so hath the Christian Church, for a great part, discovered that Son of perdition, whom a long time they had igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly worshipped, because they knew him not. <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wisedome and knowledge of God, how unsearchable are his judgements, and his wayes past finding out!</hi> But for our part, seeing our case is so like unto that of the Jewes, let their lamentable and wofull errour, in mistaking their Messiah by wrongly fancying him, be a warning and a caveat unto us, that we likewise upon like conceits and prejudice mistake and misdeeme not the <hi>Man of sinne.</hi>

For the <hi>great defection</hi> so much prophesied of, was to be a <hi>solemne</hi> and <hi>generall</hi> one; such a one, as wherein the <hi>chiefest</hi> of the Churches, <hi>honoured</hi> as <hi>a mother in Israel,</hi> should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Babylonish whore, a mother of harlots, and of the abominations of the earth, Rev.</hi> 17. such a one as whereby the <hi>outmost court of the Temple of God</hi> should not onely be prophaned, but <hi>trodden downe by Gentilisme, Rev.</hi> 11. such a one as the <hi>world</hi> is said <hi>to wonder after the beast, and to worship him</hi>; and such a one as should not onely make <hi>warre with the Saints, but overcome them, Rev.</hi> 13.

               <p>For who knowes not, that in Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> Saint <hi>Johns,</hi> and the Apostles owne times, were many Heresies and Hereticks growne up as weeds in the wheat field of Christ? but as yet the wheat overtopped them, and the visible body of the Church disclaimed them. If these had beene the worst the Church should look for, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles should seeme to prophesie of things present, and not, as they doe, of things to come, yea and more than
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93201:36"/>
this, they should foretell of a thing as proper and peculiar to the last times, which was no novelty in their owne times.</p>
               <p>We must take notice therefore that the Apostasie and corruption of faith so much prophesied of, was another manner of one, than that which was so frequent in those first times; such a kind of one as should not be disclaimed by the visible body of the Church, but should surprise, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> affords us, is, <hi>That the true Church of Christ was never wholly extinguished, nor the light of his Gospell ever quite put out, no, not in the greatest darknesse that ever was to overwhelme it.</hi> By the true Church of Christ I understand that holy society and company of beleevers, which as they accord and are joyned together in one common faith of all divine truths needfull to salvation, so are they also free from the fellowship of such erroneous abominations and mortall errours as destroy and overturne it. This is that society, whereof by the grace of Almighty God, we glory to be the members; this that society, which in the primitive times grew and flourished: this that society, which (when the times foretold of the Churches eclipse came, and the great Apostasie had over-spread the face thereof) was indeed much impaired, indangered, and obscured, but
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93201:37"/>
never was totally extinguished, but continued even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the jurisdiction of the <hi>man of sinne,</hi> yea in <hi>Babylon</hi> it selfe where he had this throne; for doth not Christ at length say? <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Come out of her my people</hi>: how could they come out thence unlesse they had beene there? or how should Antichrist <hi>sit in the Temple of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.9. unlesse <hi>Gods Temple</hi> were even there where Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ sate? as a few living embers in a heape of dying ashes: as a little wheat in a field overgrowne with weeds: as the lights of the heaven in a firmament over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast with clouds: as a little pure gold in a great masse of drosse and mixed metal: such was the faithfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Christ in the Apostate body of Christendome, the <note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 14 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Virgin Church</hi> in the midst of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But will our adversaries say, this is not sufficient to make you the true Church of Christ, because some of you have alwayes beene; but you must prove also that you have alwayes visibly beene; for the true Catholick Church must not only never have beene interrupted or extinguished, but it must have beene a society visibly knowne unto the world, and not as embers in the ashes, but as a burning and shining flame.</p>
               <p>But this objection deserves no answering: because our adversaries, howsoever they would dissemble it, doe but play upon the present advantage which they think their owne Church hath in this point above ours: otherwise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they forget the contention they have with us, and are in a calmer mood, they can bee pleased to deliver other doctrine, which (if they would be ingenuous so much as to remember it) we needed not such a stirre about the point of the Churches visibility; for the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene them and us hereabout, is not so great as they would make it seeme: They themselves and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also teach, that when Antichrist commeth, the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Church shall be eclipsed: nay, they affirme more than we usually in that case require; for then they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93201:38"/>
say the use of the Sacraments shall cease, no Eucharist, no Masse, no publick Assemblies, yea all Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction shall be extinguished; but here lies all the difference, they hold the glorious visibility of the true Church to have <hi>continued</hi> from the beginning unto this present, and the <hi>overshadowing</hi> of the <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>eclipse</hi> of the <hi>glory</hi> thereof under <hi>Antichrist</hi> to be <hi>yet to come</hi>; we on the contrary maintaine, the <hi>clouding</hi> of the Churches <hi>visibility</hi> under the <hi>man of sinne</hi> to have <hi>beene already,</hi> and <hi>some part</hi> of the <hi>visible splendor</hi> thereof to be <hi>yet to come</hi>: both agreeing in this, that in the <hi>fatall Apostasie</hi> the Churches <hi>visibility</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> should cease; but we say that the time hath <hi>been already,</hi> they say that it is <hi>yet to come</hi>; we say, that <hi>time</hi> of <hi>darknesse</hi> was to continue <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages,</hi> they say, when it comes it shall <hi>last but three single yeares, and a halfe.</hi> Seeing therefore the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie lies in the point of time, whether the Churches fatall Apostasie be already past or yet to come, it would be much the shorter and quicker course both for them and us to decide this controversie, to examine the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and quality of both religions by the holy Scripture, where we have also, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> speakes, <hi>a most sure word of prophesie, whereunto wee shall doe well if wee take heed, as to a light shining in a dark place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now though this answer be sufficient enough for the objection of our Adversaries, yet for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and clearer insight into the matter questioned, we will further consider whether and in what manner or measure our Church may be said to have been visible, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the prevailing Apostasie, and in what respects again it was not visible, and in both agreeable unto the state of the true Church under the frequent Apostasies of the Church of Israel.</p>
               <p>First therefore we must know that by a <hi>visible Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an society</hi> in this question is meant a <hi>society</hi> or <hi>company</hi> of <hi>Christian</hi> beleevers joyned together in one externall
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93201:38"/>
fellowship, and communion of the same publike profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and rule of faith, use of Sacraments, and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall jurisdiction; for these make the outward forme, and as it were the shape of a Church, whereby this socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is discernable from other societies of men: so that a society by this outside severed and distinguished from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther societies, is a society visible and conspicuous to other societies of men. The question therefore is, whether that holy society of beleevers before mentioned, who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded together in one common faith with us of all divine truths needfull to salvation, and kept themselves free from such enormious abominations and mortall errours which we now disclaime, as utterly annihilating that common faith; whether such a society as this has beene in all ages, joyned and distinguished by such a common outside from other companies, either of men in generall, or Christians in speciall? or in shorter and perhaps plainer termes thus: whether the society of men of our Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an beleefe hath beene in all ages for the outside a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct ecclesiasticall corporation from other societies of men?</p>
               <p>My answer is, That for the first ages it was so not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus visible, but easily discernable from all other socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men whatsoever; but afterward when the great Apostasie we spake of surprized and deformed the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Spouse of Christ, then was not that virgin compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Saints, our Mother, a distinct externall society from the rest of Christendome, but a part, yea and the only found part of that externall and visible body where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of our adversaries boast their predecessors to have beene members: for howsoever this our Virgin-mother, for the internall and invisible communion of her sincere and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained faith, we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e a distinct and severed company from the rest with whom she lived, yet, for the common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Christian faith still acknowledged in that corrupt body of Christendome, she retained communion
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93201:39"/>
with them; and for the most part of that time of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse continued an externall part of the same visible body with the rest in grosse call'd Christians, as being begotten by the same Sacrament of Baptisme (as the Israelites in like case of Circumcision) taught in some part by the same word, and Pastours still continued amongst them, and submitting to the same jurisdiction and government, so farre as these or any of these had yet some soundnesse remaining in them; but for the rest which was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with her sincere and unstained faith, and which annihilated in those it surprised, even those common grounds of Christianity otherwise outwardly professed, she with her children either wisely avoided all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with it, or if they could not, then patiently suffered for their conscience sake under the hands of Tyrants, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Christians, untill that Tyranny growing insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that mortall contagion unavoidable, it pleased God, lest we might have beene as <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> to begin to call us thence at the time appointed, unto a greater liberty, as we see this day. As therefore when a little gold is mixed with a great quantity of base and counterfeit metall, so that of both is made but one masse or lump; each metall we know still retaines its nature diverse from the other, and yet outwardly and visibly is not to be discerned the one from the other, but both are seene together as they are outwardly one, but cannot be distinguished by the eye, as they are diverse and severall; the gold is visible as it is one masse, and under the same outside and figure with the rest, yet it is truly invisible as it is diverse from the rest: But when the Refiner comes and severs them, then will each metall appeare in his own colours, and put on his own outside, and so become visible apart from the rest. Such is the case here, and such was the state and condition of the Church in the prevailing and great Apostasie; the purer metall of the Christians vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible body outwardly was not discernable from the base
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93201:39"/>
and counterfeit, while one outside covered them, and so much the rather, because the Apostate part in a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion exceeding the sound, made it imperceptible; but when the time of refining came, then was our Church not first founded in the true faith (God forbid) but a part of the Christian body newly refined from such corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as time had gathered, even as <hi>gold refined</hi> begins no then first to be gold, though it begin but then to be <hi>refined gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whatsoever we have hitherto spoken of the state of the true beleevers under the Apostasie of Antichrist, is the same which befell the true Israelites in the Apostasie of Israel.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93201:40"/>
outward profession still to acknowledge him, and to be cald Christians, though by their Idolatry and spirituall whoredomes they <hi>denied the Lord that bought them (i. e.)</hi> whom they profest to be their <hi>Redeemer</hi>; just as Israel for the like is said to have forsaken the Lord their God that brought them out of the Land of Egypt: here therefore the case of both is alike, let us also see the rest. You ask, where was the true Church we speake of in Antichrists time? I ask likewise, where was the company of true worshippers in <hi>Ahabs</hi> time? was it not so covered and scattered under the Apostate Israelites, that <hi>Elias</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, who was one of it, could scarce finde it? <hi>I am very jealous</hi> (saith he) <hi>for the Lord God of hoasts, because the children of Israel have forsaken thy Covenant, throwne downe thy Altars, and slaine thy Prophets with the sword, and I even I alone am left, and they seeke my life to take it away,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.14. yet the Lord tells him verse 18. <hi>I have yet left me</hi> 7000. <hi>in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him:</hi> yet I trow these 7000. were not outwardly severed from the rest of Israel, but remained still exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall members of the same visible body with them. But you will except, that the true and unstained Church in Judah was still visible and apparent: I aske you then, where was the company of the true worshippers of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah in <hi>Manasses</hi> time, the worst time of all others? when the ten Tribes were carried captive, and but Judah and Benjamin only left, and they, as far as the eye of man can see, wholly and generally fallen from the Lord their God to all maner of Idols and Idolatries,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 33.</note> like unto the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations of the heathen, whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel, when in the Temple it selfe, the only place where the true God was to be worshipped legally, were Idolatrous Altars erected, even in the house whereof the Lord had said, <hi>In this house and in Jerusalem will I put my name for ever</hi>; even in this house, this holy
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93201:40"/>
house, were Idols and graven Images erected, and in both Courts Altars to <hi>Baalim,</hi> the Sunne, the Moone, and the whole hoast of heaven, the like whereof never had beene untill that time. Besides also, who is able to name the man almost 50 yeeres together that remained a faithfull servant and true worshipper of the living God in the midst of this hideous profanation? Nor is it easie to be conceived how it was possible all that time to offer any legall sacrifice without Idolatry, when Gods owne Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and house was made a den of Idols, nay his Altar, the onely Altar of Israel destroyed, to make roome for Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars erected to Idols, as may be gathered 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.15, 16. where was the true Church of Israel now? or had the Lord no Church at all? yes certainely, he had a Church and a company which defiled not their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, a company (I say) but not visibly distinguished from the rest of their nation, but hidden as it were in the midst of that Apostate body, and yet knowne together with the rest to be Israelites and people of Jehovah; but knowne to God only and themselves to be true Israelites and faithfull servants to Jehovah their God. And that such a company there was, and a strong party too, though not seene, appeared presently upon the death of <hi>Manasses</hi> and his wicked son, when <hi>Josiah</hi> began to reign at eight yeares of age, for they then prevailed even in the Court it selfe, and so brought up the King, that even yet while he was young, in the eighth yeare of his reigne, he began to seek after the Lord God of <hi>David</hi> his father, and in the twelfth yeare to make a publick and powerfull reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, such as the like was never done before him. Could all this have been done so soon, and by a King so young in yeares, and to carry all before it like a torrent, unlesse there had beene a strong party, which now having a King for them, began quickly to shew themselves, and to sway the state, though before they were hardly to be seene.</p>

For the first, we will make no question but these are the selfe same times whereof Saint <hi>John</hi> speakes, telling us the Church should be in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse a <hi>Time, Times, and halfe a Time</hi>; the same with those <hi>two and forty moneths</hi> wherein <hi>Johns restored beast</hi> should domineere, and play the selfe-same reax which <hi>Daniels hornish tyrant</hi> doth; the same time with those two and forty moneths during which the <hi>Church is trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den downe of the Gentiles</hi>: lastly, the same times with 1260. <hi>dayes,</hi> during which the <hi>witnesses of Christ prophesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in sackcloth, for a time, times, and halfe a time</hi>; or a yeare, two yeares, and halfe, are 42 moneths, and 42 moneths make 1260. dayes: if therefore we can finde
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93201:45"/>
the beginning and continuance of any of these, we have found the beginning and continuance of them all. For the <hi>duration</hi> and <hi>length</hi> of them, they must imply some <hi>definitive times,</hi> because the Scripture followes that use of speech, and useth no number indefinitely, but those which the use of speech had made such, as 1.10.1000. but mixt and compound numbers, as these are, 3 ½.42.1260. are neither in the Hebrew, nor I think in any other language used indefinitely.</p>
               <p>Our adversaries would have them literally understood for <hi>three single yeers and a half,</hi> as though it were an <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and not a <hi>Prophesie</hi>: but besides the use of prophesie to reckon dayes for yeers, I think it would trouble any man to conceive how so many things as should be performed in this time, should be done in three single yeeres and a halfe. 1 Ten kingdomes founded at the same time with the Beast. 2 Peoples, and multitudes of nations and tongues to serve and obey him. 3 To make warre with the Saints and overcome them. 4 To cause all that dwell upon the earth to worship him. 5 Babylon to ride the Beast so long, that all nations shall drinke of the wine of her fornication, the Kings of the earth commit fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with her, yea the Merchants and all those that had ships in the sea, to grow rich by trading with her. Me thinks all this should ask much more than three yeeres works, or foure either. To which I adde moreover, that that state of government, soveraignty or seigniory, or what you will, of the Beast, under which the whore should ride him, followeth immediately upon a former, which in comparison is said to last but a <hi>short space, Rev.</hi> 17.20. But if the Antichristian state should continue but <hi>three yeers and a half</hi> literally taken, how short must the time of that foregoing King or soveraignty be which should occasion the Holy Ghost to insert so singular a note of the difference thereof from that which followed, that it should <hi>continue but a short space:</hi> doth not this imply, that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93201:45"/>
the next state wherin the whore should ride the beast, was to continue a long space: therefore 3 yeers &amp; a half histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally taken, cannot be the time of the Churches Apostasie, and the Antichristian soveraignty of <hi>Rome:</hi> and if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken historically, it must be taken <hi>prophetically,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day for a yeer, &amp; so 1260 dayes counted so many yeers, shewes the extent of those <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Now for the second thing proposed, the <hi>beginning</hi> of these <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; Saint <hi>John</hi> tells us in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that his blasphemous Beast of 42 moneths continuance should succeed upon the mortall wound of the Caesarian or Imperiall soveraignty of <hi>Rome:</hi> And <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Beast which carries the great Whore upon his back, should have a plurality of Kings start up at the same time with him, who should agree to submit their power and kingdome unto this whore-ridden Beast; and would not he also in the same chapter have us take notice, that the Antichristian state of the Beast which was to come, should be next to that of the <hi>Caesars</hi> which then reigned? for the Angell there tels him, that that state of the beast, wherein the Whore should ride him, which was then not in being, but should afterward ascend out of the bottomlesse pit, and goe into perdition; that this state or head of the beast should succeed so imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the sixth state or head, <hi>viz.</hi> the Caesarian then reigning, that howsoever in some respects it might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an eighth, yet should in very deed be but the seventh; for how could it be otherwise, when the Beast in the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath but seven heads and no more? <hi>vide ver.</hi> 8.10.11.

Now it is most true that the Popes Patriarchdome in the West holds just that scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the ancient Territory of the Roman Empire, which a man may judge by his eyes, or compasses in a Mapp: and yet I preferre the other exposition before it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:93201:47"/>To come up to an issue: It is apparent by all that hath bin said, that these <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, with that wicked soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which should domineer in them, was to take beginning from the wound, the fall, the ruine, the rending in pieces, or rooting up of the Imperial soveraignty of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> when that City should cease to be the Lap of that sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty which the <hi>Casars</hi> once held over the Nations; and many new upstart Kings should appeare in the place and Territory of that once one Empire; then should the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie be seen, and the <hi>latter times</hi> with that wicked one make their entrance. Now in what age this fell out I think no man can be ignorant, who hath but a little skill in Historie.</p>
               <p>But you will say, The Imperiall soveraignty of old <hi>Rome</hi> fell not all at once, but had divers steps and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ruine, so that the doubt will be notwithstanding, from which of these steps of the fall thereof these <hi>latter times</hi> must be reckoned?</p>
               <p>I answer, From any of them. For as the Imperiall so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty fell by degrees, so the Apostasie under the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost soveraignty grew up also by degrees; and for every degree which the ruinous Empire decayed, was the rising sonne of perdition a degree advanced. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all the maine and evident degrees of the Empires ruine fell in the compasse of an age, and the knowledge and observation of that age onely, within which the times of this fall were comprehended, was sufficient both to warn them which then lived, that that which was to come, was then a comming, and to informe us who now live, that it is already come.</p>
               <p>Now which were these maine and evident degrees of the Empires falling, and at what time, I will tell you as soon as I have removed an usuall mistake in this businesse, which is to reckon the time of the Empires ruine, and so likewise the Apostasie attending, onely from the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93201:47"/>
and not agreeable to the course wee otherwise use in the like: for as when we reckon the age of a man, we reckon not from the time since he came to mans estate, but from his birth; so should we doe here for the times of the man of sinne: I say not, we should begin to count his age from his conception, for that we use not in other things; but from the time he was first <hi>editus in lucem,</hi> when he first began to appeare in the world: and so likewise the fall of the Empire and the Apostasie, not from the time they were consummate, but from the time they first evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeared; as therefore I hold their opinion the best and most agreeable to truth, who begin the 70 yeeres of the Jewish captivity in Babylon, not from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation thereof under <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> when the City and Temple were utterly rased, for that is impossible, there being not <note n="*" place="margin">As infall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Three of these Kings, saith <hi>Daniel,</hi> should the Antichristian horne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse and displant, to advance himselfe, which three are those whose dominions extended into <hi>Italy,</hi> and so stood in his light.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That of the Greekes, whose Emperour, <hi>Leo Isaurus,</hi> for the quarrell of Images, he excommunicated, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted his subjects of <hi>Italy</hi> from their allegiance,</p>
               <p n="2">2 That of the <hi>Longobards,</hi> successours of the <hi>Ostro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goths,</hi> whose kingdome he caused, by the aid of the <hi>Franks,</hi> to be wholly ruinated, thereby to get the Exar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate of <hi>Ravenna</hi> (which since their revolt from the <hi>Greekes</hi> they were seized on) for a Patrimony to Saint <hi>Peter.</hi>

Messias be slaine for sin, and at the end of the whole 70 their City and Temple againe destroyed, and their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth utterly dissolved. To these weeks therefore, whose computation so especially concernes the Jewes, is reference made in those Epistles which are written to the Christian Churches of that Nation, whether being in <hi>Iewry,</hi> or abroad dispersed, in <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, Asia, Bythinia.</hi> Such is S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> both Saint <hi>Peters</hi> to the Dispersion, the Epistle of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> to the twelve Tribes, and likewise the first Epistle of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> which though the salutation expresseth not as in the former, yet may appeare both because <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> were all three Apostles of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, and from that passage <hi>cap.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Christ Iesus is the propitiation for our sinnes, and not for ours onely, but for the sinnes of the whole world</hi>; that is, not for the sins of us onely who are Jewes, but for the sinnes of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles also. And doth not the name of generall or catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Epistle given unto this, as well as those of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> imply thus much? for it cannot be thus called, as written to all Christians indefinitely, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, since the contrary plainly appeares in the former; but because this as well as the rest was written to those of the circumcision, who were not a people confined to any one City or Region, but dispersed through every Nation, as we reade in the <hi>Acts, cap.</hi> 2.5. &amp;c. that at the Feast of Pentecost, when the Holy Ghost came downe upon the Apostles, <hi>there were sojourning at Ierusalem Iewes, devout men, out of every nation under heaven; Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and the dwellers of Mesopotamia, Iudaea, and Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia, and strangers of Rome, Jewes and Proselites</hi> (Jewes by race, and Jewes by religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) &amp;c. for we must not mistake those there numbred to be Gentiles, but Israelites; both of the ten Tribes capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by <hi>Shalmaneser,</hi> and the other two; some of whom never returned from <hi>Babylon,</hi> but lived still in <hi>Mesopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi>:

but of these who returned, great multitudes were dispersed afterwards in <hi>Egypt, Lybia,</hi> and many other Provinces before the time of our Saviours appearing in the flesh. So that the Apostles of the Circumcision had their Province for largenesse not much inferiour to that of the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>But I come to note the places I spake of: and first out of the fore-named Epistle of Saint <hi>John,</hi> where from that prediction of our Saviour in the Gospel, that the arising of the false Prophets should be one of the neare signes of the nigh approaching end of the Jewish state: the Apostle thus referres to it <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>Little children this is the <gap reason="foreign">

And the comming of such as these, our Saviour in Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> Gospel, a Gospel for the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, makes one of the last signes ushering the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Jerusalem; and if the harmony of this prophecy in the three Evangelists be well considered, there was no more to come but the compassing of Jerusalem with

                  </gap>cause the desolation of the Jewish state and Temple would be a great confirmation to Christian faith, therefore the beleeving Jewes, whom nothing could so much stagger as the standing glory of that Temple and Religion, are encouraged by the neerenesse of that time of expectation, when so great a confirmation of their faith of their Messias already come should appeare. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.23.25. <hi>Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering, and so much the more as you see the day approaching</hi>; namely, that day when you shall be sufficiently confirmed: so I take the 35. and 37. verses of the same Chapter, <hi>Cast not away your confidence which hath great recompence of reward, for ye have need of patience. For yet a little while, he that shall come, will come, and will not tarry.</hi> What (he) is this, but even he of whom <hi>Daniel</hi> sayes, <hi>The people of the Prince that shall come, shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the City and the Sanctuary, Dan.</hi> 9.26. For even as the destruction of Papall <hi>Rome</hi> would be a great confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the reformed Christian, who hath forsaken the Communion of that Religion, the continuance and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed stability of the glory thereof being that wherewith their Proctors endeavour most to shake and stager us: so was the destruction of the Jewish state and Temple to be unto those Jewes, who had withdrawne themselves from that body and Religion whereof they had once beene, to embrace the new faith of the Messiah, preached by the Apostles. For if at the end of the 70 weeks approaching, the legall Sanctuary were rased, and the Jewish state dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, then would it be apparent indeed, that the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah was already come and slaine for sin; because this was infallibly to come to passe within the compasse, and before the expiration of those 70 weeks, or 490 yeeres allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the last continuance of that City and Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93201:53"/>
when it should be restored after the captivity of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not without cause therefore doth Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Epistle say to the Christian Jewes, <hi>We have a more sure word of prophecie, whereunto you doe well that you give heed as unto a light shining in a dark place, untill the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts:</hi> yea and besides, because <hi>Jesus</hi> also as well as <hi>Daniel</hi> had prophesied of the approaching desolation of that City and Temple, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning all the signes that were to usher it; if the event when time come should fall out accordingly, then must <hi>Jesus</hi> of Nazareth, who foretold the foregoing signes thereof, be approved as a true Prophet, by whom of a truth the Lord had spoken. Now for the last place I mean to alledge: thus must the last of Saint <hi>James</hi> also be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, because the fall and shock of that state might shake the whole nation wheresoever dispersed, unlesse God had spared the Christians, and made them alone happy in that wofull day, or rather because Christ had foretold that one of the next fore-runners thereof should be a generall persecution of Christians, as it happened under <hi>Nero.</hi> Therefore the remembrance of the end of these 70 weekes so neere the expiring, was a good cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all the Christian Jewes to watch and pray: to this sence therefore I take that of <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.7. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Neither need we wonder that this desolation should be called the <hi>end,</hi> for our Saviour himselfe taught them so to speak in his prophecie concerning it, as may appeare if we consider that Antithesis in Saint <hi>Luke, cap.</hi> 21.9. <hi>Yee shall heare of warres, and commotions, but the end is not by

               </p>
               <p>And thus much I thought to add to my former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of latter times, lest through ignorance thereof we might incline to that little better than blasphemous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit which <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Baronius</hi> by name, and some other of <hi>Romes</hi> followers have taken up; <hi>viz.</hi> that the Apostles in such like passages as we have noted, were mistaken as belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the end of the world should have been in their owne time; God of purpose so ordering it, to cause in them a greater measure of zeale, and contempt of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things; an opinion I thinke not well beseeming a Christian.</p>
               <p n="1">1 For, first, whatsoever we imagine, the Apostles might here conceive in their private opinions as men; yet we must know that the Holy Ghost, by whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct they wrote the Scriptures, is the Spirit of truth, and therefore what is there affirmed must be true, yea, though the Pen-man himselfe understood it not.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, it was not possible the Apostles should expect the end of the world to be in their owne time, when they knew so many things were to come to passe before it, as could not be fulfilled in a short time: As first, the desolation of Jerusalem, and that not till the 70 weeks were expired.<note place="margin">Mat. 24.

Thirdly, that in the meane time the Roman Empire must be ruined, and that which hindered taken out of the way, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.7. Fourtly, that after that was done, the man of sin should be revealed, and domineere his time in the Temple and Church of God, <hi>Ibid.</hi> Fifthly, after all this, <hi>viz.</hi> when the fulnesse of the Gentiles should come in, that Israel should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againe to mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.27. Sixthly, that Christ
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93201:54"/>
should reigne in his Church on earth so long, till he had put downe all rule, all authority and power, and subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted all his enemies under his feet, before he should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the last enemy, which is death, and surrender his kingdome into the hands of his Father, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 25, <hi>&amp;c.

How is it possible they should imagine the day of Doome to be so neere, when all these things must first come to passe, and not one of them was yet fulfilled?</p>
               <p>And how could the expectation of this day be made a ground of exhortation, and a motive to watchfulnesse, and prayer, as though it could suddenly and unawares surprize them which had so many wonderfull alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to foregoe it, and yet none of them come to passe. I have spoken hitherto of what was revealed to all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles in generall; but if we take Saint <hi>John</hi> apart from the rest, and consider what was afterward revealed to him in <hi>Patmos,</hi> we shall finde in his Apocalypticall vision, besides other times more obscurely intimated, an expresse prophecy of no lesse than a thousand yeers, which what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it meane, cannot be a small time, and must be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in this world, and not in the world to come. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this, I make no question but in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times many of the beleeving Gentiles, mistaking the Apostles admonition to the Jewes of the end of their state approaching, thought the end of the whole world and the day of the Lord had beene also neere, whom therefore <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. beseeches to be better informed, because that day should not come untill the Apostasie came first, and that man of sin were revealed.</p>

               <p n="1">1 Now for the understanding of this Prophecy, wee must take notice that the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these verses, leaves off the Greek kingdome with <hi>Antiochus,</hi> of whom he was speaking before, and falls about the Romane: the reason being, because after <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi> in whose time <hi>Macedonia</hi> (whence that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome sprung, with all the rest of <hi>Greece</hi>) came under the Romane obedience; the third kingdome comes no more into reckoning, <hi>Daniel</hi> himselfe calling the time of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> reigne, the <hi>latter end</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi> kingdome, <hi>cap.</hi> 8.23. and as I take it, he intimates the same in this chapter in the verses immediately fore-going: these we have now to deale withall: from thence forward there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Romane succeeds in the account of the Great Calendar of time.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:93201:56"/>2 Under the name <hi>King</hi> we must understand the whole Roman State under what kind of government soever: for the Hebrewes use King for kingdome, and kingdome for any Government, State or Policy in the world: for the Divell in the Gospel is said to have shewn Christ all the kingdomes of the world, Monarchies, Aristocracies, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracies, or what other kind soever.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Where it is said, this King shall <hi>exalt himselfe above every God,</hi> nothing is thereby meant, but the generality, and the greatnesse of his conquests and prevailings: and the reason of that phrase or manner of speech should seem to be, because in the time of Paganisme every Citie and Country was supposed to have their proper and peculiar gods, which were deemed as their guardians and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors: whence in the Scripture, according to the language of that time, we may observe a threefold use of speech. First, The Nations themselves are expressed and implyed under the names of their gods: The Israelites were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the people of Jehovah,</hi> so are the Moabites <hi>the people of Chemosh, Numb.</hi> 21.29.

As a Christian taken by the Turks may in the like sense be said to come in bondage, and be a slave to <hi>Mahomet:</hi> for a slave to the servants is in a sense servant to their masters. Let it

also be considered whether that of <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.19. be not to be expounded according to this notion, <hi>They have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, goe serve other gods</hi>; that is, banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me into a nation of another Religion. Secondly, The exploits of the nation are said to be done by their gods, even as we by like priviledge of speech ascribe unto our Kings what is done by the people under them: thus 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 28.23. the gods of <hi>Damascus</hi> are said to have smote <hi>Ahaz; he sacrificed to the gods of</hi> Damascus <hi>that smote him: and he said, Because the gods of</hi> Syria <hi>help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. Jer.</hi> 51.44. it is said of the dominion of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that the nations flowed together unto <hi>Bel,</hi> and that he had swallowed up their wealth, which the Lord threatned there to bring forth again out of his mouth. Thirdly, and that most frequently of all others, What is attempted against the nation, is said to be attempted against their gods: Even as Generals beare the name not onely of the exploits, but also of the disadvantages of the armies led by them: so here the gods are said to receive the affronts, defeatures, and discomfitures given to the people under their patronage. <note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.23.

This I suppose to be the ground of that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of speech; though if any had rather, as others doe, take gods here for Kings and Potentates of the earth, it will I confesse come all to one purpose.</p>

               <p n="3">3 That <hi>Constantine,</hi> the first Emperour under whom that State forsook the gods of their forefathers, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Christian, together with this alteration, abrogated those ancient Roman lawes, <hi>Julia</hi> and <hi>Papia,</hi> wherein the <hi>desire of women</hi> and <hi>married life</hi> was so much priviledged and encouraged, and single and unmarried life disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged. Heare it in the words of <hi>Zozoman lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. <hi>Hist. Ecclesiast. There was</hi> (saith he) <hi>an ancient law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Romans, forbidding those who after five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeeres old were unmarried, to enjoy the like priviledges with married ones; and besides many other things, that they should have no benefits by Testaments and Legacies, unlesse they were next of kindred, and those who had no children to have halfe their goods confiscated: therefore the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour seeing those, who for Gods sake were addicted to chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and virginity, to be for this cause in the worst condition, he accounted it a folly for men to goe about to increase their kind with such carefulnesse and diligence; when as Nature, according to divine moderation, continually receives as well
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93201:62"/>
diminution, as increase. Therefore he published a law to the people, that both those who lived a single life, and those who had no children, should enjoy the like priviledges with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: yea he enacted that those who lived in chastity and virginity, should be priviledged above them, enabling both sexes, though under yeeres, to make Testaments, contrary to the accustomed policy of the Romans.</hi> This alteration of the Roman law by <hi>Constantine, Eusebius</hi> also witnesseth <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 26. <hi>de vita Constantini:</hi> and again, <hi>cap.</hi> 28. where he saith, that above all he honoured most those that had consecrated their lives to divine Philosophy; he meanes a monasticall life; and therefore he almost adored the most holy company of perpetuall Virgins. That which the fathers had thus enacted, the sonnes also seconded; and some of the following Emperours by new edicts, till there was no Relique left of those ancient priviledges, wherewith married men had beene respected; which <hi>Procopius</hi> saith (how rightly I examine not) was the cause of the ruine of that Empire, which was so much enfeebled, and weakened through neglect of the procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of children, that it was not able to match the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous armies of barbarous nations. This was the first step of dis-regarding marriage, and the desire of wiving; which was not an absolute prohibition, but discouraging. But no sooner had the Roman Bishop, and his Clergy got the power into their hands, but it grew to an absolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition; not for Monkes onely, but for the whole Clergy: which was the highest dis-respect that could be to that which God had made honourable among all men.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F the first part of this Prophesie, being a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi> of the <hi>Condition</hi> of that <hi>solemne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> which was to come, I have spoken hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto. I come now to the second part of the division, the <hi>quality of the persons,</hi> and the <hi>meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it was to enter,</hi> and to be <hi>advanced,</hi> which is set forth in the verses now read; which though you may finde by others otherwise translated, yet I hope the translation which I have propounded, if the judicious Reader please to examine it, will approve it selfe not onely not to be an enforced one, but such as salves that incongruity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, which the other could not avoid, for it is usually translated intransitively, with reference to the persons expressed in the former verse, <hi>viz.</hi> that they should speake lies in hypocrisie, having their conscience scared with an hot iron, and forbidding marriage, and commanding to abstaine from meats; so as that which in the former verse, is named Doctrines of Devils, should
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93201:65"/>
onely meane that in generall tearmes, which in these verses is particularly instanced, to be doctrines of prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting mariages, and abstaining from meats, as two branches of that devillish doctrine; for so <hi>Calvin, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancton,</hi> and some others seeme to expound it. But why this interpretation should not be the most likely: my first reason is:</p>
            <p>First, because it makes Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who speaks of that great Apostasie of Christians, which was to be in the Later Times, to instance onely in the smaller; and if I may so say, almost circumstantiall errours; and to omit this maine and principall, which the Scripture else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where tels us, should be <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or <hi>spirituall fornication</hi>; who can beleeve that we could so balk the substance, and name that only, which in comparison is but an Appendix thereto.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He prophesies here in expresse words, of such things as were to come, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in the Later Times</hi>; but errours about marriage and meats, were no novelty in the Apostles owne times, as the diligent Reader may easily collect out of their Epistles; which makes it improbable that he would specifie the Apostasie of the later times in these alone.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, But my last reason whereunto I thinke I may trust, is, that the Syntax of the words in the Greek is uncapable of such an intransitive construction, and consequently of the sense depending thereon; for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons intimated in the former verse, are expressed <hi>in casu recto,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; but the persons here intended, we finde in the genitive; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which I cannot see how they can agree with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, after the manner of intransitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, without breach of grammaticall congruity, not elsewhere sampled in our Apostles Epistles; indeed they would agree with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but that would be a harsh sense every way; for either we must say as some
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93201:66"/>
doe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Calvin, Beza.</hi>
               </note> that by devils are meant devillish men, or men led by the devill, which is an hard signification; or else it would be a stranger sense, and I think not over-pliable to the usuall exposition, to say that devils should lie, have seared consciences, and forbid marriages, or meats: So that <hi>Beza,</hi> with others; had rather confesse a breach of Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax, than incurre the inconvenience of such a forced sence. <hi>Major est habita</hi> (saith he) <hi>sententia, quam constructionis ratio</hi>; the Apostle heeded more the matter than he did the Grammar. But what needs this, so long as there is a better way to salve it? namely, to conster the words transitively, making all these genitive cases to be governed of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </note> many others have so taken it; for our late translations are indifferent to be taken either way: howsoever it be, I see no way but this, to keep the Syntax true and even, and wholly to avoid the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned inconveniences: which as it is easie and obvious, and not strained, so I hope to let you see the event to have been most answerable thereunto: That this was the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and this the meanes, this the quality of the persons, whereby the doctrine of Daemons was first brought in, advanced and maintained in the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> through the hypocrisie, faining craft, or counterfeiting of those who told lies, of those who had their consciences sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, &amp;c.</p>

Or thus: through the hypocrisie, partly of Lyars, partly of men of seared consciences, partly of those who forbid marriage, and command to abstaine from meats: and so though many were guilty of all, yet some may be exempt from some; as namely some may be guilty of the last note, of forbidding marriage, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining from meats, and yet free of the former, of being
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93201:67"/>
counterfeit Lyars, and men of seared Consciences: which I speak for reverence of some of the Ancients, who though otherwise holy men, yet cannot be acquitted from all the imputations here mentioned, nor altogether excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from having an hand, through the Fate of the times wherein they lived, in laying the ground-work, whereon soon after the great Apostasie was builded.</p>
            <p>This therefore being remembred, I come now to the unfolding of them in severall: and first of the first, the <hi>hypocrisie of Lyars,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing, in common, with the rest which followes; for all should be counterfeit: lying should carry the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit of truth; the seared Conscience, a semblance of devotion; the restraint of Marriage should be but a shew of chastity; and abstaining from meats, a false ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of abstinency: for the persons of whom they are spoken, should either make a shew of what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves knew was not; or that which they thought they had, should be no better than a false shew, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit of that they took it for.</p>
            <p>The Vulgar Latine in <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.15. and the Syriack in the same place, turne the word <hi>hypocrisis, versutia, dolus,</hi> craft and subtlety: which sence, if need were, would not be denied admittance here. But I return to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>hypocrisie of Lyars,</hi> which I conceive to be the same, and no other, than that which our Apostle speaks in the same case, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. where he tels us, that <hi>the comming of the man of sinne, and the Apostasie attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, should be after the working of Sathan, with all power, and signes, and lying wonders; and with all deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse of unrighteousnesse,</hi> or unrighteous and ungodly deceiving; and that <hi>God should send them strong delusions, that they might beleeve a lye, &amp;c.</hi> Yea some of this, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93201:67"/>
of that which followes in that place, may extend also to the rest which followes in my Text, howsoever the most thereof, as you heare, doth most evidently expound this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, this <hi>hypocrisie of Lyars.</hi> Now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the event, this <hi>hypocrisie of Lyars</hi> doth appeare in three things: 1 Lyes of Miracles. 2 Fabulous Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends of the Acts of Saints, and sufferings of Martyrs. 3 Counterfeit writings under the name of the best and first antiquity. Lyes of Miracles will display their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie in three particulars. 1 Forgery. 2 Illusion, 3 Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application. 1 Forgery of Miracles never done, as were the reports of wondrous dreames, and visions, which had no other credit, but the Authors honesty; or miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Cures, by the power and reliques of Saints deceased; as when those who never were blind, made others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve they had newly received sight. 2 Illusion; when though something were done, yet it was but a seeming, and a counterfeit onely of a miraculous work, indeed some jugling trick of the Divell, or of his instruments. Lastly, Misapplication; either when that was attributed to a divine power, which was nothing but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the work and operation of the Divell: or when it was interpreted, and abused to invite and confirme men in some Idolatrous errour, as it happened in the miracle of the Shrines and Sepulchres of the holy Martyrs, which were interpreted to bee for the confirmation of their Power, Presence, and notice of humane affaires after death, and to warrant us, and encourage men to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course unto them by prayer, and invocation, as unto Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatours; and to give that honour unto their Reliques, which was due unto God alone. The like is to be said of the Miracles of Images, and of the Host, which though they smelt strong of Forgery, or Illusion, were supposed by a divine disposition to be wrought for the like end and purpose. All which was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the power of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, or strong delusion, to make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve

a Lye, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speakes 2 <hi>Thessal.</hi> 2.11.</p>
            <p>Concerning the hypocrisie of fabulous legend-Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Acts of Saints and Martyrs, you know what it meanes, as also the last which was named Counterfeit Authors, under the name of Antiquity; as approving those errours which latter times devised; I shall not need here to use any further explication: and thus you see what is comprehended under <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, counterfeiting, or faining of Lyars. I should now come to display the truth of this particular of this Prophesie in the event; but I will first unfold the next imputation, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap> is to cauterize, to sear with an hot iron, or cut off with searing, as Chirurgions doe rotten members: now that which is seared, becomes more hard and brawny, and so more dull, and not so sensible in feeling as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93201:68"/>
If they had had any tendernesse or feeling, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Conscience, but even of sense, they could never have beleeved, or vented such stuffe as there is. As <hi>Vincent. hist. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 84. That the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> should draw out her breasts, and milk in I know not what Clerks mouth. That she played the Midwife to an Abbesse, got with child by her Cater, and sent the Bastard by two Angels to a certaine Hermite to be brought up. <hi>Idem ibid. c.</hi> 86.

            <p>But that which <hi>Johannes de Nicol.</hi> in his reformed Spanyard tels, that he read taken out of <hi>Trithemius,</hi> is the more worthy to be remembred, as being a principall motive in his conversion, who was till then extremely addicted to the Idol-worship of the blessed Virgin; which was much cooled, when he read that she came into the chamber of Fryer <hi>Allen</hi> (a Dominican that made her Rosary) made a ring of her owne haire, wherewith she espoused her selfe unto him, kissed him, let him handle

her breasts, and conversed as familiarly with him, as a Bride is wont with her Bridegroome: whether think you not that these fellowes were seared in their conscience? what block could have beene more senslesse? <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> speaking of the golden legend, as they call it, a book fraught with such stuffe, as you have heard, me thinks almost expresses the meaning of a cauterized con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. <hi>Hanc homo scripsit</hi> (saith he) <hi>ferrei oris, &amp; plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bei cordis,</hi> a fellow of an iron mouth, and leaden heart, as if he had said, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, of a brawny and unfeeling conscience.</p>
            <p>But I come to shew how this prediction of our Apostle hath beene accomplished, how <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the cousening and feigning of lyars, was the meanes whereby the doctrine of Daemons was advanced in the Church, I meane the deifying and worshipping of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the adoring and templing of relicks, the bowing downe to Images, the worshipping of Crosses as new Idoll-columnes, the worshipping of the breaden god, or of any visible thing whatsoever upon supposall of any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity therein: all which I have proved to be nothing else, but the Gentiles idolatrous Theology of Daemons, revived amongst Christians.</p>
            <p>The first of these, the deifying and invocating of Saints, and adoring relicks is the most ancient for time of all the rest, and began to appeare in the Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after the death of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostate, who was the last Ethnicall Emperour; the grounds and occasions whereof were most strange reports of wonders shewed upon those who approached the shrines of Martyrs, and prayed at their memories, and sepulchers: devils charmed, diseases cured, the blinde saw, the lame walked, yea the dead revived, and other the like, which the doctors of those times for the most part avouched to be done by the power and prayers of glorified Martyrs, and by the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice they took of mens devotions at their sepulchers;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93201:69"/>
though at the beginning those devotions were directed to God alone, and such places only chosen for the stirring up of zeale and fervour, by the memory of those blessed and glorious Champions of Christ. But whiles the world stood in admiration, and the most esteemed of these won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as of the glorious beames of the triumph of Christ; they were soone perswaded to call upon them, as patrons and mediatours, whose power with God, and notice of things done upon earth, they thought that these signes and miracles approved.</p>
            <p>Thus the reliques of Martyrs beginning to be esteemed above the richest jewels, for the supposed vertue even of the very ayre of them, were wonderfully sought after, as some <hi>divine Elixar,</hi> soveraigne both to body and soule. Whereupon another scene of wonders entred, even of visions, and revelations, wonderfull and admirable for the discovery of the sepulchers and ashes of Martyrs, which were quite forgotten, yea of some whose names and memories, till then, no man had ever heard of; as S. <hi>Ambrose's Gervasius,</hi> and <hi>Protasius.</hi> Thus in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Christian world were new Martyrs bones ever and anon discovered, whose verity againe miraculous effects and cures seemed to approve; and therefore were diversly dispersed, and gloriously templed, and enshrined. <hi>Hil. lib. ad Constantium</hi> intimates miraculous cures of the reliques of Martyrs to have been as ancient as his time, yea as the time of the Churches peace <note n="*" place="margin">Plus crudeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati vestrae, Nero, Deci, Maximiniane debemus.

               <p>Heare therefore something of this kind also, that you may see as they agreed with us in the same profession a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Idols, so did they also in suffering the like slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous lyes from their Adversaries; in discoursing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I shall be neerer to <gap reason="foreign">

For I find that <hi>Stephen</hi> the Monk, afterward forsooth a Martyr, at what time the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour sent some of the Bishops and others unto him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire his subscription to the decree of the Councell, thus expostulates with them: <hi>Did yee not</hi> (saith he) <hi>discard that adjective</hi> Saint <hi>from all the Just, from all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, from the Prophets, from the Prophets, Martyrs, and other godly men? for it was bravely decreed by you, That when any one were going to any of these, and were asked whither he went, he should answer, to the Apostles, to the fourty Martyrs; or being asked whence he came, he should in like manner say, From the Temple of Martyr</hi> Theodore, <hi>or from the Temple of the Martyr</hi> George.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Theosterictus</hi> tells the same thing of the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> himselfe. <hi>Sanctos Martyres</hi> (saith he) <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum in ipso erat, honore privavit, cum praeceperit illos non esse Sanctos appellandos; sed simplicitèr nominari Apostolos, quadraginta Martyres,</hi> Theodorum, Georgium, <hi>&amp; alios similitèr:</hi> he deprived, as much as in him lay, the holy Martyrs of honour, in that he commanded, they should not be stiled <hi>Saints,</hi> but simply named the fourty Martyrs, <hi>Theodore, George,</hi> &amp;c. Whereby it appeares, that this law
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93201:77"/>
(whatsoever it was that these Authors charge the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour with) was something which proceeded from the Councell it self, as Monk <hi>Stephen</hi> even now charged them. Besides, that it was something onely about the calling of places dedicated to Saints, though our Authors (as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniators use) tell it of Saints at large.</p>
               <p>Lastly, it seemes to have growne upon some question, how farre, and in what kind, Saints were to be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which was occasioned by the wiping out of those Canons afore-mentioned.</p>

               <p>In that Idolatrous Councell of the second of <hi>Nice,</hi> one of their proofes, among many the like for worshipping of Images, is a tale quoted out of I know not what <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phronius,</hi> of a certain Recluse, who using to worship an Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> holding <hi>Christ</hi> in her armes, had been a long time tempted by the divell to fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; wherat on a time the old man being much aggrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the Devill visibly appearing told him in plaine termes (but under an oath of secrecy) that hee would never cease to vex him, untill he left worshipping the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the blessed Virgin.

Another sayth, yea more then one, that <hi>Wittikind</hi> King of the <hi>Saxons</hi> entring disguised into a Church, and diligently observing the Christians fashion of receiving the Communion, saw them put a little pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty smiling boy into their mouths. These wonders and others of the like apparitions of flesh and blood began not, till about the end of the 800 yeares. But that they might seeme ancienter, <hi>Simeon Metaphrastes</hi> hath a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Legend of <hi>Arsenius</hi> the Hermite; and some body counterfeited the life of Saint <hi>Basil,</hi> under the name of <hi>Amphilochius</hi> his companion, which now they begin to be ashamed of. And for feare the people might suspect that these were illusions, they keepe yet some of the flesh and blood which was thus transubstantiated, for a monument, in many Churches. To these apparitions, to make all compleat, they tell us of a hive of Bees seen in Saint <hi>Gervais</hi> his Monastery in <hi>Paris,</hi> which built a Chappell of wax in honour of the Host, which some body put into the hive; and a miracle of an Asse that left his provender to worship the Host; and many other the like: but I have staied too long amongst them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let here be the conclusion of <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I come now to the last description of the meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the doctrine of Daemons was to be advanced, <hi>viz.</hi> through the hypocrisie of such as forbid marriage, and command to abstaine from meats. Who are these? The wonderfull correspondence of the event makes me verily
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93201:81"/>
beleeve, that the Holy Ghost intended here (at least chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to decipher unto us Monks, and Doctors of Monkery, by two such marks, as ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the chiefe points and grounds of that singularity of life. For prohibition of marriage, and difference of meats are inseparable characters of Monasticall profession, and goe common to all that crew of hypocrites, whether solivagant Hermites, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorites which live alone, or Coenobites which lived in society. And if we take them joyned together, as our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle doth, I think they can befit no other kind of men by way of rule and precept, but these alone. 'Tis true, all Antichrists Priests are forbidden marriage, generally and absolutely; but meats they are not, save onely upon certaine dayes and times, which is not their case alone, but the people also partake with them in the like restraint. But Monks are bound by the vowed rule of their profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to abstain from both absolutely and perpetually. Concerning the first heare S. <hi>Chrisostome</hi> speak; <hi>hom.</hi> 7 <hi>in Math. Nobis &amp; Monachis</hi> (saith he) <hi>omnia mandata Dei sunt communia, praeter connubium</hi>: all the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God are common to us, with Monks, besides marriage. Wherefore in the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> is an expresse Canon, <hi>cap.</hi> 16. <hi>Vt nec Deo dicata Virgo, nec Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachus nubant</hi>: that no Nun or Monk should marry, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) they might not forsake their profession.</p>
               <p>For the second, the abstaining from meats, Saint <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> can tell us best, who is the father and founder of wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh all the Monks of the West. His rule, which they all bind themselves to observe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith; <hi>à carnibus omnes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stineant,</hi> let all abstaine from flesh. Again, <hi>Carnium eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am quadrupedum omninò ab omnibus abstineatur comestio:</hi> let all abstaine together from the eating of flesh of foure footed beasts. Hence is that decree of Bishop <hi>Fructuosus</hi> in <hi>Gratian dist.</hi> 5. <hi>Carnem cuiquam Monach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> nec gustan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, nec sumendi est concessa licentia</hi>: no Monk hath leave granted him to take, or so much as to taste a peece of flesh.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93201:81"/>
And these were the two principall observations of the first Monks, before they came to be gathered into a society of a common life, under certain set rules. <hi>Paulus Thebaus</hi> the first pattern of this kind of life, abstained as from marriage (whereof there is no question) so from all meats, save bread and dates. <hi>Anthony</hi> the next eate nought but bread and salt, and both drank no other drink but water. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in his <hi>Anchorato</hi> tels us of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring observations in this kind. Some eat no flesh, but fish; some neither of both, but fruits and hearbs: some eat flying creatures, but abstained from all besides. But if you will take meats in this place in a larger sense, you shall have a full definition of Monkery, and take in that other Monasticall principle of renouncing possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; having no propriety in any thing, which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the second fundamentall principle, next to the vow of chastity or single life. Now may not <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, meats, be expounded in this sense? We know the word (Bread) in Scripture signifies all thing needfull for the maintenance of life; <hi>omnia vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But <hi>Pambo,</hi> and <hi>Isidorus,</hi> and the other Fathers (of the Monks) laid their heads together, decreed it should be buried with him, with this blessing; <hi>Pecunia tua sit tecum in perditionem</hi>; thy money perish together with thee.

               <p>I conclude therefore, that these words, are a description of Monkery by such notes as are fundamentall, which way soever wee take them, either containing single life and <hi>discrimen ciborum,</hi> the differencing of meats, or the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93201:82"/>
two vowes of chastity and poverty, or all three of them, Chastity, Poverty, and abstaining from meats. As for that other vow of obedience, it was not from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, nor common to all; not to Hermites and Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, but such as lived in common under an head. And these are the men through whose hypocrisy, and by whose meanes the doctrine of Daemons should be brought in, and advanced among Christians in the latter times.</p>
               <p>Now let us see and behold with admiration the truth of this part also of the prophesy. Where first observe that this singular kind of life began even just at the time when the doctrine of Daemons was to enter. For <hi>Paulus Thebaeus,</hi> and <hi>Anthony,</hi> the first patterns thereof, died, the former in the reigne of <hi>Constantine,</hi> the latter a little before the yeere 360; whence, or neere unto which time, we began our reckoning before of the first entrance of Saint-worship into the Church. About that time (Monks till then having been confined to <hi>Egypt) Hilarion</hi> brought them into <hi>Syria,</hi> and presently Saint <hi>Basil</hi> gave them a certain rule to live together in forme of a Polity; and with the assistance of his brother <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> and <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> (who all entred this new kind of life) dispersed them over all <hi>Asia</hi> amd <hi>Greece</hi>; whose encrease was so wonderfull, that almost in an instant they filled the world, and their esteeme was so great, that there was scarce a man of note, but took upon him this kind of life.</p>
               <p>Though therefore it be most true, that our Apostles prophecy will bee verified, whichsoever of the two, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such as themselves entred the restraint of a Monast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick life, or those who approved, taught, &amp; maintained the holinesse of tht profession (as the rest did) were the ring-leaders and Foster-fathers of this defection; (for both come within the verge of such as forbid marriage, and command to abstain from meats) yet wee will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ourselves with so loose an application, but see what an hand Monks and Friars themselves (chiefly I suppose
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93201:83"/>
intended by the holy Ghost) had in this businesse.</p>
               <p>And first in the doctrin of Daemons, adoring of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, and Invocation of Saints: where that which I first speak of shall be in the words of <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> lest some more tender of the honour of our fathers upon earth, than of the glory of our father in heaven, might take exception. Heare therefore not mee, but <hi>Chemnitius</hi> in his <hi>examen Concilii Tridentini</hi>: About the yeare of our Lord God 370 <hi>per Basilium, Nissenum, et Nazianzenum in publicos Ecclesia conventus, occasione orationum Panegyricarum In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocatio Sanctorum invehi coepit; eodem tempore cùm ab iis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem authoribus Monachatus ex Aegypto et Syriâ in Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciam introduceretur, Et videtur</hi> (saith he) <hi>haec sive portio, sive Appendix Monachatus fuisse.</hi> By <hi>Basil, Nissen, and Nazianzen,</hi> upon occasion of Panegyricall orations, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints began to be brought into the publick Assemblyes of the Church, at the same time, when by the same Authors the profession of Monasticall life was was brought out of Aegypt and Syria into Greece; and it seemes (saith he) that this was either a part, or an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenance of Monkery &amp;c. Againe speaking of St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> when he had once turned Monke, howsoever hee was before; <hi>Non tamen nego (inquit) Ambrosium, tandem cùm Monochatum à Basilio mutuò sumpsisset, etiàm ad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocationem Sanctorum inclinare coepisse, ut patet ex libro de viduis.</hi> I deny not (saith he) but <hi>Ambrose</hi> at length, when he had once borrowed Monkery from <hi>Basil,</hi> began also to incline to the Invocation of Saints, as appeares in his book <hi>De viduis.</hi> Thus <hi>Chemnitius.</hi>

These were those surely which occasioned that rescript of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Nemo Martyrem distrahat, nemo merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; let no man sell, let no man buy a Martyr:</hi> whereby we may gather what honesty was like to be used amongst them: we know, <hi>Laudat venales qui vult extrudere mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>; Merchants use to commend their commodities. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> of <hi>Tours,</hi> who lived and died somewhat before the yeere 600, tels us this, <hi>Monachos quosdam Romam ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisse, ac prope templum Pauli corpora quaedam noctu effodis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, qui comprehensi fassi sunt in Graeciam se ea pro Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum reliquiis portaturos fuisse</hi>; That certain Monks came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and neere unto Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, in the night time, digged up certain bodies; who being apprehended, confessed they meant to have carried them into <hi>Greece</hi> for reliques of Saints.

                  </gap> in thinking God was pleased with that singularity of life; yet must it be confessed, that the greater part were no better than hypocrites, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93201:84"/>
and that the lamentable defection of the Christian Church chiefly proceeded from, and was fostered by men of that profession, as in part we have heard already.</p>
               <p>And if you can with patience heare him speak, I will add the testimony of <hi>Eunapius Sardianus,</hi> a Pagan Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who lived in the dayes of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the first, about the yeere 400, in the life of <hi>Edesius,</hi> most bitterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing against the Christians for demolishing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Temple of <hi>Serapis</hi> at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi>: he speakes in this manner: <hi>When they had done</hi> (saith he) <hi>they brought into the holy places those which they call Monks, men indeed for shape, but living like swine, and openly committing innumerable villanies, not to be named; who yet tooke it for a peece of Religion thus to despise the Divinity</hi> (he means of <hi>Serapis:) for then</hi> (saith he) <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever wore a black coat, and would demeane himselfe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly in publicke, got a tyrannicall authority; to such an opinion of vertue had that sort of men attained. These Monks also they placed at</hi> Canopus, <hi>in stead of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible gods, to worship slaves, and those of no good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; thus bringing a bond of Religion upon men. For having powdered the bones and skuls of such as had beene condemned of many crimes, and punished by a legall course of justice, they made Gods of them; prostrating themselves unto them, and thinking themselves the better for being polluted with Sepulchres; they called them forsooth Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and some Deacons, yea and Solicitours of their prayers with the gods; being indeed but perfidious slaves, who had been well basted with the whip, and carried the scars of their lewdnesse upon their bodies, and yet such gods as these the earth brings forth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the wretched caitiffe, and damned dog, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemes the Saints and servants of Christ, who loved not their lives unto death; the dust of whose feet he was not worthy to lick up. Yet may we make a shift to gather hence, what manner of offices Monks were then busied in.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93201:84"/>
And if <hi>Baronius</hi> took leave to use his testimony for the antiquity of Saint-worship, why may not I with the like liberty alledge it, to shew that Monks and Friars were ring-leaders therein?</p>
               <p>But when the Idolatry of Image-worship came to be added to those of Saints, whether Monks and Friars were not the chiefe sticklers therein, judge when you shall hear how it fared with them in that great opposition against Idols in the East.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Leo Isaurus,</hi> the first of those Emperours that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Images, we have this in generall out of the Greek Menology: That he raged most cruelly against Bishops and Monks, which maintained the worship of Images; and that he burnt a whole cloister of such kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their Monastery, together with a famous Library, and all their furniture.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Constantine</hi> his son made a worse fray amongst them. For the Author of the Acts of Monk <hi>Stephen</hi> tels us, That he being reproved and convicted for what hee had done (<hi>viz.</hi> against Images) by the religious and worthy professours of Monasticall life, he raised an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable warre against them; calling that noble habit, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the vesture of darknesse</hi>; and the Monks themselves, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>unworthy of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory:</hi> and besides, terming them all Idolaters, for the worshipping of venerable Images.</p>
               <p>The same is confirmed by <hi>Theosterictus,</hi> another Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of that time, who saith, That the whole aime and study of this Emperour was to extinguish and root out the order of Monks.</p>
               <p>And for particulars, here what <hi>Theophanes</hi> (himselfe a Monk, and a little singed too in this flame, before it ended) will informe us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the one and twentieth yeere of his reigne he caused</hi> (saith he) Andreas Calybites, <hi>a worthy Monke, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him for his impiety</hi> (in demolishing Images) <hi>to be
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93201:85"/>
scourged till hee died,</hi> lib. 22. cap. 30. Hist. miscell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the five and twentieth yeere of his reigne hee caused Monke</hi> Stephen <hi>to be dragged by the heeles in the streets, till being rent in peeces, he died; both for the aforesaid of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and because he drew and perswaded many to a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasticall life,</hi> Ibid. cap. 39.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The same yeere the Emperour</hi> (saith he) <hi>disgraced and dishonoured the Monasticall habit, publickly commanding every Monk to lead a woman by the hand, so to march through the</hi> Hippodrome, <hi>all the people abusing them, and spitting upon them,</hi> Ibid. cap. 40.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the seven and twentieth year, the Monasteries</hi> (he saith) <hi>partly he destroyed to the very foundations, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed them upon his Captains and Souldiers,</hi> Ibid. cap. 49.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the same yeere, when he could not draw</hi> Peter à Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra, <hi>a famous</hi> Stylite, <hi>or Pillar-Monk, unto his opinions, he caused him likewise to be dragged by the heeles, and his body cast out into the streets,</hi> Ibid. cap. 48.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In his thirtieth yeere, his Praetor or Deputy</hi> Lichano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draco <hi>gathered all the Monks in his jurisdiction together, and commanded them to obey the Emperour, to put on a white coat, and to marry wives instantly, or to have their eyes put out, and to be sent into exile,</hi> Ibid. cap. 52. So the Emperor, when he would have <hi>Constantine</hi> the Patriarch abjure Monkery, <hi>he made him</hi> (saith the same Authour) <hi>eat flesh,</hi> Lib. eod. cap. 29.</p>
               <p>In the one and thirtieth yeere the same <hi>Lichanodraco</hi> sold all the Monasteries, both of men and women in his jurisdiction, and sent the money to the Emperour. If hee found any one to have a relique of any Saint in keeping, he burnt it, and punished him that had it. He slew the Monks, some with stripes, some with the sword; and left not a man, where he had to doe, that wore a Monasticall habit; whereupon the Emperour wrote thus unto him, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>I have found thee a man after mine own heart,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93201:85"/>
who fulfillest my whole will.</hi> Thus much of <hi>Constantine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like reports <hi>Cedrenus</hi> of <hi>Michael Balbus,</hi> That he abominated Monks, and diversly afflicted them, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining one punishment after another against them. As also of <hi>Theophilus,</hi> the last Emperour that opposed Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: <hi>Theophilus</hi> (saith he) <hi>ordained <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that no Monks should have accesse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cities, and that they should by all meanes be banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and not so much as dare to be seen in the Countrey:</hi> and that he caused the Monasteries and places of holy retirement to become common and secular habitations: what the reason was, we may learn by that the same Author tels us: <hi>Of those</hi> (saith he) <hi>which reprehended the Emperour, the Abramite Monks were the chiefe; who freely adventuring into his presence, did demonstrate that Monasticall life was not an invention of yesterday, or the other day, but an ancient and primitive institution, and that holy Images were familiar in the Apostles times, and that Saint</hi> Luke <hi>painted an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the blessed Virgin,</hi> &amp;c. But it seemes the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was not convinced by their demonstration: for this their boldnesse cost them full deare, as our Authour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.</p>
               <p>By this time I know you understand what the matter was that this Image-storm fell so heavily upon the heads of Monks and Friars: and yet notwithstanding all this, they at length prevailed, and carried the day (so God would have it) for their Idols. For another <hi>Theophanes,</hi> whom they call the Presbyter, a Writer also of his time tells, That <hi>Theophilus</hi> being dead, <hi>Theodora</hi> the Empresse (whilst she reigned in the minority of <hi>Michael</hi> her son) when she meant to restore Image-worship, which had been banished now the second time, ever since <hi>Leo Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menius, Re cum illis communicatâ, qui erant in magistratu &amp; dignitate constituti, accersit cum ipsis eos, qui inter Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chos praestabant, &amp; de Imaginum instauratione quaestionem

               <p>For the Idolatry of the masse-god, which was not in use, at soonest, till a thousand yeeres after Christ, when the opinion of Transubstantiation had gotten strength, we shall not need trouble our selves much to shew that Monks and Friars were the authors and advancers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; since by that time, these kind of men were become the onely masters of Divinity: and therefore wee need not doubt, that what was then broached in the Church, came out of their shop.</p>
