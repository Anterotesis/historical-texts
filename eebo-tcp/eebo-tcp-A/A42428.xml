            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Captain GEORGE ST. LO his Proceedings againſt Me, for my
Fidelity to my KING and my COUNTRY; Together with the maſt Material
Conſequences of them, whilſt I was Store keeper of His Majeſty's
Dock-Yard near Plymouth, under him, and Acted in that Employment.</head>
            <p>ON the 16th. of <hi>April</hi> 1695, Captain <hi>George
St. Lo</hi> came to reſide at <hi>Plymouth</hi> as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner
of his Majeſty's Navy for that
Port, and within a Fortnight after, a Store-Ship
arrived there from <hi>Deptford</hi> for Our
Yard; whilſt ſhe was Unlading, Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> came to
the Store-houſe ſometimes to view the Stores, and found
great fault with them, particularly the Hammacocs, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
and Shovels; For the Hammacocs he ſwore, (as the
Maſter Attendant, Maſter Shipwright, Clerk of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
and I were attending him up and down the Store-houſe)
<hi>they were the very ſame that Captain</hi> Willſhaw <hi>and</hi>
He <hi>had lately refuſed to receive into</hi> Deptford <hi>Stores upon a
Survey of them, therefore Mr.</hi> Hoſier <hi>was a Knave, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to be Turned out of his Employment for Receiving
them;</hi> then Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> ordered me <hi>to ſend up a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of tboſe Stores to the Navy-Board;</hi> I told him, <hi>'twas
more proper for him to Repreſent this Matter to the Navy-Board
than my ſelf, and that I wou'd adviſe Mr.</hi> Hoſier
<hi>how much he was Diſpleaſed with him for ſending Us the
worſt Stores he cou'd pick out;</hi> Which I thought was
the Utmoſt he cou'd expect from me; Yet becauſe
he Urged me extreamly for five or ſix Weeks together
to Comply with his aforeſaid Commands, I conſulted my
Brother Officers thereon (it being more their Duty than
mine to inſpect the Quality of the Stores that were from
time to time receiv'd by me) but after they had conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
this Matter, they told me, <hi>'twas not Our Buſineſs to
make any Complaint of the Stores that were ſent Us from
another Yard, and that they wou'd not Concern themſelves in
any ſuch Thing;</hi> I cou'd not poſſibly comply with Capt.
<hi>St. Lo</hi> his Commands any further, however, he took Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
from thence to ſix a Prejudice againſt me, and in
ſuch a time of Action 'twas very eaſie for him to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At</hi> Midſummer 1695, <hi>Captain</hi> St. Lo <hi>removed from</hi>
Plymouth <hi>to the New Dock-Yard to live, and ſome of the
Officers at</hi> Michaelmas, <hi>(their Buſineſs being wholly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
thither) then Captain</hi> St. Lo <hi>gave me Verbal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
at</hi> Plymouth, to Remove all the Stores form thence to the
New Dock-Yard, <hi>I anſwer'd him, that</hi> the Removal of the
King's Stores was an Important Concern, and did require Our
ſerious Conſiderations before We undertook it; <hi>he ſaid poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi>
all the Stores ſhould be Removed, <hi>ſo I deſired his
Warrant</hi> to Remove ſuch Stores only as he foreſaw wou'd be
abſolutely Neceſſary to carry on the Service for the preſent;
<hi>Upon which, Captain</hi> St. Lo <hi>fell into Violent Paſſion, and
I did not ſay any thing more to increaſe it, but the next
Morning early, I went to the New Dock-Yard to wait
on him at his Houſe, and acquainted him that</hi> I was
much Concerned at his Paſſion with me laſt Night, and hoped
he wou'd now be pleaſed to hear me patiently what I had to
offer to him concerning his Commands to me for Removing the
Stores from <hi>Plymouth</hi> to the <hi>New Dock-Yard. Capt.</hi> St. Lo
<hi>ſaid,</hi> he wou'd not hear me, and ſwore by his Maker, the
Stores ſhou'd be Removed. <hi>He went from me down Stairs
into his Kitchin, I followed him, and after I perceived
his Paſſion was ſomewhat over, I ſaid to him,</hi> Lord, Sir,
what, do you deſign to Ruin me, that you expect ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities
from me? Pray do you conſider, Sir, that I and
my Sureties have given Bond of 1500 <hi>l.</hi> to the Navy-Board,
to paſs a Fair Account of all the Stores committed to my
Charge, whenever their Honours pleaſe to require it of me,
and that my Warrant directs me to Obſerve their Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in my Management of the Store-keepers Employment.
<hi>Whereto Captain</hi> St. Lo <hi>replyed, that</hi> his Commands ſhou'd
not be prejudicial to me; For he wou'd ingage, that if I want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ſome particular Stores to anſwer my Ballance, they wou'd
be more than made up by the Overflows of others; <hi>Captain</hi>
St. Lo <hi>his Argument indeed did not alter my Opinion,
which made him afterwards Reprimand me very often</hi>
for not Removing the Stores, <hi>(and moſt commonly before
Company) inſomuch, that I hardly took any Comfort
of my Life. But to Illuſtrate this Point beyond Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(it being the moſt Conſiderable Part of my Subject)
I ſhall inſert the Copy of a Complaint from Capt.</hi> St. Lo
<hi>againſt me to the Navy-Board, with their Order to me
thereon, and my Anſwer to it.</hi>

which I ſhall Obey to the utmoſt of my Power, and humbly
acquaint your Honours that, as to my own Habitation (tho'
not yet fitted) I wou'd have long ſince Removed to it, but
that I preferr'd his Majeſty's Intereſt before my own Eaſe and
Advantage; For at this time, not any part of the Store-houſe
is Covered, nor the Window-ſhutters fix'd, and I know
not how the Stores can be Removed without conſiderable Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
both by the Weather and Embezlement. A good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Canvas, Cables, Cordage, and other Stroes, (which
will take up much Room) are now a coming to Us from
<hi>Deptford,</hi> I wiſh ſufficient Care was taken to lodge them
in when they Arrive; And I cannot apprehend, how Our
other Stores can well be Removed (as the Caſe ſtands) till they
are properly ſecured. The Tallow, Deales, Pitch and Tarr,
alſo the Maſts, Timber, and all the other Out-Stores (excepting
the Anchors) are already Removed, and I hope, no Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
attends the Service through my Neglect. Our Iſſues of
late have been extraordinary great, and with ſubmiſſion I
affirm, that my Lodging at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and Quickning the
Tradeſmen there, has been ſomewhat Inſtrumental to the timely
ſupplying our Demands of Stores which We were Neceſſitated
for. Every Day, or every other Day at leaſt, (as Buſineſs offers)
I am at the Dock, and at Night, conſtantly I, and my Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
write till 8 or 9 a Clock to keep up my Accounts, which
I cannot do at the Dock; For no Convenience for my Office is
yet made. Beſides, every Morning and Evening (both before
and after the common Working hours) I, or my Chief Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is obliged to attend the Sail-makers at the Store-houſe
in <hi>Plymouth</hi> to ſee all things ſafe, they having for ſome time
wrought by Candle-light to diſpatch theer Work, ſo that I
foreſee great Difficulties for the preſent in managing my Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
however, I am confident of Undergoing them all
to your Honours ſatisfaction, and (If poſſible) to the good
liking of all Others that I am concerned with.</p>

not care what the Commiſſioner ordered me, for he muſt do
his Buſineſs Methodically, according to his Inſtructions from
the Surveyor of the Navy;</hi> At length, upon the Maſter-Attendant
his Requeſt, and my own Promiſe <hi>not to do
any ſuch irregular thing for the future,</hi> I got the Clerk of
the Survey his Warrant accordingly; And being thus
enjoyned not to Obey Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> his prepoſterous
Commands, I forewarned my Inſtruments from deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any more Stores to the Men of War without an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from the Officers of the Yard; which coming to
Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> his hearing, he ſaid publickly, <hi>all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
were Knaves, and joyned together to Cheat the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>On the 21ſt of</hi> March 1695, <hi>I went to the Royal Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel
at</hi> Plymouth, <hi>to ſpeak with Captain</hi> St. Lo <hi>at Mr.</hi> Hooks
<hi>the Deputy-Governour's Houſe (who was alſo Store-keeper
of the Ordnance) where was Colonel</hi> Freeke.
<hi>Captain</hi> Julian, <hi>Mr.</hi> Stuckley <hi>the Poſt-maſter, and ſome
other Gentlemen of Note; The Deputy-Goveruour was
ſo kind, as to deſire me</hi> to ſit down and take a Glaſs of
Wine; <hi>but before I cou'd well look about me, Captain</hi>
St. Lo <hi>asked me why</hi> I did not Remove all the Stores to the
Dock; <hi>I anſwered him, that</hi> there was a Lighter now at
the Store-houſe a Loading, and We made what haſte We cou'd
to Remove the Stores, conſidering the Store-houſe at the Dock
was not yet fitted to Receive them; <hi>he told me,</hi> I had beſt
Remove them all, or elſe he wou'd Complain of me to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty;
<hi>I ſaid,</hi> I hoped not to give him any Occaſion for it.
<hi>Then the Deputy-Governour told Captain</hi> St. Lo, Truly
if he was in Mr. <hi>Gaſelee</hi> his Place, he wou'd not Remove any
of the Stores to the Dock till the Store-houſe there was Fitted
to place them properly in; <hi>Whereupon Captain</hi> St. Lo <hi>was
angry with me</hi> for not being yet Removed to my Houſe at
the Dock; <hi>I anſwered, that</hi> the Painters were now at Work
in it, and I cou'd not Remove my Goods without Damaging
them, but I wou'd Remove to my Houſe next Week; <hi>Whereto
Captain</hi> St. Lo <hi>replyed,</hi> What a Deviliſh Noiſe you make
of your Goods; I warrant you, a Man may carry them all
on his Back; <hi>I anſwered, that</hi> I did not come to diſtarb him
and his good Company, only deſired to ſpeak two or three
words with him by himſelf; <hi>My Buſineſs was,</hi> to take his
Conſent to go to <hi>Exon</hi> for a Day or two; <hi>Which I readily
had, and did hope, that when I came to live at the Dock,
all Miſunderſtandings between Us wou'd afterwards
have ceaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I went to live at my Houſe in the New-Dock-Yard
the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1696, in which Month, and in <hi>June</hi>
next enſuing, We there unloded 3 Veſſels with Stores
from <hi>Deptford,</hi> among them was a good Quantity of
Oars; and as they was brought Aſhoar, Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi>
his Coxſwain came to me, and deſired <hi>he might pick out
a Gang for his Maſters Pinnace,</hi> Which I bid him <hi>Take,</hi> So
he ſet his Men to chooſe out the Oars, and went his way;
About an hour or two after, one of Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> his
Watermen came to me again, and told me <hi>his Coxſwain
had ſent him to me to change an Oar, it being broke,
and belonged to the Gang they had juſt before taken out,</hi> I bid
him tell the Coxſwain, that <hi>before I changed his Oar, I
would have a Warrant for the Oars, Pinnace, Sails, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things which he had for ſome time promiſed me to get;
And that I knew 'twas his Negligence, and not the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
his Pleaſure, that I had not a Warrant immediately, for
ſuch <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> as I delivered to him.</hi> The Coxſwain I may
believe, made the moſt he cou'd of my Meſſage to him,
And the next time I ſaw Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> he was angry
with me, and ſaid <hi>he could not have any thing he wanted
from the Store-Houſe, without the Trouble of a Warrant, but
yet the other Officers and my ſelf had;</hi> I deſired him <hi>not
to impute any ſuch Fault to my Diſreſpect towards himſelf, for
that I never refuſed to deliver any thing to his Coxſwain or
Groom, till I ſaw they took Stores out of the Store-Houſe, and
never told him nor his Clerk any thing of them.</hi> But when
ever Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> ſpoke to me of any thing that he
thought a Fault, either h<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Paſſion or his Prejudice was
ſo very prevalent, that he took no notice of what I
ſaid, but expected I ſhou'd obey his Arbitrary Commands
in all things; let their Conſequences be never ſo fatal to
my Country or my ſelf.</p>
               <p>I am next to inſert the Copy of another Complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me to the Navy-Board, and to <hi>William Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Eſq. Secretary to the Admiralty, Dated <hi>26th</hi> of
<hi>June,</hi> 1696. With my Anſwer to the ſeveral Crimes
charged on me therein, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <head>The Complaint.</head>
               <p>Laſt Night our Store-keeper brought three Cart Loads of
old Timber to the Dock, which had lain for ſome time in the
Store-Houſe at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and two Loads of it being carried
to his Houſe for the Fire, as the third Load was coming up
I met with it, ordered him to lay it down in the Yard, that
the Maſter Ship-wright might Survey it, and Judge of its
Quality; but notwithſtanding this, I no ſooner turned my
back, but it was carryed away. The next time I ſaw him, I
asked his reaſon for doing it, he told me that it was his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite;
and I believe there moght be a greater quantity than
what I ſaw, ſome of it I am ſure, was fit to be uſed on his
Majeſty's Service for Poſts and the like; and if ſuch Perqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites
be allowed, I am ſure it is a Diſſervice to his Majeſty,
For the worſt of it would have made good Fuel for heating the
Pitch-Kettle, and burning Plank, VVe being forced to buy for
that Service ſometimes.</p>
               <p>Once being at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> I met with a conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the Kings Junck at that place, into which after I
had enquired, I was told it was iſſued out of his Majeſty's
Stores to make Twice-laid Stuff, But it was without my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
And I believe if it had been met with, it had been a
good Serizure. It is my Belief and Opinion, that neither that
nor Canvas ought to be iſſued out of the Yard without my
knowledge.</p>

               <head>The Anſwer.</head>
               <p>Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> upon his meeting the third Turn of Wood,
ordered the Carter to call me to him; and being in the Yard
with two or three of the Officers, when the Carter came to
tell me thereof, I quickly left them; and in going to wait on
Captain <hi>St. Lo,</hi> I met the Carter ſtanding ſtill by his Cart,
and asked him where the Commiſſioner was, he told me at my
back Yard a looking upon the Wood; then I ordered him to
carry the third Turn thither that he might ſee it; Bue when
I came home, Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> was gone, ſo I went inſtantly to
ſeek him, and found him at his own Houſe with Captain
<hi>Beaumont,</hi> Commander of the <hi>Mountague,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>
his own Clerk, I told Captain <hi>St. Lo,</hi> I deſired to know
his Pleaſure with me, Whereupon he was angry with me before
them for taking the Wood, and ſaid it might ſerve for many
Uſes in the Yard, which Opinion I endeavoured to remove, but
he laying his Commands upon me, for bringing all the Wood
back into the Yard, for the Maſter Ship-wright to Survey it,
and (after all my Perſwaſions) perſiſting therein, I parted
from him with intention of obeying them; But it being then
half an hour paſt 7 a Clock, I found the Carter was gone
home; And the next Day was Faſt-Day, and no body Worked.
Theſe reaſons I acquainted Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> with on the Faſt-Day,
(ſeveral hours before he made his Cmplaint) and that
very Morning by 9 a Clock, the Maſter Ship-wright and
Clerk of the Survey came to my Houſe to Survey the Wood, and
their Report of it to Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> himſelf and me too was
that they had Surveyed it according to his Order, and that
'twas ſuch Old rotten Wreck Wood, as it wou'd not ſerve for
any uſe in the Yard, and that it was worth but three ſhillings
of their Money, and not above five ſhillings of any other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
it having lain ſo long in the Water; Their Report of the
Wood made me conclude, that I had not committed any Fault
at all; I deſired Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> over and over, not to ma<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
any Complaint againſt me, and did tell him I confeſs chat I
had been at a great Trouble, and ſome Charge, in Removing
all his Majeſties from <hi>Plymouth</hi> to the Dock, and becauſe the
Wreck-Wood hnd lain 7 or 8 Years under the Stores, and was not
Charged on me in any of our Surveys, (it being none of the
Kings) I further ſaid, that it did belong to me by Virtue of
my Warrant, as a Perquiſite for Fuel only.</p>
               <p>I did indeed, as the Service required, By Order and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
from the Maſter, Attendant, and Clerk of the Survey
only, Iſſue Canvas to make Sails, and Junck to make twice laid
Stuff, Purſuant to my Inſtructions from the Navy-Board, which
was carryed out of the Yard from time to time to be wrought
up, according to the Practice of all the other Yards, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuldrly
<hi>Plymouth</hi> Yard, before I went thither; But had
Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> given me any Directions for altering my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
in ſuch Caſes, or acquainted me with his Diſlike there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I ſhould have Complyed with them, or at leaſt endervoured
to have given him due ſatisfaction therein.</p>
               <p>I ſtill believe that Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> his conſtant Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling
with me and my Buſineſs on ſuch Vicious
Terms, was utterly inconſiſtent with the Juſtice and
Freedom of the preſent Government, Whoſe Laws, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
(to my knowledge) never Diſobeyed, I doubt
not, but (by the Juſtice of your Honourable Houſe)
they will Intitle me to the Rights and Priviledges of an
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99087:3"/>
                  <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, Though they have been Invaded, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, by Captain <hi>St. Lo,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bridgeman,</hi> which
Charge it behoves me to prove directly upon them both.
For, that I may thereby Diſcover to what ill Purpoſes,
their Power, their Wit, and their Subtilty, have been
made Uſe of, in Carrying on their Perſecution of me; and
to make it appear, that Captain <hi>St Lo</hi> had not taken an
Antipathy againſt me alone; I ſhall give a hint of his
many Strange Complaints againſt the Other Yard-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
during my time and ſince.</p>
               <p>Upon the Faith of a Chriſtian I affirm, that Captain
<hi>St. Lo</hi> his ſeveral Accuſations againſt me, are Meer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
and Contrivances, only. I did Order <hi>Three
Turns of Old Wood to be Carryed to my Houſe for the Fire,</hi> But
not in a Surreptious manner, and he wronged me very
much, <hi>in Suggeſting any Diſobedience to his Command, of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the third Lead of Wood down in the Yard, by ordering it
to be Carryed to my Houſe, when his Back was turned;</hi> For he
had not then ſeen me ſince his meeting with it coming
up thither, neither did I know his Pleaſure therein, till
all the Wood was really laid down at my Houſe, (as
my Anſwer to this very Accuſation does particularly
Explain) It's true indeed, I did tell him that <hi>the Old
Rotten Wreck Wood was my Perquiſite,</hi> Which in <hi>his</hi> Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Mr. <hi>Bridgeman</hi>'s, was a moſt unpardonable Fault,
Nevertheleſs, if I can't ſufficiently prove it to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
that my Claim was Juſt and Legal, I'll publickly
own my ſelf a Fool (for their Satisfaction) and Thank
Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> for his great Care and Pains, in giving me
this preſſing Occaſion to Publiſh my Folly; But to give
ſome ground for my Preſumption, that I may not be in
the Wrong, of all the Complaints that ever Captain <hi>St.
Lo</hi> made againſt the Dock-Officers under him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to make them out, he was never known upon
Examination to be in the Right: And further, ſurely
the Inditing of this Complaint was a Fancy more pleaſing
to <hi>him</hi> than ordinary, that he cou'd ſtay at home from
Morning till Iwening, to Contrive me Trouble, And
wilfully Neglect the Serving Almighty God in Publick,
with Faſting and Prayer, in Diſobedience to the poſitive
Order of the Day; As may partly be proved by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
of their Excellencies the Lords Juſtices for a
General Faſt, Dated the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1696. However,
that nothing may be wanting in me to do Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi>
Right, I muſt own I have been told, <hi>he was ſo Generous
in the Poſtſcript of his Complaint againſt me to Mr.</hi> Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<hi>as to leave the Matter wholly to his Diſcretion, whether
to take any Notice of it or not.</hi> No Gentleman hitherto,
wou'd ſide with Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> in his Erroneous Notions
againſt me; but purpoſely Directing this laſt Complaint
of me to Mr. <hi>Bridgeman</hi> in particular, he joyned with
him very readily in it, without knowing any thing of
my Defence, tho' altogether a Stranger to me; But his
Remiſſneſs in Publick Buſineſs, has ſince Evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to my Country's Loſs, (as may be ſeen in the
Votes of your Honourable Houſe, Dated in 96 or 97.
By whoſe timely Aſſiſtance, I was immediately ordered
to be Diſmiſſed my Stock-keepers Employment, without
the Navy-Boards Concurrence, (who were my Maſters)
and on the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> 1696. he ſent his Friend Captain
<hi>St. Lo</hi> a Letter, for no other Buſineſs but only to adviſe

                     </gap> quick Succeſs of his Complaint againſt me,</hi> which
ſo Elevated Captain <hi>St. Lo,</hi> that ſeveral of his Friends
and Relations were troubled at it, particularly Mr. <hi>John
Addis,</hi> diſcourſed him in theſe words. Sir, <hi>I am come from</hi>
Plymouth, <hi>and if you was but there, to hear how the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
cry out upon you, for what you have done to Mr.</hi>
Gaſelee, <hi>you would be aſhamed of your ſelf. Captain</hi> St Lo
Anſwered, <hi>I do not care what any body ſays of me, for I
am Reſolved not to ſee the King Cheated by the Officers of the
Navy, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> my ſelf Diſreſpected.</hi> Then Mr. <hi>Addis</hi> told him,
<hi>if you continue this Temper Sir, People will be afraid to ſpeak
to you in a little time, And, that no one bore him a greater
Reſpect than my ſelf; withal, I am much concerred that your
Reputation ſhould ſuffer in Changeing Mr.</hi> Gaſelee <hi>with ſuch
odd Accuſations as you did; Therefore I deſire you Sir, by all
Means, immediately to acquaint: Mr.</hi> Bridgeman, <hi>that you
did not th<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nk to have Mr.</hi> Gaſelee <hi>turned off his Employment
upon your Complaint, but only Reprimanded; And to deſire of
Mr.</hi> Bridgeman, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Gaſelee <hi>might be Reſtored to it
again:</hi> Theſe Arguments of Mr. <hi>Addis</hi>'s ſo touch'd
Captain <hi>St Lo.</hi> that he thereupon came to himſelf, and
wrote to Mr. <hi>Bridgeman, juſt as Mr.</hi> Addis <hi>had Dictated
to him.</hi> But that Letter Mr. <hi>Bridgeman</hi> never anſwered,
Whoſe Remarkable Silence, and Former Forwardneſs (to
do me wrong) moved Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> to <hi>Write</hi> ſeveral
Letters afterwards in my Favour, both to the ſaid Mr.
<hi>Bridgeman,</hi> and the <hi>Navy-Board.</hi> And now I ſhou'd be
very Ungrateful, if I did not Acknowledge that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-Board,
Sir <hi>Edward Gregory,</hi> and Captain <hi>Greenhill</hi> (the
Commiſſioners of his Majeſty's Yards for <hi>Chatham</hi> and
<hi>Portſmouth)</hi> have ſince done me very many kindneſſes;
But for Mr. <hi>Bridgeman,</hi> his unalterable Prejudice againſt
me, has cunningly cauſed me much more Miſchief, than
all my Friends have been able to do me Good.</p>
               <p>I have mentioned all the Favours that ever Captain <hi>St.
Lo</hi> conferr'd upon me, and they indeed (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his repeated Injuries to me, and the very great Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
Occaſioned me by them) wou'd ſtill have required
my heartieſt Acknowledgments, had he not Retracted
them in a very ſhort time; Which is another Point
ought to be Demonſtrated. Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> his Writing
thus for me and againſt me, did conſequently cauſe ſome
Reflections upon me. And to Salve them, 'twas expected,
<hi>I ſhould confeſs my ſelf Guilty of ſome Faults,</hi> (which God
knows) <hi>I never thought of.</hi> An Expedient I cou'd not in
Conſcience yield to, Wherefore I did not only undergo the
Grievous Effects of his further Diſpleaſure, but was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly
Characterized by him to my Superiours, <hi>for an
obſtinate Fool,</hi> As if his Taking away my Livelihood, had
been too ſmall a Puniſhment for me, and his ſingle
Evidence of my want of Wit, could juſtifie him
in acting unjuſtly by me. And after in his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away of my Good Name too, Whereas others
have ſince taken me <hi>for a Good Natured Fool.</hi> Moreover,
to aggravate my Misfortune, I continued under Captain
<hi>St Lo</hi> his Command 3 Months after I was ordered to be
Diſmiſs'd my Employment, to hear my ſelf daily Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>with Falſe, and Imaginary Faults,</hi> out of a Politick
Deſign, to Countenance Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> his Artificial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
againſt me to Mr. <hi>Bridgeman,</hi> and their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
Tranſactions concerning it. I'll cite but another
Inſtance, to prove how unadviſedly Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> acted
in his Station (with Reſpect to the Publick's Intereſt)
wherein I was particularly Concerned, and beg Pardon
for my Tediouſneſs. About the latter end of <hi>July,</hi> 1696.
Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> made a Contract with Mr. <hi>John Neele</hi> a
Merchant of <hi>Plymouth, to ſerve a quantity of Maſts into
the Kings Stores there;</hi> and before the Contract was
Entred, or any Officer ſaw it, he ſignified his Anger at a
diſtance, <hi>For our not having yet been at</hi> Plymouth <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
thoſe Maſts,</hi> and the Clark of the Survey came to my
Office to acquaint me <hi>therewith;</hi> preſently after I met
Captain <hi>St. Lo, and told him I did not underſtand his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
about Receiving the Maſts on Mr.</hi> Neale<hi>'s his Contract
at</hi> Plymouth, <hi>for all the Kings Stores were removed from
thence;</hi> Whereupon Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> pulled off his Hat ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
low to me, and bare-headed in the open Yard before
Captain <hi>Bridge,</hi> and Boat-ſwain <hi>Browne</hi> told me, <hi>what
muſt he come and ask leave how he ſhould make a Contract,</hi> I
anſwered him, <hi>No Sir, and that I thought an Officer might
ask him a Queſtion, relating to the Duty of his Employment,
and the Kings Intereſt, without any Offence;</hi> he did me <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Contract,</hi> and that was all the Satisfaction I could
get of him.</p>
               <p>In a word, to Sum up the Premiſes, I not only endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
all I could for fourteen Months together, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on my Buſineſs to Captain <hi>St. Lo</hi> his Satisfaction,
(without Betraying my Truſt, or Divulging his Errors)
but on all Occaſions, gave him the Reſpect that was due
to a Superiour Officer; Yet after my going through a
conſtant Fatigue of Buſineſs at the Admiralty Office, at
<hi>Plymouth,</hi> and at the New Dock-Yard from the <hi>18th</hi> of
<hi>March,</hi> 1688. the <hi>1ſt</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1696. (beſides ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
above 8 years and a half in thr Navy as a Clerk
in <hi>Deptford</hi> Yard) I palpably loſt my Store-keepers
Employment moſt Ignominouſly, to Gratifie the ſaid
