         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

signifie Loue, is, for that this Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is the hardest to be hid: For the
more a man seekes to couer it, the
more it discouers it selfe, and blabbs
the place, where it is. Of this quality
is Loue, and truly participateth of the nature of fire.
I came (saith our Sauiour Christ) to put fire into the
world. And the holy Ghost, which is the true God of
Loue, came and shewed it selfe in the shape and figure
of fire. So that Loue is a kinde of extraordinary actiue
fire. Nor can it, where soeuer it be, be hid, or idle. <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur

action, alwayes in working; it worketh by benefits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it
<pb facs="tcp:2459:5"/>
worketh by good workes, and by friendly offices, and
charitable seruices: And when it cannot worke what it
would, or when the subiect whereon it would worke,
hath no need thereof, it supplyeth that defect with good
desires, and words. God, who needeth not the seruice of
any, contents himselfe with this in those that are his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
accepting (when they can no more) the will, for
the deed. And the Kings, which here vpon earth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
his person, doe not require tribute and seruice,
saue onely in that, which euery one is able to giue. That
which I am able to affoord, and doe here offer vnto your
Maiestie, forced thereunto by the loue of my seruice,
(howbeit my desire hath euermore had a larger extent)
is onely a parcell of words; which if they proceed from
the soule, and come truly and sincerely from the heart,
are of some worth and estimation, and perhaps (vpon
occasion) may proue likewise profitable and aduantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Howsoeuer, it may serue at least to expresse that
my seruice and deuotion, which euer hath beene, is, and
shall be ready prest to serue your Maiestie. And I am
willing to shew it in this little, that I may not wholly
seeme vnprofitable. And therefore with this affection
of Loue, sutable to my subiect, ouercomming those feares
which are wont (and not without reason) to withhold
those that treate with great Kings, Princes, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narckes,
and write of such and the like subiects, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume

as also for the greatnesse of your Maiesties employments,
and the great burthen of so many weighty businesses that
lye vpon you, I will not here interpose any large dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
and long disputations, wherewith to entertaine
and spend the time: but briefe, certaine, and generall
Doctrines, such as are of most profit, comprehend most
subiects, and may be applyed to particular, both persons
and things, all taken out of the Politicks, the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and men that are Statists, and no way contrary to
the Law of God, and Christian Religion: As likewise
out of ancient Philosophers, and wise men, both
Lawyers and Law-makers. Accompanied wholly for

not be disesteemed as an egge of mine owne hatching) with
the examples of Kings and Emperours, (if the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Kings may moue Kings) and with those which
cannot but moue, bee esteemed, and beleeued, being
drawne out of the holy Scripture. Which being well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
and put in execution by Kings, they shall obtaine
that end for which they were intended; To wit, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and preserue their Kingdomes in peace and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>
            <p>Reade it therefore, I beseech your Maiestie, and take
it to heart; for it is a piece of worke that is directed
to the seruice of Kings, of their Fauourites and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
And let them not say, that they are Metaphysicall,
and impracticable things, or, in a manner, meere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilites,
but rather, that they are very conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to our possibilitie, and practised by our Predecessors,
Princes of famous memory, for their wisedome and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and in Kingdomes and Common-wealths, of
great Concernment, Artifice, and Policie, in matter of
Gouernement, and reason of State. And viewing those
with these times, and that which then was, with that
which now is, it will appeare vnto vs, that your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Princes doe not come much behinde their good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours:
And that which is good, stands alwayes in a
way or degree of ablenesse to become better: and that
which is not so, may be bettered in the end. Time is a
great proficient, it attaineth to all, and can doe all. And
<pb facs="tcp:2459:6"/>
your Maiestie (whom God preserue) may likewise in time
doe the like, if you will really and resolutely affect the
same; and that you will be pleased to put in execution,
what in these Aduertisements shall seeme good in your
eyes. And seeme they, or not seeme they good vnto you,
sure I am, that my desire, in these, in the rest, and in all,
shall indeuour to hit the marke whereat it aymeth. God
direct it as I desire. For mine owne part, I rest well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with my paines, and hold my selfe well paid for
my labour, in hauing put them into your Maiesties hands.
And that you shall vouchsafe to dwell a little vpon them.
For matters of State, Iustice, and Gouernment, and of
things of this high nature, is a King-craft, and a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or science that deserues your care and discourse.
Let others doe as they list; particular men may follow
their particular pleasures and delights. But this well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth

            <p>The Argument of this Booke, is the Head of Mans
body; beginning at the vnderstanding, till we come to
the last of the senses. For therein, and thence they haue
the <hi>principium</hi> or beginning of their operations. And
as in mans body, so in the mysticall body of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
Kings are the Head, to whom Regiment &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
belongs; and what choyce they are to make of
those who are to assist them therein; the qualities which
they ought to haue, and how they should carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
towards them. How they shall come to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer

the humours, affections, mindes, and dispositions of

they finde to bee amisse. This I am bold to vtter vnto
your Maiestie, and dedicate the same with that securitie
and confidence, which mine owne knowledge doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and prompt vnto mee; being not ignorant, that I
talke and discourse with mine owne proper King and
Lord, whom I humbly beseech, that hee will bee pleased,
out of his great prudence and naturall pietie, to runne
all this ouer with his eye, and to cast his cloake ouer my
faults. And though (no doubt) his Maiestie may meete
with some, yet my minde telleth me, that he may likewise
light vpon something in this Treatise, that may be of some
profit for the seruice of his Maiestie, and for the conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of that authoritie and greatnesse of place (which
he so iustly possesseth, and for the good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
For, there is not that Booke saith <hi>Seneca)</hi> so
vnprofitable, whence some good may not bee gathered.
And though this in supposall, or it's owne nature) may
<pb facs="tcp:2459:7"/>
be small, and of little or no price, yet is it of no lesse no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and royall a condition, to receiue a little louingly, and
with a gratious acceptance, then to giue much liberally.
All this your Maiestie doth with all, and I assure my selfe
you will likewise doe the like with me. For the naturall
Loue which I beare vnto your Maiestie, meriteth no
lesse, nor the minde wherewithall I doe it. And
herewith I shall in some sort satisfie my desire (which is
to hit the marke I ayme at) and that obligation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I was borne to serue you, whom I shall neuer wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
offend. And euermore, in all my prayers, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
I shall humbly on my knees beseech the Almighty
God, to preserue your Maiestie, to giue you many, and
those most happie yeares, and that hee will conserue you
in his diuine grace, and humane Greatnesse, with much
augmentation of Estate, both Temporall and Eternall.
Amen.</p>

turnes to a Tyrannie. For (as <hi>Mecoenas</hi> saith.) The state of a
few Lords, is the state of a few Tyrants. And he that is the
most powerfull, the most ambitious, and best befriended, and
respected of the people, vpon the least dissension, ioynes with
the multitude, which being it is naturally enuious, mutable
and a friend to innouation, will with a great deale of facilitie
ouerthrow the Common-wealth. And say; the Nobles do not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2459:11"/>
side, but agree amongst themselues, yet cannot they but liue in
feare of the infidelitie of the Vulgar; for ordinarily, those that
haue a hand in the gouernment, are more enuied, then those
that haue none at al. Besides, it is a weake kind of gouernment,
nor is it possible, that these few Lords, can in large, conquer, &amp;
conserue a great Empire, as can a King, or a Monarke, because
the forces are lesse vnited in them, then in him. And the people
which is little interessed, &amp; hath no share or part in those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
places, carry a Capital hatred to your great persons,
and are hardly drawn to such liberall Contributions, as may
sustaine a War, and subdue kingdomes. Your popular Estate
in falling from that equality, which it pretendeth, is easily con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerted
into a licentious libertie, or rather loosenesse, pulling
down some, &amp; setting vp others, and is much subiect to Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
through it's inconstancie, &amp; weake head-pieces of the
Popular. For (as <hi>Tully</hi> saith) the sea hath not so many stormes,
perills, &amp; tempestes, as hath this kind of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth. And
of force (euery one attending his owne proper good and
priuate interest) it must runne vpon one of these two rockes:
Either on the Tyrannie of him, that is the strongest, and, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
by the fauour of the Maior part, liftes vp himselfe aboue
them all: Or on the <hi>Plebeian</hi> gouernment, then which none
can be worse; for all then falls into the hands of ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who put ordinary people into the highest places of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and command, without any distinction or reckoning of
rich, noble, wise, or vertuous. What good Counsaile, or sound
Aduise can all the Communaltie giue (put all their braines
together) in a doubtfull case,<note place="margin">Eccl. 7. 27.</note> or businesse of importance, when
(as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith) there is scarce one to be found of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
of abilitie and sufficiencie in this kinde? But put case that
such a one may happily be found amongst them, how shall
he be heard with silence. What patience will their eares lend
him? What secrecie will be had in that which is treated, be
it of Peace, or War, that it be not divulged before it's due
execution? your Tumultes and seditions, shall be more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2459:12"/>
and greater then in other states; because your meaner
sorte of people, are gouerned more by their owne vnruly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
and womanish longings, then by reason and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And your base and cruell Vulgar, which vpon the least
occasion suffers it selfe to be led away by hatred, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
presently falls to taking of stones in their hands, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
vp the pibbles in the streetes, as <hi>Cicero</hi> sets downe vnto
vs, that in the popular assemblies of Rome, it so fell out, that
oftentimes they drew their naked swordes, &amp; that the stones
were seene to flye about their eares on all sides. And when
this head strong multitude hath once broken the reines,
there is no keeping of them in, nor can the wit of man deuise
how to bridle them. In a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> the Monarke; In an
<hi>Aristocratia,</hi> your Noble men are supreme Iudges, and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators,
and by this their supreme and absolute power, they
many times compose the differences of the subiects. But in a
<hi>Democratia</hi> and Popular Estate, they are the supreme power,
and they themselues bandy one against another, the fire of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
setting them in a consuming flame, without acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
any superiour, to decide the quarrell, and compose
their differences. And therefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayd; That there
was not any Tyrannie either greater or more pernicious,
then that of an intire Communaltie, which, of it selfe, is incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to crueltie. The <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or Kingdome is freer from
these burning feuers, and by all is ranked in the best place,
and is stiffely maintained by the grauest Authors. Of this
onely shall I treate at this present. It is called a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> of

                  </gap>, which
is the same with Prince, which is as if we should say a
Principalitie, or a Kingdome; where one alone is hee that
commands and gouernes, and the rest all obey. All these
three kindes, of Popular, Aristocraticall, and Monarchicall
gouernments were vsed in <hi>Greece,</hi> and more particularly in
<hi>Rome.</hi> But <hi>Rome</hi> neuer came to be Mistresse of the World,
till shee was reduced to a <hi>Monarchie</hi> in the time of <hi>Caesar
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2459:12"/>
Augustus.</hi> There are found therein 8. differences of States:
Husbandmen, Trades-men, Merchants, Souldiers, Iudges
Cleargie-men, the Nobility, and the King, which (to speake
more properly, and, as in diuers places it is deliuered by the
blessed Apostle S. <hi>Paul)</hi> is a Misticall Body, which we call a
Kingdome with it's Head. For a king, is the supreme Lord,
subiect onely vnto God.</p>
               <p>That in S. <hi>Augustines,</hi>

sundry other Authors of diuers faculties,<note place="margin">D. Tho. de regim. li. 1. cap. 2.</note> amongst which are
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Plato;</hi> the most excellent gouernment, is that,
which acknowledgeth a Superior,<note place="margin">Arist. Pol. 3. cap. 5. &amp; 10.</note> one King, and one Head.
For all naturall,<note place="margin">Plat. Dial. de repub.</note> and good gouernment proceedeth from
One, and that which comes neerest vnto Vnitie, hath most
similitude,<note place="margin">Prou. 8. 15.</note> with that which is diuine, and is by much the
most perfect. By God, Kings reigne, according to that of the
wise man. <hi>Per me, reges regnant; Per me, Principes imperant.
By me Kings reigne, and Princes decree iustice.</hi> And God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one, and most simple in his Being; and Nature the Head
of all the whole Vniuerse; by Whom, and Which all is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
with admirable and ineffable prouidence, and is the
Idea of all good and perfect gouernment, it is not a thing to
be doubted, but that that shall be amongst vs the best, which
is most agreeable, with his. And if the Members of the body,
being many, and bearing different Offices therein, admit to
be gouerned by a Head, and that God and Nature, hath so
ordained it, <hi>Why should not a Monarchicall gouernment be
the best? Most certaine therefore is it, that it is mainely to
be preferred before the other two. Some will haue this Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall</hi>
gouernment to be the most ancient, and that it had it's
beginning from <hi>Cain, Adams</hi> eldest sonne, who was the
first, that did gather people together, built Cities, and did
shut them vp, and fortifie them with walls. After the stood,
<hi>Nimrod,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Beros lib. 4. de Flor. Cald. secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Philon. de Antiq.</note> the sonne of <hi>Chus,</hi> and nephew vnto <hi>Cham,</hi> a man of
valour, and amongst those of those times, the most able, and
strongest man, was the first, that reduced men to liue in a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2459:13"/>
Communitie, and to be obedient to one only King, possessing
himselfe of the Kingdome and Signorie of the World. And
before these, euen in the very beginning of the Creation,
God began to establish this gouernment, &amp; forme of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.<note place="margin">Act. 17. 26.</note>
For (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith) God would, that all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
should descend from one Man. And Gods chosen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
did euermore maintaine a Monarchie, and did ordaine, that
the Supreme power should reside and remaine in One. The
first gouernours of the world, were Monarkes, &amp; did gouerne
with this Title, &amp; all the Common-wealthes of the World,
haue generally desired to be gouerned by one king. As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by those of the Gentiles, euery particular state hauing
his peculiar King. And were it not a great monstrousnesse in
nature, that one body, should haue two Heads? Much more
were it, that one kingdome should be gouerned by two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
Vnitie is the Author of much good; and Pluralitie, the
causer of much ill. The <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth did suffer
much miserie and calamitie, not because all would not obey
One, but because many would command All. And therforein
their greater necessities, they did create a <hi>Dictator,</hi> so called
because all did obay whatsoeuer he dictated, and sayd vnto
them. For they knew well enough, and did clearely and
plainely perceiue, That in the Empire of One, the authoritie
was the greater; greater the obedience, freer their determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
firmer their Councells, speedier their resolutions, and
more prompt the execution of their designes. In a word,
Command, Signorie, and Supreme power, does better in one
head then in many. And therefore all doe vnanimously and
vndoubtedly conclude, That the Monarchie, is the ancientst,
and the durablest of all other; and it's gouernment the best:
yet, would I haue it to helpe it selfe with the <hi>Aristocratia</hi> in
that which may be vsefull for it's aduantage. That in regard
of it's strength, and execution, doth by it's greater. Vnion, and
force excell the rest: This other which is composed of a
few noble, wise, and vertuous persons, because it consistes of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2459:13"/>
more, hath the more intirenesse, prudence, and wisedome; and
by conioyning and intermixing the one with the other, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulteth
a perfect &amp; absolute gouernment. So that a <hi>Monarchy,</hi>
that it may not degenerate, must not goe loose, and absolute
(for Command, is a madd-man; and power <hi>Lunaticke)</hi> but
must be tyed to the <hi>Lawes,</hi> as far forth as it is comprehended
vnder the Law; And in things particular and temporall, must
haue reference to the body of the Councell, seruing as the
brace, or ioyning peece of timber, betweene a Monarchie, &amp;
an Aristocracie, which is the assistance and aduise of the
chiefer, and wiser sort. For, from a Monarchy not thus well
and orderly tempred, arise great errours in gouernment, little
satisfaction to the State, and many distastes amongst those
that are gouerned. All men, that haue had the estimation of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound iudgements, and accounted wise in all kind of faculties
haue held this to be the best and perfectest gouernment, and
with out it, neuer Citie nor kingdome hath beene taken to
be well gouerned. Your good Kings and great Gouernours
haue euer fauoured this Course; whereas on the contrarie,
your bad kings, and euill Gouernours, transported with their
pride, haue runne another way. And therefore, in conformitie
heereunto, I dare confidently affirme, if a Monarke, (be hee
what he will be) shall resolue businesses alone on his own head
(how wise soeuer he thinke himself) without hauing recourse
to his Councell, or against the opinion of his Counsellours,
(although he do <hi>Acertar</hi> and hit right in his resolutions) yet
therein he breakes the bounds of a Monarchie, and enters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those of a Tyranny Of whose Examples, and the euill suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
insuing thereupon, the Histories are full. But one shall
serue instead of many. And that shall be of <hi>Tarquinius Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Liv. lib. 1.</note>
taken out of the first Booke of <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> who out
of his great pride, and haughtinesse of minde, that he might
rule all himselfe, and haue none else to haue a hand in any
businesse, made it his Master peece, to weaken the authority
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate in lessening the number of Senatours.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2459:14"/>
Which he purposely did, that he wholy and solely by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
might determine all whatsoeuer that occurred in the
kingdome. In this Monarchie, or Kingdome, there are three
parts, or parties to be considered, of whom principally we
are to treate. The King, The Ministers, and the Vassalls.
And if in a humane body, the Anatomie &amp; consideration of
the Head, be the nicest, subtillest, and most difficult, what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie
will it not be, and what a daintie hand will it not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
to touch, talke, and treate of a king, who is the head of
the Commonwealth? And hence I inferre, that for to treate
of Kings, and to prescribe them Precepts and Documents
touching a Kingdome, he ought to be such a wise King, as
was <hi>Salomon.</hi> Who, considering the difficulties and dangers,
which may in this matter offer themselues, aduiseth all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any difference, that they should not seeme to be desirous
to seeme wise before their Temporall kings. For no man,
howsoeuer fulfill'd with wisedome, is (speaking in his kings

Temporall power, whom all acknowledge and obey as their
Superiour, risenteth it much, to see himselfe inferiour in a
thing of so greate esteeme, as is wisedome and discretion.
<hi>Xenophon,</hi> laying his foundation on this opinion, introduceth
<hi>Cambises,</hi> instructing his sonne <hi>Cyrus,</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> how he
ought to carry himself in his Kingdome. As also <hi>Alexander,</hi>
who receiued his Militarie Precepts from his father <hi>Philip</hi>
and not from any other that was inferiour vnto him. It is
written of <hi>Agasicles,</hi> king of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to learne Philosophie of a famous Philosopher of those
times; it seeming vnto him, that being a king, it was not
fitting, he should be his Scholler, whose sonne he was not.
As if he should haue sayd; That he, onely by a naturall obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
acknowledged him alone, and that he contented
himselfe with that which he had learned from him, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2459:14"/>
would not acknowledge any other inferiour vnto him in
birth, though neuer so much before him in learning and
knowledge. But this difficulty I purpose to ouercome by
proposing, in this my Treatise, vnto kings, not mine owne
Reasons, nor those, which I might draw from great Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and humane Histories, but from the words of God,
and of his Saints, and from Histories Diuine and Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
whose Instructions kings may not disdaine, nor take it
as an affront to submit themselues thereunto, be they (being
Christians) neuer so powerfull, neuer so supreme; because the
Author that dictates these Lessons vnto them, is the Holy-Ghost.
And if I shall at any time alleage the Examples of
heathen Kings, and shall make some good benefit of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie,
and serue my selfe with the sentences of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
that were strangers vnto Gods people, it shall be very
sparingly, and as it comes in my way, and as one that ceazeth
vpon his owne goods (if he fortune to light vpon them) and
taketh them from those that vniustly detaine and possesse
them.</p>

armes, and carry them in his bosome, and shall guide them
with young. He shall perfectly performe all the Offices of
a shepheard by feeding of his sheepe, and by bearing them
(if neede be) vpon his shoulders. And of the selfe same
King,<note place="margin">Ezech. 34<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 23.</note> Christ, God said in respect of his people; <hi>Ipse pisect

My seruant <hi>Dauid</hi> shall bee the Prince amongst them, and

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2459:16"/>
willed him, that he should send for him; for we will not sit
downe, till he be come hither; shewing, that to be a shepheard
and to feed the flock, was the best Symbole, and most proper
Embleme of a King. And therfore I would haue no man to
imagine that which <hi>Philon</hi> did feare, that when we come to
make a King, we must take away the Crooke, and put the
Scepter in his hand. The Office of a King I tell you, and the
Arte of ruling, will require a great deale of study, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
For to gouerne the bigger sort of beastes, and those that
are of greatest price, a man must first haue learned to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aue gouerned the lesser. It is not meete, to Popp into great
places vnexperienced persons, and such as know not what
belongs vnto businesse, nor the weight of the charge that
they are to take vpon them. For indeede, great Matters are
not handsomely carryed, nor well managed, but by such as
haue beene formerly imployed in businesses of an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and lower nature. And this choyse, which God made
of <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De post foetanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus accepit eum, pascere Iacob Servum suum &amp; Israel haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatem suam.</note> iumpes with this our intent. He doth not say, that
he tooke him on the sodaine from the sheepefold, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
clapp't a Crowne vpon his Head; but first bred him
vp to feede the house of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and his family, and that he
should exercise himselfe therein. For a well ordered house,
and a family that is well gouerned, is the Modell and Image
of a Common-wealth; And domesticall authoritie, resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
Regall power. And the good guidance of a particular
house, is the Exemplary and true patterne of a publicke
State. It imbraceth and comprehendeth in it all the sorts
of good gouernment. It doth treate and set in order those
things, that appertaine to Policie, Conseruation, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Men, as well in regard of Commanding, as obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
What other thing is a house with his family, but a little
Citie. And what a Citie, but a great House? Many houses,
make a Citie; And many Cities, make a kingdome. And in
point of gouernment, ihey onely d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffer in greatnesse, for
howbeit in the one, they are busied more, and in the other
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2459:17"/>
lesse, yet they tend all to one end, which is the common
good. And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> and other Saints, and wise men
are of opinion, that hee that knowes not how to gouerne
his own house well, will hardly gouerne another mans. The
Emperour <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> visiting the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate,
did inquire, how the Senators did rule and gouerne their
owne priuate Houses, and families, and sayd; That that
man, who knew not how to command his wife, and his
Children, to follow his owne businesses, to make prouision
for his house, and to gouerne his familie, it were a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to recommend vnto that man the gouernment of the
Common-wealth. Amongst those the famous Gouernours,
<hi>Cato</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> was preferred before <hi>Aristides,</hi> the
<hi>Grecian,</hi> because the former was a great <hi>Pater familias,</hi> or
father of a familie, and the latter was noted to be defectiue
in that kinde. So that the life of a shepheard is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
or Picture of gouernment, as is to be seene by his
assistance in his Office, in the care of the wellfare of his
flocke, in the obligation of the Account that he is to make,
in the offence that he is to finde by Wolues and Theeues,
and in the solicitude and watchfullnesse, which those ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
dangers doe require, wherein his flocke stands, and
more especially when the shepheard is wanting vnto them.
And it is so proper vnto a King to feede his flocke, that
when our Sauiour Christ fed that multitude of people,<note place="margin">Iohn 6. 15.</note>
which followed him in the desert, they no sooner saw that
he had satisfied them, but they were desirous to make
him a King, and to clap the Crowne on his head. And for
this cause in the 3. Chapter of <hi>Esay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esay. 3.</note> he that saw he was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouided
of bread, would not accept the Votes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that were willing to nominate him for their King, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus vnto them: <hi>Non sum medicus, &amp; in domo mea
non est panis, neque vestimentum; nolite constituere me
principem populi.</hi> There is no bread in my house, nor
cloathing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I cannot be an helper vnto yee, therefore make
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2459:17"/>
me no Prince of the people. And therefore with very
good reason, and with a great deale of proprietie, a King
and a Shepheard, is all one.</p>
               <p>In the Greeke tongue a King is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Quasi
basis &amp; fundamentum populi.</hi> As if hee were the basis
and foundation of the people. And of your Kings (sayth
<hi>Rabbi Abraham)</hi> those words are to bee vnderstood of
<hi>Iob, Qui portant orbem;</hi> Who sustaine the weight of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and beare the loade thereof vpon their shoulders.
And a Hierogliffe heereof is the Crowne which they weare
vpon their head in manner of a Citie, circled about with
Townes, and battlements; signifying thereby, that the
strong brayne,<note place="margin">Greg in Iob.</note> and the good and wise head, <hi>and sound
sconce</hi> of a King, doth fortifie and vphold the whole weitht
and burthen of all the Cities of his kingdome. And this
is S. <hi>Gregories</hi> Interpretation vpon of his place. Some others
conceiue that this name was giuen it, in consideration of
that creature called the <hi>Basiliske;</hi> who is the king of the
venomous creatures, and hath this euil qualitie with him, that
he kills with his lookes onely. And doe not the kings some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
kill their fauourites, and those that are neerest about
them, with the knit of the brow, and a sower looke? And
some such Kings there be (or at least haue beene) in the
world, that take it offensiuely, if their frownes and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fauours,
doe not kill like poyson. But this Etymologie hath
little ground for it. For the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which
in that language signifies a king, is much different from
that of <hi>Bisiliscus,</hi> a <hi>Basiliscke.</hi> For it is more proper to
Kings to cure and heale, then to kill, and slay. As the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
place of <hi>Esay</hi> teacheth vs, where he that would not
take the Crowne vpon him, excuses himselfe, not onely
for that he had not bread to feede others, but also because
he was not a Physitian. <hi>Non sum Medicus, &amp; in domo mea
non est panis,</hi> presuposing, that a good King ought to be a
Physitian to his people, and ought to helpe and feede his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2459:18"/>
subiects. And the sayd Prophet, when in the person of
Christ, he relateth, how the eternall Father had annoynted
him, and Crowned him for King, saith, <hi>spiritus domini super
me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esay. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>eò quod vnxerit me &amp; vt mederer contritis corde.</hi> And
Christ himselfe being calumniated by the Pharisees, because
he did conuerse and eat with Publicans, and Sinners, hee
made them this answer.<note place="margin">Mat. 9. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Non est opus valentibus medicus,
sed malè habentibus. They that bee whole, neede not the
Physitian, but they that be sicke. Patricius Senensis,</hi> calls
Kings and Princes, <hi>Medicos vniuersales reip:</hi> Vniuersall
Physitians of the Common-wealth. And S. <hi>Austen</hi> tell vs
that to them appertaineth the remedy of all the sicke, and
the cure of all the diseases, and other those crosse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
humours which reigne in a Kingdome, and to
apply a medicine to euery particular person, agreeable to
that humour, wherein hee is peccant. And the Office of
a shepheard, which is so proper vnto Kings (as already
hath beene said) hath with it this obligation, to cure his
flocke. And therefore in the 34 of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> God doth lay
a heauie Taxe vpon those shepheards, because they were
faulty in this their Office of Curing.<note place="margin">Ezech. 34. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Quod infirmu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fuit, non

haue yee not strengthened, neither haue yee healed that which

neither haue yee brought againe that which was driuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
neither haue yee sought that which was lost; but with
force and with crueltie haue yee ruled them, yee eat the fat,
and yee cloath ye with the Wooll, yee kill them that are fed,
but yee feede not the flocke.</hi> And heere that third signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
sutes well with this name of King: which is the
same as Father.<note place="margin">Gen. 20. Iudg. 8.</note> As appeareth in that of <hi>Genesis,</hi> where the
<hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>chemites</hi> called their King <hi>Abimilech,</hi> which is as much
to say; As my Father, or my Lord; And anciently their Kings
were called <hi>Patres reip:</hi> Fathers of their Common-wealths.
And hence is it, that King <hi>Theodoricus</hi> defining the Maiestie
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2459:18"/>
royall of Kings,<note place="margin">Cassio. lib. 4. epist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 42.</note> (as <hi>Cassiodorus</hi> reporteth it) speakes thus:
<hi>Princeps, est Pastor publicus &amp; Communis.</hi> A King is the
publicke and common shepheard. Nor is a King any other
thing, but the publicke and common Father of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.
And because the Office of a King hath such
similiancie with that of a Father, <hi>Plato</hi> stiles a King <hi>Patrem
familias,</hi> A father of a familie. And <hi>Xenophon</hi> the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
affirmeth: <hi>Bonus Princeps nihil differt à bono patre.</hi>
That a good Prince, differs nothing from a good Father.
The onely difference is in this, That the one hath fewer,
the other more vnder his Empire &amp; Command. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it is most sutable vnto reason, that this Title of Father be
giuen vnto Kings, because they ought to be such towards
their subiects, and kingdomes, carrying a fatherly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and prouidence, towards their wellfare and preseruation.
For reigning,<note place="margin">Homer.</note> or bearing rule (saith <hi>Homer)</hi> is nothing else
but a paternall gouernment, like that of a father ouer his
owne children. <hi>Ipsum nam<expan>
                        <am>

                     </expan> regnum, imperium est suapte
natura paternum.</hi> There is no better habit of gouerning,
then to haue a King cloath himselfe with the loue of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to haue that care of his subiects, as if they were
so many children of his owne loynes. The affection of a
father towards his children, his care that they shall lacke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and to be one and the same towards them all, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
a great proportion with a Kings pietie towards his
subiects. Hee is called a Father, so that the very name,
obligeth him to answer this signification, in workes, not
in word; but to shew himselfe a true father indeed. Againe,
for that this name father is very proper vnto Kings, if wee
shall well and truly weigh it, amongst all other Attributes and
Epithites of Maiestie, and Signorie, it is the greatest, vnder
which all other names are comprehended, as the Species vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their <hi>Genus,</hi> being subordinate thereunto. Father is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the Title of King, Lord, Master, Captaine, and the like.
In a word, it is a name aboue all other names that denotate
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2459:19"/>
Signorie, and prouidence. Antiquitie when it was willing
to throw it's greatest Honour vpon an Emperour, it called
him the Father of the Common-wealth. Which was more
then <hi>Caesar,</hi> or <hi>Augustus,</hi> and whatsoeuer other name most
glorious in the world: whether it were conferr'd vpon them
either for to flatter them, or to oblige them to those great
effects, which this name (Father) tyes them vnto. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
by this word (Father,) it is giuen Kings to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
what they ought to doe. To wit; That they are to
rule gouerne and maintaine their Common-wealths and
Kingdomes in Iustice, and in Peace: That they are to feede,
(like good shepheards) these their rationall sheepe. That
they are (like skilfull Physitians) to heale and cure their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies:
And that they are to haue that care of their subiects,
as fathers haue of their children, watching ouer them with
prudence and with Loue, respecting more them, then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
For Kings, are more obliged to the Kingdome, and
the Common-wealth, then vnto themselues. For, if we shall
but looke into the Originall, and Institution of a King, and
a kingdome, we shall finde, that a King was ordained for
the good of the kingdome, and not the kingdome for the
good of the King.</p>

hard vnto him, to know the Talent, and parts of persons,
for the conferring of Offices and places vpon them; a
businesse, whereon good gouernment mainely dependeth.
Hee likewise found it as difficult, to make good Lawes,
and Statutes. As also, to rule so many Townes, and so many
people, as are listed vnder a Crowne, and name of King:
As likewise to dresse so many dishes for so many different
palates, so many things to the gust and content of so many
sundry wills, and a thousand other difficulties which daily
offer themselues in the ruling and gouerning of men. For

and of so many graue and weightie businesse, and of so

it is an vndoubted truth, that they haue an Office, and of

many sessements, so many Subsedies, so many impositions,
so many great rentes, so much authoritie, so high a Title,
and so great a Dignitie, is not giuen without charge and
trouble. In vaine should they haue the name of Kings, if
they had not whom to rule and gouerne. And therefore
this obligation lyes vpon them. <hi>In multitudine populi, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas

<hi>Cense</hi> and rate vpon his Subiects Lands and Goods, binde
him to rule and gouerne his States, conseruing them by Peace
and Iustice. Let Kings therefore know, that they are to
serue their kingdomes, being they are so well payd for their
paines, and that they beare an Office, which tyes them neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
to this trouble. <hi>Qui praeest in solicitudine,</hi> (saith S.

name of King, and of him that gouernes. Not of him, that
goes before others onely in his Honour, and his pleasure,
but of him that excells others in his solicitude, and his care.
Let them not thinke, that they are Kings onely in name, and
representation, and that they are not bound to any more
but to bee adored and reuerenced, and to represent the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

which shew a hand, where there is none; discouer a face,
where there is none; and represent a body, where there is
none; expressing therein actions to the life, as if the Image

The names which God setteth vpon things, are like vnto
the Title of a Booke, which in few words, containeth all
that is therein. This name of King, is giuen by God vnto
Kings, and therein includeth all that, which this their
Office tyes them to doe. And if their workes and actions
doe not answer with their name and Title, it is as if one
should say yea, with his Mouth, and by making Signes, say
no, with his head. What aiest and mockerie is this? How
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2459:22"/>
shall such a one bee truely vnderstood? It were Cosenage
and deceit in that Golde beater, who writes vpon his Signe,
Heere is fine gold to be sold, when indeed it is but <hi>Orpine,</hi>
and base gold for <hi>Painters.</hi> The name of King, is not an
Attribute of Idlenesse; A person regall, must haue reall
performance. As his name soundeth, so let him serue in
his place: it is the people that proclaime the King, but
it is the King that must proclaime his loue to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Hee that hath the name of ruling and gouerning,
a Gods name let him rule and gouerne. They are not to be
<hi>Reyes de anillo</hi> (as it is in the <hi>Prouerb)</hi> that is to say; <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall</hi>
Kings only, <hi>&amp; praeter nomen nihil:</hi> hauing nothing else
in them. In <hi>France,</hi> there was a time, when their kings, had
nothing but the bare name of Kings, their Liuetenants
Generall gouerning, and Commanding all, whilest they
(like so many beastes) did busie themselues in nothing
else, but following the delights and pleasures of Gluttonie,
and Wantonnesse. And because it might be known, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
to the people, that they were aliue, (for they neuer
came abroad) once a yeare they made shew of themselues,
on the first day of <hi>May,</hi> in the Market-place of <hi>Paris,</hi> sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in a chaire of State on a throne royall, like your kings
amongst your Stage-players; and there in reuerence they
bowed their bodies vnto them, and presented them with
giftes; and they againe conferred some fauours, on such as
they though fit. And because you may see the miserie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they were brought, <hi>Eynardus,</hi> in the beginning of that
Historie which he writes of the life of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, says:
That those Kings (in those dayes) had no valour in them
in the world, made no shew of Noblenesse, nor gaue so much
as a tast of any inclination thereunto; but had onely the
empty and naked name of King. For in very deede they were
not Kings, nor had actually and effectually any hand in the
gouernment of the State, or the wealth and riches of the
Kingdome; for they were wholly possessed by the <hi>Praefecti
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2459:22"/>
latij,</hi> whom they called <hi>Seneshalls,</hi> or Lord high Stewards
of the Kings House. Who were such absolute Lords and
of that vnlimited power, that they ruled the roste, and did
what they list, leauing the poore seely King nothing saue
onely the bare Title, who sitting in a Chaire with his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwigge,
and his long beard, represented the person of a
King making the world beleeue that hee gaue Audience
to all Ambassadours that came from forraigne parts, and
gaue them their answers and dispatches, when they were
to returne: But in very truth, he sayd no more vnto them,
saue what hee had beene taught, or had by writing beene
powred into him, making shew as if all this had beene done
out of his owne Head. So that these kinde of Kings had
nothing of the Power-Royall, but the vnprofitable name
of King, and inutile throne of State, and a personated
Maiestie that lay open to nothing but scorne and derision.
For the ture kings, and those that commanded all, were those
their <hi>Minions</hi> and <hi>Fauorites,</hi> who oppressed the other by
their potencie, and kept them in awe. Of a King of
<hi>Samaria,</hi> God sayd; That hee was no more but <hi>paulu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
spumae,</hi> a froathy bubble. Which being beheld a far
off, seemeth to be something, but when you draw neere
and touch it, it is nothing. <hi>Simia in tecto, Rex fatuus, in
solio suo.</hi> He is like vnto an Ape on the house-toppe, who
vsing the apparances, and gestures of a man is taken for
such a one by them that know him not. Iust so, is a foolish
King vpon his Throne, your Ape likewise serueth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
children and to make them sport: And a King
causeth laughter in those, who behold him stript of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a King, without authoritie, and without gouernment.
A King, appareled in Purple, and sitting with great Maiestie
in his Throne answerable to his greatnesse, seemeth in
shew, graue, seuere, and terrible, but in effect nothing.
Like vnto the Picture of that <hi>Grecians</hi> limming, which
being placed on high, and beheld from a farre, seemed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2459:23"/>
to be a very good Peece, But when you came neerer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, and viewed it well, it was full of Blots and Blurs,
and very course stuffe. A King vnder his Canopie or
Princely Pall, expresseth a great deale of outward State
and Maiestie, but himselfe being narrowly lookt into, is
no better then the blurred Character of a King. <hi>Simu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachra
gentium, Dauid</hi> calleth those Kings, that are Kings
onely in name. Or, as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> renders it: <hi>Imago fictilis,
&amp; contrita.</hi> An image of crack't earth, which leaketh in
a thousand places. A vaine Idoll, which representeth
much, yet is no other then a false and lying shadow. And
that name doth very well sute with them, which <hi>Eliphas</hi>
falsly put vpon <hi>Iob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 4. 19.</note> who, being so good and so iust a man,
did mocke at him, vpbrayding him, that his foundation
was in the dust, that he was not a man of any solid and
sound iudgement, but onely had some certaine exteriour
apparences, calling him <hi>Mimicoleon,</hi> which is a kinde of
creature, which in Latin, they call <hi>Formicaleo.</hi> Because it
hath a monstrous kinde of Composture, in the one halfe
part of the body, representing a fierce Lyon, which was
alwayes the <hi>Hierogliffe</hi> of a King; and in the other halfe
an <hi>Ante</hi> or <hi>Pismire,</hi> which signifieth a weake thing and
without any substance. Authoritie, Name, Throne, and
Maiestie doth well become Lyons, and powerfull Princes;
And hitherto, it is well. But when we looke on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
halfe, and see the being and substance of a <hi>Pismire;</hi>
that goes hard. There haue beene Kings, who with their
very name onely, haue strooke the world into a feare and
terrour. But they themselues had no substance in them,
and were in their Kingdome no better then <hi>Ants,</hi> and
<hi>Pismires.</hi> Great in name and Office but poore in action.
Let euery King then acknowledge himselfe to be an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,
and not onely to bea a priuate, but a publicke Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,
and a superintendent in all Offices whatsoeuer. For
in all, hee is bound both to speake, and doe. S <hi>Austen,</hi>

which treates of <hi>Episcopall</hi> Dignitie, say; That the Latin

The name of Bishop, of King, and of whatsoeuer
other superior, is a name that comprehendeth Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendencie,
and assistance in all Offices. This, the royall
Scepter signifieth, exercised by Kings in their publicke acts,
a Ceremonie vsed by the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> but borrowed
from the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who for to expresse the obligation of
a good King, did paint and open eye placed alofte vpon
the top of a rod, in forme of a Scepter; signifying in the
one the great power that a King hath, and the prouidence
and vigilancie which hee is to haue. In the other that he
doe not onely content himselfe in possessing this supreme
power, and in holding this high and eminent place, and
so lye downe and sleepe, and take his ease, as if there
were no more to bee done: but hee must bee the first in
gouernment, the first in Councell and all in all Offices, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a watchfull eye in viewing and reuiewing, how eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
publicke Minister performes his duty. In signification
whereof, <hi>Ieremie</hi> saw the like rod, when God asking him
what hee saw,<note place="margin">Ier. 1. v. 12.</note> hee sayd; <hi>Virgam Vigilantem ego video.
Well hast thou seene, and verily I say vnto thee; That I
who am the head, will watch ouer my body; I, that am
the shepheard, will watch ouer my sheepe; And I that am
a King and Monarke, will watch without wearinesse ouer
all my Inferiours.</hi> The <hi>Chalde</hi> translates it, <hi>Regem festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantem,</hi>
a King that goes in hast. For though hee haue
eyes and see; yet if he betake him to his ease, be lull'd
asleepe with his delightes and pleasures, and doth not
bestirre himselfe, visiting this, and that other place, and
seeke to see and know all the good and euill which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

which is the superiour part of the bodie. In which the

the Vnderstanding,<note place="margin">Arist. &amp; Aly. lib. 3. de Anima.</note> and Will, the instruments whereof haue
their habitation in the head. There is seated the <hi>Sensus

And that he, who among them all should be most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned

that he should be watchfull ouer all of them, that he should
be solicitous of the common good and profit of them all,

themselues, that such a kinde of Man, as this ought to be, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying

not be withdrawen by other by businesses, but apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
wholy to those of the Common good, and to publicke

the beginning that Kings had; and it ought to be the care
of a good King, to care more for the publike, then his owne

A King to his Kingdome, is that, which a wise man to the

earth is to all his creatures. For this Title he gaue vnto <hi>Moses,</hi>

of them all; For to all this doth the Office and dignitie of a

trencher (for if it should be so, no man would willingly be
subiect vnto them) but for the publicke profit and common
good of all his subiects, for their happy gouernment, for their
safe protection, their augmentation, conseruation, and in a
word for their seruice; (and without any vnmannerlinesse, we
may well tearme it so) for albeit in outward appearance the
Scepter and the Crowne, haue the face of Empire and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niory;
yet in strictenesse and in rigour, it is but the Office
of a Seruant. <hi>Servus Communis, siuè Servus honoratus:</hi> The

wherein is cyphered vp the Office of a King. These the
Lawes of his Court, whereby he is bound to mantaine in
peace and Iustice, the fatherlesse, and the widowe; the poore
and the rich; the mighty, and the weake. To his Account
are put the <hi>Agrauios</hi> and wrongs which his Ministers doe
vnto the one; and the Iniustice, which the other suffer. The
wretched estate of those that are necessited, the cry of the
distressed, and the teares that are shed out of anguish of
heart; and a thousand other loades, euen wane-loades of
cares and obligations, lye vpon the shoulders of him that
is the Head, and King of a kingdome. And albeit he be the
head in commanding and in gouerning, yet in bearing (if
not often ouercharged therewith) the heauie weight and
loade of all, hee must be the feete or supporters to beare the
burthen of the whole body of the Common-wealth. Of
Kings and Monarkes,<note place="margin">Iob. 9. 13.</note> the iust men <hi>Iob</hi> sayth; that by reason
of their Office, they carry (like Poters) the world on their

stoope. In consideration whereof, it is sayd in the booke
of <hi>Wisedome; In veste ponderis, quam habebat summus sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdos,

the whole world. The Latin translation <hi>In veste ponderis,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes

thee and so heauie a load, as the strongest Carte will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

And he that is wise, and well vnderstands what it is to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne,
and to be a Head, knowes that Gouernment, and
Charge, or Loade, is all one. And that the words themselues
<hi>Regere,</hi> and <hi>Portare,</hi> are Synonomyes, and haue one and the
selfe same signfication. For there is not any Gouernment,
or charge, which is without it's burthen, and trouble. In that
repartment and diuision of Offices, which <hi>Iacob</hi> conferr'd
vpon his children, he marked out <hi>Reuben</hi> to be the first in
Inheritance,<note place="margin">Gen. 49 3.</note> and the greatest in gouernment. <hi>Prior in donis,
maior in imperio:</hi> Thou art my first in the excellencie of
dignitie,<note place="margin">Hierom. in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc. Hebraicis in Gen.</note> &amp; the excellencie of power: which S. <hi>Ierome</hi> renders,
<hi>Maior ad portandum;</hi> The greatest to beare. For Empire, and
bearing, are both one thing. And by how much the Empire
is the greater, by so much the greater is the toyle and trouble
and the burthen the heauier.<note place="margin">Gregor. lib. 24.</note> St <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Moralls saith;
That the power,<note place="margin">Moral. c. 26.</note> Dominion, and Signorie, which Kings haue
ouer their subiects, ought not to be esteemed an honour, but
a trouble. <hi>Potestas accepta, non honor, sed onus aestimatur.</hi> And
the blindest Gentiles did attaine to this light of truth. And
one of them vsed the selfe same phrase of speech, speaking of
another that was much puffed vp and well contented with
the charge and office, which <hi>Apollo</hi> had allotted him.
<q>Laetus erat,<note place="margin">Ouid. Metam.</note> mixto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> oneri gaudebat honore.</q>
So that to rule, and Command, is a Mixture of a little honour
and much trouble. And the Latin word, which signifieth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
doth not differ more then in one Letter from that
which signifieth a loade or burthen. <hi>Onos, &amp; onus.</hi> For <hi>(H.)</hi> is
but an aspiration. Nor was there euer that man yet wanting,
nor euer will be, to take (for Honours sake) this burthen vpon
him. Though all of them can be well content, to take as little
of the loade as they can vpon them, but as much of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
as you will; howbeit this is not the securest Course.</p>
               <p>But I shall conclude this Chapter with this <hi>Aduiso.</hi> That
the Office of a King consists not so much in the outward
operation, (though in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2459:31"/>
inward apprehension. Which in it's own nature may imbrace
infinite things, not as infinite, but as such as may be reduced
to a few points, nor no more then shall be pointed at in this
Treatise. Which ought alwayes, of a wise &amp; prudent King, to
be well vnderstood, &amp; to make vse of as many of them as hee
can, and which do more particularly appertaine vnto his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and to leaue the rest vnto his Ministers. A King must be
like the Heart in the Body, which solely of it selfe cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
all those offices, which all the members more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
may. But by the helpe and meanes of diuers Instruments,
members, and Organs, diffusing &amp; sending forth their vertue
vnto them, it findes it selfe in the operation of them all. The
king, is the heart of the kingdome, and must worke therin like
it, not doing all by himselfe (for that is impossible, and instead
of doing good, would do hurt) by keeping himselfe in his
proper Station, without transiliating that Circle which more
particularly belongeth vnto him, and performing those Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which another cannot execute for him, by his great power
and vertue, he may in a diffusiue manner haue recourse to all
the parts euen the most remote of his kingdome, take a care
of all and haue a hand in all. And this care, is as proper to a
King; as it is to the heart; it being impossible for the heart to
liue without care.<note place="margin">Isidor. lib. 4. Etym.</note> And from thence it takes it's name and
Appellatiue. <hi>Cor</hi> (saith <hi>Isidore) dicitur à cura, Cor</hi> (which

least dis-carefullnesse in the world, loosing it's owne quiet,
to giue Man ease. And therefore the Spouse, called her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,
her Heart; because hee performed this office with

not for his owne, hee hath denied the faith, and is worse
then an Infidel. The heart likewise hath another property
very proper vnto Kings, which is, it's continuall beating on
the left side. The Author of Nature being desirous by this
secret to teach Kings, that they should apply themselues
with more care to the weakest part, and that which hath most
neede of their helpe. The right side is more assisted with
naturall heate and blood, then the left, which is more
stript of these fauours. And in this, the Heart showes, that
Kings should shew their King-craft and the finenesse of their
care, towards poore needy people, and such as are destitute
of all humane fauour. For to the rich and mighty, blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth,
and nothing is wanting vnto them. God doth
illighten Kings, which are the Heads of the people, to the
end, that they may doe in their Kingdomes all that which

that the vnderstanding and naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is the most principall power that is
in Man, by which he is distinguished
from Beasts; and is the <hi>principium &amp;
radix,</hi> the ground and root of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
And by how much the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
a man is, &amp; of better vnderstanding, by so much the
more is he capable thereof, and the more intensiuely doth he
loue it. And for this cause did <hi>Pythagoras</hi> call wise men Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
Louers, or coueters of Wisdome; because the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
thereof doth set an edge on the desire, and makes a
man to couet it the more, for it's treasure is infinite, and
no man can exhaust it. And therefore the more a man hath
of it, the more he desireth it. It is the retreit and receptacle of
faith, and of all the Arts and Sciences, both practicke and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatiue,
hauing an vniuersall aptitude to receiue them all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

power, yet so great is it's capacity, and of that ample<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and ablenesse to receiue and containe, that it seemeth
infinite, for let a man know neuer so much, yet can he not
fill vp his knowledge. For such and such notions dispose the
vnderstanding for others. Knowledge begetteth knowledge,
and the more things a man knoweth, so much the more
easily doth he apprehend those he knoweth not, till he come
to the perfect inquiry and knowledge of the truth: and by
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2459:34"/>
conuersing with the wise, and exercise of good Letters, hee
goes still rising higher and higher. And by how much the
more a man is aduanced in his vnderstanding, so much the
more aduantage shall he haue of those which haue not the
same measure. Suting with that saying of the Comicke <hi>Poet,</hi>
who wondering to see the great difference betweene man &amp;
man, cryes out, <hi>Homo, homini quid praestat!</hi> So much doth
one man differ from another in wisdome and prudence, that
they seeme to be different <hi>species.</hi> And hence is it that the
aduantage which a wise man hath ouer those that are not so,
is, to make him King ouer all the people. Which lesson
God taught vs in the first King he made choice of for his
people, who standing in the midst of his Subiects, was taller
then any of them from the sholders vpwards, so that his head
shew'd it selfe aboue them all.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 10. 28.</note> And the word <hi>Melech</hi> which

vnderstand the excellency that aboue others, Kings ought to
haue. And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> stiled a prudent and wise Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

should be somewhat more then a man; and exceed in diuine

way of eminency containeth the perfections of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
so, (as farre forth as a Creature can) a wise King
should (and that with much aduantage) possesse the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of all his people. And the holy Scripture teacheth
vs, that God created man after his own image and likenesse,
giuing him Vnderstanding, Memory, and Will. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

almost, they gaue the same name, and the same Ensignes
to Empire and Wisdome. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes them <hi>Synono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
and will haue them to signifie one and the same thing.
She alone (by keeping Gods commandements) will be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
in a King to make him pleasing and acceptable vnto
God, and to be cut out according to the measure of his own
heart. And though some are of a larger heart and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
then other some; yet (with God) to be wise, is that
which conueneth most both to King and Subiect.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Esay</hi> the Prophet God promiseth to all his people a
golden age, happy dayes, and fortunate times, wherein all
shall haue a share of happinesse, peace, equity, iustice, health,
content, and abundance of fruits. But comming vnto Kings,
he saith no more, but that there shall not be any one that
shall be a foole. <hi>Non vocabitur vltrà is qui insipiens est, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps.</hi>
This is a great happinesse. But (O Lord) let mee
aske thee; Is a King of worse condition then his Subiects,
that thou shouldst promise so many good things vnto them,
and but one alone vnto him? The answere hereunto is, that
our good God giueth vnto euery one (according to his state
and calling) that which is fittest for him. The Subiect who
hath one to rule and gouerne him, hath need of one to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2459:35"/>
minister iustice vnto him, to conserue him in peace, and to
make such prouision, that he may haue wherewith to eate,
and the like. But a King, who is to rule and gouerne, hath
need of wisedome, which is the life and soule of Kings,
which sustaineth the weight of a Kingdome, and without
which (be they neuer so rich, neuer so powerfull) they shall
be as fit for gouernment, as a body without a head, or a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

head without a soule. And as from the soule the Sences are
origined, and from that essence result your passions; so in
like sort from wisedome resulteth vnto King, and Kingdome,
all that good and happinesse that can be desired.<note place="margin">Wisd. 6. 24.</note>

they were gouerned by those that were wise. Of such conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is wisedome in a King, that vpon the very rumour
that he is a wise Prince, all presently obay, and sooner sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themselues, then at the noise of his power. As was to
be seene in King <hi>Salomon,</hi> whose wisedome was no sooner
knowen to the people, but they began presently to respect
and feare him.</p>
               <p>But let me aske this question: Shall it suffice a King to
haue vnderstanding and wisdome, vnlesse he make vse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and shew a willingnesse to execute what he knowes? No
certainly. For the greatnesse of a power or faculty consis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in it's operation. The Vnderstanding without Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
(like the Will without Loue) serues to little or no
purpose. And it is doubted (as I toucht in the beginning)
vpon which of these two <hi>potentias,</hi> or faculties, is that arme
and hand, whereby the soule operateth it's most excellent
workes? The vnderstanding alleageth for himselfe, that it
is he that in the kingdome of our soule doth ordaine, dispose,
and gouerne. The Will, she saith, that without her nothing
is done. For as the Philosophers tearme it, <hi>Applicat poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias
ad operandum,</hi> she sets these faculties a worke, and
findes them hands. The Vnderstanding confesseth this is
true; but with all saith, it is he that nods and winckes vpon
her, makes signes and tokens vnto her, is as it were the
Watch-word, &amp; doth expose vnto her whether she will this
or that, for the better ordering &amp; disposing of it. The Will,
she on the other side replyes, that she likewise fomenteth
and affectionates the Vnderstanding, and doth excite and sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite
him, that he study, thinke, and dwell vpon that which
she best liketh. But leauing the resolution of this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie
to your <hi>Thomists,</hi> and <hi>Scotists,</hi> who dispute it at large;
the Vnderstanding (as I said before) is a Regall power which
ruleth &amp; gouerneth in man, and is that Starre which guideth
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2459:36"/>
and giueth light to the whole house of the soule; yet is the
Will so much Mistresse, that nothing is done without her.
Nor can God himselfe (by violence) draw a yea, or a
nay from it, without trespassing vpon that liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he created it; for in it's owne nature it is free: and (as
Philosophy informeth vs) it cannot be forced. <hi>Caeterae po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae
possunt capi, non tamen voluntas.</hi> But the common
receiued opinion is, that both the one and the other must
concurre for the effecting of any free worke. Insomuch,
that it is impossible to performe any action of importance,
vnlesse that both doe intend that same. We must plucke the
reynes of both, hold both of them in our hands, if we meane
to rule and gouerne the soule as we ought; the Vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
directing, and the Will operating. And therefore a
deuout King, after that hee hath begg'd vnderstanding of
God, that hee may be able to study and meditate on the
obseruance of his diuine Law, for the conseruation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and his kingdome; finding that this is not sufficient if
the Will should draw another way, let him presently pray
vnto him, that he incline his Will, and so dispose thereof,
that he may not onely will his Will, but that hee may take
pleasure to put it in practise. In strictnesse, and in rigour,
that is not Wisedome, nor deserueth the name thereof,
which is bung'd vp in the Head, and goes not from the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
to the hand, and from the Will to the Worke.
<hi>Non enim sapientia est</hi> (saith S. <hi>Bernard) quae quod sapit, non
exercet; Wisedome without practise is not Wisedome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are some of whom all men sticke not to say, that he
is of great vnderstanding, a man of admirable abilities, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
wisedome, &amp;c. And yet no man knowes wherein his
Knowledge lies, nor can discerne his Wisdome in his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
It is necessary that this opinion should be ratified and
confirmed by exterior Actions, and some publique demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations.
Of King <hi>Dauid</hi> the holy Ghost saith, that hee
did gouerne his people with the vnderstanding of his hands.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2459:36"/>
                  <hi>Et in intellectibus manuum suarum deduxit illos.</hi> It is a
cleare case that the hands haue no other particular vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in a distinct manner, or distinguished from that
which the soule hath; and this is in the Head, and not in the
hands. But the meaning of that place is, that in the Workes
of his hands, and in all his Actions, the King manifested his
great Vnderstanding and Wisedome: Which if it remaine
onely in the huske, or shell, it is good for nothing, <hi>Sicut fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
ita &amp; sapientia, sine operibus mortua est; Wisedome</hi>
(saith S. <hi>Bernard) is like Faith, without good Workes it is
dead.</hi> That King therefore that shall haue wisedome inough
in, and for himselfe, and shall execute and shew the same in
the gouernment of his kingdome, and exercise the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
his Subiects, he shall be great in all his kingdomes
heere on Earth, and great likewise in the kingdome of
Heauen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salomon,</hi> when God had giuen him wisedome, did not
onely attend the speculatiue part, but the practicke; which
is the principall thing in him that ruleth.<note place="margin">Eccl. 8. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Apposui cor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,

is done vpon Earth;</hi> for in Wisedome, and the good exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
thereof, consisteth all the good gouernment of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.
This being presupposed, and what else in the
subsequent Chapters shall be spoken hereof, I say, That it
is not required of Kings, that they should be so wise and
skilfull in all Arts and Faculties, as King <hi>Salomon</hi> was, and
others, which make profession thereof; nor yet so illiterate,
as the Emperour <hi>Licinius,</hi> which was such an Idiot, and such
a beast, that he knew not how to firme or set his hand to any
De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, or Writing. Or as that other <hi>Michael Balbo,</hi> which
was such an enemy vnto Learning, that hee would neither
study good Letters himselfe, nor suffer the children of his
time to be b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed vp therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:2459:37"/>
That which is to be required of euery good King, is; that
he haue so much wisedome, as to be able to aduise himselfe,
and to make benefit of the Councell of others. That he be
wise enough to know what is good and iust, and what is bad
and ill, that he may vse the one, and shun the other. <hi>Is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim
moderatus est sapiens</hi> (saith <hi>Socrates)</hi> that hath Courage
to execute, and Will to doe. On those Bases, which the most
wise King <hi>Salomon</hi> placed in the Temple,<note place="margin">1 Kings 7. 29.</note> hee commanded
Lions, Oxen, and Cherubins to be ingrauen, in significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of so many the like qualities which Kings ought to haue,
who sustaine the whole weight of a kingdome. He must be
in perpetuall labour, signified in the Oxe; he must be endued
with courage, expressed in the Lion; and he must abound in
knowledge, notified in the Cherubin. Wherefore <hi>Cicero</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
maketh mention;<note place="margin">Cicero in Orat. pro lege Manil.</note> 
                  <hi>Hae sunt</hi> (saith that Heathen Orator)
<hi>virtutes Imperatoriae, Labor in negotijs, Fortitudo in peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis,
Industria in agendo:</hi> To assist in businesses, to be stout
and valiant in dangers, to be dextrous and wise in acting, and
aboue all, to haue a liberall will without subiection, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
disposed for execution, are vertues befitting an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
For to gouerne well, great strength, great courage,
great wisedome, great power, and a great willingnesse will
be required. For, though a King know much, and can doe
much; yet, if he will not exercise his knowledge, nor make
vse of his power, it is all one as if he neither knew, nor could
doe any thing. The Leaper said to our Sauiour Christ,
<hi>Domine, si vis, potes me mundare; If thou wilt, thou
canst make me cleane.</hi> And Christ made him
answer, not in word onely, but in deed;
<hi>Volo, mundare; I will, be
thou cleane.</hi>

if a Prince would bee so holy, and so zealous of the good

so much the more acceptable in this kind are their
prayers vnto God. As King <hi>Salomon</hi> exemplifieth it vnto

his want of Wisedome, for to gouerne so great a people
that could not bee numbred, nor counted for multitude,

Giue therefore thy Seruant an vnderstanding heart, to iudge

discreete young King saw the doore of Gods mercie set
thus wide open vnto him, and what a liberall offer he had
made vnto him, to bestow fauours vpon him according to
the measure of his owne desire, yet did hee neither set his
eyes, nor his heart vpon Gold, Siluer, Riches, or long life, but
as one, that knew so well how to aske, desired that he would
out of his grace and mercy, giue him the gift of Wisedome,
that hee might know how to gouerne his State and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and to conserue them in peace and Iustice. And God
was so well pleased with this his Petition, that he did not
onely bestow that vpon him, but many other blessings with
it, and (as the Apostle saith) <hi>affluenter,</hi> in a great aboundance
making him the wisest, the discreetest, and the greatest king,
that euer was in the world. And besides, gaue him all that
which hee omitted to desire, or might haue desired: To

He did not account of these, in comparison of wisedome,

and yet all those other fauours were conferred vpon him;
<hi>Quia hoc magis plaucit cordi tuo, &amp; non postulasti diuitias,

the Counsaile of the wise, that Kings ought to striue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour,
that no man should know all their store, nor be able
to fadome the depth of that their sea of knowledge, for the
danger of the discouerie of a deceit; for many times it impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
more in those that are led away with affection, and those
likewise that are strangers, to be ignorant whither and how
far, the worth and wisedome of a Prince extends it selfe, then
the experience and proofe thereof. And because sometimes
vpon occasion Kings are forced to discouer that, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise

that they should vse few, graue, and well-weighed

Things being so various, and so many, and weighty the
businesses as are those which come vnder the hands of Kings,
and craue their care to bee treated of, the successe of them,
must needs run a great deale of danger, when there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth
not some diligent and mature Counsaile. Kings
(I assure you) had neede haue good both Counsailours
and Counsaile, hauing so many eyes as they haue vpon
them, some of iealousie, and some of enuie, so many that
goe about to deceiue, and doe deceiue them; and many,
that doe not loue them as they ought; I say they had neede
of good both Counsailours and Counsaile, and such a
Councell as is more close and priuate, as that of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of State, and sometimes, and in some cases with a little
more restriction and reseruednesse, making choise of one,
two, or more of their faithfullest and sufficientest Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours,
with whom they may freely Communicate their
greater, and lesser affaires, and be resolued by them in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of greater moment, and such as importe their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
preseruation, and the augmentation of their Kingdome,
such as the Historians of <hi>Augustus</hi> paint forth vnto vs,
which kinde of course, the Princes before and since his
time haue taken, and now at this present, doe. From the
poorest Plowman, to the Potent'st Prince, from the meanest
Shepheard, to the mightiest Monarke, there is a necessitie
of this Counsaile. And in effect, euery one as hee can,
(comformable to his Estate, and calling) must Consult
with his Wife, his Sonne, his Friend, or himselfe, (if his
fortune afford him not a Companion, whom he may trust,
or make his Confident). How much doth it concerne Kings,
who possessing such great Estates, and being subiect to so
many Accidents, haue need of a more perfect and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2459:41"/>
Councel. And not any thing so much importeth them
for the conseruation, and augmentation of their Kingdomes,
as to haue about them iust, prudent, &amp; dis-interessed persons,
to aduise them with a great deale of faithfullnesse, and loue,
and with free libertie of Language to represent the truth of
that, which to them, and their Common-wealth, is most
fitting and conuenient.<note place="margin">Plut. in P. Aemil Arist. c. 8. Mag. moral.</note> Who, for this purpose, are as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie

are so many Contingencies that mans wisedome is not

Which is done by the infusiue gift of the Holy Spirit co-o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating

Hoary-headed men (accompanied with much vertue, an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
life, soundnesse of Religion, and much prudence) are
those that are worthy to giue Counsaile, and those which
Kings are to make choyse of for their seruice. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Charles</hi> the fift sayd it was fit, that Princes should be
serued by men that were learned and vertuous, and that the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2459:43"/>
Counsaile, and companie of those which were not so, were
very preiudiciall and hurtfull. Counsailours likewise must be
of that greatnesse of courage and magnanimitie, as may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respond
with the Dignitie royall. For Kings that haue not
had in themselues any great courage, haue still honoured
noble minded Counsailours, whereas the contrary haue bin
disgraced, and degraded of their honours by Kings that were
naturally magnanimous. For it is the condition of coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hearts, and of base Counsailours <hi>en cuerpo, yalma</hi> (as they
say) in body, and soule; to propose vnto their Kings base
and vnworthy meanes, for the remedying of some mischiefes,
whereon others follow, that are farre greater. And let
them not perswade them, that this Age is barraine of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
dispositions, and Noble mindes, which produceth, as
well as former times, whatsoeuer is necessary and needefull
for them. For, the diuine prudence (to which particularly
appertaineth the conseruation of kingdoms) is neuer drawen
dry, neuer waxes weary. And if such men are wanting, and
appeare not to the eye of the world, it is, because they are
not sought after, or not admitted to Councell, for the chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and punishment of our great and heinous sinnes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
this one benefit Kings haue aboue others, that all good
men would be glad to serue them, and many do sue and seeke
after them, and offer their seruice vnto them; So that, they
haue store of choise, and may easily make good election, if
therein they will strip and cleanse themselues of their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and passions, which Eclipse and darken the true iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of man. And these, that I now speake of, when they
haue found them, and made choise of them to be of their
Councell; let them loue them, honour them, and trust them.
And as they shall receiue ease and honour by their good
Aduise; So let them reward them, and conceiue of them, as

let Kings take heede, least they strike a feare into their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selours,
through their absolute and free condition, and make
them to withdraw themselues from aduising them what is
fitting, by seeing them so wedded to their owne opinion, and
to excuse themselues from giuing Counsaile, for that they are
dis-heartned &amp; discountenanced by them for deliuering their
mindes freely for their profit, &amp; honour. Of the Emperour
<hi>Adrian</hi> it is storyed, that hee had so noble a condition, <hi>Vt
libenter patiebatur admoneri &amp; corrigivel ab humili persona:</hi>
That he willingly submitted himselfe to be admonished and
reproued of the meanest person. It is proper to gentile brests,
&amp; generous hearts, to listen with delight to the good reasons,
&amp; Counsailes of others, though they be inferiour in qualitie
vnto them: for sometimes a poore man hits right, when a rich
man misses the marke. And a Country Clowne may aduise
that, which a king knowes not of. And if he do perswade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
that he knoweth all, and vnderstandeth all, and that his
opinion alone is the certainest &amp; surest, he but shuts the doore
to the discouery of his errour. One of the two things (saith
<hi>Hesiod)</hi> which euery man of reason, wisdome, and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that shall be sufficient to gouerne that, which shall be
committed to his charge, ought to haue; is a great blandure,
smoothnesse, and softnesse of heart, to follow the opinion,
aduise and Counsaile of those that are the wisest and know

and we shall finde it set downe in expresse words, in

the second of the <hi>Chron.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Chron. 2. 10.</note> It is written, that he sayd; <hi>Da mihi

                  <hi>Giue me wisedome.</hi> And in the first of the <hi>Kings;

for gouernment, without the first, which is pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and wisedome, for to choose and know the best. For,
by following bad Counsaile, he shall erre as much, as if he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
his owne proper errour; and sometimes more. And I
should hold it the lesse euill, that a king were not ouerwise, if
presuming that he is; he should relie too much vpon himself,
&amp; scorne to take counsaile; then if he were lesse wise, but knew
how to benefit himselfe, and make good vse of the Aduise of
prudent and wise Counsailours.<note place="margin">Aug. lib. 14. de Ciuit. Dei. cap. 13.</note> A Prince, of a docile and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious

with as much facilitie, as if he had beene bred vp in euery one

wise men, giue the first place vnto that man, who of himselfe
knowes that which is fitting. And the second, to him, that

because in the Chapters that are to follow by and by, we are
to treate more at large of this matter, I conclude this with
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2459:44"/>
saying; That Kings for to hit the nayle on the head, and not
to faile in the carriage of their businesses, must alwayes take
counsaile of wisemen, such as are of knowne vertue and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience;
and not giue credit vnto any, that prate and talke with
a great deale of libertie and licence of those things they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not, as if they were graduated in them from their
Mothers wombe; And only for a more happy (in shew) then
prudent wit: Least that happen vnto them, which befell king
<hi>Ahab,</hi> who admitted to his Counsell a false Prophet, that
made great osteniation of that spirit, which he had not. Hee
put the gouernment into his hands, and all was gouerned by
his Counsaile. And because he did not speake by the spirit of
God, nor he himselfe well vnderstood what he sayd, businesses
went a misse, the kingdome suffred, and it cost the king his
life.<note n="*" place="margin">It passeth so sometimes that Kings put the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into those mens handes which are lame, and neyther know nor can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. They require their voyce, who haue nothing but a voice: Empty barrells that sound loude, but haue no fulnesse, and craue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, of those that are least able to giue it them. And if they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues pay not for their folly, yet at least the Kingdome suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers for it.</note> And therefore we are not more to desire any thing of
God for the good gouernment, conseruation, and augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Kings, and kingdomes, then that he will be pleased to
furnish them, with good, wise, and prudent Counsailours
such as are sound at the heart, cleane from corruption, and
blamelesse in their conuersation. For such as these, will serue
them in stead of Eyes, and vnderstanding both, wherewith
they may see, and vnderstand all that passeth in their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
O how without eyes, how blinde is that king, who

he will conserue himselfe and his kingdome well, he ought
not so much to flye from those Physitians, who either out of

For without it, can we neither treate of peace, nor war.
<hi>Consiliis, tractanda sunt bella:</hi> Euery purpose is established by

this the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> teacheth vs in a vision which he had,<note place="margin">1. Kings. 22. 19.</note>
in this forme: God represented himself, sitting on his Throne,
and all the Hoast of heauen standing by him, on his right

to be the fittest &amp; most effectuall for the kings vtter ruine and

manifested for the dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>deceiuing of Kings, and to put them
out of their errour, there were many things worthy obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and consideration, yet the principall note (in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
is; That neither <hi>Ahabs</hi> want of vnderstanding, nor
his being head-strong nor wilfull in his opinion, nor his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ouer-rash, and vnaduised in what he vndertooke, but his
own sins, and the sins of his people, had put him in that estate
and condition, that dismeriting Gods fauour, and the light of
heauen, the diuel did deceiue him, guiding the tongues of his
false Prophets, telling them falsehoods, for truthes; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
things, for things certaine, and by perswading him, that
that which was to be his destruction, should turne vnto his
profit &amp; honour.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 15.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells vs, that Satan often times trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes
himselfe into an Angell of Light, and represents lyes
and falshoods vnto vs, in the shape &amp; figure of truth. And the
mischiefe of it, is; That the same which the diuell wrought
vpon <hi>Ahabs</hi> Counsailours, feigned friends, and professed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
haue, and doe the like on some occasions; procuring by
secret meanes, to introduce persons, who making profession
to side and take part with the king, perswade him to do that,
which is least fitting for them, and most vsefull for their own
ends. This is one of the greatest darings, and insolencies, that
may in matter of State be attempted. God free all good kings
from such Counsailes, and Counsailours. When king <hi>Dauid</hi>
saw how his sonne <hi>Absolon</hi> persecuted him; and thought to
go away with the kingdome, he feared not any thing so much,
as the plots and Counsaile of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> who was both a
subtile Statist, and a valiant Souldier, and by whose aduise <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salon</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:2459:46"/>
was wholly ruled and gouerned. For the repairing of
which mischiefe, he got <hi>Hushai</hi> the <hi>Archite,</hi> who was no whit
inferiour vnto him in valour, and prudence, in a dissembling
and disguised manner, to offer his seruice vnto <hi>Absalon,</hi> and
to worke himselfe in to be of his Councell of war, and State,
that he might be the better able, to oppose the able and sound
aduice of <hi>Achitophel;</hi> as he did euen then, when his Master
had most need of his seruice: By which discreete carriage, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
was freed of his fear,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 15. 31.</note> and <hi>Absalons</hi> businesses went back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
till himselfe, and his whole Armie were vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown.
Which story ye may read more at large in the second
of <hi>Samuel.</hi> Two things therefore are to be considered for to
know which is the best and safest Counsaile: The one on the
Kings part, who craues it; the other, on his part, that giues it.
And on either part, that which most importeth, is purenesse
of intention, &amp; a desire to incounter with Truth. Not like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those, who hearken vnto good and disappassionated Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailes
with passion, and onely desire to be aduised, that the
Councell may conclude, what is meerely their Wil, &amp; not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.
And in their sittings at the Counsaile-Table, which
are ordained to this end, they doe not so much treate, whether
that, they pretend, be iust, or no? but with what colour of
Iustice, they may effect what they desire? The vnderstanding
(saith <hi>Salust)</hi> which we will (and with better reason, or more
properly) tearme the Will, ought to be free and dis-incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branced
of affection, or particular passions, as well in asking,
as giuing Counsaile. And because if there be any of this reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the brest, it cannot alwaies, nay scarce any long time
be dissembled, but will like fire breake forth from vnder the
ashes that couer it; fitting it is, That Kings should seldome as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
personally in Counsaile; for their Voting in his presence,
is done with awfulnesse, and great respect; but in his absence,
they vtter their mindes with a little more freenes, and libertie
of language. And euermore your first opinions of your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
and Counsailours of State, before they be toucht with
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2459:46"/>
the Ayre of the Kings will, are the best and the sincerest, as
produced from that vnforst motion and naturall inclination,
which is in their owne particular hearts, and bosomes. If the
King desireth to haue this or that thing passe, and for to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize
and qualifie this his desire, he craueth their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
howbeit hee meete with many which conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
thereunto, &amp; follow his gust and liking, yet such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile
or aduice in such a Case, ought to be esteemed as little se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
as there is great reason for it to hold it suspected: Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
if the foresaid Counsailours, by some meanes or other
come to haue an inckling, that this way the King is inclined,
and this is that, which will giue him content. And though
we might as well out of Diuine, as Humane Letters cite heere
many examples, for that this is a thing so vsuall, and so well
receiued both by Princes, and by Priuy-Counsailours; Or to
speake more truly and plainely, by those, that sooth, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them; I will onely alleadge that, which passed with that
vnfortunate King <hi>Ahab;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Kings. 21. 6.</note> who out of his proud and haughty
spirit, and the desire that he had to make warre, and to take a
place of importance from the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> propounded
his intent, or to say better his Content, to those of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.
The businesse was no sooner in treatie, and the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
for the vndertaking of this action proposed vnto them,
but forthwith 400. Counsailours with a ioynt consent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
themselues to his opinion. And to sooth vp this his
humour the more, one amongst the rest bobb'd him in the
mouth with an intollerable Lye, affirming; that God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
vnto him, that he should haue the glorie of the day, &amp;
that the successe of the battaile should be prosperous vnto
him This was apprehended with a great deale of content by
the King, but was finished with his vnfortunate end, himselfe
being slaine in that battaile, and his Army routed and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.
By which we may see, how much it concerneth
Kings, if they will receiue good Counsaile, that they dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(as much as they can) their particular good will and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2459:47"/>
liking in the businesse proposed. But that, which is heere of
greater consideration, is the vertue, fidelitie, and truth of a
Counsailour, a minde without passion, disinteressed, and pure.
For it oftentimes hapneth, that he that craueth Counsaile,
hath not his intention so sound as is requisite, nor his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
so strong, as to reduce him into the right way, and being
set in it, to follow the best. But to grow to a Conclusion, that
cannot faile, which Truth it selfe, our Sauiour Christ said in
his Gospell; <hi>A good tree, cannot bring forth had fruit nor
a bad tree good.</hi> And the badge or cognisance of good or bad
Counsaile, shall doubtlesse be the goodnesse, or badnesse, the
wisedome, or ignorance of the Counsailour. And therefore
I importunately presse, that it mainly importeth a Prince, to
beware, of whom he taketh Counsaile. For by how much the
more profitable is a wise &amp; vpright Counsailour, by so much
the more preiudiciall is he, that is vniust, and vnstreight And
therefore the Holy Ghost saith;<note place="margin">Tob. 4. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Consilum semper a sapiente
perquire: Aske Counsaile alwaies of the wise.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place;<note place="margin">Eccl. 6. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Pacifici sint tibi multi, Consiliarius sit tibi vnus de
mille. Amongst a 1000. Men scarce will there be found one, that
is fit to giue Counsaile.</hi> For some want wisedome, &amp; prudence;
othersome, purenesse, and cleannesse of heart; and a third sort,
are so ouerswaied with passion, that they do not simply &amp; sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
perswade the truth. A cleare Example wherof we haue
in King <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> the sonne and successour of King <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
who though he succeded his father in so rich a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and so inured to peace, and obedience to their King, yet
notwithstanding was in an instant vndone &amp; vtterly lost by
bad both Counsaile, and Counsailours. For good Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
are the life and soule of a Kingdome. And when it is not
vnderpropped with such, like a body without a soule, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
sinke, &amp; falls from it's state wherin it stood. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the holy King sayd.<note place="margin">Psal. 101. 6.</note>

Will: <hi>Gregory Nyssenus</hi> saith; That it
is composed of both partes; To wit, of
the Act of the Will, and of the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
And hee said well. For therein is required both
a fullnesse of Knowledge, and a freenesse of Will. And it
is the Doctrine of <hi>Diuus Thomas,</hi> who saith; That it is not
of the will alone, but also of the Vnderstanding, because the
electiue Act of the Will, conference, consultation, &amp; Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is to precede; which is the proper Act of the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
But the mischiefe of it is; That in Elections, wee
many times see the contrary, and what a strange diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

For that, which now a dayes most of all discouers it

And therefore to remedy so great a malady, it shall be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2459:48"/>
requisite, that the Prince, who desireth to tread sure, to hit
the marke he aymes at, and to please God in those whom
he electeth and calleth to his Counsell: that hee follow the
Example of our Sauiour Christ, written for our instruction
by the Euangelists S. <hi>Mathew,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 4.</note> and S. <hi>Luke,</hi> who recounting

                  <note place="margin">Luk. 4. &amp; 5.</note> and other the
Apostles, as his principall Ministers, there preceded a long
and prolixe Oration, or prayer, full of feruour, of zeale,
and of the Spirit, and retyred himselfe into the desart, and
there fasted 40. dayes,<note place="margin">Luk. 6. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Et erat pernoctans in Oratione Dei.</hi>
And continued all night in prayer vnto God. Which (as
S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and other fathers haue well obserued) Christ did
not doe, that hee had any neede of these Dispositions, and
Preambles, for to iumpe right in that Election; but to teach
kings, and all other Princes, that if they will hit right in
their Elections, they are to vse the like Diligences. They are
by good and pious workes to procure this fauour at Gods
hands, and to direct all their actions to this end. Nor would
hee, that this Election should be left wholly to the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those Saints, for our Sauiour did declare himselfe
more particularly in the 10. of S. <hi>Luke;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 10. 2.</note> Where speaking with
the 70 Disciples, which had nominated them, he sayd vnto
them; <hi>Messis quidem multa, operarij autem pauci; rogate
ergo Dominum Messis, vt mittat operarios in messem suam:
The Haruest truly is great, but the Labourers are few; Pray
yee: therefore the Lord of the Haruest, that hee would send
forth Labourers into his Haruest.</hi> And though in those
former times, these words were very seasonable, yet now in
this present age, it's necessitie is better knowne, as likewise
the truth thereof. For, the Haruests being so many, and
so great, I meane, so great and so many the varietie, and
multitude of important businesses for the welfare of the
Common-wealth, the Labourers are very few. But to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
my self a little more fully, I say, That very few are they,
that enter, or seeke to enter into Offices, for to labour and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2459:48"/>
paines, but for to liue at their pleasure, &amp; to heape vp riches,
that they may increase the more in ambition, and more freely
take their ease. The remedie of this, consisteth in that, which
our Sauiour Christ commandeth vs; To wit: That we in defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigably
pray vnto him, that he will be pleased to send forth
faithfull Ministers and good Labourers into his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth:
Ministers, of knowen trust, zeale, &amp; vertue, to whom
may sute the name of Counsellours, and not of Babblers; of
worthy men, &amp; not of wordly men. And kings, to whom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
this Office of Election doth, belong must put the more
force, &amp; insist the more in this prayer begging that which the
wisest of Kings, <hi>Salomon</hi> petitioned of God, <hi>Da mihi sedium

with that guide and light which humane wisedome might
afford him, but had recourse by prayer to that diuine Light

sayd: By the hand and Light, which I reach forth vnto
Kings, they goe rightly on in their iudgements, and their
Elections, so that they reigne, and conserue themselues in

is this; That when a King shall come to elect and
make choise of his <hi>Ministers,</hi> his first care must be, to pray
heartily vnto God, that hee will direct this his choise and
election. And so much the more diligence hee ought to vse
therein, by how much of more importance and of greater
qualitie the Minister shall be, that is to be imployed.</p>
               <p>After Prayer, which is diuine, other humane diligences,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2459:49"/>
are to bee followed. Whereof the chiefest is, that the
Prince informe himselfe of the good sufficiency, the honest
life, and faire carriage of those, whom hee is to choose.
And that heerein, he may not be deceiued, it is necessary,
that with Christ he goe vp vnto the Mount; That is, To ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
his Consideration vnto God and to auoide vulgar opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
To strip himselfe of passion, and not to strike hands
with those, that are not Gods friends; To forget all kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and Alliance; Not to take in the infectious Ayre of
fond affection; Not to apply himselfe to that, which the
importunat intercessions and requests of a fauourite, or kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
shall seeke to draw from him for their priuate benefit;
Nor to hearken to the negotiation of cunning and subtile
pretenders, but onely to the good of the Common-wealth,
and the quicke dispatch of businesses, and other the like of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
that are to be exercised by men of their place. And
albeit, it was my purpose, not to serue my selfe, in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
but with the Testimonies and Examples of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the Doctors that are Expositors thereupon; Yet
can I not omit to exemplifie heere in one, of King <hi>Don
Philip,</hi> the second of this name, whose soule doth rest in
peace, being that for his great prudence, and zeale to Iustice,
and for his good gouernement, all the Kings of the world
may acknowledge him their Master. The case is this; A
President of his time, hauing proposed a Person for a place,
relating vnto him the qualities, which concurred in him,
for the meriting thereof, hee farther added; That the
Lady <hi>Infanta,</hi> did much desire this prouision should bee
made him. Heereunto his Maiestie with a great deale of
iudgement, and grauitie, made answer. <hi>Y mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hya que sabe
desso?</hi> What? Has my Daughter a hand in this? Can she
iudge of his worth. Giuing his President by this his Answer
to vnderstand, that he should not haue alleaged vnto him
that, for to make a good election, which should passe the
bounds of the consideration of those parts and qualities,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2459:49"/>
wherewith hee was to be furnished, were his pretension
neuer so much fauoured by the mediation and intercession
of great persons. And heereunto I farther adde, that a king
should in no hand content himselfe with the bare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of those onely, whom he knowes by sight, and walke
dayly vp and downe in his Court, but that hee should take
leysure to informe himselfe of as many as hee can, and to
follow the ancient custome, in giuing order to his Generalls,
Vice-kings, Prelates, and Gouernours of euery Prouince, to
giue him information of the best and sufficientst subiects that
are in their Gouernment, and that after due consultation
had with them, they should nominate three or foure vnto
him, that from amongst many good, hee might choose
the best. And the rest to bee listed, and taken notice of,
that vpon occasion they might receiue imployment. From
whence likewise this good will arise, that All, in all partes,
great, and small, will study the Science and Arte of good
gouernment, fly Vice, and follow Vertue, that they may
in their due time be numbered amongst the Chosen. Let
a King goe, <hi>Con su spassos contados</hi> (as they say) with a slow
foote, in those Elections, which he is to make, giuing way
vnto Time, and to information. Which hee ought wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
to heare, neither in all giuing credit to all; nor being
(as many are) too incredulous. Let him remit things to
Tryall and Examination, it being a thing needefull for him
so to doe. For, if it be not wisedome, to lend a facile eare
to all that we heare, for, the wise man saith: <hi>Qui citò credit,
leuis est corde;</hi> So likewise doth it betoken little prudence,
to liue alwaies suspicious and distrustfull. Something must
be left to Experience. But to come to the qualifying of
persons, if the one's qualities be of ten, the other of nine
quilates, and all of them necessarie for the Office of a
Counsellour, the first ought to be preferred, though the
other out strip him in Estate, in fauour, in riches, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
For, in that Ministry, there ought respect to be had
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2459:50"/>
onely to the aduantages of sufficiencie, and not of power.
Nor seruices, albeit two be equall in sufficiencie, must loose
their place, and right. But that hee, who hath done the
greater seruices for his King and Countrie, ought to bee
preferred before the other. Now there is this difference
(amongst many others) betwixt a good Prince, and him
that is not so; that a good Prince, conferrs his Offices,
according to the sufficiencie and vertue of the Minister he
maketh choise of; the other vpon fauour, and humane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
vsing therein his power, but not attending distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butiue
Iustice, which rewardeth euery one according to his
deserts, without respect either vnto persons, or particular
intents.</p>

euery word in particuler, and in them, the qualities of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
The first is <hi>Prouide;</hi> Which signifieth not onely to
prouide, but to fore-see, and consider. For, the election
of a Minister is a businesse of great prouidence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
and the most important and necessarie for a
King in matter of gouernment. On the good, or bad Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Counsellours, dependeth the whole honour and
profit both of King, and Kingdome. And he that erres
in this, must necessarily erre in all. For the spring of a
fountaine being spoyled, all the water is spoiled. And a
King failing in this Principle, all goes to destruction. For
without doubt, all good dispatch growes from the force
and vertue of good Counsai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e. Then therefore is a King
held to be wise and prudent, when he hath wife and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Counsailours: Hee succeedeth well with all his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
and inioyeth same, credit, and reputation both
with his subiects, and with strangers. Of the one he is
beloued and obayed, and of the other dre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

and of all esteemed and commended: The whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
resteth contented and satisfied. And though in

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me erre, none will beleeue it. But
when Priuie-Counsailours are no such manner of men, all
murmur, and proclaime to the world; That there is not an
able man in all the Counsell, and if in some one thing or
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2459:51"/>
other hee hap to haue good successe, few or none will giue
credit thereunto, but rather conceiue, it was done by Chance.</p>
               <p>The sacred Text says farther; <hi>De omni plebe;</hi> Out of all the
People. As if he should haue said out of all the 12. Tribes,
or families of this people; thereby to giue vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand;
That for to make a good Election, it is requisit, that
there should not remaine a nooke, or corner in all his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
where diligence should not be vsed (as before hath
beene sayd) to search out the fittest Ministers. And likewise
it may in this word, be giuen vs to vnderstand, that in
matter of Election, wee are not to haue respect to Linage,
Kindred, or Parentage, but to vertue, sufficiencie, and courage,
accompained with other good qualities, which adapt a man
to be a Counsellour. And therefore it is said anon after,
<hi>Viros sapientes,</hi> Wisemen; men of vnderstanding heads, and
stout hearts, which dare boldly and plainely to speake the
truth, and to maintaine and put it in execution, when they
see fit time: for your pusillanimous and white-liuerd persons
are not fit Ministers for a State. <hi>Noli quaerere sieri iudex,
nisi vale-as virtute irrumpere iniquitates.</hi> He that hath not
a face, to out-face a Lye, and to defend the truth, let him
neuer take vpon him the Office of a Minister of Iustice. In
the booke of <hi>Daniel</hi> it is storyed, that King <hi>Nabucodonozor</hi>
was resolued to haue done some cruell chastisement vpon
his Princes, and Counsellours, for that hauing asked them
the Interpretation of a troublesome dreame hee had, none
of them could declare the meaning of it. And howbeit they
told him, that they could not tell what to make of it, &amp; plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confessed the truth, yet notwithstanding the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
that hee had good reason to except against them.
For (thought hee) if you know it, and for feare will not
tell it me, yee are Cowards; And if you know it not, yee
are ignorant; and either of these is a great fault in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailours,
&amp; afford sufficient cause, why ye should be punished;
in that yee would offer to take that Office vpon yee; which
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2459:51"/>
first of all hath neede of stoutnesse of courage; and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to be learned and expert in so many and various things,
as a King hath occasion to vse yee in. And therefore that
wise <hi>Iethro,</hi> after the word <hi>Viros,</hi> Men, puts, <hi>sapientes,</hi> Wise
Or as the 70. and others translate it, <hi>potentes sortes.</hi> Because
in Ministers and Counsellours of State, strength, courage,
constancie, and wisedome, should walke hand in hand. The
Courts and Pallaces of Kings and Princes, that which they
are least stored with all, is Truth. They scarce know her
face, nay not so much as of what colour or complexion
shee is, the onley Minions there made of, being flatteries,
and lyes. A wise and stout man, is daunted with nothing,
is neuer troubled, nor altered, he stands vpon his own worth
and sinceritie, &amp; is Lord and Master of his reason, he speakes
with libertie and freedome, hee represents the truth to his
King, and maintaines it, <hi>Pie quedo</hi> (as they say) stiffely and
stoutly, without respect to any thing, no not so much as
his owne proper life, hee ouerthrowes plots, discouers the
impostures, deceits and Lyes of flatterers; for the which he
had neede of courage and wisedome.</p>
               <p>Now let vs see, what that wisedome is, which a King is
to require in his Ministers. Not worldly wisedome, wherof
S. <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, That those which inioy it, boasting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
thereof, very wisely goe to Hell. The question, that
I aske is; Whether, they should be Philosophers, Diuines,
or Lawyers, or in what kinde of faculties, they should be
wise? Heereunto first I answer; that questionlesse, it would
be a great helpe to the making of a good Counsellour to
bee seene in these Sciences, and to haue spent some time of
study in them. But in case they haue no skill in these it shall
suffice, that they are wise in that which belongeth vnto
that Ministry, for which they are nominated and called; to
wit: To be a Counsailour, which is a person, that is fit, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
and able, for that charge which he is to administer.
That hee haue a nimble wit, and quicke apprehension, for
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2459:52"/>
without that, the rest serues to little purpose. Whereas he
that is furnished therewith, with a little helpe, attaineth to
much; He knowes things past, vnderstands the present,
and giues his iudgement of things to come. That hee be
well read in ancient and moderne Histories, wherein are
contained the sentences and opinions of wise men of elder
times, by which they ordred their Common-wealths, and
maintained them in Peace. For this kinde of reading, doth
indoctrinate more in a day, then Experience hath taught
others in many yeares, which must by no meanes be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in a Counsellour for that ordinarily in them, are found
Prudence, Authoritie, and Experience: That he haue happy
memorie, which is the <hi>Archiue</hi> of the Sciences and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Truths; for without it, to reade and studie, is (as
they say) <hi>Coger aqua en vn harnero,</hi> to gather water in a
fiue; and it importeth much, in regard of the diuersitie of
businesses, and persons, with whom hee is to treate. That
hee haue trauailed, and seene forraine Countries. That hee
be skill'd in the Languages, and haue in all of them the
Arte and garbe of speaking and discoursing well. That he
more esteeme the seruice of his King, and the publicke
good, then his own priuate gaine. That hee be courteous,
humble, affable, and yet of a good spirit. That hee lend
an attentiue eare, and that hee keepe that gate open for great
and small, rich, and poor. But aboue all these, he must be
of approued vertue, for without it, all the rest are of no
esteeme. Hee that shall haue more, or lesse of these quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which are for all in Common, shall bee the more, or
lesse sufficient Counsellour. As for Vice-royes, Gouernours,
Ambassadors and other great Gouernments of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
such are to be chosen, who together with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said

for the greatnesse of those mindes, and stomacks which are

bred there, (a necessary qualitie for to occupie great places,
and not to bee bred vp with a poore portion of Treating,
and Vnderstanding, which begets mindes according to the
same measure) but likewise, because there by their Treating
with Kings, Princes, and other great persons assisting them
in their Counsells and graue consultations, communicating
with great Ministers, and Counsellours of State, diuerse
cases and businesses, the Practick of all affaires, is thereby
the more, and better apprehended; As your practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

therefore, that shall haue both Learning, and Experience,
shall amongst all men be the most remarkable. But, <hi>Quis
est hic, &amp; laudabimus eum:</hi> Shew mee this Man, and we
will commend him. For Mans life is short, the Arte long,
and experience hard to be atchieued. But to summe vp
this discourse, and giue an ende thereunto, I say: That he
that is to bee made a Counsellour of Warre, should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
haue beene exercised many yeares. And that he, that is
of the Councell of State, should haue a full knowledge of
all, and should be very dextrous in matters of gouernment,
both publike, and particular, and well verst in military
discipline, because hee is to consult both of warre, and peace.
Which because they are things so opposite, and contrary,
a man cannot iudge well in the one vnlesse he know and
vnderstand aright the other. As wee shall shew heereafter
when we shall more in particular treate of this Counsell.</p>
               <p>Other qualities, are competible more in especiall to Iudges

Veritas:</hi> Iudgement, and Truth. But S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> would haue
it to signifie <hi>Doctrinam, &amp; Veritatem,</hi> Learning, and Truth.
For these three things, Iudgement, Learning, and Truth, are
much about one, and in them consisteth the whole perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Minister; <hi>In quibus sit Veritas.</hi> For in the brest
of a good Iudge, there must neither raigne passion, nor
affection, but the pure Truth, which hee cannot possibly
avoyd, vnlesse hee will wrong nature it selfe. For our
soule is naturally inclined to Truth. And it is so proper
to a wise and prudent Man, that hee that doth not say it,
vnsaies himselfe. And certaine it is, that the gouernment
of a Kingdome, is so much the more good or ill, by how
much the truth therein, hath more, or lesse place. For if
businesses be not seasoned therewith, as meates are with salt,
neither the poore shall be defended from the oppression of
the rich, nor the rich possesse their goods in safety; men and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2459:53"/>
womens honors shall runne danger, and no one person
can promise to himselfe securitie. And therefore it is so
much the more needfull, that a iudge should treate Truth,
and desire that all should doe the like; by how much the
more are they that abhorre it, and seeke to conceale it; an
olde disease, which was almost borne with vs into the
world. And if Iudges shall not fauour Truth, and plaine
dealing; treachery, and Lying will reigne and beare rule.
Let Kings take heede how they choose men that are feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and timerous to be their Ministers, who out of cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
and pusillanimitie, hide the Truth, and dare not bring
her forth to Light. For, as shee is the foundation of Iustice,
and Christian iudgement, if a Iudge shall not loue it with
his heart, tracke the steps of it, and draw it out of that
darke dungeon wherein shee lyes, Iustice will be in danger
of being crush't, and falshood will preuaile. As in that
peruerse Iudgement in Christes cause, where the Iudge
was so farre from being desirous to know the truth, that
hee did not know what kinde of thing it was; And
therefore demanded in the face of the open Court; <hi>Quid
est Veritas?</hi> What is Truth? To whom, that diuine wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
made no answer, perceiuing him to be such a foole,
as to be ignorant of the first vndoubted Principle of Iustice;
and suffring himselfe to be carryed away with false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
and feigned relations, which had no bulke nor

of a poore shadow, to be thus mis-led.</p>

the other was rounded with bookes. Thereby, giuing vs
to vnderstand that that Man, which is truly the man he
ought to be, and is to aduise and gouerne others, his head,
hands, and feete, must be stucke full of Letters. He must
be learned from the sole of the foote, to the Crowne of
the head, full of Letters hee must bee; for in the discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the Vnderstanding, in the working of the hands,
and in the moouing of the feete, wee may easily guesse,
whether a man be wise, or no; Whether he hath studied,
or doth studie; For though a man be neuer so wise, neuer
so learned, hee still forgetteth somewhat. So that, it is not
enough for him to haue studyed, but it is requisit, that he
still continue his study, that hee may repayre with that
which he learneth, the losse of that which hee forgetteth.

fauour (when it comes to point of Iustice) to one, then
another. And for this reason, the sayd Aegyptians, did
ordinarily paint Iustice, without a Head. The Head, is
the common seate of all the Sences; signifying thereby,
that by no one sence, a Iudge should open a doore to
Passion, but that he should place them all in heauen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
respect to any thing vpon earth. And this, is not to
respect persons, but Iustice.</p>

That in their Courts of Iustice, they had the Pictures
drawne of certaine reuerend olde men, sitting in their due
order, and in the midst the President; all of them without
hands, and their eyes fixed on heauen. To intimate that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2459:54"/>
they should alwaies stand in the presence of the Lord, from
whence is to come that Light, which is to cleare the eyes
of their intentions, avoyding to cast them downe towards
the ground, that the Vapour of humane respects which is
raysed from thence, may not cloude and darken the sight of
their vnderstanding. They must be olde, and wise, because
they are to iudge with mature Counsaile, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyeth
that age. And as it is ordred by their Lawes, they
must haue neither eyes, to see, nor hands, to receiue bribes.
And if they would cut off their wiues hands too, the cause
would be the better iustified. For in them, your bribes
finde an open gate, and are so easie to be knowne in this
kind of trading, that there are few or none, but take notice
of it. They haue the slight of hand, and (like Gypsies) haue
a fine facilitie in deceiuing, and not hard to be wrought
vpon to gaine by this vngodly course. And looke what
businesse they labour to effect, they are vsually the least iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
And if they are disposed to fauour this man, or that
cause, and will but set their friends, and wits roundly to
worke, and doe their best, they will shrewdly put a Iudge
to his shiftes, and driue him to that streight, that Iustice
shall hardly escape a fall. I would haue iudges therefore
with their hands off, and their eyes out, least that befall
them, which did a couple of their place, and qualitie, who
came to see the Processe of a famous, but false, and loose
woman, who perceiuing that the reasons of the Relator
did worke little vpon them, appealed, <hi>para vista de ojos,</hi>
that shee might appeare face to face, and in her informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when shee came <hi>Ore tenus,</hi> shee cunningly discouered
her beautie, by a carelesse letting fall of her mantle, and so
bewitched them therewith, that allowing for good those
powerfull witnesses of her eyes, and face, they released her,
and gaue her for free. But to say the truth, it was her loosenesse
that freed her, and their lightnesse, that condemned them;
making that fault light, which before weighed heauie. And
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2459:55"/>
how shal he freely administer Iustice, who hath his heart cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuated,
and in the power of him, and her, that can turne and
winde him, which way they list and wrest him from good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?
More Iudges haue bin vndone by Lightnesse, then by
Cruelty. The one begetteth feare the other contempt. And by
the way, let them take this lesson a long with them, that not
onely in reality of truth they conserue their credit without
spot, but likewise in apparance procure to giue such good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
that the world may not iustly charge them, no not
with so much as a discomposed looke, neither in the open
streete, nor Court of Iustice; for euery bend from their brow,
or euery smile from their countenance, is the Common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<hi>Almanack,</hi> wher-by they make coniecture, whether it is
like to be faire, or fowle weather; reading in the face fauour to
one, and rigour to another. Wherefore, as their place is great,
so is their perill; The way is slippery wherein they tread, and
therfore had need looke well to their feete. Woe be vnto that
Iudge, which seeth, and seeth not; sees the best, and followes
the worst; suffering his reason to be subdued by passion, and
himselfe by one poore slender haire of a handsome woman, to
be led by the nose whether shee will leade him. For a good
face, is a tacite kinde of recommendation, a faire super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,

and to remoue those from thence, that haue receiued any

which like a Leprosie goes from one to another,

And the end of that which is past, is but a disposition
for that which is to come. Like a hungry Curre, who hath no

For it is a kind of salte and brackish water wherewith
couetous mans thirst cannot be quenched, for when he
hath taken this, and that other, and a world of things, he
gapes still for more. He is better satisfied by denying him
that which hee desireth, then by giuing him that, which
he craueth. And therefore publicke Ministers (if wee will

credit Diuinitie) should be so noble and so free, that they
should not onely not be couetous, but quite opposite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and to hold a particular hatred, and perpetuall enmitie
with couetousnesse. That they should not onely not receiue
giftes and presents, but that they should hate, and abhorre

and make no scruple to condemne the poore, who hath
nothing to giue him, and absolue the rich, who giues him
all that hee hath. For mony is an able <hi>Aduocate,</hi> and

For, if they will faithfully performe their Office,
they cannot fauour any, saue him that hath most right and

for him that gaue; or vniust, If they doe contrarie vnto

cease at last to steale; let them cease I say; And if they
will not cease, and giue ouer stealing, let them be cut off, and
set vpon the gallowes top. Neither let Kings cease to make
diligent search after them, and to execute iustice against them
in the most rigorous manner. And if they will not amend,
let them (a Gods name) be soundly punished. For it is a
foule and abominable Vice, pernicious, and pestilent, and
which doth much marre and deface the Luster of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer

Minister, be he neuer so illustrious and great. And
therefore in the Ciuill Law,<note place="margin">L. ff. ad l. Iul. rep. l. 3. ff. de recep &amp;c.</note> it hath the name of <hi>Sordes</hi>
giuen it; which signifies foulenesse, or beastlinesse. The
Emperour <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> (a great subduer of this vice)
when he saw any Minister noted thereof, his choller rose,
and his stomacke began to turne, and did prouoke him to
vomit, as if hee had seene some loathsome stinking thing.
And for such kinde of corrupt men he would vsually say,
hee had euer a fingar in readines, to plucke out their eyes.
And for the better informing himselfe of the truth of these
businesses, hee made choice of some vertuous and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
persons, whom hee sent secretly as Spyes into seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
parts of the Kingdome (which all wise Kings ought
to doe) giuing them good Intertainment for the defraying
of their charges, to the end, that they might truly informe
him of all whatsoeuer passed, as how his Ministers beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
themselues in their gouernment, how in their Offices?
Saying; That if they did abuse them, it was not enough to
remoue them onely, and put other in their places; but for
example sake, seuerely likewise to punish them. He gaue all
his Officers good honest maintenance, and sufficient allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and would by no meanes permit, that any Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
or publicke Office, should bee bought and solde. For he,
that buyes of me (sayd hee) must of necessitie sell to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for to quit his Cost, as also to make his best profit
and benefit thereof. Such as these, buy cheape in the grosse,
and sell deare by retaile. And so it is, that hee that buyes a
tree for money, can hardly afford the fruite for nothing.</p>

And these, whom you (my President) shall choose, or we

Law it selfe.</p>
               <p>Diuerse other ancient, and Moderne Lawes, and decrees
haue beene made, generally prohibiting all kind of gifts and
bribes, vpon paine of diuers very greiuous punishments,
to be inflicted vpon those, that either take, or giue bribes.
As paying double what was promised, or giuen; depriua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Office; The treble value of what was giuen; Then
(vpon the increasing of the abuse) a quadruple value.
And after that, Confiscation of goods, banishment, and
open infamie. <hi>Iustinian,</hi> added heereunto the punishment
of Whipping. And the Emperour <hi>Valens,</hi> and <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus,</hi>
farther increased the same, commanding, they should
be burned. And the now Emperours of <hi>Iapan,</hi> did lately
execute the sayd Law vpon one of his Fauourites Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
for taking of a bribe; and him that bribed him, (who
was Gouerner of a Kingdome) he caused to be beheaded.
<hi>Plato,</hi>

He trembled for feare, and yet his eyes, and

receiue from that blessed Apostle. Feare is not of force, to
detaine the Couetous; For Couetousnesse, is a huge great
riuer which if it once begin to make it's Current, bee it

did with that naughty Prophet, who hasted with great
furie to curse Gods people, that he might finger his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
gold. And though an Angell stood before him, and
stopp't his way, hee tooke another way, and brake through
thicke and thin (as they say) that hee might not loose his
reward;<note place="margin">Ioseph. de Antiq. lib. 4. cap. 5.</note> so farre (saith <hi>Iosephus)</hi> did the promises and gifts
of the <hi>Moabites</hi> preuaile with him, that hee chose rather for
his priuate interest, to please a King of the earth, then him
of Heauen. The Kings of Spaine haue likewise made some
Lawes with very sharpe and rigorous punishments, but all
not worth a pinne, because they are not executed. So that
this bad custome alone, is of more force, then all the lawes.
These are written with inke, on paper; Those, with letters of
gold on the heart. The Lawes threaten with roughnesse and
rigour; Money perswades with softnesse and gentlenesse, and
carryes mens mindes after it without contradiction. The
Lawes, haue few to defend them, &amp; to put them in execution.
But this euill custome, is of more force then the Law, &amp; hath
stronger Abettors. In a word, terrible are the forces and skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
of this foule assaulting vice, become now as it were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
vnto vs, and more vsed in these, then any other Times
whatsoeuer. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> ask't the <hi>Athenians</hi> (&amp; those which
are, may aske of those that haue bin) what were in those times
which are not in these? And himselfe makes the answer,
That one thing was now wanting vnto them; whereby those
that liu'd then, alwayes went away with the victory, &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:2459:60"/>
their libertie. Which was; The perpetuall hatred which
they bore vnto those, who suffered themselues to be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with mony. In stead whereof, it is now come to that
passe, that to receiue a bribe, is onely a nine dayes wonder;
if the same be confest, it is made a matter of laughter; if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
he that receiues, receiues a pardon for it; and he that
informes, sent away with a flea in his eare, and in stead of
a reward, receiues a round checke for his labour, &amp; growes
a hated man, and troublesome member in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
But vnfortunate is that Common-wealth, where
Corruption liues vncontrolled. And because this Vice goes
daily taking deepe roote, and grows still stronger and stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
inuenting new impudencies, new slightes and subtilties,
it is needefull that Kings should hunt Counter, and finde
out some new Tricke, to take these olde ones in the Trap.
And this one (me thinks) would be a pretty remedy for
this disease; That a Law were made, That of all those,
that should be nominated for Ministers and Officers pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
and particular in any Tribunall, or Ministry what
soeuer as well of Iustice, and gouernment, as of the publike
Treasurie, there should an Inuentorie be taken (by some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
for that purpose) of all their rents, and goods moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and vnmoueable, and when they are to take their
oath (as the fashion is) at their entrance into their Office,
the said Inuentory should be presented in open Court, and
there they made to sweare, and take a solemne oath that this
is a true Inuentorie, and that their Estate is thus and thus,
neither more nor lesse, or much there abouts, to the end that
when their states come to be increased, and their wealth
makes a great noyse in the world, it may (vpon better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie)
be knowen how, and which way, they came by
it. For experience daily teacheth vs, that your Iudges,
your Exchequer men, and other publike Officers, enter into
the Office with little, and goe out with much. And I
would, that the Kings Atturney generall, or one of like nature,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2459:61"/>
should enter an Action against all those Augmentations of
their Estates whereof they should not be able to render a
good Account. I could likewise wish, that they might be
sworne to that Law of <hi>Theodosius;</hi> That they neither gaue,
nor promised, by themselues, or by any other person, or

               <p>All this (say they) that you say, is true. We confesse
as much. But withall we must tell you, That that which
we receiue is <hi>subsidium gratuitum,</hi> a free gift, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eere gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitie,
with a great deale of loue, and good liking of the

which the <hi>Logicians</hi> tearme, <hi>Ad aliquid.</hi> Whereby he
that receiueth a courtesie, is bound to returne a courtesie.
And those which giue, hope to receiue from such Ministers,
that which they cannot iustly giue them. With these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
a gift is lawfull, and esteemed to be lawfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
when it comes free, vnclogg'd, disinteressed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
pretension, and without respect of requitall, or reference
to any recompence or retribution. That is a gift, which
goes dis-roabed of all respects which is neither a friend nor
kindsman, nor kindswoman of the party that giues it, and
hath no obligation, no Interest, no necessitie, but is all
pure loue, and is freely giuen of grace, onely to do him
good, that receiues it, The rest is Vsurie, Loane, br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

see, how euery man longs and desires, that that may
bee returned to the Owners, which they haue got by foule
play. It is a great blindenesse in Ministers, to imagine,
that what is giuen them, proceedes from liberalitie, and
out of the good will and loue they beare vnto them. God
he knowes, it is no such matter, but what they do in this
kinde, is only to corrupt them, and to oblige them to do
that, which they neither may, nor ought. Let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue

                  <hi>&amp; Commouit illos, quasi fluctus maris.</hi> Let them looke
well to themselues, that receiue gifts, for they run a great
deale of hazard; let them take heede, least some storme
arise that may drowne their ship, euen then (as often hath
beene seene) when she is deepest and richest laden. And
let them not trust to their taking in secret, nor of such,
and such a person; for the Diuine Sunne of Iustice, whom
they offend, will discouer and bring all to light. And
though no body should see or know it, it is enough that
God, and his own Conscience knowes it, which are two
sure Witnesses, besides many other, which time will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</p>
               <p>They likewise alleage, That they haue leaue and licence
of their Kings to receiue gifts. Whereunto, first of all I
answer; that it is not to be beleeued, that Christian
Kings, will grant such Licences as these, which are so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall,
pernicious, scandalous, and so contrary to the
Common good, and good gouernment of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
Secondly I say; (speaking with that reuerence
and respect, which is due vnto the authoritie of Kings)
that it cannot be grounded on good Diuinitie, that they
may giue any such leaue or licence vnto their Ministers.
Againe, they vrge, that sometimes, in some particular case,
gifts haue beene giuen to some great <hi>Priuado,</hi> or fauourite
of the King. It may be so; But sure I am, that to no
Counsellour of Iustice, can it euer iustly be, or may be
done. But because this will fall within the compasse of
our insuing discourse; I will cite those words; <hi>Timentes

For well will it suite, that with these, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this Chapter because the feare of God is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of wisedome. And from whence, as from their
fountaine, are deriued all those other good qualities, that
are in man. <hi>Timor Domini super omnia se superposuit:

that feares him, and hath him alwayes before his eyes,
hath libertie and power to ouercome the feare and dread
of the mightie, whereof the World doth stand (and all
for want of this feare) too much in awe. Among the Lawes
of <hi>Moses, Iosephus</hi> relateth one, wherein he willeth Iudes
that they should aboue all things preferre Iustice; and
that without respect to any mans person, or dignitie, they
should equally iudge all; For they hauing (as they haue)
heere vpon earth, the power of God, they ought not to
feare any other but him. He that preuaricates Iustice in
relation to great persons, makes them greater and more
powerfull then God; who giues vs this short but stoute
Lesson; <hi>Feare not him, that can kill the body, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

not true notice giuen them of worthy
persons, for to imploy them in his

sufficient, are clapt in betwixt them,
and home; Those are the men, that are
most intermitted, take most vpon them, and procure by
their Negociating and Plotting, to occupie the best places,
and not contenting themselues therewith, seeke to shut the
doore against men of merit, and to keepe them out, to the
end that their owne defects, by this course, may receiue the

                  </note> For this is the nature of things opposite
each to other, that the neerer they are one to the other, the
more excellent lays it's Contraryes defect, the more open.
Now to occurre to this mischiefe, wise <hi>Iethro</hi> aduised his
sonne in Law, that he should seeke out men of good parts,
and choose them (as we s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yd before) from amongst all the
people. And we shall better perceiue, what that Counsaile
comprehendeth, if we will but consider that other place of
<hi>Deuteronomy;</hi> Where <hi>Moses</hi> discoursing with the people,
what diligence he had vsed on his part, it is there mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that he spake vnto them, and admonished them (to
the end that the Election of the Ministers might take the
better) that they themselues likewise would vse their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences,
and then giue him notice of those persons, which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2459:64"/>
they held in greatest esteeme amongst them, and were (in
the generall opinion) the ablest men. <hi>Date ex vobis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>and knowen amongst your
Tribes, and I will make them Rulers ouer you.</hi> And indeed,
the best and surest course, that Kings can take, to come to
that notice or knowledge they desire, is to lay holde on
those persons, whose approbation is so notorious, that all
the people giue good Testimonie of them. For, (as a wise
man hath well obserued) the generall opinion, is that Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
which proueth or reproueth. For, it cannot be, that
One should deceiue All. And happily from hence grew that
Common Adage <hi>Vox populi, vox Dei:</hi> The Peoples voyce,
is Gods voyce. We must giue Credit to the fame and
report that goes of Men. For (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith) she some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
makes the choyse of Ministers; it being his meaning,
that this satisfaction should be giuen to the people, that
those, that are to gouerne them, should be chosen and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
by that common fame, and good report, that goes
of them. And heere by the way let me tell you, that it is
not much amisse, that some Offices, and Preferments be
in a dissembled kinde of disguise; purposely published be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they be bestowed, to see how it will be intertained and
receiued by the people; to whom it is fit some satisfaction
should be giuen, as being the body that is to be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
This is a Trick of State, whereof (vpon some occasions)
<hi>Fernando,</hi> surnamed the Wise, made good Vse. For when he
was to goe any great Voiage, vndertake any Warre, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
some new Enterprise, or any other action of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
he would not publish, nor iustifie the same to the
world, till he had vsed some art and cunning, imploying
some persons fit for that purpose (before his designes were
throughly vnderstood) to giue it out; That the King should
do well to make such, or such a wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re, to make this or
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2459:65"/>
that prouision, for this, or that reason. So that first of all,
the vulgar were made acquainted therewith and rested sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with the reasons that were rendred for it. And then
afterwards it comming to be published; that the King had
done, or would doe such a thing, it is incredible to beleeue,
with how much ioy, loue, and applause of the people, and
whole Kingdome, this his Resolution was receiued. But
mistake me not I pray; I do not say, that this is to be done
alwayes, but on some occasions, or great preparations. And
Kings in this case, must haue a care, that they haue faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Centinells, that may truly certifie them, how that Newes
takes, and what exception (if any arise) they make against
it, and vpon what grounds, that if any thing had beene
omitted, it might be amended A President (not vnlike to this)
had the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealth in those it's first flourishing
dayes. Which did cause their Lawes to be set vp in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

to the end, that the people might peruse them, and thinke
well vpon them. How much more ought this Course to

as are to command and gouerne a Common-wealth who

that they may loue them, respect them, and beleeue them, in
all they shall say, as they would their own fathers?</p>
               <p>I well perceiue, that there may be much deceit in the
world, and that there are some men so subtile and so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that only with a pen in their hand, they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
Masters of other mens studies, and labours, and by
this tricke gaine the credit and opinion of able and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
men, when as indeed they are nothing lesse. And
this deceit takes more in matter of learning and wisedome,
which (as we said before) cannot be measured out with
the yard. And in no place is this so common, as in
the Courts of Kings, where your purpurated persons (saith
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2459:65"/>
                  <hi>Seneca)</hi> meaning those, that abound in riches, and other
corporall ornaments, stand a loofe of from the Vulgar
and yet vse to be vulgar in their vnderstanding, to the
preiudice of the good and true esteeme of things; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
these kinde of men, those easily get the name and
fame of wise, who talke boldly, and spinne out a large
discourse of those things, which they well vnderstand not.
And it is daily seene, that some of these superficiall fellowes
haue beene preferr'd to better places by these their false
ostentations, and feigned knowledge, then great Learned
Clarkes, by shewing themselues humble-minded, temperate
in their talke, and moderate in their conuersation, could
euer attaine vnto. And if this did happen only in those
Sciences and faculties, which they call <hi>depone lucrando,</hi>
which are studied for to get temporall riches, it were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable,
because for this end, opinion is of more profit for
them, then Truth. But the griefe of it is, that this passeth
forward euen vnto those, that are professours of that
Science, which, as it is in it selfe superiour, so ought it
to make those, which professe the same superiour in minde
and vnderstanding, and make them much more to esteeme
the truth, and existency of wisedome and knowledge, then
false opinion, falsly gained amongst the lesse wiser sort of
men. Now, for the auoyding of these inconueniences, it
importeth much, that a King do not rely too much vpon
the opinions of the Vulgar, which in particular are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and ill grounded, but when they shall heare it general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spoken, that such a one is an eminent man in this, or
that other thing, and that he hath not his fellow in the
kingdome for these and these abilities, let the Counsell
be called, the Partie thus recommended, examined, and
let the King take information from them, that are euery
way as able as he, euen in that wherein he professes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
his crafts-master, whether they giue vp the same ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of him, or no; So that the fame, and opinion of a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2459:66"/>
good Souldiers, of a good Captaine, and of a good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour,
must be confirmed by the Testimonie of those
that are the best both Souldiers, Captaines, and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.
By this line, may you leuell, &amp; by this course secure the
approbation of all other Offices. And in those whose suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie
may be seene, and measured out by the suruay of Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls,
there cannot be so much deceit therein; but in those,
who are to serue a King and State, with great studies, and
with the knowledge of diuers faculties, as are your grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dignities, and Ecclesiasticall functions, where (as we
are taught by the Apostle S. <hi>Paul)</hi> there is necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
great learning, great integritie of life, and great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and therefore had more neede of examination and
triall. And I hold it for a great inconuenience, that the
iudgement of things of so high a nature should be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the relation of those, who are not onely farre from
being able to iudge, but scarce know how to speake truly
of them. By meanes whereof it is very vsuall with them, to
suffer themselues to be ouercome by deceit, and ouerswai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with passion, holding those for the best and worthiest,
and recommending them to the King for those high Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteries
and Offices, to whom, either they, or their friends,
and kinse folke, beare most affection, or are most beholding.
But opinion ought not to carry these things, vnlesse it be
confirmed with very good, and sure Testimonies.</p>
               <p>Much of this mischiefe will be remedied, if for these and
such like great Dignities and Offices, we should not rely
only vpon Fame, or that voice and report, which comes
a far off, and somtimes painted ouer with apparencies, and in
the maske and disguise of truth, being nothing else, saue
meere passion, but that we should looke a little neerer into
the inside of these persons, and grow by communication in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a fuller knowledge of them. Not that knowledge, which
some Ministers speake of, who are sayd to know only those
whom they preferre, or are willing to preferre, and only
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2459:66"/>
for that they haue heard them talke in ordinary matters of
complement, and base flatteries, which they vse more, which
haue all their wisedome in their lips, then those that are
truly graue and learned men. Mens witts, are not like the
water of a fountaine, which, at the first draught, our palate
findes to be thicke, or thin, salt, or sweete. It is like a Sea,
without a bottome; or like vnto a deepe riuer, to know
whose depth, we must wade through it from side to side.

In the sacred history of <hi>Genesis,</hi> we reade, that when the

of the primogenitureship to his elder sonne <hi>Esau, Iacob</hi>
came athwart him, and feigned himselfe to be <hi>Esau,</hi> (whom
his aged father meant to blesse) and in a distinct and cleare
voyce sayd vnto him;<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 21.</note> I am thy first begotten sonne <hi>Esau;</hi>
To whom the Patriarke made answer; <hi>Thy voyce</hi> seemeth
<hi>not to be the voyce of</hi> Esau, <hi>but of Iacob.</hi> And therefore,
<hi>Accede huc, vt tangam te fili mi: Come neere I pray thee
that I may feele thee (my sonne) whether thou be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> my very
sonne</hi> Esau, <hi>or not?</hi> Many there are, who boast themselues
to be elder brothers in vertue, and learning, and with
tricks and deuices, clad themselues (to shew) in sheepes
cloathing, but inwardly are rauening Wolues, and with
gifts and presents, (as <hi>Iacob</hi> heere did) incline, or peruert
the mindes of Ministers, that they giue them credit, and
beleife, stealing by this meanes the blessing away, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
prioritie of place, being indeed younger brothers in
their deserts. And we are to consider that in this History,
there did concurre two things, which were sufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the Patriarke. The first, that he was blinde or at least
very dimme sighted; For (as wee said before) when this
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2459:67"/>
propounding or nominating of such persons, is left to the
will of those, that are blinde, or ignorant in these matters,
there is not any thing done therein, which is not full of
deceit. The second, That the voyce was far different, from
the person whom he felt. The like vsually happeneth in
that matter which we haue now in hand. For there shall
goe a voyce, and fame, and a true opinion of such a man,
that he hath very worthy parts, but comming vpon the first
sight to those Ministers, which are to preferre him, he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to be another manner of man, from that which hee
truly is. And the reason of it is, for that (like the blinde)
they only feele, touch, and examine these wise men, when
as indeede they should conforme themselues to the settled
voyce, and receiued opinion of the learned, who are better
seene in these matters, and haue a deeper knowledge of
them. Anciently, the people did meere all together, and
with a generall and common voyce did nominate him to
be their Bishop whom they thought to be the fittest man,
and most worthy the Episcopall Sea. And this was then
held the fairest and surest Course. For (to speake morally)
it is not likely (as we said before) that one single man,
should deceiue so many, nor draw the votes and suffrages
of all the whole multitude vnto him, vnlesse he had parts
and abilities deseruing this their approbation. Many most
holy men, and great Prelates, as <hi>Ambroses, Gregories, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostomes,</hi>
and other learned, and graue Diuines, haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
their preferments by such Nominations as these. But
this kinde of Election (now some yeares since) was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
(esteeming it the fittest and the surest way) to the
voyces, and suffrages of your Deanes and Chapters of
Cathedrall Churches. But, because in humane things
there is such little stabilitie and firmenesse, your popular
dissensions inforced them (for the greater ease and quiet of
the Common-wealth) that your Kings (by concession of
the chiefe Bishops) should haue the nominating of them.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2459:67"/>
And no doubt, but it was well ordained by them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
that as those their Royall persons, are of so superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
a degree, and so free from respects of humane businesses
(for these are wont to worke vpon the mindes of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
men) so the nomination, that passeth through their
hands, is by much the more certaine. For, as they are
Kings and Rulers ouer the people, God doth inlighten
them (so as they do not dis-deserue this light, or be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
vnto him, for the making of a good and iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
choise.)<note place="margin">Prou, 16. 10.</note>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Creation of the vaste Vniuerse,
God shewed his great Omnipotencie,
and his infinite wisedome in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of those things, which hee
placed therein, with such a concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
and harmonie, that <hi>Diuus Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
confesseth that it could not be
mended, without some dissonancie,
and iarring. And he citeth the example of a well tuned
Viall, wherein it is not possible to straine a string, but the
consonancie in all the rest is quite marred. This was that
which the Wiseman said; That with weight, number, and
measure, God had created, and ordered all his Creatures.
So that the parts of the Vniuerse, haue amongst themselues
that proportion, that in euery one, and all ioyntly, there
are found these three Circumstances, weight, number and
measure. But that, which is spoken in the booke of <hi>Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
touching the gouernment of all this huge <hi>Machina,</hi>
is of greater consideration. For God touching (as being
infinitely powerfull) the extremes and ends of all things
in the disposing of them, he doth it with a great deale of
sweetnesse. He did set an inuiolable Law, a settled and
determinate Seate (as being the Author of Nature) to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it selfe; to the end, that euery thing conseruing it
selfe with in it's owne proper bounds and limits, it should
not be confounded with the rest. And from hence grew a
most sweete and pleasing harmonie of all this great frame
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2459:68"/>
of the World, so well tuned, and so well ordred, that it
alone voyceth and Proclaymeth the wisedome, and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie
of the Creator. What a goodly thing is it, to
see the continuall Motion of the Celestiall bodies? The
perpetuall influence, sixednesse, &amp; resplendour of the Planets
and of other starres? The fire, in it's sohere? The Ayre,
the Water, and the Earth, in their most firme and stable
Mansions? And only by vertue of that first Law which
God settled in his first Creation? Out of this Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
and admirable accord, and agreement of things na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
is to be drawne the politicall consent and attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Common-wealth, appointing to euery one his
site, his place, and his certaine limits of Iurisdiction for
that Office, that shall be put vpon him, without once thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to haue it altered or changed. And it is the obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the wise, and men of much experience, that if it
might bee inuio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ably kept, and might bee established as an
inuariable and vnchangeable decrce in the brest of the King
and his Counsellours, that those of one Counsell should
not be transferred and put ouer to another; nor be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
from that wherein they are already placed, vnlesse it be
to your Presidentships of your Chanceries, and Visits of
the Kingdome, and that they themselues of euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Councell should haue the nominating of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents,
it would in matter of gouernment be of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.
First of all, by these meanes would cease those
anxieties, vexations, and cares, wherewith all of them liue,
of being translated from one Councell to another; as also
that extraordinary negociating and labouring for this end
and purpose. Those that are of the Councell of <hi>Hazienda,</hi>
pretend to be preferred to that of the <hi>Indies, &amp; de los Ordines.</hi>
And when they haue attained to these, they aspire to that
of <hi>Castile.</hi> So that out of this ambitious humour, none of
them sticke fast, or keepe firme footing; but from the very
first day, wherein they enter into one of these Councells,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2459:69"/>
their mindes are wandring, pretending to better themselues
by chopping and changing from Councell to Councell. And
the mischiefe of it is; That in these Pretensions, they wast
and spend that time, which they should bestow in study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those points, which belong to their own Tribunall. For
the curing of this sore, in the Councell of the <hi>Indies,</hi> in
former times, those Counsellours had a larger allowance
and greater Pension, then any of the other Councells, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
them thereby to settle themselues where they were
placed, without pretending to budge, or to leape from one
Councell into another, making themselues thereby capable
of all those difficult businesses of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which good
effect then ceased, when the Salaries were made all a like.
And if this Order which I speake of, had beene well and
truly kept, the disorder which is in these pretensions of
change, had beene remedied, and men would haue beene
more practicke, and better seene in those businesses, which
are treated in euery one of them, being so different, and
of so great consequence, and so hard to be vnderstood,
that they will require the study and assistance of many
yeares to vnderstand and know them aright. And (as
the holy Ghost sayth) it is contrarie to the rules of good
gouernment, and of prudence, to put one vpon that
he vnderstands not, and to commit weighty affayres vnto
him, who vndertaking them (as being tyed thereunto by
his imployment) knowes not whether he be in the right,
or no, though perhaps he presume he is. Likewise, there
should be much more care had in the prouision of those
places of other Audiencies, and inferiour Courtes of
Chancerie, to the end that in them might be bred vp such
subiects, in qualitie, learning, and vertue, that out of them,
Election might be made of fit men for greater Counsells.</p>
               <p>And that the Presidents should be chosen out of the
said Councells in which they were bred vp, it is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient,
and grounded vpon good reason, For, hauing
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2459:69"/>
beene conuersant in them some yeeres, by the concourse
of so many things, as dayly offer themselues, thereby will be
better knowen, their talent, and capacitie, their truth, their
treating, their integritie, and all the worth and parts of
their person, whereby the election that shall be made, will
be much the better, more certaine in the things vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and more safe and secure in matter of conscience.
And who is he can doubt, but that those Counsailours,
which haue beene for a long time in your supremer Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
will haue greater knowledge of the qualitie and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of those businesses, which are treated in them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with those necessary circumstances, which make for
their better expedition. Besides, they will more prefectly
know the State, wherein the businesses of that Tribunall
stand, without being driuen to haue recourse vnto others
to be better informed, spending and loosing much time
therein. Againe, they know, (which is a matter of no
small consideration) the rest of the Counsailours, as also
their condition, their abilitie, their cleannesse of hands
and heart, and their good, or bad parts, for there, better
then else where, are they discouered. And this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is very necessary in Presidents, for to deliberate, and
make choise vpon all occasions, of the fittest persons, that
are to be trusted, with businesses of importance. And it is
of no lesse consequence to take notice of the suitors and
pretenders, for to know how to carry themselues towards
them, &amp; to take particular knowledge of the good customes,
ceremonies, preheminencies and priuileges of those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,
that they may be kept and obserued, and that the
authoritie of the Tribunall may be maintained, and all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes
and Competitions a voyded.</p>
               <p>All these things are learned with time, and that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
which euery one hath of his proper Councell,
wherein it is very requisite, that the President be a Master
and not a Schollar, as he is, who enters newly into a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2459:70"/>
though he haue serued many yeares in another: and
of no little inconuenience are the nouelties, which they
both attempt and do, who are admitted without this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
being desirous to accommodate, and order things
according to the measure of their own d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

the want of experience be in Counsailours a matter
of much consideration, and may be tolerated and borne
withall in some; yet in realtie of truth, the lacke thereof
in a President, is intolerable, and very preiudiciall to the
whole Common-wealth; And from thence arise many
great mischiefes, and those remedilesse. For some out of
ignorance, and some out of flatterie, do leane to their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
whereby many vniust decrees passe, whilest the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
and wiser sort, (which euermore are the fewer)
haue not power equall to their sufficiencie, to turne the
course of the streame. And for this reason, so many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
offer themselues, so many differences are raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

that he, that is to be the Head or President of the

the rest, in the dignitie and hight of his Office, yet for all
this, God would not, that he should be made of any other

he should not besome great block-headed Lord, or a man
without wit, or learning, that in his carriage and manner
of life, he should seeme to be cut out of another peece of

fashion, and profession. And that the President of euery
Councell, should be chosen from amongst the Counsailours
themselues, that they be moulded out of the same Masse and
lumpe, as well the feete, as the head, that there goe (as we
say) but a payre of sheares betweene them, and that they
be clad all in one and the same liuerie. And God giuing order
to his Vice-roy (and in it, to all Kings) how he was to
choose a President, that should be the Head and ruler

To the end that Kings may vnderstand, and all the World
may know, of how great importance it is, that the Members
and Head, Counsailours, and Presidents, should in their
qualities and conditions, be very conformable, sithence that
heerein he would not dispence with himselfe, much lesse
therefore with others, and for this cause Presidents ought
still to be chosen out of the same Councells, <hi>Ex eodem loco,
eiusdem gentis, &amp; de numero fratrum suorum:</hi> Out of the
same place, the same people, and from amongst their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
And if Counsailours might haue the hope of such
increase of honour in their persons, it would make them
much better then they are, and they would study to win
themselues credit, and to cumply in all things with their
obligation, seruing with carefullnesse and satisfaction as well
to give their Kings good content, as that they againe, might
take notice thereof, and in their greatest occasions imploy
them in their seruice. This rule did that great gouerner of
Gods people <hi>Moses</hi> obserue, who hauing (as wee savd) vsed
diligence for to seeke out persons, which might helpe him,
furnished with those qualites afore-mentioned, made a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution

worthy the noting, that (as he himselfe affirmeth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

rulers ouer the rest. For, when in noblemen, concurre the

they likewise are to haue a care, that they
keepe it, by not altering businesses, nor
remouing either them, or the men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
imployed, out of their proper places,
for from the trucking and bartring of
these things, from this chopping and
changing, great inconueniences, and
mightie troubles, are wont to rise in gouernment. What
a strange thing would it be, nay, what would become of
vs all, if that order which God placed (as we told you)
in this <hi>Machina</hi> of the World, should he altred? if the
earth should get vp aboue the Ayre, and the Ayre should
passe beyond the Spheare of fire, what were this, but to
destroy the World? So good gouernment in like manner
is destroyed, by the Ambition and Couetousnesse of those,
who not contented with their imployments and places,
draw businesses out of their right Current, for to make
themselues Lords and Masters of all, and to pursue, by this
meanes, their idle vanities, ambitious humours, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
interest. The Holy Ghost, in that Misticall booke of the
<hi>Canticles,</hi> compares the Gouernment of the Church to a
well ordred Army, or p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ranked on the one side, the shot on the other, the horse in
a third, and all the rest in their due places appointed for
them. And in this well ordring and marshalling of the
Men, consisteth the strength of an Army. A Christian,
and Church like Common-wealth, by the good order that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2459:73"/>
is kept therein,<note place="margin">Cant. 6. 4.</note> is as Terrible as an Army with banners
to it's Enemies, and as beautifull as <hi>Tirzah,</hi> and comely as
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in the sight both of God, and Man. And when
Kings do hit right the distribution of their Offices, and
in giuing to euery one, that which is fitting for him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his condition and qualitie, most certaine it is,
that euery man shall get aduantage thereby and proue
morè excellent in his proper place and Office, then those
can be, who haue beene imployed in other Offices and
places. And that they, who haue beene deputed to such
a Councell and well exercised therein, shall far better know
what belongs thereunto, then those that haue not had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
and knowledge thereof. Euermore presupposing,
that with the foresayd care and diligence, choise hath beene
made of the most sufficient. For which reason, we are to
giue credit to euery one in particular, and to all ioyntly
in their Ministries, as to selected persons, and such as are
their crafts-Masters, in these kinde of matters. For (as

Euery one is wise in his owne Art, Knowing therein
both how to speake, and do. According to this ground,
Kings cannot doe any thing better or surer for the good
gouernment of their Kingdomes, and satisfaction of their
Consciences, then to giue credit to each Councell in that
which appertaineth vnto them, and to leaue vnto their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Councellours and Councels the Dispatch of all
your running businesses without any particular Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
vnlesse it shall more neerely concerne the State, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
as the King ought onely to be the Iudge, and to giue
his resolution, what he will haue therein to be done; So
likewise must he lend them his hand and authoritie, as far
forth as is fitting, proportionable to the bulke and qualitie
of their Office, without which they cannot well exercise
the same. Where as not to giue them that, which they
iustly deserue, is a great impediment to their cumplying
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2459:74"/>
with the occasion to which are the substantiall part of their
obligation, and giues occasion to others, not to yeeld them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
&amp; respect, which are the raines of that bridle, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the people are to be restrained and ruled. And together
with this, they themselues must helpe to sustaine the weight
and charge of gouernment, wherein they haue so great a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift of glorious memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
was much commended for the great care he tooke in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
the authoritie of his Ministers. And it is not to be
doubted, but those ancient graue Ministers, whom the
people reuerenceth and respecteth for the place wherein
they are, and for the opinion which they haue gained by
their yeares, and experience, and for the authoritie they
haue to do either well, or ill, and for that power they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse,
and which the Lawes grant vnto them ouer mens liues,
and goods, may doe much in authorizing, or disauthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
not onely all that they doe, but euen the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
Hence will issue this other benefit, that a great part
of your Audiences (too ordinary arrouble with Kings) will
be much lessened, whereby they shall be the more disoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied,
and recouer greater force and strength for to treat
of waightier affaires, not wasting and spending to times in
matters of lesser moment. And this bad and old custome
ought to haue it's leggs broken and heereafter be disina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for attributing vnto Kings those resolutions, that are
disagreeable and displeasing to the people. For albeit those
ineuitable, offences and distastes, which sometimes cannot
be auoyded, ought to be indured, and passed ouer with
dissimulation, for the publicke good, yet is it not safe to
procure them for euery particular thing, nor that all men
should know, that all their dammages and hinderances
proceede from the supreme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of the King. And it is as
olde, as vsuall a fashion with your Ministers, when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
murmure at them, (I cannot tell whether it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
with that wisedome and loyaltie which they owe to their
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2459:74"/>
King) to lay the fault on their superiour, and the people
easily intertaineth it, and apprehends it, to be so. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they throw all the stones, that they can at him, and
although they cannot reach him, yet is it not fit, that they
should grow to that insolency and contempt.</p>
               <p>Let Kings, by all possible meanes excuse those <hi>Iuntas,</hi>
or References, which haue lately beene introduced for the
deciding of businesses; a thing as ill receiued in common,
as desired by the Ministers; and that for many reasons.
First, that the people, and the Parties, may not thinke,
or say, that it is done to oppresse them, by putting busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
out of their Course, and recommending them to a
few selected persons, that they may so end them, as he
desireth, who hath the nominating of them. Secondly, that
they may not draw vpon themselues the hatred and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of those resolutions they shall take, if they shall be either
in offence and distast of the people, or of the Partie whom it
concerneth. Thirdly, because there is no cause or reason, why
they, that are trusted with all other publike businesses, should
not likwise be trusted with particular greiuances. Fourthly, be
cause your ordinary Councels haue more experience of those
businesses, which they treate dayly, then your <hi>Iuntas</hi> haue,
which are formed of different Councels, wherin vsually, there
are many which scarce know the first Principles of that, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they are to treate, &amp; must be guided &amp; directedby those,
which are taken out of that Councell, which is acquainted
with these kind of businesses. Or if they will not confesse this,
by their ignorance, and by their Competition, they deferre at
least, if not vtterly ouerthrow the resolution that should be
taken in the businesse For, being (as they are) composed of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Tribunalls, they neither loue, nor trust one another nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
know they how to yeeld each to other, but grow stiffe &amp;
obstinate, and attend onely to shew their wit &amp; learning vpon
those that are vnuerst in those affaires. Whilest in the meane
while it succeedeth with mens businesses, as it doth with those
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2459:75"/>
diseases and sicknesses, which are discust and debated by
many Physitians who whilst they are diuided in opinion,
and one would haue this, and another that, the time of
the cure is past. Fiftly, for the credit and authoritie of the
King, as also of the Councels themselues; for when that
which belongs to these Counsailours and their President,
is taken out of their hands by artifice and cunning, and
is recommended to others, in no hand can be excused the
note and suspition, that either the King hath erred in the
Election which he made of these his Counsellours, or that
they do not do their duty, because that which did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
appertaine vnto them, is taken from them, and put
ouer to others. And as it should be a fault in a Prince,
not to trust his Ministers, if they deserue to be trusted; so
is it likewise, if they dismerit that trust, to continue them
in that place. And therefore that Minister from whom
there can be had no good satisfaction, let him be put out
of his Office. For to keepe him in it, argues either weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in a Prince, or an euill Conscience. Sixtly, That
that may not by your Discoursists, and Wits (as they call
them) whereof Kings Courts are full, diuine afore hand,
what is treated in those <hi>Iuntas,</hi> which are no sooner had,
but the end of them is knowne; a thing which cannot
but be of infinite inconuenience for all affaires, and more
particularly in those, which as they are of more importance,
so doe they require more reseruednesse. Seuenthly, because
Ministers may haue time and place for to heare Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
which they cannot haue, nor be able to remedy matters,
nor to vnderstand them, vnlesse they may haue the hearing
of them. And though this complaint, be without fault on
the Counsailours part, I am sure it is not without punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of those, that are to negociate with them. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because it is a great errour and intolerable burthen, to
tye two or three, to the dispatch of many businesses of pea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,
and of warre, of the Exchequer, &amp; of the state, and of diuers
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:2459:75"/>
other things, which dayly offer themselues; for, (as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
teacheth, reason requireth, and inconuenience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes
it) it is impossible to giue a good issue and dispatch
to all, nay scarce to the least part of businesses. For a man is
not made of brasse, that hee should be able to indure the
trouble of so many <hi>Iuntas,</hi> at least his spirits will be so spent,
that he will be able to doe little seruice in those that are
last treated. Counsai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ours know not, like Angels, <hi>Diuino
intuitu,</hi> but as Men, by way of discourse: and in this they
are tyred out, and ouer-wrought; and it is not possible, that
at the latter end of the day, they should be so quicke and
nimble, as at the first hower, after they haue taken paines all
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> day long. For this vertue is granted to spirits, which
know and comprehend things without measure, or weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnesse.
Mans vnderstanding is finite, and hee said not
ill, that said; The sence, which is occupied in many things
is weakened by euery one of them. And in that repart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and diuision, which that Euangelicall father of his
familie, made of the Talents amongst his seruants he gaue
vnto euery one of them, <hi>Secundum propriam virtutem.</hi> He
measured their abilities, and conformable thereunto impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a charge vpon them. How many doe groane vnder the
burthen of those offices, which they beare, without being
able to vndergoe them; yet will not they leaue these, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their ambition does not leaue them. But rather ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
themselues to the gust and Palate of their King, and
out of a disordinate desire they haue to grow still greater
and greater, they are well content with loade vpon loade,
and neuer cry Ho, because they neuer thinke they haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
And so not complying (as indeed they cannot)
with their obligation, businesses are retarded, and goe not
on in that good way as they should, and both they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and they that put them into these places, liue with
little or no securitie of conscience. But if it be the Kings
will and pleasure, and that hee thinke it fit for his greater
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2459:76"/>
satisfaction that some one particular man that is eminent
in the profession of that businesse, which is to be treated,
shall treate thereof, and shall see and peruse it, a gods name
(if he will haue it so) let his will be fulfilled: yet with all,
let his Maiestie take his opinion, as of a particular person,
and hauing receiued it, let it be disputed, discussed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
by the body of the Councell, such as haue beene
beaten in these kinde of businesses, and are throughly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with these matters; for by this meanes, that
which is pretended, shall the better be effected, and many
the fore-mentioned inconueniences be excused. Amongst
those Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> when that Common-wealth was
sole Mistris of all the world, and when it was likewise
vnder the Empire and Command of one onely <hi>Monarke,</hi>
we neuer read, that it euer admitted of more then the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Councells for the dispatch of businesses. <hi>Augustus
Caesar,</hi> a Prince of excellent prudence, and his great <hi>Minion
Mecaenas,</hi> in matter of Counsaile, can sufficiently confirme
this Doctrine, being that he himselfe was one of those, that
treated businesses in the ordinary Councells. And he had
a respect and consideration thereunto in that extraordinary

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erius</hi> the Emperour who was one
of the subtilest and craftiest Princes, that euer the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire knew, would not for all his great strength of wit, &amp;
cunning dissimulation, wherein he was his Arts-Master,
venter vpon any innouation farther then this, to passe ouer
his opinion to this, or that other Councell, but neuer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
any particular <hi>Iunta</hi> for the same, as one who
knew very well, that onely in so doing he should haue
but laded his own shoulders with the weightinesse of the
Case, and the successe of the Cause. Onely your <hi>Iuntas,</hi>
are to be vsed vpon some great and extraordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and not vpon euery trifling businesse, as is now and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2459:76"/>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sons of these Councells. If the number
be not sufficient for the dispatch of businesses, let it rather be
increased, then that by this other course, he that is Master
and Lord of all, should likewise make himselfe Master of all
wrongs and grieuances, and of that which the aggrieued
will conceiue of him; which hatching imagination of theirs,
will bring forth (that <hi>Cocatrice</hi> of Kings) most venemous
hatred. By that, which wee haue both read, seene and
heard, it is easie to be collected, that this was meerely an
Introduction of the Ambitious, who indeauoured by this
meanes to haue all things passe through their hands, and
depend vpon their will. And this, as if it had beene a thing
of inheritance, hath gon along in descent from one age to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
euen to these our present times. That particular Councell
which Kings formerly had, and in effect all of them still
haue, that more reserued secret Councell with whom they
communicate their in wardest thoughts, let it (a Gods name)
be superiour to all the rest, which supplying, as in those three
<hi>potentiae</hi> or faculties, the very place and soule as it were of
the Prince, it is very fit and conuenient, that it should iudge
of the actions, and Resolutions of all your Ordinary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,
and that they should all wayte vpon this, and attend
their pleasure, and that they should likewise treate of all those
great businesses, which the Ancient, and more especially,
<hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> called <hi>Arcanaimpery,</hi> Misteries of State,
and secrets of the kingdome. But for the rest, let them be
left to their Ordinary Councells for so shall they receiue
quicker dispatch, and all sutes be more easily ended, and
things carryed with lesse labour of the one, and fewer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of the other. And let it likewise suffice euen the
greatest intermedlers of these Ministers, that they haue a hand
in publicke businesses, without offering for their priuate inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
to draw things out of their ordinary course, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2459:77"/>
tracke whereinto they were put, making themselues
thereby hated and abhorred of all those that haue any thing
to doe with them. For at last they will come to sent and
winde out their driftes, to know all their doublings and
shiftings, and to watch them at euery turne, and when they
haue them at aduantage, neuer poore Hare was so hardly
followed by Hounds, as these will be pursu'd to death by
them, whom the others powerfullnesse with his Prince, did
seeke to crush and keepe vnder. It were well that these great
Ministers, would weigh and consider with themselues, that
as they haue their hands already too full of worke, so haue
they more complaints against them, then they would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
heare of, and more enuie at the heeles of them, then
they can well shake of, and therefore (if they were wise)
they would anoyd (as much as in them lyes) to draw these
mischiefes more and more vpon themselues.</p>
               <p>In great resolutions indeed, Kings are not to giue way,
that they should be taken out of the Councells of State,

be qualified for such by his Priuy Counsellours, as finding
themselues iustly offended, in that hee hath not imparted
his minde vnto them, nor communicated with them in the
Common wealths affaires, especially if they be of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
The principall cause, why there was ordained a
Councell of State, was; That it might serue to helpe the king
(whom principally this Body representeth) to beare the
Popular charge, which euermore iudgeth of things by the
euents; and though now and then they fall out ill, and the
people thereupon ready to murmure and mutinie, yet are
they the better bridled, and appeased by the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2459:77"/>
of these Counsellours. The Office of a King hath
trouble inough with it, burthen inough, and therefore they
should not aduise him to lay more vpon himselfe without
lawfull and necessary cause. And because, when I treated of

Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth was wont to Say; That the
Councell of State, is the whole wisedome, power, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of the King; That it is his Eyes, his hands, and
his feete; And that himselfe, should often sit in Counsell and
without it not to do, or conclude any thing that is of any
weight, or moment.</p>
               <p>The qualities required to make a perfect Counseller in this
Councell are many; As that he be a man of much courage,
truth, and integritie, and well seene in matters of State and
Gouernment, publick, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>uate, of peace, and of warre;
for he is to aduise in all; A man of good yeares, great
vertue, much authoritie, and of no meane credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;
That he be very skilful in those businesses, which
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2459:78"/>
he treateth; That he vnderstand them well, and be his Crafts-Master
in that facultie. That he be of a prompt and sharpe
wit; That his tongue be well hangd, and be able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
himselfe so happily, that he may be truly vnderstood.
That he haue a minde free from all by respects, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Loue, nor Feare, may detaine him from vttering what
he thinketh; That he beare an especiall loue and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to his King; That he keepe his hands cleane, and not
suffer himselfe to be ouercome by couetousnesse. For he,
that in whatsoeuer is propounded, presently apprehends
what is best, and vnderstands what is proffitable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient,
yet neither knoweth, nor hath fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ting words to
declare himselfe, it is all one, as if he vnderstood it not.
And he that can play both these parts passing well, yet
loueth not his Master, his conseruation and augmentation
of honour, this man will hardly be true and trusty vnto
him, and scarcely adiuse him to that which is fitting for
him. But suppose he hath all these good qualities, yet if
he giue way to be won by the loue of money, and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse
of gaine, all that shall be treated with him, shall be
saleable, no whit weighing the benefit, and authoritie of
his King, if the insatiable, hunger of riches be put in the
scale. And I say moreouer, that he, that shall want these two
qualities, and shall not loue his King, and yet loue Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse,
though he be indewed with all the rest, he shall
thereby be so much the worse, and more dangerous, for
hauing his will depraued, and his vnderstanding ill affected,
hauing these two Vices attending on him, how much the
more shall his sharpnesse of wit be, and the greater his
force of E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>quence, the worse effects will it worke, and
the more remedilesse. Let Counsellours therefore haue
these two qualities, Loue of the heart and cleannesse of
the hand, together with good naturall partes, as a quicke
wit, and nimble apprehension, for the speedier determining
of present businesses, and not onely to giue sodaine, but
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2459:78"/>
sound aduise in them. And that in future cases, they may
be able by naturall discourse to giue a guesse, how things
are like to succeede; as also, that they may by good dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and debating of businesses, attaine vnto those things,
whereof as yet they haue not had particular experience.
That they be prudent discerners of the better and the worse
in Cases doubtfull, that they may not be to seeke, but to
goe through stitch therewith and be prouided for all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.
In a word, let them be excellent sodaine speakers
vpon all occasions, assisted as well by a naturall kinde of
gift they haue that way, as by the exercise of their wit.
All which will not serue the turne, nor make the Mill
go so roundly as it would, vnlesse there be much amitie
amongst them, and a conformitie of good agreement, and
a willing helping and assiting one of another in businesses.
For, from Competitions and Contestations amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
haue insued the losse of Kingdomes, and States, and
other great losses and Calamities.<note place="margin">Ley. 29. Tit. 9. Part. 2.</note> They must bee of one
accord, and one will with their King, and still aduise him
to the best, hauing an eye both to him and themselues, that
they doe not erre, or doe any thing contrary to that which
is right and iust. And then is it to be vnderstood, that
they beare true loue to their King, and Countrie, and that
they apply themselues to all that, which concernes the
common good, and their owne particular seruice, when
they take ioy and comfort, that they concurre, and runne all
one way without diuision or distraction. And if this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
be not amongst them, it is to be imagined, that they loue
not so much the King, and State, as their owne priuate
interest. Being thus qualified, they shall be fit Ministers
and Counsellors for so great a Counsell, for they shall ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
be able to rid as many businesses as shall be brought
before them, and giue them good and quicke dispatch,
well vnderstanding what is needefull to be done, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:2459:79"/>
as well how to declare themselues in that which they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.</p>
               <p>And in this or any other Councell, there ought (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Fadrique Furio)</hi> a care to be had, to examine the
merits and dismerits of euery one, informing themselues of
his life, behauiour, and abilities, as also the Actions, of those
who without suing, deserue for their vertue, to haue fauour
showen them; and likewise to take notice of those who
desire this preferment. And that for this purpose there be a
Register or Book<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> kept of the merceds, and fauours to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
and of the persons that are well deseruing, to the end
that those honours and fauours may be thrown vpon them,
according to the vertue, sufficiencie, and merits of the men.
For he, that depriues Vertue of that honour that is due
thereunto, doth (in <hi>Cato's</hi> opinion) depriue men, of vertue
it selfe. And when fauours are afforded those which not
deserue them, or are forborne to be bestowed on those that
merit them, vertue receiues a great affront, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
a notable losse. And it will proue the greater
if honour be added to the bad, and taken from the good;
and that vice, shall be better rewarded, then vertue. For
where she is not esteemed, and rewarded, the vertuous liue
like men affronted, and that are banished the Court. King
<hi>Nabucodonosor, Assuerus,</hi> and others, haue kept such a booke
as this, wherein were commanded to be recorded the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
that were done them, and the persons deseruing, to the
end they might gratifie them, and cast their gracious fauours
vpon them. And this is very necessary in all well ordred
Common-wealth, to the end that all might indeauour to
take paines, and study to deserue well. For reward inciteth
men to labour; And (as <hi>Salust</hi> saith) were it not for hope of
reward, few or none would be good. It makes much likewise
for the honor and credit of Kings. For in no one thing can
they gaine themselues greater reputation, then by honouring
those, that are good, and vertuous.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:2459:79"/>
The <hi>Romans</hi> had likewise another Councell which was
called by the name of <hi>Censura,</hi> or Reforming of manners,
which did not in the Common-wealth permit publicke
delinquents, which might cause either trouble, or scandall
to the State, and to the end, that such ill disposed persons,
might not escape punishment. For, where there is neither
hope of reward, nor feare of punishment, there can we haue
no good thing, no Common-wealth, nor no Congregation
of men to last and continue; when as the good and vertuous
are not rewarded, nor the lewd and seditious punished.
For if one part of the body be infirme, and be not holpen
in time, the maladie extends it selfe, and goes creeping and
spreading it selfe ouer all the whole body. And therefore it is
sitting, that Ministers should haue an eye, to see what vices,
what disorders, what ill corrupted manners disturbe and
molest a Kingdome, and to haue a care to cleanse and cure
the Common-wealth of them, dealing with them for the
publicke good, as wise Physitians do for the Bodyes-safety
Who, in the curing of infirmities, for the securing of the
whole, cauterize this or that member, and if neede be cut
it off. Now your infirmities and diseases, which are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knowne, are as easily cured (a great meanes of the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
resting in the discouerie.) but those which with time
waxe olde, grow in a manner incurable; (the Aliment, and
fomenting of them, consisting most in their concealement,)
For as in suffering and dissembling a fore, it but rankles the
more, and of ill, becomes worse; So to beare with insolent
offenders, and to winke at their foule faultes, is; as if a man
should fauour a wound too much; wherby, as it, so do they
daily grow wors<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and worse. For it is too too well knowne,
that to malignant dispositions, the more lenitie, is but the
more licence of offending, and open mercie proclaimed,
Crueltie.</p>
               <p>Let the end of this discourse be, that the Councells and
Counsellers being seated and setled in the forme aforesaid,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2459:80"/>
the King likewise apply himselfe to treat truth with them,
and to deale plainely with them, in whatsoeuer businesses
shall offer themselues to be debated of. And let him not
perswade himselfe, that there are too few of euery Councell,
for if they be chosen and selected men, few will suffice; and
many, serue to no other end but to trouble each other, and
to delay businesses. For howbeit it be true, that it is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
good to heare the opinions of all for to ventilate
and sifte out a cause throughly, yet the determination ought
to passe through the hands of a few, but withall good, and
experienced persons, that they may not erre in their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
Of the Emperour <hi>Alexander Seuerus,</hi> (who was a
man of singular wisdome) it is reported, that for the resolution
of those businesses, which he vndertooke, he called onely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

And very necessary is that pause and breathing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Kings goe ripening great businesses; And exceeding
fit it is, that they should goe soberly to worke, take time and
leasure inough, and that in their consultations they should

steele. Which being once well grounded, and both the
Conueniences, and Inconueniences throughly weighed,
(though in these great and weighty affaires, there are neuer
some wanting, that will follow that part, which hath least

on in an orderly Course, or shall imitate in their constancie
those naturall causes, and shall be punctuall and faithfull
in their Ministries, the gouernment ought not to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or receiue any change. But when they shall faile in their
obligation, another order must be taken with them. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I say, that in some cases, the best &amp; surest course that can
be taken, is; That Kings proceede after another kinde of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
by being serued by other Ministers, and Counsellers that
they may comply with that which tends to the seruice of
God, and the good of their kingdomes. Especially, when (as
hath bin said) Ministers abuse that power which is giuen them
&amp; make it the meanes to afflict the good, and to doe other
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2459:82"/>
wrongs and iniuries. And this, the sacred Scripture teacheth
vs in that History of <hi>Daniel,</hi>

                  </note> where it is reported, that when
<hi>Shadrach,</hi> and his two Companions were cast into the fiery
fournace, the kings Ministers caused the fournace to be heated
so hot, that the flames of fire ascended some 49. Cubits high.
But by how much the more power the fire had for to burne
those innocent children in that occasion, by somuch the more
to the greater astonishment of the standers by, God slaked the
force thereof, causing that in that very place, where for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
these Saints, the fire was most kindled, a coole fresh ayre
entred in, and did refresh them. And the King himselfe, who
came to see this wonder told them, that he espied in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
of these three children a fourth man, which seemed to
be like vnto the son of God. For indeed so it was, that this his
Diuine goodnesses, did not content it selfe with deading the
force of that intensiue flame, but made meanes by his Angell,
to come &amp; free these Innocents from that torment. Therein,
instructing kings, That albeit it be fit, that ordinarily, they
should suffer businesse to passe by the hands of those Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
to whom they belong; yet when the subiect is extrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wronged, &amp; iniustice offred by them against the Innocent,
Kings ought not to respect the Order and ordinary course of
Law, but to take another course with them, and (if neede be)
wholy to change and alter it, and in his own proper person, to
direct things to their due ends, taking from the fire it's Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie
&amp; instead thereof sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing a pleasing coole gale of wind,
as God did. For experience teacheth vs, that this ill seede or
bad race of Ministers, makes post-hast, &amp; quickly ouerrunnes
a Common-wealth, as ill weedes doe a ground, to the great
dishonour of kings, and diminution of their credit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to the
notable dammage and destruction of kingdomes. Oh how
doth it discouer it selfe in these our vnhappy and miserable
times, how much more, and how many Cubits higher then
it was wont, doth the fire of Ambition, and Auarice, mount in
many Ministers, who grow by this meanes, to be so great, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2459:82"/>
so high, that they quite loose the sight of themselues, and
goe beyond the reach of their own knowledge, being in a
manner besides themselues puft vp with their promotion,
and the high places they possesse, seeming to be another
kind of men, then they were wont to be. And this their
folly and madnesse extends it selfe so farre, that they will not
suffer themselues (forsooth) to be seene, or knowne, by
those, whom not long since (God he knowes) they adored
as Gods, but now are growne so proud, and into so good
a conceit of themselues, that they thinke themselues to be
something more then men. Of these, S <hi>Bernard</hi> giues this
admirable good note; You shall see (saith he) many in the
Chruch of God, as also in Kings Courts, without noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
made noble, and of poore, become rich, to be sodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
puffed vp with pride, forgetting their former Estate, to
be ashamed of their Ancestors, and disdainfull towards their
poore kinsefolke, and by a strong hand, and with lyes and
falshoods, they seeke and procure that, which Nature hath
deny'd them, and being not noble by birth, nor innobled by
vertue, set a good face on the matter and by such art and
cunning as they will vse, would seeme to the world to be
great Princes, and to be well descended, fetching their feigned Pedigrees, as farre as <hi>Noahs</hi> flood: Farre vnlike
vnto him, who by his vertue came from a Potter, to be a
King; who, that he might not forget, whence he came,
and yet represent what he was, caused to be set on his
Court cupboord vessells of earth, with this Letter; <hi>Haeac
fecimus:</hi> These we once made; and vessells of gold, with
this other Letter; <hi>Ista facimus:</hi> These we now make. I say,
that it is a matter of much importance, (and I purposly
forbeare to speake so much as I know in this point) for the
conseruation of Kingdomes. As also how fit it is, that their
Maiesties, both in regard of that respect which is due vnto
Kings, and to the right and true administration of Iustice,
should by their seueritie, temper and moderate the excesse

howbeit the word, remitting, or refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
doth seeme to notifie the care and
poruidence, which a Prince oweth vnto
businesses, certaine it is, that it shall well beseeme him,
sometimes so to doe. For, amongst many other the miseries

as externall, as well of the Soule, as of the body are
much limited, and restrained, and haue much need of many
helpes. Wherefore I say, that Kings not being able (as they
are not) to attend of themselues so many businesses as
howerly occurre, nor to comprehend so great variety and
difference of things, they ought to remit some, nay many
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2459:83"/>
of them, to persons deputed for their ease, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of their Consciences. Let a King examine those
businesses, which are fit to be reserued for himselfe.
And those that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> cannot, let him remit them vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
because of himselfe he is not able to dispatch all of

               <p>The one for to vnloade himselfe of that charge and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that he may liue himselfe at ease, and out of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
lay the burthen vpon others, and command them to end
such or such a businesse. Which is now too commonly vsed
and practised. For euery one, as much as in him lyes, striues
to be superiour in this kind; Taking that to himselfe which
is most p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>easing, and easiest for him, and remitting the hardest
and harshest to other mens hands, And hence it hapneth,
that from the first remitting the King makes, your poore
<hi>Negocian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> like so many Tennis balls are tost from one to
another. Nay, their fortune is farre worse; for the Ball
which is racketed by the one Player, the other with great
nimblenesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and care, runnes forth to receiue it: But the
poore <hi>Negociant,</hi> who in these Remitments, serues in steed of
the Ball, they doe not onely not receiue him readily, but
shut the doore vpon him, obliging him to solicite his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
one while by fauour, another while by giftes. And
although this be too vsuall a practise in all Tribunalls; and
with all Iudges and vpon all differences of businesses, yet
is it there most practised, where matters of goods, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2459:84"/>
Titles of Lands are treated, wherein the Pretenders doe not
only sweate and take a great deale of paines, but are forced
to pay as much for the dispatch of 10000. <hi>Marauedis,</hi> as
if they were so many Ducats. And this may be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with the example of a poore honest widow, who (as
it is well known) spent much time, and that little mony
which she had, in Negociating the dispatch of a small
debt. And when, after a long and tedious suite, she had
at last got an order against her Aduersarie, yet was she neuer
the neerer getting of her money, for that it was ordred in
Court, that shee should be payd out of such Rents, which
vpon some pre-morgage, or some other cunning Conueiance,
could not be recouered. These remittings, I doe not finde
how they can be defended, or salued in the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But there are many reasons for the condemning
of them, and for the obliging of Kings to referre
them.</p>
               <p>The other kinde of remitting, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When either the
order and qualitie of the businesse, or the lawfull Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of him that remitteth, doth so require it. For which
we haue our Sauiour Christs warrant in that admirable
Conuersion of the blessed Apostle S. <hi>Paul.</hi> For albeit he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
by his powerfull hand threw him downe from of his
horse, and made him so farre forth to yeeld himselfe his,
that he vttered these wordes so full of submission; <hi>Domine,
quid me vis facere?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 9. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord, what wilt thou, that I doe?</hi> Yet
did he not then giue him a present absolute Dispatch, but
remitted him ouer to another Disciple, which was named
<hi>Ananias.</hi> It being held fit it should be so for those reasons
which are rendred by the Saints, and holy Fathers. The
like course hee tooke with <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion in
that great businesse of his Saluation,<note place="margin">Act. 10. 5.</note> putting him ouer to
S. <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 17. 12.</note> And when he saw the Petition of those ten Lepers,
who besought him, that he would make them whole; how
beit he granted them their request for the recouery of their
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2459:84"/>
health, yet did he remit them ouer to the Priests, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to present themselues before them, because
in those kinde of infirmities, they were to be Arbitrary
Iudges,<note place="margin">Leuit. 13.</note> what was to be done in that case. And to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> which he sent vnto him, when he was
in prison, to the end that they might informe themselues
who he was, and whether it was he that should come, or
were to looke for another? He remitted them backe to
their Master with this Answer; <hi>Ite, renunciate Ioanni, quae
audistis, &amp; vidistis: Goe and shew</hi> Iohn <hi>what things yee
heare and see.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 4.</note> As he should haue said, For as much as <hi>Iohn</hi>
is my Voice, by him is the truth to be declared, which you
seeke after touching the Diuinitie of my Person. All these
Remittings were plaine, and dispatched without reply; And
those doubtlesse condemned, which are now daily vsed, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
things ouer from one to another, as if men were to
deale with children, who asking a companie of them, that
are playing together; Is your Mother at home? All make
answer; This boy can tell you, or that other boy can tell
you. So that many mens liues are ended, before their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
can be ended. Their suites growing older then them
selues; wasting both their wealth, and their persons to no
purpose.</p>
               <p>It is recounted in the Acts of the Apostles;<note place="margin">Act. 6. 2.</note> That they
being so busily imployed in the Preaching of the Gospell
that they could not ioyntly with it attend those workes
of Charitie, and Almes-deedes, which were exercised in the
Primitiue Church, by feeding those that were conuerted,
they did remit the care thereof to seuen Deacons chosen
out from amongst them all for that Ministrie. And heere
is to be confidered a point of Doctrine of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
That the Apostles (as there it is mentioned) albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
they saw what a great charge they had, and how much
trouble with daily Preaching, and continuall Praying, they
did neither omit, nor remit this businesse, but were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2459:85"/>
carefull, that those to whom this care was remitted,
should be persons of great approbation, and fulfilled with the
Holy Ghost, and with wisdome, as were S. <hi>Steu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which were elected, and ioyned in Commission with him.
<hi>Considerate ergo, fratres, viros ex vobis boni testimonij Septem,
plenos Spiritu Sancto, &amp; sapientia, quos constituamus super hoc
opus, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore brethren, Looke you out among you
seuen men of honest report, and full of the Holy Ghost, and
of wisdome, which we appoint to this businesse. Which is a
Lesson for Kings, that when they vnderstand, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
to whom they vseto remit businesses, are not such as
they ought to be, either for their want of wisdome, or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
in those things, or that their minde is not cleare and
free from passion, &amp; couetousnesse, they in no manner of wise
discharge their Consciences in making such remitments and
references, but ought rather to reserue the dispatch therof
vnto themselues, or to remit them to such Ministers, that are
able to giue good satisfaction therein, and of whose good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and sufficiencie, the world rendreth publicke Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
In a word, I am of opinion, that to remit businesses, is a
matter of necessity, in regard of the shortnesse of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
which is imbroiled and mightily hindred with this
multiplicitie of affayres, and oftentimes choaked and stifled,
and made defectiue in those matters, that are most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And as for our bodily strength, the force thereof is so
small, and so weake, that we had neede to preserue the
same, by easing it of that burthen, which is too heauy for it
to beare. Yet withall there must a great care be had, that these
remitmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, be not made meerely, that the King might liue
at ease, and be idle, but because weighty businesses, and such
as haue neede of new Examination, and new diligencies, doe

must extend it selfe a great deale farther; As to treate of

onely <hi>Mattathias,</hi> and his Sonnes, are here said to haue

his Sonnes, were the onely men that were sensible of the
hard measure they receiued, and the first that rose vp, and
opposed themselues against the furie of the Tyrant, for the
remedying their so many and so great Calamities, that sacred
Historian saith, That they onely had eyes, and saw the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
of Gods people. This kinde of sight best be fitteth
Kings, as they are heads of their Kingdomes and Common-wealthes,
and it is likewise necessary, that they haue their
sight, Large, Cleare, and Sharpe, that they may reach to see
euen those things, that are most secret, and most remote, as
doth that princely birde the Eagle, which houering aloft in
the ayre descryes the fishes, that are in the deepe: Or be like
vnto that Maiesticall Creature the Lyon, who both waking,
and sleeping, keepes his eyes open. The Holy Ghost saith;
That a wise man hath his eyes in his head. <hi>Sapientis oculi in

his feete. Which as they discouer but little, so are they lyable
to a thousand offences, and deceits. But the wise man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
from high and as from a watch-Tower discouers
things a farre off; and is thereby better able to take notice
of them, and more punctually to comply with his obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the state, and to that which neede shall require in
those accidents that may occurre. This is that sight, which
(as before hath beene said) befitteth Kings, for that they
are the Heads of their Common-wealths, and therefore are
to reserue for their own view those the more weighty busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of their subiects; there being a great deale of reason,
that they should see them (as they say) with their owne
eyes. For this end, are those Visitations ordayned, and
those Entrances in State, which Kings are wont to make
into the Cities, and Prouinces of their Kingdomes. When
the arrogant and vaine presumption of men grew to that

a whole Common-wealth, and a busines of that weight, as

kinde of language, that it may accommodate it self to the stile
and capacitie of men, for to instruct Kings in this place, that
graue and weighty businesses, they are not to transferre them
ouer vnto others, but of, and by themselues to see and looke
vnto them, nor ought they too be to facile in giuing credit to
fame, and report (especially of the vulgar) without hauing
first fully informed himselfe thereof, and that by themselues
they should be able to dis-deceiue themselues, and to see, and
consider things with attention, and with a desire to search
out the truth, and to rectifie what is amisse.</p>
               <p>In the Kingdomes of <hi>Castile,</hi> there is a very commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
custome and of great authoritie, and Maiestie, worthy
those most prudent Kings which first ordeyned it. And this
is that <hi>Consult<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the President of <hi>Castile</hi> makes with those of his Maiesties
Councell Royall, wherein an Account is giuen vnto his
Maiestie of all the weightiest businesses, and wherein the
opinion and the authoritie Royall is necessarie. And this is
not without example in the sacred Scripture. For in the
first chapter of <hi>Deut.</hi> it is written; That when that great
Law-giuer <hi>Moses</hi> had named for good and quicke dispatch
such Counsellours (as before specified) giuing them in
charge what they were to keepe and obserue, and how to

<hi>Consulta</hi> of euery Friday weekely, there should bee added
another Meeting some certaine dayes in the yeare, to the end
that the President, and those of the Kings <hi>Camaera,</hi> should
carry with them the <hi>Consulta</hi> of the Offices, and should
treate and conferre thereof by word of mouth with our
Lord the King, it would be one of the most important things
(in the iudgement and opinion of many graue men, whom
I haue consulted with in this particular) that could be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained
for the good of these Kingdomes. Whereby many
of those inconueniences would be auoyded, which wise and
Christian Counsellours haue found out by many yeares ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
And none of the meanest (amongst the rest) is the
remitting by writing so weightie and important a thing, as
the Election of Officers, recommending the same to a dead

but be sullyed, especially if it come to such hands as are not

in more, and treat with more punctuality and truth,
the things appertaining to his Office, considering that the
King himselfe taketh particular knowledge of them. For (as
we said before) it is very meete and conuenient, that Kings
should know, and communicate with, if not all, yet at least
those, who are to be placed in your greater kinde of Offices,
and dignities. And amongst a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yet at least it will be needfull, that those persons, of whom
they take testimonie, and receiue information in so graue and
weighty a busines, should be of that prudence, learning, and
authoritie, and so beyond all exception, that the world,
(which is apt to take exceptions) may be perswaded, that the
Election could not but be passing good, being that it past
through such iudicious mens hands. For, whatsoeuer shall
come forth decreed by them, it is not fitting, that it should
bee subiect to their censures, who either haue not the said
qualities, or are much inferiour in them, or faile in their zeale
to God, or their Loyaltie and Loue, to their King being
<hi>Narcissus</hi>-like, inamoured with their owne shadow, and led

which Kings had, that which the Ancient said of
them, and that which the holy Scripture teacheth vs, wee
shall finde, that this Occupation is very properly theirs,
and that this Care appertaines of right to their greatnesse.
That most wise King <hi>Salomon,</hi> in the fourth of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi>
saith; That when he saw the teares of the Innocent, and the
wrongs they receiued, and no body to helpe them, or to
speake so much as a good word for them, it seemed a thing
more terrible vnto him, then to dye, or neuer to haue beene

And I count him better then them both, which hath not

of the Innocent, they are not content to themselues, with
remitting them ouer vnto others, but to looke thereunto
themselues; And (if need were) to come from forth their

the like, if they should see their subiects ready to fall into
their enemies hands, with whom they wage open warre.
But from those more close and secret enemies, which are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with vs subiects, Citizens, neighbours, Countrymen
and Ministers of the same Kings, and of whom there is held
so much trust and confidence, who goes about to free the
wronged? What reparation is there for receiued iniuries?
Are they not much greater then those, that the <hi>Philistims</hi>
offered to Gods people, and more remedilesse? As for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Enemies, against them we may make open resistance,
and euery man, that is not vnnaturall, or a Traytour to his
Country, will put to his helping hand, and seeke to repell
force by force, &amp; reuenge the wrongs that are done them. But
for these our domestick enemies, these our home-borne foes,
&amp; feigned friends, who vnder the shew of friendship, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
cloake and colour of being the Kings Ministers, oppresse
the poore, and such as haue little power to oppose their
greatnesse, who shall be able to resist them? If he, that suffers,
shall pretend to doe it, doth he not put himselfe in manifest
danger of suffring much more? if not of loosing all that hel
hath? And it is worthy your consideration, that in those
words related in <hi>Exodus,</hi> it is not said, that God went down
to see, and remedy the wrongs which that Tyrant king
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> did vnto the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> but that which was
offred them by his chiefe Ministers; <hi>Propter duritiem eorum,
qui praesunt.</hi> For the hard-heartednesse, and cruelty of those,
which were set in authoritie ouer them. As if he should haue
said, The Affronts and Iniuries done by a Kings principall
Officers, are not so easily remedyed, as those of particular
men. They require a powerfull hand, they require Gods
presence, and assistance, and will craue a Kings especiall
care. For your Councells cannot doe it, nay are not able
for to doe it of themselues alone, be they the greatest and the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2459:90"/>
highest in the Kingdom; be they neuer so zealous of Iustice,
neuer such true louers thereof, and neuer so desirous to doe
right. And the reason therof (in my poore opinion) is, for that
in regard the burthen of ordinary businesses is so great, that
only they are not able to attend the quitting of those <hi>agrauios</hi>
and greiuances, with that speedines and efficacie, as were
needefull, but rather that they themselues, without so much
as once dreaming thereof, doe vse to make them farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then otherwise they would bee, for want of time, and
strength of body, to cumply with so many and so great busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
And it oftentimes so commeth to passe, that those that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ue for reliefe, in stead of being eased of their wrongs, receiue
further wrong, either because they cannot finde fit place
and time to be heard, or because being heard, they are soone
forgot, or because they that wrong them, finde meanes to
couer their faultes. And if they cannot couer them, and so
should be lyable vnto punishment, yet they that lent them
their hand to lift them vp to the place wherein they are,
will likewise lend them a hand to defend their disorders.
And it hath beene already, and is yet daily to be seene, that
a Iudge in Commission, who for his wickednesse and euill
dealing deserued exceeding great chastisement; yet, for that
he hath this <hi>Patron</hi> and <hi>Angel</hi> of Guard (for in your grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

husht, and the party peccant neuer questioned. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he shall not be disgraced, if the matter proue fowle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, by putting him out of his place, he that tooke
him into his protection, will intercede in his behalfe to haue
him remoued from that Office, and preferred to a better; A
case certainly worthy both punishment, and remedy, if there
be any vpon earth. And if there be any helpe to be had, it
must be by the sight and presence of the King, for without
this, it is not to be hoped for.</p>
               <p>The Courtes of Kings, (much more then other places)
are full of humane respects, and these haue taken so great a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:2459:91"/>
head and are growne so strong, that in businesses they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
that, which truth and iustice ought to vphold. And
therefore my aduise vnto Kings is, that being they are men,
that are or may be free (if they will themselues) from these
poore respectiue considerations, and are supreme Lords, and
absolute soueraignes in their kingdomes, they would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
to dis-agrauiate those that are iniuryed, respecting onely
wronged right, and oppressed Truth. But because such as are
wronged, and finde themselues agrieued, haue not that
easie accesse and entrance into Princes Courtes, or to their
persons, either in regard of their great and weighty Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or some other lawfull Impediments, it shall much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte,
that in their Courtes, they should haue some person,
or persons, of great zeale and approued vertue and prudence
to whom those that are agrieued should haue recourse. For
many suffer much, that cannot come to be admitted to the
sight, or speech of their King, whereas, if there should be a
person appointed for to heare their Complaints, they would
cry out with open mouth for iustice, and should be righted
in their receiued wrongs. And that person, or persons thus
deputed by their Maiesties, hauing first well weighed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
the reasons of their Complaints, should afterwards
represent the same vnto their Kings, and giue them true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
thereof, to the end that they may forthwith by
expresse Command, put thereunto a speedy and fitting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.
And this (I assure you) would be a great bridle to
restraine the insufferable insolencie, and Auarice of Princes
Ministers; Who (questionlesse) would carry themselues

vnto vs to stop vp all the passages to his eares; but
say open way should be made, and that the King should
take notice of this, or that misdemeanour, it shall be dawbd
vp so handsomely, such a faire varnish set vpon it, and so ful
of excuses, that it will be all one, as if he had neuer heard of
it, or any such thing bin at all. Presuming, that Kings, rather
then they will be troubled with businesses of clamour and
noyse, will (for their owne ease) slightly passe them ouer.
Wherein, as they haue oftentimes found themselues, so
it is fit they should still, be deceiued. And truly to no man,
can with better Title his Entrance be giuen, nor this golden
key to the Kings Chamber be committed, then to him, who
with the integritie and zeale of an <hi>Elias,</hi> should trample
and tread these Monsters vnder foote; and roundly and
throughly to take this care to task, which (without al doubt)
would be one of the gratefullest, and most acceptable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices,
which can be done vnto God both in matter of pietie,
and of pitie. But what shall I say of the Kings happinesse
in this case? With nothing can he more secure his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
then with this. As one who is bound, out of the duty
of his place, to haue a watchfull eye ouer all his Ministers,
but more narrowly and neerely, to looke into the water of

is truly found. For, when the subiects iust Complaints are
not heard, besides that his conscience is charged and clogg'd
therewith, the Ministers themselues become thereby much
more absolute, and more insolently Imperious; Insomuch
that the subiect seeing, that they are neither heard, nor eased
of their grieuances, they grow desperate. And what fruites
despaire bring forth, I neede not tell kings, that know either
men, or bookes. There is not in holy Scripture any one
thing more often repeated, then the particular care which
God hath of the oppressed. In the seuenty second <hi>Psalme,</hi>

Petitions, commonly finde there such quicke dispatch, that
presently hee nominateth Captaines, leuieth forces, and

that kingdome. And though some may conceiue, that the

For without it, the foot that sets forward, falls backward;
and a King hath not where withall to relye on his power, his
forces, his wisedome, and experience in gouernment, if he
be defectiue in this. For kingdomes last no longer, then
Iustice lasteth in them. And true it is, that there is no winde
shut vp in the bowells of the earth, which causeth therein
such violent effects of Earth-quakes, as in those kingdomes,
which thinke themselues surest and firmest doe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
and greiuous sighes of the wronged poore. And
therefore let none whatsoeuer, be they Kings, great Ministers,
or Counsellours of State, slightly reckon of the cries of the
poore; For they referring their reuenge to God, they draw
him downe from Heauen to right their quarrell. And the
basest, and most barbarous man in the world, when he sees
himselfe wronged, and can finde none vpon earth to pleade
his cause, or to doe him right, he presently lifts vp his eyes
vnto Heauen, and makes his addresse vnto God, assuring
himselfe that his helpe will come from thence. And it was
well said of a Wise man; That the wronged are like vnto
those that are ready to be drowned, who if they fasten vpon
any thing, neuer let it goe: so these men, when they are in
danger to be sunke by being forcibly kept vnder water by
the oppressours hand, lay fast hold on complaints, cryes,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2459:94"/>
sighes, and teares, as the last remedy allotted them by God;
who saith: That he will heare the petitions, and receiue the
Memorialls of the afflicted, which are written with teares.

cheeke, they ascend vp to heauen. They trill downe the
cheekes, till they fall to the ground, and from thence they
mount vp as high as Heauen: for being water, they rise as
much as they fall. And when God sees they haue reason on
their side, and that they onely call vnto him for iustice, (it
being so proper an Attribute vnto him) in the end he
grants, and signes their request. Nor is it much, that he
should shew them this fauour, his bowells being moued to
compassion, in seeing his creatures in such extremities of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
Let Kings therefore beware and take heede, and
their Ministers bethinke themselues; that in such a case, an
Inundation of teares, is of more force, and more danger, then
that of the swiftest Torrent vpon a mighty flood.</p>

Of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> (though some put it vpon <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius)</hi>
it is reported by <hi>Plutarke</hi> in his life, that going one
day abroad to take his pleasure and pastime, an olde woman
came vnto him, &amp; besought him to heare her, and to do her
Iustice. But he excusing himselfe, and telling her, he was not
now at leysure to heare her, shee made answer. <hi>Proinde, nec
Rex quidem esse velis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Sir, if you be not at leysure to heare
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:2459:96"/>
your subiects, &amp; will not giue them leaue to speake vnto you,
leaue to be king; for there is no reason he should be a king,
that cannot finde a time to cumply with his dutie. Conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with this reason, without any more adoe, he presently
gaue a gracious Audience not onely to her, but many moe
besides. For Kings, which doe not heare, by consequence do
not vnderstand; And not vnderstanding they cannot go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne;
And not gouerning, they neither are, nor can be
Kings. The <hi>Cretans,</hi> painted their God <hi>Iupiter</hi> without
eares, because he was that supreme king, that gaue lawes,
and iudged all. And therefore ought to cary an equall eare, &amp;
indifferently to heare all parties after one and the same selfe
manner. Other some, did allow him eares, but so placed
them withall, that they might heare those least, that were
behinde him; Which was held a fault in their God; as
likewise it is in King; not to heare any but those that stand
before them, or side by side are still weighting at their elbow.
Kings should heare as many as they possibly can, and (which
is the onely comfort of suitors) in that gratious and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
kinde of maner that no man should depart discontented
from their feete, being a maine fundamentall cause, to make
all men to loue, reuerence, and esteeme them; and likewise
to oblige Princes, to lend the more willing and patient eare
to their subiects. And of this subiect, <hi>Pliny,</hi> in commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Emperour <hi>Traiane,</hi> tells vs, that amidst so many
cares of so great an Empire as his was, he spent a great part
of the day in giuing Audience, and with such stilnes and
quietnes, as if he had beene idle, or had nothing to doe. And
that he knowing the content that his subiects tooke in their
often seeing of him, and speaking with him, so much the
more liberally, and longer, he afforded them occasion and
place, for to inioy this their content. For nothing doth so
much please, and satisfie the heart of a Prince, as to conceiue,
that he is beloued, and generally well affected of all his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.
Let a King then, (this course being taken) perswade
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2459:96"/>
himselfe, that his people loueth him, and desireth to see him,
and to speake dayly (if it were possible) with him. And that
they take a great deale of comfort, that they haue seene him,
and he heard them. And that of two things which all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
To wit; To be heard, and relieued; The first, intertaines,
and comfortes the suitor; and makes him, with a cheerefull
minde, to hope well of the second. Let him heare, though
it be but as he passes by from place to place, and let him not
let any day passe, without giuing ordinary Audience at a
set hower, and for a set time. And in case any shall require
a more particular and priuate Audience, a gods name, let him
grant it them; For euery one of these (to conceiue the worst)
cannot deceiue him aboue once; And it is to be supposed,
that they will not be so vnciuill, or so foolishly indiscreete,
as to craue the Kings priuate eare, but in a case of necessitie,
or where there is some especiall cause, or extraordinary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for it. And I farther affirme, that Audience being giuen
in this maner, things will be carryed more smoothly, and
with more ease on either part; For that which breakes down
your <hi>Damn's</hi> in your riuers, is the detention of the water.
And the detayning of a Subiect from the presence &amp; speech
of his King, is that which doth dishearten, and deiect the
mindes of your negociants, and supplicants. And when they
see they so seldome haue Audience, and are put off from day
to day, and that it costes them so deare before they can be
heard, they will, while they may, make vse of that present
occasion, and then they talke world without end, and neuer
giue ouer, because they are afraid they shall neuer haue the
like opportunitie againe. But when those suit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs shall know
that they shall haue ordinary hearing, on such dayes, and
such a set houre, and for so long a time, they will content
themselues, with giuing much lesse trouble to their owne
tongues, and his Maiesties eares. In a word, no man will
denie, but say with me, that it is iust and meete, That he, that
is to rule, and remedy all, ought likewise to heare all and that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:2459:97"/>
all men should know as much; for, for the good, and hope
thereof, they principally obay, and loue their King. And
besides, a great part of that concurse, and tedious trouble of
<hi>Negociants,</hi> will by this meane, be cut off. For, vnlesse it be
in case of necessitie, or some extraordinary occasion, no man
(I assure my selfe) will be so vnmanerly as to offer to weary
and tire out his King. For it is naturally inbred in all, to
feare and respect Greatnesse, And therefore will not cause
molestation to so great a Maiestie but when they cannot
finde any other meanes to negociate. In conclusion, facile
Audience in Kings, is such a vertue, as doth supply (and
that with a great deale of aduantage) the defect of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vertues. And where there is no neede of that supply, it
serues to giue a greater luster and perfection to the rest, the
subiect not hauing any other thing, that he more craueth
from, or desireth in his King. And questionlesse, vse and
custome, will make it more easie, though at first it may
seeme somewhat troublesome vnto him. King <hi>Antigonus,</hi>
who was father to the great <hi>Demetrius,</hi> was a proud, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
couetous, cruell, and effeminate Prince, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all these vices, and other his weakenesses and
infirmities, his subiects did beare with them, and did truly
serue and obay him, because he did neuer refuse to giue them
Audience, gaue them kinde and faire answeres, suffred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to bee seene often of them, and did neuer shew to any
man a frowning looke, or discontented Countenance.</p>
               <p>This facile giuing of Audience, doth bring likewise with
it another benefit not so well vnderstood perhaps, as it
ought to be, by Kings and their fauourites. Which is: That
thereby they receiue the priuate aduertisements of particular
persons in such a conuenient time and season, as is fitting for
them. For, in negociating, by retarding this Audience, either
the occasion is ouersl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And because the aduertiser, (as there is great reason
for it) would be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

may not loose both his thankes, and his labour. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
many times this Aduertiser, either dareth not or
holdeth it not fit, to trust a paper therewith or other mens
eares, all this may easily be excused with a facile Audience.

is quite taken from them; which certainly is a iewell so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the wearing, that euery one would willingly haue it for
himself. And if kings do not know thus much, or that they are
not told therof, it is by reason of that old mischeife which they
suffer by not hearkening vnto truth, either in their Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
or those <hi>Auisos,</hi> that are represented vnto them, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

shal be the only man in fault, &amp; he that must pay for all. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
is the State of Kings, dangerous the times, but more
dangerous the remedy, &amp; the non conueniencie for the now
putting it in practise. In ordinary, and publick Audiences, let
not Kings permit either Ministers, Counsellours, or Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
to enter for it wil but make the Commons complaine,
that that is taken away from them, which is theirs; And they
on the other side, being principall persons, will mutter and
grumble, thinking themselues wronged, and their worth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derualewed,
to haue all one Audience with the ordinary sorte
of people. So that with one &amp; the same Act, he discontents all
of them. Let there be dayes, &amp; houres; appointed for the one,
&amp; the other naturalls, &amp; strangers, &amp; let euery man know his

doth it serue for, but multitude, and confusion? And to haue
all of all sortes to assist there continually to heare and nourish

the Complaints of particular persons, and to make report
thereof by Letters to their seuerall nations and Countries,
and to put a Glosse vpon them, to shew their owne wit.
And though this at the first sight, may seeme to be a thing
of small importance, yet such a time may be taken, that it
may proue a matter of great consequence.</p>

Tell me (thou holy king) why dost thou say with thine eares.
Might not that phrase of speech beene spared? Or wouldst
thou happely, that God should heare thee with his eyes, or
his mouth? No certainly, But because it is a vsuall custome

Doe thou thy selfe heare me with thine owne eares, without

that they alluded vnto this, who (as wee told you) pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their God without eares; for to giue vs thereby to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that it is peculiar onely vnto God to heare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

<hi>Oydos,</hi> or <hi>Oydores;</hi> For such a necessitie, were in God
a defect. But in Kings it were a defect to doe otherwise;
for they are notable to heare all of themselues, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

as Nature, in Mans body hath disposed different Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
necessary for it's proper conseruation, as the eyes to

this. The rationall Soule (saith he) is solely one, indiuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and of a limited vertue or power, and that it cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
to that strength and force, as to giue vigour to those
partes that are so farre distant and remote in a body, beyond

vaste, and exceeding great, and goes dayly increasing more
and more, and that the Soule of the King which is to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
it, to animate it, and to giue it life, doth not increase,
nor is multiplyed, nor augmented, at least in it's Ministers;
How is it possible, that a King of himselfe alone should bee
able to afford assistance to all? And to giue life, and being,
to so many partes and members, that are set so far assunder?
so great is the Office of a king, especially, if he be Master of
many Kingdomes, that it is too great a Compasse, for one
mans reach, and it is not one man alone, that can fill and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie

And therefore of force he must make vse of other folkes

the Cryes, and Complaints of the poore may not come to
their eares. There is not any crueltie comparable to this,
to see a poore suitor trot vp and downe, a moneth or two
together, labouring to haue Audience, and in stead of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him in, hath the doore still shut against him. Nature
would not allow doores to the eares, &amp; yet these that are the
Common-wealths eares, make profit of the doores of their
houses, and command them to be kept shut: your suitors
they come and goe, but my <hi>sennior Oydor,</hi> my Lord iudge,
he that should haue his doores open, to giue open hearing
to all Comers, is shut vp in his closet, and cannot be spoken
withall vnder a couple of Capons. The <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

as he did, without doubt it had cost <hi>Paul</hi> his life. For fourty
men, had taken a solemne oath to kill him as he came forth
of prison to his Triall; and bound themselues with a curse,
that they would neither eate, not drinke, till they had killed
him. Now, when this young man came to the Chiefe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and told him that he had something to say vnto him;
The Text there saith, that the Captaine tooke him by the
hand, and went a part with him alone, and asked him;
What hast thou to shew to me, &amp;c. With this facilenes,
did the Ministers of that Heathen-people, giue Audience.
How much more ought Christian Ministers to doe the
like? The open doore, and the giuing of Audience in some
open Hall, or in some outward Court, whereunto all are
admitted to enter, would giue much content vnto many; but
these close doores, and close Audience, to very few; which
is purposely done for to pleasure their friends and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants;
for, from this their hard accesse, and difficile en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
they likewise make their gaine, and are not ashamed
now to demand that for a see, which if they were well
serued should be recompenced with a halter And looke
what I haue said of your <hi>Oydores,</hi> which are your Iudges in
Chanceries, and other the chiefe Courtes of Iustice; I say the
like of other Ministers, who though they haue not the same
name, yet doe they serue as eares to their king. And then are
their eares shut, and growne deafe, when they will not heare;
making thereby his Maiestie to be found fault withall, &amp; to
receiue a hard censure from his subiects, when he is innocent
&amp; blamelesse, and drawing a thousand other mischiefes vpon
the Common-wealth. And it is a most shamefull thing, and
worthy reprehension, &amp; redresse, that when kings shall bee
liberall in this kind, their Ministers should be so short &amp; cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and that a man should be at more cost and trouble to get
Audience of them, &amp; to negociate a busines, then of the king
himself. And the mischiefe of it is, that they procure and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

And this was well vnderstood by <hi>Absolon</hi> the son of <hi>Dauid,</hi> &amp;

there is no man deputed of the King to heare thee. And
this is it, that puts all out of frame, and order. O quoth he,
that I were made Iudge in the land, that euery man which
hath any matter of controuersie might come to me, that I
might doe him Iustice; &amp;c. And it followeth anon after in
the Text; <hi>Quod solicitabat corda virorum:</hi> That by this
means he stale away the hearts of the men of <hi>Israel.</hi> And that
thereupon there shortly after insued a great rebellion, which
put the king, &amp; the kingdom in great ieopardie. Which may
serue as a lesson for a good Minister, to teach them what they
ought to do, &amp; not to think, they do that which they ought,
when for fashion sake, they giue short and crowding Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
where that which enters in at one eare, goes out (as
they say) at another. But that so much time should be allowed
for the hearing of them, as the qualitie off the busines shall
require, without cutting those off, who go rendring their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2459:101"/>
For he that hath not the patience to heare them, either
he not vnderstandeth them, or is afraid to meddle with them.</p>
               <p>With this therefore I conclude this, and the former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
That the first Office of a King, is, To heare all his
subiects. And it being supposed, that he alone cannot doe
it, it is fit he should haue <hi>Oydores,</hi> that should heare for him,
and be his eares. And for that as by the eares of the head,
there runn's along a certaine secret nerue, by meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
that which is heard, is presently conuaied to the braine,
there to be registred, and consulted on by the Common
sense. So these <hi>Oydores,</hi> ought to holde their secret <hi>Consulta,</hi>
wherein they ought to make relation vnto the King of all
that they haue heard. But let them weigh with all, what a
short Cut it is from the eare to the braine, and the small stay
that is made in this Iourney, or passage; to the end that by
this natural course, which is so quicke, &amp; speedy, they may see
their errour, and perceiue what a great fault it is, to retarde
their <hi>Consultations,</hi> to shew themselues thicke of hearing, &amp;
to haue their eares shut, or rather the <hi>Oydores</hi> themselues
shut vp, and not to be spoken withall. Some would faine
excuse these Audiences, with the impertinencies of those
that craue them, which sometimes are very large and tedious
and to as little purpose, as they are too too importune, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable.
But to this answere; That your high and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
places, bring with them this trouble and charge; And
(as the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> said) that it is a great token of
prudence to know how to beare with the foolish, and to
haue suffrance and patience with those, that are none of the
wisest.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 19.</note>

And because he that is most wise, is most offended with

haue fully informed themselues of the truth of the case. For
this is rather an honour, then dishonour vnto Kings, and

question of him that speaketh, it may be conceiued, that
he doth not heare him; For these two sences are so neere
of kinne, that (as the Philosopher obserueth) he that is borne
dumbe, is also deafe; And not onely this, but likewise,
that the speech being taken away, the hearing is lost with
it. The cause whereof (according to <hi>Lactantius)</hi> is; for
that the Organ, by which the Ayre is receiued, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee told you in the former Chapter that
Hearing was the precisest, and directest
meanes for the doing of Iustice. And
therefore falleth fitly out here to treate
thereof. Your Ancient <hi>Hieroglyfinists,</hi>
as also your Saints, in their writings,
treating of this Vertue, compare it to a
payre of weights or scales with it's two
ballances. And it seemeth, that Nature herselfe made this
<hi>Ectypum,</hi> or <hi>Exemplar,</hi> this portrayture or delineation, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing
it out in euery one of vs, by giuing vs two eares, like
vnto those two balances, whose truth dependeth on the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amen,</hi>
or <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> that tongue or needle, which stands
vppermost in the beame of the ballance; making my appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in this maner, that the two eares, standing like two
ballances, on either side of the head, they haue their rule
of truth from the supremest and highest part thereof, where
stands the tongue or needle of reason, and the iudgement
of those things to their true weight, and measure, which
are put into these Intellectaull ballances. To discourse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of Iustice, is very essentiall to that which hath already
beene treated touching a Common-wealth; For (as we
told you in our very first Chapter) A Republick, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
is a Congregation of many men, subiect to the
same Lawes and Gouernment, which is not possible to bee
conserued, if Iustice therein shall be wanting. Which giues
to euery one, that which is his owne, keepes men within
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:2459:103"/>
the bounds of good Order and Discipline, and bridles those
by reason, which transported by their vnruly appetites,
(like headstrong iades) would liue without it, admitting
no curbe, no manner of controll, but following that Law of
<hi>Viuat, qui vincit:</hi> Let him weare a Crowne, that winn's it.
If Men would but obserue that first rule of the Law natural,
consecrated by the mouth of our diuine Master Christ.<note place="margin">Math. 7. 12.</note>
                  <hi>Quod tibi non vis, alteri ne feceris. Et quaecunque vultis vt
faciant vobis homines, eadem facite illis:</hi> Offer not that to
another which thou wouldst not haue donne to thy selfe.
And therefore, whatsoeuer ye would, that men should doe to
you, euen so doe yee to them. There needed no other bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes,
or fortifications, to liue quietly and peaceably in
the world. But after this same <hi>Lolium</hi> crept in, this Tare,
of <hi>Meum,</hi> and <hi>Tuum;</hi> the <hi>Cooler</hi> (as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> calls it) of
Charitie, the Seminarie of discordes and dissention, and
the fountaine of all mischiefe; men found themselues obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
nay inforced, to seeke out some such meanes, or maner
of liuing, whereby euery one might quietly and peaceably
inioy that, which he held to be his owne. And for this
cause, they resolued to leade a ioynt life together, submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themselues to one and the same Lawes, and subiecting
themselues to one and the same King, who should likewise
keepe and obserue them, and by iustice conserue nourish, and
maintaine all other necessary vertues for the augmentation
and conseruation of Common wealths. And for this end,
was giuen vnto Kings that great power, which they haue,
holding in one hand the ballance of Iustice, and in the other,
the sword of power. Which that naked weapon doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present,
which is borne before them, when they enter with
authoritie and State into their Cities. And alluding either
vnto this, or those ancient <hi>Insignia</hi> of your Iudges, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith;<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Vis non timere potestatem? Bonum
facinon enim fine causa gladium portat;</hi> Wilt thou be without
feare of the power? Doe well. For the Magistrate beareth
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:2459:103"/>
not the sword for nought. <hi>Herodotus</hi> tells vs that, which
<hi>Cicero</hi> deliuereth vnto vs.<note place="margin">Cicero.</note> 
                  <hi>Eadem fuit legum constituenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

cause and Motiue, of ordaining Lawes, and Creating Kings.
Whence it followeth, that there neither can be any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
without Iustice, nor any one that can deserue
to be a King, vnlesse he maintaine and conserue it. And
though he may seeme to be a King, yet in realitie of truth
he is not. Because he wants that principall attribute, that
should make him be so; As a painted man, which is no
man, cannot properly be said to be a Man. The holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
styles those Hypocrites, which doe not administer
Iustice, for they haue no more in them of Kings, then the
apparent, or outward shew, as the Scepter and the Crowne,
and other their regall roabes, and ornaments. And it is
worthy your consideration, and it is no more then what their
holy Doctors and learned Interpreters of diuine Letters
haue obserued; That a good King, and Iustice, are brothers

there was presently offred and put into his hands a great
occasion for to shew his prudence and wisedome, and his
great noblenesse and courage for to do iustice. The Case was
a common and knowen Case; it was betwixt two women,
that were friends and Companions, who leading a lewd and
dishonest life, were deliuered or brought to bed both at one

she puts me the dead childe by her, and tooke the liuing
childe to her selfe. But this theft could not be so couered,
for all her cunning carriage, but that the other knew, that
the dead childe which was layd by her side, was not hers,
but the liuing. The other with a great deale of impudencie,

Iustice, the people shouted for ioy, and cryed out, that
his wisdome was from heauen, and though he were then
very young, they began to feare and reuerence him very
much. And therefore if a king will be beloued, esteemed,
and respected of his subiects, he must be a iust King. For,
most certaine it is, that if Kings will pretend honour, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,

Let therefore the Conclusion of this discourse be; That
(according to <hi>Plato)</hi> the greatest prayse, that can be giuen
to a King, is in consideration of this Vertue; for, (as wee
will shew you by and by) it imbraceth all vertues in it selfe.
And there is not any Title more honourable, or that doth
so <hi>quadrare,</hi> so square, and sute; with a King, as that of lust.
whereby a King is made as it were a God vpon earth,
and becomes like vnto him in rewarding, and punishing.
<hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> and <hi>Homer,</hi> called Kings, <hi>Iovis discipulos, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piters

administer Iustice. And anciently, they were tearmed <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratissimi,</hi>
most sacred. In effect, Iustice is a vertue, truely
regall, and most proper vnto Kings, because it appertaines
vnto them by Office, and doth constitute them in their
being of Kings; for without it, they cannot be. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

calls her the Ouerseer,<note place="margin">Plato lib. 9. delegibus.</note> and the Reuenger of all things, in
regard of that great vigilancie which Kings ought to haue
in executing Iustice, and in seeing and knowing, what
passeth in the kingdome: for kingdomes for this cause are
content to become subiect vnto them, out of a confidence
they haue, that they shall be protected by them. This
is the thing (saith <hi>Osorius)</hi> that Kings must looke vnto;<note place="margin">Osor: lib 4. de reg. Iustit.</note>
This must be their cheife care and study. <hi>In studium iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,

namque à principio Reges creauit.</hi> The doing, or not doing
of Iustice, is that, which either sets vp, or puls downe
Kings, And that King, must make a new conquest of
Kingdomes, If those, which he hath already gained, be not
conserued and defended by the force and power of Iustice,
which, is the maine pillar, and onely prop to speake of,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:2459:105"/>
that vpholdeth Kingdomes, without which they cannot
long last and continue. For God will most iustly punish
them, by taking those from them, which they haue, if they
dissimulate iniustices, and if they suffer themselues to be
carryed away contrary to all right and reason, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
notorious faults to passe without punishment: Other
faults are not so much risented in Kings, and Kingdomes
are content to tolerate them, be they neuer so great.
But should they haue neuer so many other good partes,
if they be faulty in this, which is of so great importance,
they shall presently see and perceiue a publicke face of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and a generall discontent in all their subiects. And
God oftentimes, makes it a meanes for the punishment,
and amendment of Kings and Kingdomes. It is the saying
of <hi>Iesus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Syrach;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 10. 8.</note> That by Counsaile, and
Iustice, Kingdomes are maintained. And for default there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
Scepters and Crownes, are lost, and Kingdomes trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
from one people to another. And those brought to
serue, which were borne to command. But the King, that
administreth Iustice, without respect of persons, shall haue
his succession perpetuall: for that is the very ground and
foundation of a Throne royall.<note place="margin">Prou. 25. 5.</note>

the wicked from the King, and his throne shall be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in righteousnes. That is, His Issue, his House, and
his Kingdome. Iustice is that which foundeth Kingdomes,
which enlargeth them, and conserueth them; That which
establisheth peace, and resisteth warre. Without it, there is
neither King nor Kingdome, nor Common-wealth, nor
Citie, nor any other Communitie, which can be conserued.
And all whatsoeuer that haue beene ruined and destroyed,
hath beene for want of Iustice. For this cause the Kings of
Egypt, and in imitation of them, some others, did (which
all good Kings ought to do) sweare their Presidents, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and Magistrates, that they should not obay their
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:2459:106"/>
                  <hi>mandatums,</hi> nor execute their orders and decrees, if they
found in them, that they commanded any thing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
vnto Iustice, and the Lawes of the Kingdome. <hi>Philip</hi>
the Faire, King of <hi>France,</hi> and his successor <hi>Charles</hi> the
seuenth, enacted a Law, that the Iudges should make no
reckoning of the Kings Letters nor those his royall
scedules, vnlesse they seemed vnto them to be iust, and
lawfull. The Catholike Kings, <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> and <hi>Donna
Isabella,</hi> and their Nephew, <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, by their well
ordained Lawes, Magistracies, and Tribunals of so much
power and authoritie, exceeded all before them, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
Iustice. Which were augmented and inlarged by
King <hi>Philip</hi> the second, who was more particularly zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of Iustice. And his sonne King <hi>Philip</hi> the third,
was a great fauourer and louer of Iustice, and obseruer
of the Lawes, submitting vnto them his person, and his
goods, Who might very well say, that which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Traiane</hi> said, conferring great power on his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour
in <hi>Rome;</hi> Thou shalt vse this sword, in our name,
and for Vs, as long as we shall command that which is
iust; and against vs, if we shall command the contrarie.
For it is alwayes to be presumed of the Intention of
Kings, that they euermore command Iustice to be done,
but neuer the contrary, though it make against themselues.
<hi>Dauid</hi> gaue thankes vnto God, that hee had set him in
the way of Iustice; that is, That he had giuen him an
vpright heart, and informed his vnderstanding with so
right a rule, that it inclined his disposition to doe iustice,
though it were against himselfe. The cause (saith <hi>Diuus
Thomas)</hi> why God, for so many yeares did inlarge the
Empire and Monarchie of the Romanes, with so much
power, so much treasure, and so many great victories,
was; for that their rectitude and iustice, which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
towards all. But in that instant, that they fell from
this, their Empire likewise began to fall. Of these Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:2459:106"/>
all Histories, both humane, and diuine, are very
full; yet all will not serue the turne, they doe little, or
no good. Let Gods mercie supply this defect, and worke
this good. And let not the poore bee discouraged and
disheartened, but let them comfort and cheere vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
with this, that their righteousnesse, and their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
shall not perish for euer. God hath spoke the

and poore vnto their right, that the man of earth
bee no more exalted against them. Woe vnto those, that

Of iustice, considered thus in the generall, we will not now
treate of in this place; for in rigour and strictnesse, this is
not true iustice, though it haue some similitude therewith.
Now Iustice is taken after another manner for a particular
virtue. To wit, that, which is one of the foure Cardinall
vertues, which hath for it's obiect and end (as we shall tell
you by and by) to giue vnto euery man that which is his
right and his due. Of this (which is properly Iustice) do we
here meane to treate; of whose Excellencies, all bookes are
full, and whereof, the Ancients said; That it is a celestiall

we are to vnderstand, that there was a Iudge, and
Iustice in the world, before any other thing was created.
For, to haue created a world, without a Iudge, or iustice to
gouerne it, and to punish humane excesses and disorders,
had beene to make a denne of Thiefes, and Robbers. For

(saith Saint <hi>Austen)</hi> had beene nothing else, but so many

or other their substitutes, till <hi>Noahs</hi> time; who was the

                     </gap>ctiuae</hi> or subiectiue parts of this Iustice;
that is to say, it's essential Species. And therefore we will treate
of these two, and that very briefly. And first in the first place
of the Commutatiue, and in the second of the distributiue.</p>
               <p>Iustice Commutatiue, Contractiue, or Venditiue, (for all
these names your Authors giue it, for the matter of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutations,<note place="margin">Arist. 10. Met: Tit. 11.</note>
Contracts and Sales, wherein it is exercised, is
considered betwixt two, party and party, which are a part
of that whole body of the Common-wealth, which giue,
and take, betweene themselues, by way of Contract, or Sale.
It's end, and obiect, is equalitie, and proportion, betweene
that, which is giuen; and that, which is receiued; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
respect vnto the persons which buy, and sell, but to that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2459:109"/>
which is contracted, solde, or commutated, that there may
be an equalitie and proportion had, betwixt that, which is
giuen, and taken. And when in this there is a defection,
it is contrary to Commutatiue Iustice. The distributiue, is
considered betweene the whole, and it's parts. The <hi>Medium</hi>
of this Vertue, doth not consist in the equaltie of thing to
thing, but of the things to the persons; for, as one person
surpasseth another, so the thing, which is giuen to such a
person, exceedeth that part, which is giuen to another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
So that there is an equalitie of proportion betweene
that, which is more, and that which is lesse; but not an
equalitie of quantitie, to wit; So much to the one, as to the
other. For those, which in a Common-wealth, are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
in dignitie, and desert, ought not equally to enioy
the Common goods thereof, when they are reparted and
diuided by the hand of distributiue Iustice; As we shall
shew you by and by, when we come to speake of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutatiue,
which treates of equalizing and according that,
whch mens disordinate appetites, and boundlesse couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
doth disconcerte, and put out of order, euery one
being desirous to vsurpe that for himselfe, which of right
appertaines, and belongs to another, whence arise your cose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages

your Iudges are called Gods. And since that they are his

himselfe doth. For I must be so bold as to tell them, that
there is a reuiewing of the businesse, and a place of Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

there the Party pretending doth not deposite his thousand

who are faine, by deferring, to deferring, and putting ouer

by so much the more, by how much the more great it is. And

they shall haue of this Communicatiue qualitie. And so
much the neerer shall they resemble God, with by how
much the more liberalitie they shall repart and diffuse these
outward goods, whose distribution appertaineth vnto
them. And to him cannot the name of King truely sute, who
hath not alwayes a willing minde, and as it were a longing
desire, to communicate himselfe. Now, for to temper and
moderate this generall longing, and inflamed desire, &amp; this
so naturall and proper an appetite, of bestowing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding
the riches, and common goods of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
this part of Iustice, which they call Distributiue
was held the most necessary. Which <hi>Aristotle</hi> says, either
is, or ought to be in a King, as in such a Lordly subiect,
and person, to whom this repartition and communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
properly belongeth. Wherein, aboue all other things,
Kings ought to vse most circumspection, prudence, and care,
for that therein, they vsually suffer most cosenage, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit:
For, in regard that to giue, is in it selfe so pleasing and
delightfull a thing; and so properly appertaining to their
greatnesse, and State, they doe easily let loose the reines to
this noble desire, and send giftes this way and that way, in
such poste-baste, that within a few dayes they run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
out of all, and draw dry not onely the Kings par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
wealth and treasure, but the riches of the whole
kingdome, were they neuer so great. So that, what is done
in this kinde with so much content and pleasure, ought to
be done but now and then: for such great courtesies, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
kindnesses, must not be made too common, for
feare of drawing on a dis-esteeme of them; nor done but in
their due time and season, not vnaduisedly, before hand, and
vpon no merit or desert, but when others want and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,
and his owne honour and noblenesse, shall oblige him
to expresse his bounty: And in good sooth, there is not any
Moathe, which doth so consume, nor any Caterpiller or
Grasse-hopper, that doth so crop and destroy the power of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:2459:114"/>
well doing, and the vertue of Liberalitie, as the loose hand,
that can hold nothing, and in a lauish and disproportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
manner scatters it's Donatiues, with so vnequall a distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,
that the dignitie of the gift, is drowned in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion
of the giuer. And therefore, as it is in the <hi>Spanish
Prouerb.</hi> which speakes very well to this purpose; <hi>Para
dar, y tener, seso es menester:</hi> A very good braine it will
craue, to know when to spend, when to saue. Yet mistake
me not I beseech you; for it is no part of my meaning, nor
did it euer come within my thought, or desire, to perswade
Kings to be close-fisted, and couetous, a Vice to be hated
and abhorred in all men, but in them much more. That
which I say, is; That, to the end that may not be wanting
vnto Kings, which doth so much importe them, and is so
proper vnto them, as to giue rewards, and bestow fauours,
it is fit, that they should doe these things so, that they may
be able to doe them often. And according to the olde saying;
To giue so at one time, as we may giue at another. Your
Trees in holy Scripture, are sometimes taken for the Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyffe,
or Embleme of Kings, for that they are in some
things like vnto them; Wherof, we shall speak hereafter. But
that, which makes now for our present purpose, is; That
the tree, shewing such a largenes, spreadingnes, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifullnesse,
in discouering it's fruit through it's boughes and
branches, and it's inuiting vs, and presenting it's prouision
vnto vs, first in the flower and blossome, to the end wee
may come to gather that fruit, which yearely it bringeth
forth in it's due time and season; and yet notwithstanding,
hideth and concealeth it's rootes all that it can, because there
lyes that fountaine, from whence all this good doth spring.
As also, for that if in that part it should suffer any hurt
or detriment, all the rest would cease, nor would it flourish
and fructifie any more. And I am of opinion, that when
Kings cannot content themselues with conferring of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors,
and bestowing of gifts out of those fruites and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:2459:115"/>

away in perpetuitie, or for one or two lifes, which is
a kinde of rooting or grubbing vp of the tree; the King
shall thereby be disinabled, and depriued for euer of the
fruit of those <hi>mercedes</hi> and fauours, which he might from
time to time, not onely yearely, but daily, and howerly,
haue afforded many of his good and well deseruing subiects.
As did that other, who, because they should not trouble
him with comming vnto him, to craue of the fruite, of a very
good tree which he had in his Garden, caused it to bee
rooted vp, and to be sent amongst them, to make their best
of it; whose fruite, had he let the tree stand, might haue
pleasurd a many, and that many a time and oft, whereas
now it could but content a few for the present, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture,
not so well pleased neither, because thereby all
hope was taken from them of hauing the like againe. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>

to this purpose; I like not that <hi>Gardiner,</hi> that puls vp

                  <hi>juros reales,</hi> and whiles the <hi>rayzes,</hi>
or roote of them, shall remaine aliue and whole, they may
yeelde good store of fruit, but if they come once to be
rooted vp, they presently grow dry, and wither away. In
the fourth Chapter of the Prophesie of <hi>Daniel</hi> is set downe
that dreame, wherein the King of <hi>Babylon Nabucodonosor,</hi>
saw that huge high tree whose top did reach vp to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and whose boughes did stretch and extend themselues
to the vttermost ends of all the earth, and so laden with
fruit, that there was prouision and sustenance sufficient for
all the Men and beasts of the world, and was a shadow and
shelter vnto all that came vnder it. And <hi>Daniel,</hi> by the
helpe of the diuine Spirit, declaring this dreame, told him;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2459:115"/>
                  <hi>Arborem, quam vidisti; tu es Rex.</hi> The tree that thou
sawest, is thou, O King. That tree, was an expresse sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification,
of that King, and of the Vastnes and greatnesse
of his Monarchie, and of that which conueneth, and is
proper to such Monarckes. Which is: To communicate
their fruit to all, To sustaine and maintaine their subiects,
and to hugg, and defend them vnder the shadow of their
wings; And this is said to haue beene, and to haue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neued
with that Monarke; whilest the tree stood whole and
sound: But the Dreame, and it's declaration, proceeded far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and <hi>Daniel</hi> told the King; That after he had seene the
beautie and greatnesse of that tree, he heard likewise a most
strong and fearefull voyce from Heauen, pronouncing a most
heauie and rigorous sentence, that the tree should be hewen
downe, and the boughes lopt off, and so wholy and vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
destroyed, that the creatures that came thither and were
fed and maintayned by it's fruit, fled thence, and forsooke
it. Yet the stump of the rootes thereof was left in the earth,
and bound about with a bond of brasse, and yron, &amp;c. In
this dreame, were signified three things, declared by the
selfe same Prophet, with the same Spirit of God. First, The
fall of that King and Kingdome, in those lopt boughes, and
the hewing of it downe, and leauing it fruitlesse; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That which vsually befalls Kings, who not hauing
wherewithall to giue, all those doe leaue and forsake him,
which before did follow him. Thirdly, That when the
rootes remaine, there is hope that it may be restored, and
returne to it's former greatnesse: As was to be seene in this
King, whom God so seuerely punished for his sinnes. For
the rootes of the said tree remained still whole and sound,
and were a most certaine prognostication, and assured hope,
that hee was to be restored to his former Estate. So that
when in Kingdomes, the <hi>Rayzes</hi> of the rents royall, remaine
whole and intire, though in the giuing away of the fruites,
there be much bounty and liberalitie vsed, those breaches
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:2459:116"/>
may be made vp againe, which are occasioned by so large
a hand; But when the <hi>rayzes</hi> are grub'd vp, when the roote
that should giue sap and life, is gone, there is not any means
of restauration to be made or found, though Kings should
charge their Kingdomes with neuer such excessiue tributes,
and draw (as they say) the very heart blood from forth
their subiects bodies. In a word therefore, there ought to
be had in giuing, Order, Moderation, and Temperance;
For a Prince, that giues without these conditions, is not
Liberall, but Prodigall, a great scatterer and waster, and if
not contenting himselfe with the fruites of the tree, he will
haue a pull at the rootes, Lord haue mercy on that Land,
for it is to be feared, that King will turne Destroyer. Giuing
hath it's times, its taxe, it's limits, and it's orderly maner in the
doing thereof. The excesse whereof, doth crosse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
distributiue Iustice. Wherein is to be considered the
kings abilitie; then the seruices and merits of the persons; and
last of all the Distribution it selfe, which must be done
with discretion and prudence. For all must not be throwen
vpon one either part, or partie; nor kings be like riuers;
which rising out of their bedds, breaking forth beyond their
bounds, vndoe some, and enrich others; robbing many, to
raise one. God free euery good Common-wealth from such
distributions as these, which are rather destructions then
distributions, and actions of Iniustice, not of Iustice. And
God (I beseech him) so illighten the vnderstanding and
heartes of Kings, that they may in an orderly kinde of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
conferre their fauours, and giue rather reasonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to many, then extrauagant ones to a few. For the
raine doth then most good, when all haue the comfort of
it. But when it powres downe in one place alone, that
marr's and spoyles all. Some grounds for want thereof are
parched and dryed vp; and other some, by too much, are
ouerflowen, and made fruitlesse. In like manner a King,
showring downe all the water of his liberalitie vpon one
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:2459:116"/>
particular person, it cannot but breede a generall discontent
and languishment, in all the rest of his subiects. And more
is the hurt, which resulteth from those, that are offended
with the great fauours conferred on others, then the good
that ariseth from those that are benefitted by them. For the
first neuer forget the wrong they thinke they haue receiued;
And the second treate of that they haue receiued, as of a
due debt. And all these, and a great many more inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
grow from the not true obseruing of this distributiue
Iustice. Let Kings conferre fauours on their publicke Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and vpon such persons, as haue done them great and
notable seruices, both in Peace, and in Warre: for this will
be well pleasing, and very acceptable vnto all, and will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them all to new seruices; And such a generall content
will it cause in all sortes of people, that it will make them
to brook with the better patience those great fauours, which
are vndeseruedly done vnto others, being in themselues men
of no merit in the world. I would not haue Kings to be too
much carried away with the inclination of their own mindes,
for as they are Kings, they will euermore be apt to giue
much. But I would haue them to place their eyes, as also
their consideration, vpon the qualitie of the person, to whom
they giue, according to the rules of Distributiue Iustice. For
from that in the receiuer, and this in the Giuer, is formed
that Temperance, Moderation, and Equitie, which giues li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality
it's being, and makes it to be a vertue Heroicall,
and worthy Kings; Which, if it be fayling in ether of these,
the one, or the other, it shall merit no such name; as you
shall see by and by, when we come to conclude this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
wherein we aduertise those that giue, that it shall be
much prudence, and make likewise much for the good of
the party himselfe, that receiueth, to goe leysurely along with
him in these <hi>Mercedes,</hi> and fauours. For this difference I
finde to be betweene offences, and punishments, fauours, and
benefits, that the first are done but once, because in discretion
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:2459:117"/>
they will not goe dayly nourishing the passion of those
who receiue the harme thereby, and stand in feare lest the
like ill might happen vnto them selues. As for the second,
it is fitting that they be done often, giuing now a little, and
then a little, that it may the better penetrate the palate, and
please the taste of him that receiueth them; As in our bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
meates and drinkes, bit after bit, &amp; draught after draught,
agrees better with our health, and taste, then grosse feeding
and full cups. Besides, this faire and frequent distribution,
cannot but cause a more settled loue in those persons on
whom they are bestowed, as also in those, who liue in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of the like.</p>

which may be made against that, which
we haue mentioned in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For this same sising of Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
and these same short bounds of
bounty, wherein some would shut them
vp, seemeth no way compatible with
the authoritie and greatnesse of Kings;
Especially on such occasions, wherein they are forced to
bestow them vpon persons that are deseruingly qualified
for them, and that haue done notable seruices, who are not
to be gratified with small gifts; nor may that seeme to bee
much, which is giuen but once. First of all I answer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
that it stands with good reason, that they, who haue
spent their meanes, and the better and greater part of their
liues, in the seruice of their King and Common-wealth,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:2459:117"/>
should be recompensed according to the qualitie of their
persons and seruices, when Kings are well able to doe it,
without putting themselues in necessitie, or charging their
subiects (which they too vsually doe) with extraordinary
Impositions. And if it be well considered, the maine drift
of our former Chapter was, that things might be so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
that Kings might haue wherewithall to giue vpon
such like occasions. That therefore which I say, is this; That
they ought to holde their hand in those Gifts, which they
giue meerely vpon their owne pleasure and humour, that
they may the better cumply with those which lye vpon them
by way of obligation. For they, that haue vnder their charge
and Command such a multitude and number of subiects, it
is not meete, that they should conferre many and great
fauours vpon a few, and few or none vpon many; shewing
grace vnto some with that, which in Iustice is due vnto
others, whose often sweats, perpetuall labour, and extreame
neede, serue now for riches, <hi>regalos,</hi> intertainments, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
rents to those, who in all the whole course of their life,
neuer knew what it was to moyle and toyle, or to take
any paines for the Common-wealth. Nay, which is more
(and it grieueth my soule to speake it) the sweat, and blood
of poore labouring men, is conuerted into rose water, for
to feede their delightes and pleasures, and that in such wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
riotous, &amp; loose intertainments, as certainely beseemeth
not Christians but Epicures and <hi>Sardanapalians,</hi>

of the flock &amp; the Calfes out of the stall; who drink wine in

the <hi>Grandeza,</hi> and Greatnesse of Kings, requireth, that
great rewards should be giuen both to the one, and the

Kings, for the conseruing of their Greatnesse,
then to know that they are but men, and that they cannot
stand in Competition with God, whose fountaine of riches,
is infinite, and is able to fill and satisfie all, and neuer can
be drawne dry, though it be imparted and distributed to
neuer so many. Whereas that of men, is but like vnto the
water of a Cisterne, which by being communicated to many
is diminished and exhausted. King <hi>Nabucodonosor,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Kings (of whose falls, there is mention made in the
Scripture) for default of this knowledg, fel from their estates:
And let that tree, whose top touched heauen, and whose
boughes did ouerspread the whole world (whereof wee so
lately made mention) serue now the second time for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
which going about to imbrace all in it's owne armes,

sooner found themselues full, but they presently resolued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
themselues to make him their king. And this their
determination, grew from two things which they saw
to bee in him. The one his noble disposition, in affording
them such free and plentifull intertainment; The other
for his great prudence and good gouerment, in giuing
order that the peeces of bread, and other the fragments that
were left,<note place="margin">Iohn 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

fragmeta, ne pereant.</hi> Gather vp the broaken meate, which
remayneth, that nothing be lost. Nor did he doe this, that he
had neede to set it vp, or keep it to serue at some other time
vpon the like occasion; for he could (as often as he would)
haue made bread of stones; but to instruct, and teach Kings
to knowe both to spend, and saue, to giue, and hoord vp,
where, how and when it is fitting, in regard that their power
is limited.</p>
               <p>Moreouer Kings are to consider that they, who at one
clap receiue much from them, grow so fat and pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie, that they
are not able to serue and follow them as they were wont, and
sometimes they retire themselues, and nere returne againe, to
see either King or Court, vnlesse meere Couetousnesse, and
greedinesse of gaine draw them thither to beg, more and
more,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 7.</note> &amp; to cramme their purses. Being like vnto that Crowe
which <hi>Noah</hi> sent out of the Arke, who as soone as he had
found firme footing, and whereon to feede his fill, neuer
came back again. Kings Palaces are, like <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, where
there is a great diuersitie in the Conditions of men; and
generally you shall meete there with more Crowes, then
Doues. And here, I will with your good leaue, take a little
libertie, to diuert my selfe from the Testimonies of Holy
Scripture, to those of Great Kings and Monarckes, some of
one nation, and some of another. And the first, that I
shall begin withall, shall be king <hi>Don Alonso</hi> of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:2459:119"/>
walking along by the Sea-side, caused many gobbets of
flesh, some great, and some small, mingled one amongst an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
to be brought vnto him, and still as the Crowes (which
were many) came about him, to some hee threw out the
lesser, to other the larger morsells. Those that went away
with the great gobbets, came no more in sight, but fled
their way; but those that had but a small pittance, and were
not so full gorged, they followed the King whether so euer
he went, and neuer forsooke him. Who tolde those that
were then about him; In this (my Masters) yee may see,
how much it importeth Kings to distribute their fauours
with moderation and temper. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi>
did much reprehend his sonne <hi>Alexander</hi> for being too
lauish of his fauours, and too excessiue in his giftes. Telling
him, that thereby hee peruerted the mindes of those, that
were to serue him, who in stead of seruing him with that loue
&amp; loyalty which in duty they were bound vnto, they would
now onely serue him for their owne particular interest, and
proper commoditie making, by this meanes, affection and
fidelitie become a kinde of trading, and merchandizing.
And certainely so it is, that when mens mindes make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
their Aime, and daily to get more and more, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
saleable, and tender their seruice to those, that wil giue
them most. And they, which doe thus accustome themselues
to craue and take, the loue of friendship and that thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
acknowledgement, which is due to the Doner, is turned
into interessed Loue; which is called by the name of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupisence,
And are (as the Comicke Poet saith) like vnto
those lewd huswifes which, <hi>Amore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

still begging one thing or other, that hath not some touch of
Couetousnesse, and some tincture more or lesse of vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnesse.
For, in regard that these men loue themselues, and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:2459:120"/>
their owne interest so well, they haue not one drop of loue
left for others, and if any doe remaine, they conferre it on a
third person, through whose hands, that which they pretend
is to passe. And the King, and Prince, to whom all is due,
rest depriued of two things, that are the most substantiall
and of most importance for the conseruation, perpetuation,
and augmentation of his Kingdome, which are their subiects
Loue, and Thankes. For the truest kinde of Raigning and
the likest to Gods kingdome, is to gaine the heartes of their
subiects, and to make themselues (as much as in them lyes)
Lordes and Masters of their good Wills. And it is our
dayly experience, to see persons that haue beene highly and
richly gratified, and extraordinarily well rewarded, to haue
proud very vnthankfull. For, this fault great benefits haue
with them, and such as are dis-equall to the deserts of those
persons that receiue them, that they are not thankfully
accepted of; And those that are benefitted, to the end
that they may not bewray this their imperfection (being
such, as it is no lesse, then so great a sinne, as ingratitude)
they soone learne to forget them; but those that are confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
on others, neuer slip out of their remembrance. In a
word, of all that that is begg'd, and of all them that begg,
few there are, that forbeare to goe this way. In confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof, we may alleadge heere that question, which
Christ made to one of those ten Leapers which hee healed,
shewing himselfe not halfe well pleased with the rest of his
fellowes. <hi>Nonne decem mundati sunt, Et nouem vbi sunt?
Non est inuentus, qui rediret &amp; dares gloriam Deo, nisi
hic Alienigena:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 17. 17.</note> Are there not ten cleansed? But where are
the nine? There is none found, that returned to giue God
prayse, saue this stranger. In Kings Pallaces, your strangers
and those that are newly come to Court, are your onely
thankfull men; For those, that are well acquainted with
the Court, familiarly attend the person of the King, and are
still assistent vnto him vpon all occasion, neuer acknowledge
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:2459:120"/>
the fauours that are done them, bee they neuer so great:
They are alwayes crauing, but are neuer satisfied; they
swallow downe whole riuers, and wonder not at it; they
thinke all <hi>Iordan</hi> is too little for them, and that they shall no
soner open their mouth; but they must presently sup it vp.
And the reason hereof, is; because they verily perswade
themselues, that all whatsoeuer you giue them, (be it neuer
so much) is due vnto them for their seruices, and their day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Assistencies. I therefore say, (and therein say but the
trut,) That one of the greatest happinesses, that can befall
Kings, is; to be serued by noble persons, and men of honour
<hi>gente granada</hi> (as the Spaniards tearme them) iolly, strong,
lusty people, proper, comely men, and persons of best and
most account both for riches and honour. But this is the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife
of it, that this golde, which should make such a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
shew in Court, and shine both in honour and goodnesse,
is canckred and rusted by Auarice and Ambition, which
eates into all mens mindes, and wholly possesseth them. So
that from the highest to the lowest, they are all well read in
the Schoole of Couetousnesse, Dissimulation, and deceit; And
your Priests, and those that weare Miters on their heads, are
not in this kinde the meanest Schollers amongst them. All
complaine, they are not rewarded, that they haue nothing
giuen them, &amp; if they haue any thing giuen them they thinke
it is all too litle. And betwixt this their complayning, &amp; their
thankefull acceptance, there is set vp such a strong partition,
that it neither suffereth them to acknowledge a benefit, nor
to intertaine it with that thankfullnesse as they ought. All
now a dayes attend their own interest, and not their kings
seruice; Who may say that of them, which God spake by
<hi>Malachie;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Malach. 1. 10.</note> Who is there euen among you, that would shut
the doores of my house, or kindle but a coale on mine
Altar in vaine? Not one, I assure you, but will be well
payd for his paines. There is not that Sexton, that Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Cleanser, nor scullion of the Kitchen, but will haue good
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:2459:121"/>
wages, &amp; other <hi>ayudes de costa,</hi> or by-helps. This great traine
(saith <hi>Seneca)</hi> of seruants and Attendants, seeke not so much
after a Master, as Money, a friend, as a fortune. Miserable is the
condition of kings, whom none loue for themselues but for
their owne ends, and the good they expect from them; so
that this their priuate interest fayling them, their seruices faile
with it, &amp; likewise faileth (so says S. <hi>Isidore)</hi> that loue &amp; Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
which is due vnto them, <hi>Non sunt fideles, quos munus, non
gratia copulat, nam citò deserunt, nisi semper accipiant;</hi> Those
whom Lucre, not Loue linketh, cannot bee faithfull. For
vnlesse they be still on the taking hand, they vanish, and are
quickly gone. Yet is it not my intent and purpose in that
which I haue sayd, to condemne those who demaund their
pay and satisfaction for their seruices, to relieue their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities.
For therein they doe but vse that lawfull course
which is appointed for them by way of petition. Howbeit,
<hi>Aristotle, Plato,</hi> and other Philosophers, would haue sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
to be solicitous not in sueing, but in seruing. And I far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
affirme, that Princes are to take it to their charge, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
those that haue done them good seruice; it being the
principall Office of distributiue Iustice, carefully &amp; vigilant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to distribute riches and honours, to those that haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
them. And this vndoubtedly, is one of the most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
meanes for the good gouernment of a Common-wealth;
For, as those three diuine vertues, <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi>
and <hi>Loue,</hi> are increased and augmented by praying vnto
God; so on the contrarie, are they lessned and diminished
by sueing vnto Men. For when subiects serue, and not sueing
obtaine that which they deserue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> humane Faith, Hope,
and Loue, is augmented in them; because thereby, they are
taught to rely on the vertue and wisedome of their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
who applyes himselfe to euery mans meritts, and
the iustnesse and vprightnesse of his cause; For which cause
they will loue him much, but much more, when he giues
without being importuned with petitions. And it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meeth
vnto them that hee giues not more willingly, then
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:2459:121"/>
he doth wisely, in applying himselfe onely to reason and
Iustice, and not to the importunate Petitions of Pretenders.
And therefore Kings are not to content themselues onely
with paying that which they owe, and to doe <hi>mercedes</hi> and
fauours to them that serue them; but that these should like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
goe accompanied with Loue and Good Will; for with
remuneration are the seruices requited; and with Loue, are
they obliged to doe them still more and better seruice. In
that Case, which the Scripture recounteth of King <hi>Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erus,</hi>
who, one night being not able to sleep and take his rest,
commanded Lights to be brought in, and some that were
about him, to take that booke, and read vnto him, wherein
were written the notable things that past in his raigne, and
amongst the rest, there was mention made of a great peece
of seruice, which <hi>Mardochee</hi> did him, freeing him from that
death, which two of his Eunuches had plotted against him,
by discouering this their treason, demanded of those there
present; What honour and dignitie hath beene giuen to
<hi>Mordochee</hi> for this his fidelitie towards me, and the good
seruice he hath done mee? And the Kings seruants that
ministred vnto him, sayd; There is nothing done for him.
Whereupon, he presently bestowed vpon him such great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
and dignities, that vnlesse he should haue giuen him his
kingdome, he could not well haue giuen him more. Thus
was this good seruant rewarded, honoured, and graced by
his Lord and Master, who without being importuned, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
called his good seruices to remembrance, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him aboue all the Princes of his Kingdome. And I
could wish, that all that are rewarded by their Kings, might
receiue their recompence vpon the like good tearmes of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and Iustice. But now a dayes, poore and slender seruices
(the more is the pitie) finde copious, and plentifull rewards;
and those (ordinarily) accompanied with ingratitude; A
thing, which Nature it selfe abhorreth; And which tyes
Gods hands from giuing, who is so liberall and so rich; and

<hi>Societas enim Patris ad filios, Regni

father towards his children, represents
the true forme of a kingdome. Let any
man compare the power royall to what
hee will, and (according to <hi>Aristotles</hi> opinion) hee shall
finde no one thing that doth fit so well with it, or giues it so
much fullnesse, as the Title of father, who day and night
beates his braines, and imployes all his whole study on
that, which is most fitting for his children regarding more
the good which hee may bee able to doe them, then any
profit that he expects to receiue from them. How many
times whilest his children, are a bed and a sleepe, doth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lye awake, casting, and deuising with himselfe, how he
may mantayne them, and better them in their Estate? What
a deale of care doth hee take to get his daughter a good
Husband, who is dearer vnto him, then himselfe? Great is
his care; but much more ought the care of a king to bee
in giuing to their kingdome, good, faithfull, and diligent
Ministers, to the end that they may doe all possible dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,
(as hath beene sayd heeretofore) fixing alwayes
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:2459:122"/>
their eyes on the Common good, and directing likewise
their owne particular in the same way. That which I would
say, (to expresse it in plainer termes) is this; That they
are not to subiect the Offices to the commoditie of the
men, but to seeke out men, that are fit and sufficient for
them. When <hi>Saul</hi> was resolued to recommend vnto <hi>Dauid</hi>
that Duell, or single Combat against the Gyant <hi>Goliah,</hi>
the better to accommodate him, as also therein to honour
him the more, hee put his owne rayment vpon him, and
an helment of brasse vpon his head, and a brigandine, and
all the rest of his owne compleat Armour; but <hi>Dauid,</hi>
who was a man of little stature, and not accustomed to
shut vp in harnesse, found the weight thereof to be too
heauie for him, and very troublesome to his body;
yet notwithstanding, to obey the Kings Command,
and that hee might not seeme to reiect the honour
the king was pleased to doe him, hee was willing
to make tyrall, <hi>Si arma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

could goe in it, or no? for he had neuer proued it. But
when hee found hee could hardly goe in it, and that he had
not the free libertie and command of his body, hee sayd
vnto the King;<note place="margin">1. Kings. 17. 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And therefore rather made choyse to betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to his sheepheards staffe, his stones, and his sling, which
he knew well how to vse, then to put on the Kings royall
rayment, together with his rich Armour, and afterward to
giue an ill account of what was committed vnto him. But
where shall you meete with the man in these dayes, that
is like vnto <hi>Dauid?</hi> Nor is it fit for Kings, in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
to imitate <hi>Saul,</hi> for we dayly see notable Losses in
matters of Warre, and Peace; by accommodating and
honouring such persons with Offices, as had neuer beene
trayned vp in them, wanting that sufficiencie of knowledge,
which is fitting for the administration of them. As for
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:2459:123"/>
your Prebends, and other Ecclesiasticall Dignities, whose
nomination appertaineth vnto Kings, they had neede take
the greater care therein by so much the more, by how

Your ancient Canons and Councells will bee your

reasons, that they are worthy to be read, and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by Kings, when they make the like Elections, or
Nominations, to the end that they may not erre therein:
And heere will I bring to their remembrance, that which
God did, when that famous and ancient Tabernacle was
to be built, which was to be a figure of his holy Church.
Who (as the Scripture tells vs) nominated <hi>Bezaleel</hi> a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
workeman in all manner of workemanship,<note place="margin">Exod. 31. 4.</note> whom he
filled with his holy Spirit, and indewed him with wisedome
and knowledge from heauen, that hee might finish that
worke, and bring it to perfection, God himselfe hauing
drawen the plot, and being the chiefe, and principall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triuer
thereof. And if for that dead Edifice, for which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
skill and dexteritie might seeme to haue beene suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
there was made choice of a man of such singular
wisedome, and such admirable partes, as is there mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in <hi>Exodus;</hi> for the gouernment of a kingdome, for the
ordring of a Common-wealth, for to put euery thing in it's
right place, and to administer Iustice equally to all, giuing
euery one that which is his; things all of them of such
great importance, and which doe so much beautifie and
grace this mysticall body of the Church, what ministers
will it bee necessary, that Kings should seeke out and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after? Namely Men, that are full of the spirit of God,
wise vnderstanding men, good Christians, and adorned
with all manner of Vertues. And if they will not beleeue
me, let them looke vpon that first Election, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
made, when <hi>Iudas</hi> turned <hi>Apostata,</hi> despayr'd, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:2459:123"/>
hung himselfe. In which Election, they made choyse of
Saint <hi>Mathias,</hi> a man well knowen, as one that had
beene bred vp amongst them, and from whom they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
very good satisfaction.<note place="margin">Act. 1. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Oportet ex his viris, qui no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biscum

Wherefore of these men, which haue accompanied with
vs, all the time, that the Lord Iesus was conuersant amongst
vs, &amp;c. Must one of them be made a Witnesse with vs of his
Resurrection. I say, that when Kings finde sufficient partes
and aduantagious abilities in those whom they know, and
haue neere about them, and in their Court, the Election
may in all likely-hood seeme to light more safely and happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vpon them, then any other. For they, who being still in
our eye, discouer no faultes, it may be presumed, that they
haue not any; For if they had, in such persons they would
hardly be hid. And let this be exemplified in some, nay
many of those your pictures which being beheld a farre off
seeme to be curious peeces, but drawing neere vnto them,
appeare to be but course worke, and discouer great faultes.
And therefore <hi>Diogenes</hi> sayd,<note place="margin">Prou. 17. 28,</note> you must stand aloofe to
looke vpon great <hi>Statuas;</hi> And I say; That he who in his
speech, seemeth to be wise and discreete, ought to be taken
for no lesse. For by a mans silent reseruednesse, and holding
his peace, it is not much, if he passe for a wise man; because
the Holy-Ghost saith; <hi>Stultus quoque si tacuerit, sapiens
reputabitur:</hi> Euen a foole, when he holdeth his peace, is
counted wise. In like manner, may he seeme to be a good
Man, that is a great way from vs, because we neither see
his deedes, nor heare his words. And peraduenture, for
this reason it was ordayned, that the Pope could not be
chosen, vnlesse he had beene one of the number and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of those Cardinalls there present at the time of the
Election. And when kings, cannot meete with sufficient per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
amongst those whom they know, they must looke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:2459:124"/>
out, though they bee farther off. For so did the
wisest King that euer was, King <hi>Salomon;</hi> who vsed dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
out of his owne Kingdome, for to seeke out the
best Artificers, and such as were the fittest and ablest men
for the building of the Temple. He could not content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with good workemen onely, but he sought out those
likewise, that were the best, and the worthiest. The like
course ought Kings to take; who alwayes, in those Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that they make, for the building and vpholding of this
Edifice of the Church, should not content themselues with
electing onely those that are good, but in seeking out the
best and the worthiest. Whereby their Conscience shall
rest the more secure, and freer from opinion. Whereas
in doing the contrary, those that are the wisest, and the
most learned, affirme; That their Conscience is not onely
charged therewith but that they are likewise bound to the
restitution of the robbery, that is therein done to the
Church. And it is a lamentable thing, that for to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
a priuate subiect, that he may eate and drinke his fill,
and triumph in his pleasures, a King should put himselfe
in hazard of going to Hell. But aboue all the foresayd
diligences, Kings ought to haue recourse vnto Prayers &amp;
supplications, beseeching Almightie God that he will illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
their vnderstandings that they may elect the best.
For so did the Apostles; who being to picke out two of
of the best out of the whole pack of those that were there,
at the time, when they were to proceede to the Election,
they betooke themselues to prayer, vttering these words
so full of meekenesse and humilitie; <hi>Tu domine, qui nosti

               <p>This, which we haue said touching prouision of those
that are knowen in Court, it seemeth, that it may open a
gap for those that are tumultuous Pretenders, and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Courtiers, to carry all before them, and let nothing
that falls, scape their fingers. For these are much better
knowen, then those wise and vertuous men, who ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
liue retyred, and attend more to the Complying with
obligations of their profession, and function, then to the
Compliments of those, who spend their whole life in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions.
And it hapneth not once, nor twice, but dayly, and
ordinarily, that they who follow the Court, and frequent
Princes Pallaces, haue not so much followed their studies,
and frequented the schooles. And few there are of them,
which take pleasure in reading of bookes, to informe their
knowledge, and to supply that, which is defectiue in them,
concerning the knowledge of businesses, and the true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
and execution of their Offices. But the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of it is, that if a wise and prudent Man shall seeke to make
his entrance and accesse to the King, the Porters will shut
the doore against him. And fooles hauing such free entrance
it is no wonder that wise men are kept out. As it hapned
to that wise Philosopher who being clad in a meane but
honest habit, pressed amongst the rest to the Kings <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camera,</hi>
or with-drawing Chamber, where hee vsed to giue
Audience, hauing very necessary occasion to speake vnto
him. But as hee offered to come in, the Porter still clappt
the doore against him, and would not suffer him to enter.
Hee being a discreete man, presently entred into the recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it, and seeing how the world went, shifted himselfe
out of the companie, and changing his poore, for a rich
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:2459:125"/>
Habit, and being in the fashion as others vse to be, that are
not knowen, to make them selues knowen in Court, way was
made him, and he presently let in. And at his going in, hee
kissed his cloake, and sayd; <hi>Honoro honorantem me, quia quod
virtus non potuit, vestis obtinuit:</hi> I honour thee, that hast
honourd me, for what vertue could not effect, my cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cloathing hath obtained; For he that is rich and well
clad, is commonly the best knowen and most respected.</p>

entrance: so that for the most part, the most deseruing, are the
least knowen. To this point therefore I reply, that those men,
which are to be nominated for Offices, and Dignities, may
be knowen two manner of wayes; First, by that good fame
and report which goes of them, and that opinion of
vertue, learning, and wisedome, which the world holdeth of
them. Which we may rightly compare to the sweete and
fragrant odour of that pretious and costly oyntment,<note place="margin">Iohn 12. 3.</note> which
the blessed <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> powred forth on our Sauiours
feet; Wherof it was said; <hi>Repleta est domus ex odore vnguen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti:</hi>
That the whole house was filled with the Sauour of the
oyntment. When either in Court, Citie or Countrie, there
is found a man, who is like a sweete Sauor in the nostrills
of all men, and beares about him, and scatters in what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
soeuer he comes, a most odoriferous and pleasing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:2459:125"/>
of his Vertue, Holinesse, and Learning (which is as
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> says of himselfe,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 15.</note> and his fellow Labourers, the
sweet sauour of Christ) there is no neede to seeke for any
other knowledge, or to make any farther Inquiry; for this
is sufficient of it selfe to make choyse of him, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
vpon him the greatest Offices of trust; It being safer to
put them into his hands, then into many of those men, that
are more in his Maiesties eye, and by sight better knowen
vnto him. For the best knowledge of man is by the eare.
And he that will not beleeue me,<note place="margin">August</note> let him reade Saint <hi>Austin,</hi>
who in a Letter which he wrote to Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> hauing
expressed the great desire and content that hee should take
in the knowledge and sight of him, corrects that speech of
his, saying; That he had not spoken well, in saying; That
he did not know him, because he had seene his most learned
bookes wherein were represented vnto him his very heart
and soule. In like manner, he that shall be knowen by the
like fame, or by the learned bookes, that hee hath written;
Or if he be a souldier, by the great and noble Acts that hee
hath done, or by his good gouernment, in those places of
Commaund which hee hath held; Such a one I say, is
sufficiently well knowen, though he had neuer put his
head within the Court gates, or seene the Pallaces of
Kings. The second kind of knowledge, is that which your
ambitious and solicitous pretenders doe giue of themselues,
who are ordinary Attendants and Assistents in the Courts
and palaces of Kings and Princes, and the houses of their
Ministers, seeking to insinuate themselues into their grace
and fauour, by flatteries, Compliments, and Lyes, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
by giftes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and subornations, against which the
doore is neuer shut, because they carry about them (if need
be) the Master Key, not a gilded key, but a key of pure
golde, whose bitts and wardes are of diamonds, by which
they make their way, remoue all difficulties, open the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningst
locks, and enter the strongest castles. This is not that
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:2459:126"/>
knowledge, which is here required for conferring Offices
vpon them, but rather to shut them out of all: For it is to
be presupposed, that these who doe thus negociate, and pay
soundly for their places, must make their best profit of them
and fell at deare rates, that they may the sooner get out of
debt, and haue wherewith all to maintaine themselues,
their wiues, their children, and their familie. But to these
kinde of men, Kings may (and with a great deale of reason)
vse by way of answer, those words of our Sauiour Christ:
<hi>Amen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Amen, dicovobis, nesciovos:</hi> Verily, verily, I say vnto

deceit, which kings, vsually suffer by the cunning plots, and
bolde impudencies of pretenders, and by the fauour of
those which put to their helping hand, and giue them their
best furtherance; And this it is: That when any of these
pretenders is priuie to himselfe, that hee hath not the like
parts of Learning and Vertue and other abilities, as others
haue, to mount at the first flight to those high places,
whereunto their ambition aspireth, they seeke to enter into
the base<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t and meanest Offices, and that by base and vile
meanes, either by buying them with their money as good
cheape as they can; and when their purse cannot stretch
so farre, worke themselues in by the Codpisse, by match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with this or that other Courtiers Kinsewoman, and
other the like humane respects, making these the stepps for
their preferrment. God celiuer all good Kings from such
kinde of Prouisions; especially if they be preferred by them
to places of Audience, and of Iustice; for therein shall they
sinne grieuously, because they put men into them, that are
ignorant, and necessitated, who, for to relieue their wants,
and to maintaine their Vanities, they, and their wiues take
bribes, and set Iustice out to sale. And so, not by degrees,
and by little and little, but in all post haste, (to the great
preiudice of the Common-wealth) they goe still ascending
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:2459:126"/>
to greater places, and higher Dignities, wherein they goe
on in doing greater hurt and more mischiefe. And these
kinde of men, are like vnto your <hi>martinets,</hi> which if they
be not raised from the earth, are not able to flye, but being
raised neuer so little, they make a very high flight. So is it
with these men, who not hauing sufficiencie for the meanest
places, are no sooner raised a little by fauour, and by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orning,
from that first Office which they no way deserued,
but they afterwards make a higher pitch, and goe away
with the best Offices in the Kingdome. And the errour in
this, is, for that Kings doe thinke, that they are put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those places for their merit, and good partes, when as
indeed it is farre otherwise. Though sometimes also it cometh
so to passe, that Kings knowing how that such a one is not
fit for such a place, or such an Office, that they may put
him out of that, clap him into another better and greater
then the former, and which requireth greater parts, and
more sufficiencie; crossing that sentence of our Sauiour
Christ (who is the eternall wisdome of his father, and
cannot lye:) That hee, that is not trusty in a little, is not
to be trusted with much. Neither can he be held fit for
the greater places, that hath not sufficiencie in him for the
lesser.</p>

Wherefore, to seeke to runne any other course, sauours
of I know not what singularitie, rashnes and presumption.
Hereunto I answer, that there is a great deale of difference
betwixt sueing to God, and sueing to Men, and in the crauing
of spirituall goods, and the crauing of Temporall. For, in
sueing to God, we better our selues much, and those princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Vertues, <hi>Faith Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charitie,</hi> are much increased
and augmented. For our Faith increaseth, when we petition
God, by acknowledging him to be the vniuersall Lord of
all things, who onely can fulfill our requests and desires
According to that of Saint <hi>Paul; super abundanter quàm
petimus aut intelligimus;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 3. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

we hope, for a good end of our petition: And for this
cause doe we likewise loue God, from whom wee hope to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:2459:127"/>
receiue the good, we desire. And this hath the greater
force and truth with it, when wee craue spirituall goods.
And of these spake our Sauiour when hee sayd; <hi>Pettite, &amp;
accipietis.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iames 1. 5.</note> And the Apostle S. <hi>Iames</hi> saith; if any of you

him. But it is conditionall, and bounded with a <hi>Nihil haesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans;</hi>
That he aske in faith, and wauer not. Which may
likewise be vnderstood of Temporall goods, as they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned
to a spirituall, and super-naturall end. But to aske of
men, produceth farre different effects. And therefore we
are to consider, that for one of these two ends men may aske
temporall things; Either for to raise themselues, or to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
themselues. Of the latter of these, who demand their pay
and satisfaction for their seruices, for the remedying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing

are not to bee blamed; but in conscience, and Iustice, wee
are to helpe them, and make them due satisfaction, in that

There are certaine things (sayth he) which albeit
they may be honestly receiued, yet may they be vnhonestly
desired. Kings are to bestow their fauours, but others must
not sue for them. <hi>Hoc non peti, sed praestari solere,</hi> saith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Law; it is fit, good turnes should be done, but not sued
for to be done. And it was the same mans saying; <hi>Inuitum,
non ambientem, esse ad rempublicam assumendum:</hi> That he,
that was vnwilling to receiue honour, not he that did ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
seek after it was to be preferred in the Common-wealth.
And trust me, I cannot search into the reason, why it should
become a Custome, not to giue, but to those that aske; For
neither they, that giue, doe gaine thereby, nor they that
aske, are bettred thereby. For to giue, is so much the more
worthy prayse, and thankes, by how much the more liberally
and freely it is giuen. And the Prouerb saith: <hi>Bis dat, qui
citò dat:</hi> He doubles his gift, that giues quickly. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he, that stays looking and expecting to be sued vnto, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to giue with an ill will, and not so freely as he should.
For (as <hi>Seneca</hi> truly saith) there is not any thing that costes
a man dearer, then that which is bought by intreaties, and
petitionings. And therefore, as often as either offices, or
Rents, are bestow'd on those, which deserue them, without
making suite for them, the whole body of the Common-wealth
doth commend and indeare the rectitude, and iust
dealing of the Doner. And all good and vertuous men
take heart and incouragement thereby, and are fill'd with
good hopes; and those, which are otherwise, ashamed and
confounded; and becomes the meanes many times of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them turne ouer a new leafe, and leaue their former
lewd course of life. But when this rigour and strictnesse is
obserued, of not giuing to him that asketh not, though hee
merit and deserue the same, it seemeth to be made a merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:2459:129"/>
cause, to sue, and to negociate; and occasion giuen,
that more care should be placed in this, then in deseruing
well, whereby mens mindes and courages, haue their edge
abated, and are dishartened. For to aske, when it is not for
the end aforesayd, it draweth on this inconuenience with it.
Which is <hi>Aristotles</hi> opinion, and is made good in all true
reason of Morall Philosophy. The Apostle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> quoteth
a sentence, which our Sauiour Christ vsed often to repeate;
<hi>Beatius est magis dare, quam accipere:</hi> Farre more excellent,
and more prayse-worthy is it, to giue, then to take. And if
not to take, be so good a thing, much better shall it be, not

And herein did the Saints of God glorie much, and Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> saith of himselfe; That he would rather liue by the
labour of his hands, then be importunate in crauing. And
that great Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> that which he did most prize
and iustifie himselfe of before the people, was, that hee had
faithfully performed his function, without crauing or taking
any thing. There was a time, wherein the Romane Senate
did ordaine, that the Consullship, and other the chiefe
Magistracies, should not be giuen to any, saue such as sued
for them. This Law, at first was good; for then, none durst
presume to sue for them, but those, who in the peoples opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
did well deserue them, and tooke it for a great affront
that they should receiue a deniall. So that by this meanes
euery one did labour by his noble Actions to deserue that
Dignitie, as also that all the people might thinke him worthy
thereof. Afterwards, this proued to be a very pernicious
Law; for, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> those, who by their vertues, and heroicall
Acts, did deserue this Honour; but those, that were the
most powerfull did sue for it, whilest others, for feare of
these, durst not shew themselues in the busines, and so were
vtterly excluded from those honourable Offices. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience,
was taken notice of, and <hi>Publicola</hi> the Consull
made a Law, vpon paine of death, wherewith he was to be
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:2459:129"/>
punished, who without approbation from the people of
Rome, should sue for any of the said Offices. And likewise,
for the curbing of this Vice, was the <hi>Calphurnian</hi> Law
enacted. But now (for our finnes) hath crept in amongst
vs that Greekish infection,<note place="margin">Isocrates Orat. de pac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that hight, that in stead of putting ambitious pretenders to
death, those honourable places were not bestowed but
vpon those, which did shame-fully sue for them, and could
best negociate by their power, purse, or friends, whichis, was,
and will be an occasion in all times and places, that with scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
corruption, and Simoniacall trading, Offices,
and Benefices shall be giuen and solde, to him that
will giue most. Not the better person, but the better
purse shall carry it. The inconueniences, that follow the
so much fauouring of suitors, and being vn-mindfull of those,
who tend nothing else but to serue, and deserue well, are very
great, and not vnknowen to all those that are Statists, and
good Common-wealths men. And if the shortnesse, which
I desire to obserue in this Discourse, did not hinder mee, a
large field would here discouer it selfe vnto me, wherein to
enter and expatiate my selfe, and might take occasion to
treate of the false hoods, shiftes, deceits, and iniustices, which
are dayly vsed in such like pretensions, and petitions, which
haue beene the cause of the destruction and ruine not only
of particular Common wealthes but of whole Kingdomes.
And this which I speake, is of so much truth, that some of
the Hebrew Doctors hold for certaine, that the Monarchie
of the House royall of <hi>Dauid</hi> was ouerthrowne by giuing
credit to the malice and deceit of a couetous pretender, and
that of twelue Prouinces which his heyres possessed, of
those twelue Tribes, two onely remayned intire vnto him:
The case was this;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 9. 6.</note> King <hi>Dauid,</hi> hauing (in performance of

And thereupon, tooke hold of such an occasion, as seemed
fittest vnto him to worke this his treacherie and deceite.
When King <hi>Dauid</hi> fled from his sonne <hi>Absalon</hi> to the
mountaines, <hi>Ziba</hi> the seruant of <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> met him
with a couple of Asses sadled, and vpon them two hundred

an hundred of dryed Figgs, and a bottle of Wine, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the like commodities for the refreshing of <hi>Dauid</hi> and
his followers. And hauing a Lye ready at hand, which he
had thought on before, hee castes himselfe downe at the
Kings feete, and telling him a thousand leasings, raised false
witnesse against <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> informing his Maiestie, that
<hi>Mephibosheth</hi> was in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and tolde him; This day

all, that pertained vnto <hi>Mephibosheth.</hi> And truly, this
businesse was strangely carryed. For notable was the faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
where with the King gaue credit to the calumniation
of this pretender, and the remissenesse which he shew'd in
punishing so loud a lye, and so great a treason, when the truth
of the matter, and the innocencie of <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
made knowne vnto him. And that, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
concerning this point, is; That the cause why hee
did not punish this so fowle a treacherie, was; Either for
that he was conscious to himselfe of the fault, which he had
committed in hauing giuen such easie beliefe there vnto: or,
for that the rootes of this suspicion, and iealousie, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
still deepely grounded in his heart. For the calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and cautelous suggestions of Pretenders, carry this
mischiefe still with them, that they pierce euen to the very
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:2459:130"/>
heart, and are hardly remooued from the minde of him, that
giues eare vnto them.<note place="margin">Prou. 26. 12.</note>

persons and their diuelish practises, that such base and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
people, might not vnder the colour and shew of
good and worthy men, thus abuse and deceiue them. In a

deceitfully euery one with his neighbour, flattering with

destroy such deceitfull and lying tongues, to the end that

many inconueniences would be excused, if those persons, to
whom the charge is committed of distributing Offices, and
rewarding of seruices, would take the care, to conferre them
on those that deserue them, and not on those that negociate
and sue for them; then would there not be so much libertie,
nor so many tricks vsed in petitioning, nor so many Orators
in the Courte, in whom, by this suing vnto them, couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:2459:131"/>
increaseth, and the hungry appetite of taking; whilest
in the meane while all modestie and shame is vtterly lost.
And I am verily perswaded, that kings many times, streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by earnest intreaties, and the importunate prayers of
such as are in neere places about them, doe vndeserued fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
rewarding vnworthy suitors, and leauing out those
that are worthy, because they doe not offer to speake and sue
vnto them. And that you may perceiue that I doe not speake
this of mine owne head, or that it is a birde of mine owne
hatching, I will relate that here vnto you, which Saint
<hi>Luke</hi> reporteth of an importunate woman,<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 3.</note> who finding
her selfe wronged, came to a secular Iudge, that was an ill
minded man, and vniust, and was very earnest with him,
crying still vnto him; doe me Iustice against mine Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary:
Which he would not of long time, but afterwards
he sayd with himselfe; Though I feare not God, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
man, yet because this woman troubleth me, I will
doe her right, lest at the last shee come, and make mee
weary. To begge, and sue, is an easiy office, especially, when
pretenders know, that hearing breedes wearisomnesse, and
that by this meanes they obtaine that which they sue for,
it being the nature of many men, and more particularly of
Kings that loue their ease, to be quicke in their grants, for
the avoyding of further trouble. Our Sauiours Disciples,
were much troubled, &amp; their eares were euen tyred out, with
hearing the clamourous voyce of the <hi>Cananitish</hi> woman, and
intreated <hi>Christ,</hi> that he would dispatch her, that they might
be rid of her. And we vsually see, that your importunate
suitors, be it iust, or vniust, obtaine their purpose. And I
know not, whether I may blame them most, or those that
put them to it, to be importunate in this, or that, be it right,
or be it wrong. God knowes where the fault lyes, and will
reward euery one, as he deserues.</p>

Tower, they say, that it was very high, euen, and streight,
and for to represent the beautie of the face of the Spouse,
it is (and with a great deale of proprietie) sayd; That
her nose is like a Tower; for that, which doth most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
a Citie, or any other place whatsoeuer, is a fayre high
Tower. In like manner in the face of any person, the nose,
which is that, which is eleuated and lifted vp aboue all the
other parts of the face, expresseth great beautie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
to be without a nose, or to haue it too hooked, or too
flat, extraordinarily crooked, or extraordinarily little, is a
foule deformitie. And therefore, the summe of all, that
hitherto hath beene sayd, is; That, what a goodly fayre
Tower doth, in the adoring and setting forth of a Citie,
which doth exceedingly grace and beautify the same; The
same doth the nose in the face of the Spouse, which is so
well proportioned, that it much commendeth all the
whole feature. And vpon this Litterall, leaneth the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
sence of this place; which is: That this Tower
doth denotate discretion, and prudence, which exalts it
selfe aboue all other the workes of Vertue, and doth
grace and beautifie them all. Many of the Gentiles erected
Fortune for their Goddesse; It seeming vnto them, that
shee was the onely Lady, and Mistris of all good, and
bad successe; But others, which drew neerer vnto Truth,
and Reason, made a iest thereof, and sayd; That it was
not Fortune, that afforded happinesse, and prosperitie, but
prudence; and that shee was rather Fortunes Mistris, and
that her power did predominate ouer the Starres. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>No Deitie, no power, is wanting to him, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed

such as are carelesse in their businesses, attribute Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to Fortune, that they may free them selues from the note
and imputation of carelesnesse, and imprudencie. But the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:2459:133"/>
truth is, that fortune stays not behinde, when prudence
setts forward.<note place="margin">Salust.</note> And therefore it was well sayd of <hi>Salust;
Vnusquisque est artifex fortunae suae;</hi> Euery man is the
worker out of his own fortune. And the Spanish Prouerb
tells vs, <hi>Que la buena diligencia, es la madre de la bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enauentura:</hi>
That good diligence, is the mother of good
successe. So that in very deede, there is neither good, nor
bad Fortune, but it is the will of God, that rules and
gouerns all; and the care, and prudence, wherewith men
haue recourse vnto that, which is fit and conuenient for
them. And therefore is prudence in Kings, of that
great importance, and ought to be, (as we sayd of the
Spouses nose) like a high tower; and not according to
that modell as they would haue it, but it must be placed
vpon Mount <hi>Lebanon;</hi> to the end, that being in so high
and eminent a place, it may make the better discouery.
Kings must haue an eye as well to that which is a far
off, as that which is neere at hand; on this side, and on
that; heere, there, and euery where. They must bee
ready to supply vpon this, or that other occasion; They
must see,<note place="margin">Terentius.</note> and foresee all. <hi>Istud est sapere, non quod ante
pedes modo est videre, sed etiam illa, quae futura sunt,
prospicere,</hi> sayd the Comicke: This, in realtie, is true
wisedome, not to see that onely which is before his feete,
but to foresee that also which is to come. And this
prouidence, circumspection, or prudencie, sound alike, and
are in a manner one, and the same thing. The Ancient
did so artificially paint prudencie, that shee seemed to looke
euery way, and to haue her eyes fixed on whatsoeuer did
behold her. For prudence, as it is silent, so it is searching;
nothing escapes her knowledge. And it is a vertue that
maketh Kings like vnto God. For, as hee, by his diuine
prouidence, doth foresee all, and gouerne all and hath all
things present before him, so they by their humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which participateth of the diuine, behold things
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:2459:134"/>
past, dispose of things present, and prouide for things
to come. Some call her <hi>Filiam Dei,</hi> Gods daughter,
because it seemed vnto them, that shee had something of
the Deitie in her, that shee was his Minister in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the world, and disposition of all things, and
ought likewise to be the Mistris of Kings vpon all their
occasions. For (as <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> avouch)
no man can gouerne well, that is not prudent. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
times, the Common people were of opinion, that
Prudence was annexed vnto Kings, and that they had
a particular gift to fore-see that, which was to come.
And such, as were prouident, and prudent, they held to
bee Diuine. True it is, that wisedome is the gift of
God, and wee must craue it of him, as did <hi>Moses,
Ioshua, Dauid, Salomon,</hi> and other wise Kings. Which
to obtaine, wee must shunne and flye from sinne; for,
it is impossible that hee should bee prudent, that is not
vertuous. And so much hath a man of prudence, as hee
hath of vertue. And according to this measure, shall the
authoritie, credite, and opinion bee which hee shall hold
with the people. The Offices and effects, which Prudence
doth, and causeth, are many; And some of them are
collected, out of the many and various expositions
which the Doctors attribute to this Tower, and nose of
the Spouse, which we will goe disposing, by it's Paragraphes,
in this chapter.</p>

The Lord is mercifull and gracious, slow to anger, and
plentious in mercie: that is; Of wide nostrills, full of
sufferance and patience; for the smoake of fury and choler
doth not so soone runne vp the chimney, as in those which
haue straight and narrow nostrils, who are soone hot, and
sodainely incensed to anger. And the selfe same <hi>Philo</hi> saith,
that in the <hi>Leuiticall</hi> Law, they were not admitted to the
Preisthood, who had either a little, crooked, or dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
nose, as being lesse fit for that Ministery. The one,
are hot and cholerick; the other, ill-inclined. Those againe,
which haue too great a nose, are naturally cruell, and proude,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:2459:135"/>
and these are mislik't of all; but that, as much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

and is of sufficient largenesse to suffer and dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

little smoake. A qualitie, so much importing Kings, that
from thence did arise that Prouerb; <hi>Qui nescit dissimulare
nescit regnare:</hi> Hee that knowes not how to dissemble,
knowes not how to rule. And there was a King of late
times, which stickt not to say; that hee would not haue
his sonne know any more Learning, then that which this
sentence doth containe; for that it was so good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
a Lesson for Princes. <hi>Tiberius Caesar,</hi> did glorie in
no one thing more, then in the Arte of Dissimulation,
wherein he was so excellent, that neuer any, vpon any,
though neuer so great occasions giuen by him, could
search into his intents, or diue into his thoughts. In the
story of the Kings, it is written; That at the very same
time, that God commaunded the possession of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to be giuen vnto <hi>Saul,</hi> which was the first King he had
nominated, some ill disposed persons, that were malitiously
bent against him, did murmure at him, and speake ill of
him, seeming to scorne, and set light by him. But God
had giuen him such a measure of wisedome, and discretion,
that although all that they had sayd, came to his eare,
<hi>Ipse verò dissimulabat se audire:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 King. 10. 27.</note> Yet hee held his peace,
and would not seeme to take notice of it. For, when Kings
come newly to their Crownes, and that the things of the
Kingdome are not yet throughly settled, it is great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to reserue with dissimulation the punishment of
great persons, that with better occasion, and in a better
coniuncture, he may proceed against them, as reason and
Iustice shall require. That King shall not be accounted
wise, that shall pretend execution of Iustice with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Insurrections, and seditions; nor shall the iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his intent, suffice to execute his rashnesse in the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:2459:135"/>
meanes, vnlesse hee first ballance the businesse, and see which
way the scale will incline; as to see, how farre hee may
rely vpon the loue of his subiects, and how the end may
sorte with his designes, lest the danger of the scandall &amp;
disobedience, may proue to bee greater, then the profit
that can arise from the execution of Iustice. For in such
cases, it is great wisedome in a King, to conforme himselfe
according to the times; And that that which at one time
is worthy of punishment, should be dissembled, and reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to be punished at another time. Which course (as

King <hi>Dauid</hi> when <hi>Ioab</hi> so treacherously slew <hi>Abner.</hi>
Onely to some few, that were very inward with him, he
discouered the reason, that mooued him to dissemble the
matter, and not to punish him with death for the present,
telling them with a great deale of griefe; <hi>Ego autem adhuc

should haue sayd; To see the affaires of my Crowne and

stand, obligeth me, not to make that demonstration of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and iustice, as the heynousnesse of this fact doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
But the Lord shall reward the doer of euill accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vnto his wickednesse. <hi>Tribuat dominus facienti
malum, iuxta malitiam suam.</hi> Here, is much to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered;
the great care, which this King tooke in concealing
his purpose from the people, till some better occasion were
offred; For, if he should haue declared himselfe before, and
manifested his meaning to the world, hee might haue put
the whole Campe in danger of Mutining; or at least to
haue shewd themselues in defence of their Captaine. This
perill, he ouerpast by his great prudence, dissembling the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:2459:136"/>
matter for that time, and deferring it till the last vp-shut,
when now the businesses of the Kingdome were better
settled; For, the most important point in gouernment, is,
to make vse of Time, and occasion: facilitating with silence
and dissimulation, those orders and decrees, which doe
crosse the peoples humour, or that stand not with his liking
that is powerfull with them; For if they should be divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
before their due time and season, they would serue
for nothing else, but to incense mens mindes, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
to turne them against himselfe. Which certainly
might well haue beene <hi>Dauids</hi> case with <hi>Ioab,</hi> if hee had
shewed himselfe offended, and openly vented his spleene
against him, whilest he had his sword in his hand, and
stood so fayre in the peoples affection; who in that hurre
might haue done (God he knowes what) for the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of his ambitious ends. In such cases, it is great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in a Prince, (contineuing still firme and constant
in his purpose) to benefit himselfe by dissimulation, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for a fit time and season, when without danger hee
may vnmaske himselfe, and with the safety of his realme
and person, put his resolution in execution. A word well
kept,<note place="margin">Prou. 25. 11.</note> and fittly spoken is (saith <hi>Salomon)</hi> like apples of
gold, in pictures of siluer; which doth not onely shine
and giue a glorious luster, but worketh it's effect, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth
the art and cunning of it's Master. And King
<hi>Dauid</hi> hauing heard the reproachfull words, and reuiling
tearmes which <hi>Shimei</hi> to the very face of him, and in a
loud voyce, vttred in the presence of those that were with
him, wisely dissembled his rayling, and was angry with
<hi>Abishai,</hi> because he was earnest with him, that hee might
presently take due chasticement of him, and reuenge the
great affront hee had done him, and would by no meanes
giue consent, that any one of all his Army should once
moue or stirre against him. For, that holy King thought
it fit in his wisedome, to leaue him to that occasion,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:2459:136"/>
which hee afterwards specified to his sonne <hi>Salomon;</hi> that
he might teach Kings these two things. First to relye on
God, and to attend his leasure, who will doe that for them,
which they cannot doe for themselues; As he did in that
known case of <hi>Moses</hi> brothers murmuring against him, which
hee himselfe so mildely and fayrely dissembled. But God,
to whose account runn's the honour of his Ministers, tooke
the cause into his owne hands. Secondly; That it is not fit
to be solicitous in appointing Iudges, and Informers, at all
howers, and in all places, against such, as in some occasions,
assume libertie of speech, and freely vtter their mindes. For,
as another sayd; In free places, and persons that are likewise
free-borne, wee cannot at all times exercise that slauery vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, as to clap a Locke and chaine vpon their tongues.
Who could haue done this better, then that omnipotent
King <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> when those licentious and loose-tongued
<hi>Libertines,</hi> reproached him with such sharpe &amp; bitter Taunts
as toucht him to the quick in his honour, and yet euen then
with what a royall minde, and princely reportment did
he carry himselfe, in those few milde and moderate words,
which he spake vnto them. Kings ought not to expresse any
alteration, turbation, or discomposure, for those things which
they see, nor to be startled euery foote with that, which
they heare, nor to shew themselues offended at that, which
is muttred and murmured of them. But let them (a god's
name) mend that, which is amisse, and then their mutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and murmuring will cease of it selfe. Heere likewise
Kings are taught, not to be curious inquirers after those,
that speakeill of them, nor to giue eare to euery idle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint;
For if it be once perceiued, that their eares itche af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, infinite will the number of Delators, and Informers
be. In the raigne of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and of <hi>Nero,</hi> more then in
any other were these <hi>Sycophants</hi> and priuie Accusers fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and things were then so glazed ouer, that they had set
spies, that should curiously obserue the semblance, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:2459:137"/>
one made of his Actions, euen to the knitting of the
brow, biting the lip or the like, which kind of carriage,
seru'd as a condemnation, and was seuerely punished. But
it is fitter for Tyrants then Christian Kings, to stand thus
in feare of the tongues of the vulgar, it being the part of a
magnanimous minde, to know how to forget, and forgiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries,
especially those of the tongue, to whose iurisdiction,
the most powerfull, are most subiect. And if they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
this wrong vpon account, the number would be so
great, and rise to such an infinite sum, that they may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bring their Monarchie to an end. That which most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
for their own and their Empires quiet, is to shake all
kinde of suspition out of their minde; and whatsoeuer others
thinke of them and their affaires, they ought to be so farre
from being troubled therewith, that it should no whit moue
them.<note place="margin">

vnto vs, is, To proceede so, that the good may not
likewise hate vs. And this King very well vnderstood, that
it is proper vnto Kings (as <hi>Alexander</hi> said) to doe well, &amp;
to heare ill. Yet are they not to imagine, that that which is
causelesse sayd against them, can any whit diminish or lessen
their honour; For it stands not with their condition and
greatnesse, that none should speake ill of them, but that they
should doe no ill: And then no such thing can be sayd of
them, but by the way of falshood and lying, which wil soone
vanish. Yet notwithstanding will I not say, nor shall it once
enter into my thought, to approue the impudencie and
insolencie of the licentious <hi>Satyrists</hi> but rather holde
them worthy of seuere punishment, especially when
they touch vpon the persons of Kings, whom all their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
both by Gods Law, and the Law of nature, ought to
respect, honour, and obey. Yet withall I say, that it is great
prudence, to dissemble vpon some occasions, be they neuer so
great, and to be close and secret in their intentions, till they
see a fit time to inflict punishment, and when it may be done
with least noyse. For some men sometimes, seeking to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the fire, by turning and stirring the sticks, inflame it
the more. And if at any time vpon vrgent occasions, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the odiousnesse and foulenesse of this or that other fact,
(reason and iustice so requiring it) they shall be forced to
vse seuere punishment, let it be mingled with moderation
and mildenesse, that all men may vnderstand, that it doth
not arise out of anger and displeasure, but out of zeale and

the people of the sweetnesse of the Princes nature, and his

shall be, this; That it is of great importance, that all men
should know, that nothing can be hid from the King, be it
neuer so close and secret, for the many and priuate diligences
which he vseth for intelligence, by the meanes of sundry per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

(whom the wisest and the waryest cannot avoyde) deputed
by his Maiestie diligently to labour to heare, and vnderstand

that he may informe himselfe of the truth of them, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

a minde to see, and know all, they ought also to be milde,
and mercifull in punishing, mingling mercie with seuerietie.
For it is fit and necessary, that he that desires to know all,
should likewise dissemble, and pardon much.</p>

Such effects doth the smooth breast, and soft
heart of a King worke; And this is so sure a Tenet,
that for to keepe a Kingdome secure, and to be Lord of
many moe, there needeth no other claime, then that which
Loue and Gentlenesse maketh. For, in regard that the
heart of man is generous, it will not be led by the necke
with a halter, nor will subiects long indure the yoake of
a Tyrannizing and proud Lord: whereas on the contrary,
they are easily led a long, by a smooth and gentle hand.
And reason teacheth vs as much; for by how much the
more easily is the heart of man moued by conueniences,
then by menaces, by faire meanes then by foule, by
so much the better is it to gouerne by meekenesse and
gentlenesse, then by force and rigour. Whence we draw
this Conclusion, That too much sharpnesse, and excesse of
rigour in a Prince, procuteth hatred; and affabilitie and
clemencie, Loue. Which is that, which Kings ought
most to seeke after, as by and by we shall shew vnto you,
when wee come to tell you, that these two qualities of
blandure, and clemencie, so befitting a supreme Lord,
are quite contrarie to that good expedition of Iustice, and
that integritie, which God doth require in a Iudge;
whom hee willeth and commaundeth. That in matter of
iudgement, hee shall not pittie the case of the poore:
According to which Instruction, it of force followeth,
that a King must represent two contrary persons; that of
a kind and pittifull Father; and that of a iust, and angry
Iudge. For, if in his owne nature, hee be kinde, and
tender hearted, there is not that offender, which will not
be set free by the power of Intreaties, and Teares, weapons;
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:2459:140"/>
wherewith the hardest and cruellest hearts suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to be ouercome. And if he be otherwise, what can the
delinquents hopes end in, but death and despaire? Againe,
if he be vertuous, and seuere, it is impossible that he should
not hate the vicious, and grow into choller, when hee shall
heare of their cruell outrages and insolencies.<note place="margin">Hie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

our consideration, nor lyable to inconueniencie, that a
King should represent two persons, so contrary in shew, as
iudging with Iustice, and Mercie. For two vertues cannot
bee contrary. And as the Saints and holy Doctors
say, (and they are in the right) Mercie doth not hinder the
execution of Iustice, but it moderateth the crueltie of the
punishment. And it is very necessary in a good Iudge, that
hee should haue a true and faithfull paire of balance in his
hands, and in either scale to put rigor, and equitie, that hee
may know how to correct the one by the other. The Kings
of <hi>Portugall,</hi> (especially <hi>Don Iuan</hi> the third) did vse to iudge
Capitall crimes, accompanied with his Councell, and were
alway accounted fathers of the people, because with them,
Iustice, and Mercie, walked hand in hand; shewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
iust in punishing the fault, and mercifull in mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the punishment. By which meanes, they were of all,
both feared and beloued. And let not Kings perswade
themselues, that this doth lessen their authoritie, and
take of from their greatnesse, but giues an addition;
and the oftner they sit in iudgement, they shall doe God
the more seruice, and the Kingdome more good: And
in conscience, the surest and safest course, for that recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
obligation, which is between the King and his subiects.
For they owe obedience, seruice, and acknowledgement to
him, as their Lord and Master. And he vnto them, Iustice,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:2459:141"/>
Defence and Protection. For to this end and purpose, doe
they pay him so many great Tributes, and Taxes. Nor is
it enough for him to doe it by others, but he must also doe
it by himselfe. For, neither that great Gouernor of Gods
people, <hi>Moses,</hi> nor any other after him, is, in all the whole
body of the Bible to be found, that euer yet condemned
the occupation of iudging the people, to bee vnworthy
royall Maiestie nor contrarie to the reputation of a King.
I know no other preiudice in it, saue that it is impossible
for one sole man, to vndergoe so great a taske. And this
impossibilitie ariseth from the multitude of subiects; and
in that case<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they aduise, That a King should not wholly
take away his hand from the doing of Iustice, but that the
lesser and more ordinary businesses, hee should remit and
referr them to different Ministers, and the weightier causes,
take to his owne charge, and be present in person, when
they come to be sit vpon, and determined; as formerly
haue done the wisest and greatest Monarkes, that euer were
in the world. Who did euer equall King <hi>Salomon,</hi> in
wisedome, greatnesse, and Maiestie? yet did hee hold it no
disgrace vnto him, to humble himselfe to heare suitors,
iudge their causes and to doe them Iustice. The Kings of
the Hebrew people, were called Iudges, because they did
glorie in nothing so much, as to heare, and iudge the people.
And in all Nations, this hath alwayes beene the principall
Office appertaining vnto Kings. And the Holy Ghost saith;
That the King,<note place="margin">Prou. 19. 14.</note> that faithfully iudgeth the poore, his throne
shall be established for euer.</p>

the Heads of their Kingdomes; Their
Estates serue them as Members; With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which it is impossible they should
be that, which their name speakes them.
And therefore, it is not onely conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
but necessarie, that they should
seeke to gaine the good wills of all, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themselues, (though they force their owne) to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of their subiects, and beholding them, as if they were
his children. Which is the best course to keepe them well
affected, and contented, and to be beloued, and obayed by
them. Which they may easily doe, if they will but thinke
themselues, that they are sheepheards, and fathers of those
people, which God hath recommended vnto them, easing
them of those wrongs and grieuances, which they vniust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suffer; laying no more vpon them, then they are able to
beare; suffring them, when reason shall require, to take their
ease and their quiet; and helping to sustaine them, when
they grow poore, and are decayd. <hi>Plato</hi> tells vs, That for a
Prince to be good, and to be beloued of all, hee must bestow
all his loue, and his whole heart, vpon the Common-wealth;
his will, on the Gods; his secret, on his friends; and his
Time, on businesses. For, by thus reparting himselfe with
all, he shall haue a part in all, by all of them comming to
vnite themselues with him. Onely in this good Corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency
of Loue betweene Kings, and their subiects,
wise <hi>Periander</hi> placeth all the safetie, and good fortune of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:2459:142"/>
Kings and Kingdomes. <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> King of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi>
was once askt the question, How a King might liue secure;
For that it is oftentimes seene, that neither multitude of
seruants, nor a guard of Halbardiers can defend them from
violence? To which demand, hee returned this answer:
<hi>Si suis populis ita imperet, vt parentes filijs;</hi> If he so rule ouer
his people, as a father doth ouer his children. The King
that loueth his subiects, and is againe beloued by them,
neede no guarde, they are his guard. For Loue, where it
is true and faithfull, plainesheth the knottiest peece of
timber, smootheth the roughest and most vnhewen dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
and makes all faire, safe, and peaceable. It is a
most strong wall, and more durable, yea then Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
With this, no difficulty can offer it selfe vnto them,
which they may not ouercome; no danger, whose impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
they may not oppose; no command, which
they will not obay. For as Kings desire no more of
their subiects, but to be well serued by them; so subiects,
pretend nothing from their Kings, but to be beloued by
them. And indeede, the one dependeth on the other. For,
if a King loue not his subiects, he shall neither be well serued,
beloued, nor obayed by them. And as little, if he loue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
too much. For the more care he takes of himselfe and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
his owne particular, so much the more his subiects
loue departs from him. For the harmonie of a Common-wealth
consisteth, in that all should liue by the Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
and they by their subiects loue. For they ought to
be vigilant in all that belongs to their seruice: and Kings
most watchfull in that, which concernes their generall good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
So that none is to haue lesse part in the King, then the King
himselfe. And because it is impossible to content all, by
reason not onely of their different, but contrary natures, it
is necessary at least to content the most. There are two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
of States, or two sorts of people, to be considered
in a Kingdome; The Citizens, (or which comprehendeth
all) the common people: Or your Peeres, and such as either
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:2459:142"/>
are persons of Title, or aspire to be. It shall be good dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
&amp; prudence, to procure to content the people, (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in a Kings first entrance into his raigne) in that which
is reasonable and honest. And if their demaunds shall be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
to dissemble with them, and to take time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of it, and so by little and litle, let their blood goe coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
This was the Counsayle of your olde Counsailours.
Which had it beene followed by that young King <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi>

his people had not rebelled against him, nor hee in
the beginning of his Empire, (before he was scarce warme
in his throne) haue lost ten Tribes of the Twelue. The
Common people, are alwayes grumbling, and complayning,
and ready to runne into rebellion, as being fearelesse, in
regard of their multitude, and carelesse, for that they haue
little or nothing to loose. The <hi>Minor Plinie,</hi> after that hee
had made a large Catalogue of the naturall vertues of the
Emperour <hi>Traiane,</hi> after that he had shewen what great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
he made of the Common people, he sayth; Let not a
Prince deceiue himselfe, in thinking, that hee is not to make
any reckoning of the common people; for without them he
cannot sustaine, nor defend his Empyre. And in vaine shall
hee procure other helpe, for that were to seeke to liue with a
head, without a body; which besides that it were mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous,
it must needes toter and tumble downe with it's
owne weight, because it hath nothing to beare it vp. And
if Kings will needes know what kinde of thing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people is, and what able to doe vpon all changes and
alterations, let them take into their consideration, that which
passed at the arraignment and death of our Sauiour Christ,
where there was not that Rule of reason of State in the vilest
manner, which was not then practized. And the first stone
that the Princes of the Scribes and Pharisees moued against
him, was the people; for they knew well enough, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them they could not awe, and feare <hi>Pilate,</hi> nor moue him
by their accusations, and false witnesses to condemne him.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:2459:143"/>
In the next place, they had recourse to the particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniency
of the Iudge, that he should not be a friend vnto
<hi>Caesar,</hi> but should loose his loue, if vpon this occasion the
people should rise and rebell; by which tricke they inclined
him to their partie, and wrought him to preferre his priuate
Interest, before publicke Iustice, and his owne preseruation,
before that which was both honest and reasonable. Againe,
it is more secure, to procure the fauour and loue of the people,
and more easie to effect his purpose by them. More secure,
because without their loue and assistance, no alteration in
the state can take effect. This their loue doth vphold Kings,
and gets them the opinion of good and vertuous Princes.
This qualifieth all wrongs, or makes the offenders pay
soundly for them, against whom none dare seeme to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular.
Lastly, for that the common people; hauing onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to their particular profit &amp; their own priuate Interest,
cannot desire nor pretend that, which your greater Peeres,
and principall men of the State do, who alwayes (out of their
ambition) aspire to more, and stand bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing their braines,
how they may compasse that, which their imagination tells
them they want; And by so much the more doth this their
Ambition increase, in how much the greater place they are,
and in a neere possibilitie of that which they desire. I sayd
(before) more easie; because the people content themsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es
with aequalitie (and his likewise makes well for Kings) with
the administration of Iustice with common ease and rest,
with plenty, and with the mildenesse, gentlenesse, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse
of him that ruleth ouer them. Now, that Kings
may procure this popular loue, it is fit they should make
choyse of such Ministers, as are well beloued of the people,
that will heare them with patience; comfort, and hearten
them vp, that they may the more willingly beare the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
that are laid vpon them, the Tributes, Taxes, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of the Kingdome, which in the end must light all vpon
them. For it is not to be doubted, and experience teacheth the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:2459:143"/>
truth of it, That the Ministers and seruants of a Prince, make
him either beloued, or hated; And all their defects or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
turne to his hurt, or profit. And let not Kings make
slight reckoning thereof, nor let them colour it ouer with
Reasons of State; For he, that once begins to be hated out
of an ill conceiued opinion, they charge him withall that is
either well, or ill done. For, there is nothing, be it neuer so
good, which being ill interpreted, may not change it's first
quali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e in the eyes of men, who iudge things by apparences:
Which is another principall cause, why Princes ought to
procure the loue of the people. For, in conclusion, most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it is, that the Common people, is not onely the Iudge
of Kings, but is their Attourny, also whose censure none of
them can escape; And is that Minister, which God makes
choyse of for to punish them in their name and fame, which
is the greatest of all Temporall punishments. Suting with
that which we sayd heeretofore of the voyce of the people,
that it is the voyce of God. For his diuine Maiestie vseth this
as a meanes to torment those, who haue no other superiour
vpon earth. And therefore it behoueth them to preuent this
mischiefe, and to winne vnto them the peoples affection by
as many wayes as possibly they can deuise, as by their owne
proper person with some; with other some, by their fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
and familiar friends; and with all by their Ministers.
For, there is not such a <hi>Tully,</hi> nor <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> withall their
eloquence, for to prayse, or disprayse the Actions of a King,
either to salue, or condemne them, as is the peoples loue, or
hatred. A great cause likewise of procuring this loue, and to
winne the hearts of the people, &amp; to giue them all good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
will be, if Kings would be but pleased, who are Lords of
many Kingdomes, and Prouinces, to haue neere about them
naturall Ministers and Counsaylours of all the sayd seuerall
Kingdomes, and Prouinces; For Common-wealths, &amp; king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
risent it exceedingly, to see themselues cast out of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration,
and gouernment, when they doe not see at the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:2459:144"/>
Kings elbow, or in his Counsell any one of their own nation,
and countrie, conceiuing, that they doe either basely esteeme
of them, or that they dare not trust them; Whence, the one
ingendreth hatred, and the other, desireth libertie. Let a
King therefore consider with himselfe, that hee is a publicke
person, and that he ought not to make himselfe particular;
that he is a naturall Citizen of all his Kingdomes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces;
and therefore ought not willingly to make himselfe
a stranger to any one of them. That he is a father to them all,
&amp; therfore must not shew himself a Step-father to any. And
therefore let him still haue some one naturall childe of euery
Prouince in his Councel. For, it is a great vnhapines to a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
not to haue any one childe of theirs (amongst so many)
by the Kings side, with whom the Naturalls thereof may
holde the better correspondencie. For these more speedily, &amp;
with more diligence and loue, treate and dispatch their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
then strangers either can or will, who must be sued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and will do nothing but vpon earnest intreaty, or by force
and compulsion, or like good wary Merchants, by trading
for ready mony. Let Kings weigh with themselues, that it is
as naturall a worke in them to afforde fauour vnto all, as in a
tree to afford fruit And it is a great glorie to a king, to oblige
all nations to loue him. For that King much deceiueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
who will make himselfe King of this, or that Prouince,
and no more; Sithence, that God himselfe, whom he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
on earth, professes himselfe, to be Lord of t'one, and
t'other, and of all. And therefore, hee that is Lord of many,
should not throw all his loue and affection on a few. Let him
in such sort conferre his fauours on the one, that he may not
giue occasion of affront and disgrace to the other. For, these
generall fauours, make much for the honor and estimation of
Kings. It faring with them, as it doth with those trees, when
all sorts of passengers, goe gathering, &amp; inioying their fruits.</p>
                  <p>I say farther that for the augmentation and conseruation
of the loue of Common-wealths, and Kingdomes, towards
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:2459:144"/>
their Kings, (a maine and principall point, which o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ght to
be esteemed in more, then other great treasures) it will be very
conuenient (and is the Counsayle of persons of great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie,
throughly acquainted with Kings, and Kingdomes)
that they should haue some person, or persons of these good
parts and qualities; To wit: Men of good naturall abilities, &amp;
of great wisedom, to whom in particular, they should ommit
the care to heare those that are wronged, and male-content.
For the graces and fauours of Kings, as proceeding from
humane power, which cannot doe all it would, haue euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
beene lesse in number then the pretenders. And
therefore must of force follow, that there must needs bee
a great number of discontented persons in all Kingdomes,
euen in the best, and most sweetely gouerned. Some hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
themselues wronged, induced thereunto by their own
opinion; others, by disfauours; Some, by bad dispatch;
others, by delayes; And some, (and those perhapps the
most) by finding themselues deceiued in their pretensions;
A thing that ought much to be thought on, though there
be few, that take pleasure to heare on that eare. These
men, I say, troubled with cares, and transported with pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
thrust themselues into all Companies, great, and small,
high, and low, entring into discourse with Male-Contents,
and laying open their wounds vnto them; which kinde of
men, I would haue to be kindly dealt withall, that the
Kings Ministers, should giue them the hearing, that they
should temper and allay this their passion, that they should
hearten and encourage them, and indeede make shew in
some things to goe hand in hand with them, though it
be in some sort against their king and Master, seeking rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to maintaine their part, and that hee cannot blame
them if they complaine, hauing so much cause, laying
the fault either on the iniquitie of the times, or the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessenesse
of those, through whose fingers these things were
to passe; and that, as it was no fault of the Kings, for not
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:2459:145"/>
hauing beene truly informed, so can hee not but rest well
assured of their good bowells and sound intention to his
Maiestie and the State. This is a cunning artifice, and
admirable art, against that deadly poyson, of those mens
hatred and discontent, which repute themselues wronged
and disgraced. And the better will this take with them,
if this care be committed to such either person, or persons,
that are well liked and beloued of the people, and haue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with their naturall grace, the grace of heauen, a
gift which Kings can neither giue, nor take away; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
they giue that grace and fauour, whence resulteth the
peoples respect. For, it will not alwayes serue the turne,
to bee beloued of all; nor will this generall loue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
excuse him from being hated of many. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this the grace of heauen must bee sought after,
and such a man made choyse of, as hath this naturall
gift; for by the helpe thereof, hee shall be the better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,
and ouer them all haue the more commaund. This
Counsayle, was well esteemed and approued by that wise
and prudent King, <hi>Don Philip</hi> the second, as a very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
&amp; conuenient meanes for to temper mens mindes, &amp; to
get generall notice of all that passeth, either in word or deed,
and thereupon be able to giue all possible remedie thereunto.
And this aduice pleased him so well, that hee committed
the execution thereof to him that gaue it him and purposely
remitted some businesses vnto him, that he might haue the
better occasion to sound mens mindes, and to effect what he
pretended by that kinde of course: And in short time gaue
good satisfaction by the proofe, and made knowen to his
Maiestie how much good was inclosed in this Artifice, for
the conseruation of Kings, and Kingdomes.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Enebrard,</hi> and other graue Authors
say; That this statly Tower, and nose
of the Spouse, whereof wee discourse,
signifieth those, which gouerne the
Church, or the Kingdome, and such as
excell the rest in vnderstanding, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
sagacitie, and prudence. The
Egyptians likewise in their <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks,</hi>
by a high rising nose, vnderstand a wise and
sage minde, that hath an eye vnto dangers, fore-sees mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes,
and takes order for them in time, that it may not
be ouertaken by them. And such a one as this, a King
ought to haue. And certaine it is, that if that olde Serpent
had not had that hap in that first deceit, exercised on our
first Mother <hi>Eue,</hi> it had beene needelesse for one man to
watch another and to be so wary and circumspect, as now
they are. But because he, with such great craft, and subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
did powre forth this his poyson into the originall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of our nature, it was necessary that against this his
venome, we should take this <hi>Antidote</hi> and <hi>Treacle,</hi> for a
preseruatiue, and preuent one poyson, by another. And
as Treacle, being made of poyson, serues as a remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
poyson it selfe, so, for to resist that poyson<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
that Serpent by his subtletie, scattred and spred abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
vs; it is needefull, that men, following the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle,
which our Sauiour Christ gaue vnto his Disciples;
Be yee wise as Serpents, and harmelesse as Doues; should
ioyne these two together. For of these two, is made that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:2459:146"/>
fine Treacle, whereof we intend to speake. Not of simplicitie
alone, nor prudence alone, but of both together. This
is that true and perfect Confection; for prudence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a sound and harmelesse Intention, is but meere craft
and subtletie, (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayth) and produceth nothing
but trickes and deuises, to delude and deceiue. And a plaine
and sincere intention, deuoyd of prudence, doth but deceiue
and damnifie a mans selfe. I meane particular persons. For
in Kings this want of warinesse, and prudent sagacitie, will
procure greater hurt to the generall affayres of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth. Too notorious and well knowen is that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the glorious <hi>S. Ierome; Sancta rusticitas solum sibi
prodest:</hi> Holy plainenesse and simplicitie, doth onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
a mans selfe, That is; some particular person. But Kings
besides their good intention, and sinceritie of minde, must
haue prudence &amp; sagacitie, for to resist the plots and traps of
the ambitious, who still lye in wayte, watching a fit occasion
for to deceiue them, vnlesse they be minded to loose their
reputation, their authoritie, and their Kingdome all at once.
This is not a Prognostication, broached out of mine owne

there is no mysterie so secret, which hee must not pry, and

winde and sift out. And from that high place, wherein
they are seated, they are, like sentinalls in a watch-Tower,

diuelish plots deuised against them, and of the slye and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile

And presently thereupon, hee stouped down, and fell to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

making them farther ashamed, being conuicted by their own
conscience, they might one by one get them gon, and leaue
the poore woman free. These men came armed with the

would haue absolued her of that crime, they would then
haue accused him for an infringer and breaker of the Law;
And in case hee should haue condemned her, they would
haue charg'd him with crueltie. But our Sauiour was euery

The like trick they would haue put vpon him, &amp; with

for those Princes also, that haue not as yet gained with all

vnto them, wherein they might catch these crafty &amp;
subtill Foxes; And they ought purposely to hunt after them,
&amp; to perfourme some exteriour, and publick actions in order

                     </gap>l for ioy, saying;
surely, the wisedom of God is in him; And from thence forth
they began to respect, &amp; feare him. Yet mistake me not, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
yee; For, I do not say, that Kings should desire, that any
ill should betide any man; but that they ought, &amp; may desire,
that some such occasion might be offered vnto them, wherein
they might shew their zeale and loue vnto Iustice, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
to the world, that they are wise enough of themselues to
execute the same. For there is nothing, that makes a King
more worthy of his Monarchie, as to win, by meanes of his
good Counsel and gouerment, greater credit and authoritie,
then what he had, when he began first to gouern: For a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is only the gift of fortune; but this other, argues his
owne wisedome, and iudgement.</p>
                  <p>But that, which I shall conclude this point withall, is this;
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:2459:148"/>
That this prudence &amp; sagacitie of the Serpent, so much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by <hi>Christ,</hi> ioyned with the Doues simplicitie, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
two effects of much importance in kings, which are these
Neither to deceiue, nor to be deceiued. Simplicitie, is without
welt or garde, plaine &amp; true, and knowes not how to deceiue
any man. Prudence, on the other side, is very wary &amp; circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
and will not suffer her selfe to be deceiued by any man.
Nay, it goes a little farther; for it perfecteth the whole essence
and being of prudence, and causeth a certaine dexteritie in
the dispatch of businesses, which is a great help vnto Princes,
and is the only Mistris to make them to vnderstand &amp; iudge
things aright. And likewise to see and discerne them by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
actions, and the exterior sences. The eye, the foote, the
hand, shall not wag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> moue, or stirre, but it shal discouer the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thought. Lastly, it is it's proper office, (Reason assisting
and the discourse of the vnderstanding) to anticipate occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to diuert in time the euill that may happen; For, (as
<hi>Tully</hi> sayth, and very truly) <hi>Nihil turpius in sapiente est, quam
dicere, non putaram:</hi> Nor ought it to be the Language of kings
to say; I did not thinke on such a thing, I did not dreame, that
things would haue fallen out thus, &amp; thus; or that I did not
throughly vnderstand the busines. For, in Kings, it is no lesse
shame to suffer themselues to be deceiued, or to be ouercome
by Artes, and tricks, then to be subdued in the open field by
force of Armes. Kings therefore, being necessarily to heare,
and negociate with so many and so sundry persons, to free
themselues from the slightes &amp; subtleties of some, must make
vse of this circumspection and sagacitie. <hi>Homer</hi> representeth
vnto vs a most prudent Prince, who (though vnlearned) yet
for that he was very crafty &amp; subtile, did gouerne very well,
and freed himselfe from many great dangers. Subtletie and
Sagacity, accompanied (I say) with a sound intention, and a
good conscience, (for that is it, we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

proceedeth not from sagacity, and subtletie, but from good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and Iustice.</p>

And is of that great excellencie, that the Ancient made

all the rest vnto it. Another call'd her the Mother.
A third, the fountaine or well-spring of the Vertues; A
fourth, will haue euery particular vertue to beare the name
of Discretion. And there is not one wanting, who affirmeth
that these did not hit the marke aright; for farre better
(saith hee) might they haue said, that there is no vertue at
all, without discretion. For albeit the Vertues in themselues
be perfect and full, and doe qualifie the person that posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them, as Fortitude, makes a man valiant; Iustice, makes
a man iust; Wisedome makes a man wise. And so in the
rest; Yet if the vse of discretion be wanting to any one of
these, they loose their <hi>Punctum &amp; medium;</hi> wherein they
consist and light vpon the extreames. So the Liberall turnes

discretion strikes a great stroake; for it distinguisheth false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
from truth; things certaine, from things doubtfull; and
from amidst what is ill, maketh choice of that which is good.
It qualifieth all things, and puts them in their <hi>punto,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

vnto Kings,<note place="margin">Arist. 3. Polit. c. 3.</note> Princes, and Gouernours to whom by office
it belongs to intermeddle, and haue a hand in such a world of
businesses, as require their direction and discretion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
all they must help themselues for the better disposing,
and ordring to a good end the affayres of the Common-wealth.
It is a neere neighbour vnto prudence, and bordreth
much vpon her, these vertues (as we sayd before) being so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chained,
and interlinked one with another that we cannot
touch one peece, without trenching vpon the other. And are
both so necessarie, that though I should say neuer so much
of them, I could not out-speake them.</p>
                  <p>But to come to the point; Let the first point of aduise and
discretion in a King be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not trust so much to his own wise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and discretion, as to forbeare, out of a presumption of his
owne sufficiencie, to treate and Consult businesses with
persons of prudence and vnderstanding. For, being that so
and so various are the cases, which dayly offer themselues
vnto Kings, and so graue and weighty the businesses,
whereof they treate, they must be canuased to and fro,
and well and throughly debated, for the better ordring
and setting of them; making former errours, to serue as
land-markes, for the avoyding of those to come. And like
a wise, and experienced Physitian, let him apply that medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
there, and in that case, where, for want thereof he had
formerly erred. Out of ignorance, to draw knowledge;
out of errours, certainties, &amp; out of bad successes, future war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
is admirable discretion.<note place="margin">Arist. lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(sayth <hi>Aristotle)</hi> By coniecturing of things past,
wee come to make our iudgement of things to come. And
it is a very good course to diuine by that which is past;
and in Kings exceeding necessary; to draw experience from
some times, for other some; And to beware (as they say)
not onely by other mens harmes, but likewise by their
owne. For, let a man be neuer so wary, neuer so circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
and let him watch and looke about, as if his life lay

listeth a faire lot, and a certaine and happy successe in all
his businesses; for this is only, and wholy, in Gods hands,
and not in his. And therefore to require any such thing
of him, were great indiscretion: but that hee should enter
into them (if time will giue him leaue) with sound aduise,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:2459:151"/>
and mature deliberation, and to intertaine them till hee be
able to bring his purposes to passe; And, <hi>si sit periculum

what in like cases hath vsually succeeded, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
let him settle in the present, and prouide in the future,
that which is most fitting, euermore hauing respect to the
iustnesse of his cause, relying altogether vpon God, and
humbly beseeching him, that hee will direct him in all
his wayes.<note place="margin">Prou. 16. 9.</note> For (as it is in the <hi>Prouerbs) Cor hominis dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponit

mans heart deuiseth his way; but the Lord directeth his
steps. Suting with that common saying; <hi>Homo proponit,
&amp; Deus disponit.</hi> Man purposeth, but God disposeth. The
second thing required of him is; That hee looke well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, that he diligently obserue the maner of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
throughout his whole kingdome, and that he haue a
watchfull eye on his publike Ministers, and Counsailours
of State; and more particularly vpon those, that are in
highest place and authoritie, and haue his eare most; And
that hee likewise labour to know the qualities, conditions,
and naturall dispositions of those, that now are, and to
conferre and compare them with those of former times that
hee hath seene, and knowen, or hath heard, and read of in
Histories; to the ende, that by the knowledge of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and naturall inclinations of those, hee may prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the end whereunto these tend; and by those passages
and proiects of precedent times, make a diuination of the
designes of the present. For, this <hi>prudentia in principe,
quodammodo diuinatio est:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plutar. in Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. Artic.</note> This prudence and discretion
in a Prince, is a kinde of diuination. And let them not tell
mee that mens manners, are changed with their names;
nor their naturall inclinations with the declination of times,
and that there is no correspondency betwixt those that are
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:2459:151"/>
now, and those of olde, for (as <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> saith,
who was a singular Master in this science, speaking of his
owne times, in respect of the former) the men are other,
but now their manners. They are now, as they were then; and
then as now. Well may it be, that for some considerations,
men may represse, and couer their affections moreat one time,
then another, but not, that they are not one and the same,
those of this time and that; and that early or late they doe
not the same worke, they antiently did. For, from one and
the same causes, it must necessarily follow, that we must see
one and the same effects. Let Kings therefore see (once
more I speake it) and consider well the estate wherein
stand the affaires of their Kingdome, how it is in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,
in their Ministers, and their Counsellours, what
their affections, naturall inclinations, passions, ambitions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
and the like, and make a iudgement of the one and the
other, of the present, and the past, and they shall finde, that
these, and those, great &amp; small, and all one with another tread
in one and the same steps, and ayme all at that faire white,
of their owne black and fowle Interest. And weighing
likewise with themselues, that some, if not most of those
Kings and Monarkes, that haue gone along in that track
and held the like course of gouernment, and made vse of
the like Ministers, either haue beene ruined thereby, or
brought neere vnto it, let them stand aloofe from it, or them,
or ought else whatsoeuer whereby they may either see, or
know, other their predecessours haue beene vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.
For, most certaine it is, that by the effects of
Cases past, we may know what were the causes of them;
and how in the like, the like may likewise succeede. The
science and knowledge of Kings, is like vnto that of <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,</hi>
wherein are better skill'd those of latter then former
times, in regard of those many proofes and experiences,
which they haue seene, heard, and read. Historie therefore
and experience, being the fountaines of humane wisedome,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:2459:152"/>
Princes ought to peruse Histories, and procure to know
how it hath succeeded with others, that thereby they may
take aduice and warning in cases to come; and from this
experience and knowledge of mens naturall inclinations and
affections, to draw thence a doctrine, for to moderate their
owne, and to know other mens dispositions, and withall,
to take notice, that the naturall dispositions of the men of
these times, are not more strong and able to resist their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
but are more weake in the naturall, and lesse perfect
in the spirituall, then those of our Ancestors. Whence that
followeth, which wee said before, that by the Knowledge
of the past, wee may prognosticate of the present, if wee
haue once seene, and made triall, that it fell out so with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men of the like state, and condition. So that it may
be collected, by what hath hitherto beene deliuered, how
necessarie it is, that a King, or supreme Lord, should exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
himselfe for some few yeeres, in the studie of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Lections of Histories, and may (if he will) come by
them, to know the customes, and inclinations of forraigne
nations, as well of those, that are free States, as those that
are vnder subiection; with whom he must indure so many
demaunds, and Answeres. To the end that the varietie of
Accidents, may no whit afflict, nor trouble him. For it were
a kinde of disparagement to a great Prince, to admire any
noueltie whatsoeuer, or to seeme a stranger, to the strangest
Accidents, that shall occurre vnto him. And hee must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
suffer this, and other great inconueniences and
deceits in matters of State, if hee be not well aduanced in
the knowledge of them, and with the people, with whom
hee is to treat. For many are they, that pretend to deceiue
him, and will not suffer the truth to come to his eares in it's
naked nature, but shadowed with some colour, as shall
make best for their pretension. For to cut off which mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
histories serue the turne, which supply the want of
experience, and set before his eyes in a short peece of paper
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:2459:152"/>
the successes of an age so large and of such a length, that
many liues cannot reach thereunto. A thing very necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in Kings, whereby to finde themselues prepared for the
present, and prouided for the future. For hee, that hath still
before his eyes what is past, is seldome deceiued in that
which is to come. And hee, that shall turne ouer the
Histories of former times, shall meete with the nouelties
of the present; as also with those truths which Sycophants
conceale, and such as are not flatterers dare not to tell him.
Onely Histories, without feare or dread, speake plaine
language to Kings, and yet remaine as whole, sound, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
as they were before.</p>
                  <p>Another point of Discretion, is; That for as much as
the aduice and wisdome, and more particularly in Kings
and persons of great name and ranke, is great, they should
not intermeddle in small matters, not shew themselues in
your lesser occasions, where the glory is none, and the
losse of reputation great, not onely if they be ouercome,
but also if they doe not ouercome to their great aduantage,
They ought not likewise lightly and without very good
ground to thrust themselues into businesses of great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and of that danger and difficultie, that they shall
not afterwards know well how to winde themselues out
of them: For it argues but a small talent of wisedome, to
know dangers then onely, when a man is in the midst
of them: And sauours of much leuitie, to put himselfe des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately
vpon cases of aduenture. And this is no other
Counsayle, then that which a very graue and wise man, gaue
the Emperour <hi>Vespasian,</hi> deseruing to be written in letters
of gold, and in the Cabbinies of Kings.<note place="margin">Refert. Cor. Tacit An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or no for the common-wealth, honourable for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
or whether it may easily be effected, or at least with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any great difficultie? And this is a Lecture, which
<hi>Christ</hi> reades vnto all, aduising vs, that before wee begin
any busines of importance, wee enter into an account and
reckoning with our selues, whether wee bee able to goe
through with it, or noe, and when hauing well weighted
the difficulties, dangeres and expences wee must bee at, wee
shall finde it to be of more charge then profit, to let it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
So shall wee rid our selues of a great deale of care,
and excuse the murmurings and censure of the people,
who will much risent it, that in businesses, wherein the
wealth, peace, and reputation of a Kingdome is interessed,
Kings should aduenture for the gaining of a little, to put
themselues in hazard of loosing much. As likewise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thereby is giuen occasion, of measuring the extent
and limits of the power of Kings, and of plainely mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing
to the open view of the world, that they cannot
alwayes doe what they would nor against whom they will,
and therefore must not giue way, that men should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into iudgement, that their power cannot reach whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they themselues will haue it, but ought alwayes and
by all meanes they can, to maintaine the credite and estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their power, and greatnesse. The words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
<hi>Christ,</hi>

Tower, sitteth not downe before, and counteth the cost,
whether he haue sufficient to performe it? Lest after hee
hath laid the foundation, and is not able to goe through
with it, all that behold him, begin to mock him, saying; This
man began to builde, and was not able to make an end. Or
what King going to make warre against another King, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
not downe first, and casteth in his minde, whether hee
be able with ten thousand to meete him, that commeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him with twenty thousand, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The like I say of competitions, whether this, or that other
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:2459:153"/>
doth this, or that better? Though it be in matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation.
For all occasions of incounters with Kings are in
any hand to be avoyded. And it likewise seemeth ill
in point of policie, that they in any kinde should haue any
competition with their vassalls.<note place="margin">Pont. 20. 3.</note> And King <hi>Salomon</hi> sets it
downe for a point of policie; for that it is a thing vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
authoritie Royall. It is a mans honour (saith he) to
keepe himselfe from strife. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, being askt
the question, whether he would goe and sport himselfe at
the Olympick games with the rest of the Great ones of his
Court? made answere; yes, if there were other Kings with
whom I might contend.</p>
                  <p>Yet would I not haue Kings so farre to mistake mee, as
to vnderstand that they may not enterprise great things,
and haue competence with others, that are as great, or
greater then themselues, following their stepps and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their heroycall Actions; nay, it is a point rather of
Discretion, and wisedome, in a prudent King, to tread in
the track of their Ancestors, that walked in the right way,
and to set before their eyes the good things that they did,
that according thereunto they may take the like resolution
in the like Cases. The <hi>Romanes</hi> were so religious in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents
and Examples of their Predecessours, that they
made them the line and rule of all their Actions, and made
them as a Law to be kept and obserued, and could not
depart ther-fro without the fowle note of ignominie, gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
new enterprises, by former old Actions. Neither ought
a King likewise to esteeme so meanely and so basely of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
as to thinke, that hee is not able to doe as much as
others haue done in times past. For if they of olde, had
had that minde and conceit of themselues, in calling to minde
the braue and noble deedes, which they haue either heard,
or read in Histories of their Ancestours, they would not
haue imitated them, as many of them haue, in their great
and glorious Acts. And certaine it is, that neuer any man
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:2459:154"/>
did any such illustrious and heroycall Action heeretofore,
which might not be done by another. And therfore, the
Actions of Kings being such, as conduce to the seruice of
God and the well-fare of the Common-wealth, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uene
very well (the said circumstances being duly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
to commence and giue a beginning vnto them, to the
end that fortune, or (to say better) God, putting a helping
hand to our good diligence and industrie, may giue vnto
them a full and perfect end. It was the saying of King
<hi>Agesilaus:</hi> That fortune, in great affayres, and high en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises,
neuer shew'd her selfe liberall and generous, but
when shee met with noble and generous mindes. And it
hath beene often seene, that men loose, at least let slip, many
things, not because they are not able to atcheiue them, but
because they want courage to vndergoe them. And let them
not onely content themselues with the bare reading of them,
but endeuour to be like those famous Captaines, in matter of
warre; those great Common-wealthes, in matter of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and those Christan Politicians, in matter of State. For
examples perswade much. And albeit that <hi>Homer</hi> saith, that
great enterprises are sooner spoken of, then done; easily
vttered, but hardly executed, yet let Princes doe their
best, which will be no small matter. For thereby, their
subiects will receiue benefit, their successors beare them
enuie, and their enemies stand in feare of them.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs draw out of this discourse that discretion,
which is a vertue so necessary, that when it is wanting, good
is conuerted into ill; and vertue, into Vice; and where a
man thought to winne fame, in stead thereof, growes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous,
affronted, and ashamed. For discretion, worketh in
man that effect, as salt doth in flesh, which dryes vp the
moysture, drawes forth the blood, and keepes it from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
As doth salte, so doth discretion, keepe man free
from perturbations, or any vnseemelinesse and discompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
in any Action whatsoeuer he vndergoeth. Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:2459:154"/>
this vertue to his Disciples,<note place="margin">Mark. 9. 49.</note> when hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to haue salte within themselues. This was
in the Gospell.<note place="margin">Leuit. 2. 13.</note> But long before in the Leuiticall Law, it
was commanded; that euery Sacrifice, should be saked with
salte.<note place="margin">Ezech. 43. 24.</note> The wordes, are these; Euery oblation of thy meate
offering, shalt thou season with salt, neither shalt thou suffer
the salte of the Couenant of thy God to be lacking from
thy meat offering: With all thine offring, thou shalt offer
salt. Giuing vs thereby to vnderstand the wisedome and
discretion, wherewith hee would haue vs to serue him,
And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth vs, not to vtter that word which
shall not be seasoned with the salt of wisdome, and discretion.
A qualitie very necessary and requisite in all, but more
particularly, and without comparison with much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
in Kings, as hath wisely beene obserued by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmus,</hi>
and venerable <hi>Bede.</hi> In that safe-conduct, which
<hi>Artaxerxes</hi> gaue vnto <hi>Esdras,</hi> wherein was set downe in
a list,<note place="margin">Esdras 6.</note> all the allowances that they were to make him, and
what prouisions he was to haue along with him, and though
in the rest there was a limitation, <hi>Salverò absque mensura;</hi>
yet was hee to haue salte without measure. Hee was not
stinted in that. For in all things belonging vnto Kings, there
is such a proportion, taxe, or measure set vpon them; but there
are no bounds, no limitts to be set vpon their wisedome and
discretion. Let them (a Gods name) haue that without
measure, without limitation. For, let them haue neuer
so much, it is no more then they haue neede of. God, of
his goodnesse, giue them as much as is needefull for them,
and that shall suffice them. And let vs extract this, out of
all that which hath beene said touching this sence of smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
that there are two sorts, or two kindes of prudence,
(according to S. <hi>Basil.)</hi> The one good, and the other bad;
The one of flesh, and blood; and the other of spirit, and
life. Of the former, doe the wise men of this world boast.
For they denominate that man to be wise, that is crafty and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:2459:155"/>
subtill, a slye, cunning Companion, that by ouer-reaching;
and damnifying his neighbour, procures his owne priuate
profit.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 8.</note> The one (sayth Saint <hi>Paul)</hi> kills, the other quickens;
This brings death, that life. <hi>Nam prudentis carnis, mors
est; prudentia autem spiritus, pax &amp; vita:</hi> For, to be carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
minded, is death; but to be spiritually minded, is life and
peace. Let that then be condemned for ill, and let that suffice,
which hath beene spoken thereof. And let vs set vp our rest
vpon this, which is such and so good, that no vertue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, is pleasing and acceptable vnto God, as no Sacrifice
was without salte. So that chastitie, and cleanesse it selfe, a
vertue so high prized by God, and allianced so neerely with
the Angels, is of no reckoning without prudence. And that
his best beloued,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> beautifullest, and fairest Spouse, should shee
be wanting in this, he would repudiate her, and abhorre
her. Wee read in Saint <hi>Mathewes</hi> Gospell, of ten hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some

were shut out, and not suffred to goe in with him to the
wedding. So that, it is good for all; and without it, all is as
nothing. <hi>Omnia operatur prudentia:</hi> (saith S. <hi>Ambrose)</hi> Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
worketh all things. It doth not onely put mans reason
and will in the right way, direct his forces and faculties, and
order all his actions; but without it, man is no man, but the
Counterfaite, and figure of a man. Fortherein consisteth the
absolutenesse and perfection of man, and that similitude and
likenesse, which he hath with God, in his being capable of
Reason, and prudence. By his Memorie he makes that, which
is past, present; by his wisedome, he foresees that which is to
come; and by his Counsell and aduise, he disposeth and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
the present estate of things, which are those parts of
prudence, which we specified before.</p>

man, euen from the cradle
to his graue, and from his mothers
wombe, to that of the Earth, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of vs all, that hungry appetite and
precise necessitie of eating, and drinking
is not the least. It is (as S. <hi>Isidore</hi> saith)
a rigorous, a cruell and importunat cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditour;<note place="margin">Isidor:</note>
                  <hi>Nullus hominis tam improtunus exactor est, quàm
venter; bodie suscipit, &amp; cras exigit:</hi> There is not any so
earnest and eager an Exactor on man, as is the belly; It
receiues to day, and requires the same againe to morrow. It
is continually demaunding that troublesome tribute of
meate and drinke, of recreation and pleasure, and all other
things necessary for the body; for all these passe, and are
registred, vnder the sense of the Taste. Which albeit it
be lesse noble then the rest, yet is it more necessary then all
of them. For (as S. <hi>Ierom</hi> sayth, and experience teacheth)
without it wee cannot liue long, but without the other we
may. <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayth, that this sence directs it's eye to these
two obiects; to the pleasure it receiueth in eating, and to
the delight it taketh in drinking. Both being very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and walking still hand in hand, the one seconding the
other, taking their seuerall turnes. And their <hi>Signorie</hi> so
farre extends it selfe, that it trenches vpon the rest of the
sences, and all of them are willing to accompaine him. For
Hearing, Seeing, and Smelling, neither like vs, nor last long,
vnlesse they haue the fellowship of the Taste, Yet are they
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:2459:156"/>
differenced in this, that the <hi>Species</hi> of those things, that
are to be seene, heard, and smelt, are to passe by the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
or meanes of another kinde of transparent body, as is
the Ayre. Whereas those that are to be tasted, are to
touch immediatly vpon the tongue, and to haue their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and abiding in the palate, that it may the better relish &amp;
distinguish the seuerall sorts of Tastes. And it is worthy
our obseruation, that in that part of the Head, which is the
mouth, where principally the Taste hath it's seate, though
it's Iurisdiction be so short, and so curtall'd, that it scaree
occupieth the least space of the Tongue, and that it's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
is so short, that it indureth but for a moment, yet it
should come to be of that power and force, that it forced
the wise man to say; That it was insatiable. And though
it alwayes hath, and doth still shew it's rule and Empire
ouer all mortall men, yet does it make it's greatest oftenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Kings, in Princes, and your great and principall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who are most subiect to it's Command. Some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
it to the fire, whereinto the more fuell you fling, the
more infinite is it's power, and rests neuer satisfied. In
like manner, such a Tyrant is the Taste, that be our riches,
rents and patrimonies neuer so great, like fire, it wastes
and consumes them, though it selfe remaine still whole and
intire, without being lessened or diminished. Nor will I
heere cite the Examples of prophane Kings and Emperours
giuen ouer to the pleasure of their palate and sensuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
to the losse of great Estates and Kingdomes, and
the scandall of their suiects; because my purpose is to quote
some places of the sacred Scripture, dictated by the Holy
Ghost, the Author of Truth. It is reported of King <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
that being so wise, so rich, and so powerfull a Prince,
that hee did in such sort let loose the reines to his vnbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
appetite, as if there were not the least footing of
wisedome, or reason to be found in him. Hee himselfe says
as much in <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 2. 8.</note> where (as one that saw at last his
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:2459:156"/>
owne errour) hee expresseth his minde in this manner;
<hi>Dixiin corde meo: Vadam &amp; affluam delicijs, &amp; sruar bonis:</hi>
I sayd in mine heart, Goe to now, (for so the vulgar
renders it) I will proue thee with mirth, therefore inioy
pleasure. I sayd so, and as I sayd, so I did. <hi>Vadam;</hi> I will
goe; That is to say, after my appetite, I will abound in
wealth, I will inioy the good things of this world, by
which are vnderstood all sortes of delights, and pleasures,
as eating, drinking, intertainments, recreations, sportes, and
pastimes, and whatsoeuer in that kinde may be conceiued
or imagined.<note place="margin">Eccl. 2. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Omnia quae desiderauerunt oculi mei non ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaui

them; I with-held not my heart from any ioy. For my
heart reioyced in all; &amp;c. And at last, hee conclndeth
with this saying;<note place="margin">lbi 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Quis it à deuorauit, &amp; delicijs affluit,
vt ego:</hi> Who, of all the Kings that euer were in the
world, could eate more then I? Or who could hasten more
thereunto then I, hauing the world so much at will, and
more then all they had? Was it not a thousand pities
(thinke you) to see so wise a King to become Tributary
and subiect to so vile a slaue as is the belly? I haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
times mused and wondred with my selfe at the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of our noble men of these times, who making it such
a point of honour, and standing so strictly vpon it, not to
pay any taxe, or tribute, though it amount not to aboue
a blanke, and that they will sooner loose their liues, then
acknowledge themselues Tributaries, and yet that these
the more noble and greater Lords they are, should the
more glory to be Tributaries, and render and submit
themselues most, to this infamous tribute, and tyrannicall
taxe, which is payd to the palate? What sumptuous tables?
What costly diet? What dainty dishes? What exquisite
curiosities? What rich and precious wines? What <hi>Regalos?</hi>
And what recreations, more befitting Heathens, then
Christians? And all, for to pay the Taste this vnlawfull
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:2459:157"/>
custome? Which in plaine language, is a greater taske,
and a greater Tribute, then the poorest labourer, or the
meanest hedger and ditcher is seassed at. For, when he pays
this Tribute, it is onely with a peece of houshold bread,
and a dish of small drinke, and other the like poore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments,
denying to his Taste those excessiue Tributes,
which your Kings and greater persons pay, being in this
particular better gentlemen then they. O the blindnesse
of our Christian Nobilitie! Let me put this question vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you; when the Collector of Subsedyes comes to a poore
husbandmans house, to demand so much of him as he is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eassed at, if hee should pay him more then is due vnto
him by the Law, or any Act ordained in that kinde, or
should be earnest with him to take more then hee is set at,
would not all men thinke him to be a foole, and a very sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
fellow? The like errour doe they commit, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
their goods, their lands, and their whole Estates in
seruing the belly, and satisfying the Taste with such diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
of delicate Viands, and choyse wines, when as they
may well pay this Tribute with that little, or small modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,
mentioned by the Apostle; <hi>Habentes alimenta, &amp;
quibus tegamur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>his contenti simus:</hi> Hauing foode, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
let vs be therewith contented. And with this, let
vs goe dayly redeeming those seassements and Tributes,
which were imposed vpon vs by sinne, and in particular
this sinne of eating and drinking, wherewith so often euery
day we make such large payments. And if wee cannot quit
the whole score, let vs doe herein, like your bad payma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
who doe huck and pinch, and pay as little as they
can. But this (the more is the pitie) is not in vse amongst
them. For men, when they are call'd vpon to pay either
priuate debts, or publick seassements, they driue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
off with delayes, and when they should make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
fall a caffling, and refuse to lay downe what is due.
But in eating, and drinking, they will pay much more then
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:2459:157"/>
is due, and presse the belly to take more, then either it is
willing, or able to receiue. When <hi>Caesars</hi> Collectors came
to demand Tribute of our Sauiour <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> hee put
this question to Saint <hi>Peter; Reges terrae, à quibus accipiunt
Tributum, velcensum? A filijs, an ab Altenis?</hi> The kings
of the earth, of whom doe they receiue Tribute? Of the
Children, or of strangers? To whom <hi>Peter</hi> answered; of
strangers. Thereupon our Sauiour persently replyes, <hi>Ergo
liberi sunt filij:</hi> Therefore the children are free. And if
Kings and their children are, and ought to be free from this
royall Tribute; it standeth with much more reason, that
they should be freed (as much as is possible) from the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
of their proper gusts and pleasures, which is much
more preiudiciall vnto them, then that can be, should they
pay it. For that payment is made but once yeare at most,
or from halfe yeare to halfe yeare, and it is payd in money;
But this is daily and howerly, and must be payd with a
mans wealth, with his Health, with his life, and with his
honour. A man cannot lap vp in a little peece of paper the
misbehauiours and misdemeanors which Princes haue fallen
into, by giuing themselues to riotous banqueting, nor the
excesses, which they haue beene forced to commit, when
they haue broke the bounds of Temperance.<note place="margin">Prou. 30. 22.</note> There are
two things (sayth the Wise man) which disquieteth the
world,<note place="margin">Prou. 31. 4.</note> and turneth it topsie-turuy; To see a slaue when he
reigneth; And a foole, when hee is filled with meate. And
therefore the sayd Wiseman forbiddeth wine vnto Kings.
And <hi>Seneca</hi> doth much reproue <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great,<note place="margin">Senec. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> for their distemper in their diet; A thing
so vnworthy the royall dignitie,<note place="margin">Cicero. Philip. 2. Orat. 4.</note> that <hi>Cicero</hi> did affirme, that
cruditie of the stomack in Princes, was a great indignitie,
and altogether vnbeseeming them. For, by delighting in
drinking, they dull their spirits, enfeeble their strength, and
discouer a thousand weakness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whereof did import them very much, and neerely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne

them. King <hi>Salomon</hi> sayth in his <hi>Prouerbs,</hi> Much more
strong is that man, which ouercomes himselfe, and subdues
his owne affections, then hee that getteth great victories
ouer his enemies: Suting with that vulgar saying; <hi>Fortior
est quise, quàm qui fortissima vincit moe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a.</hi> And therefore,
it not so much importeth Kings, to conquer others, and to
make themselues Lords of new Prouinces and Kingdomes,
as not to become perpetuall slaues to their proper gustes &amp;
appetites. For this doth not fit and sute so well with the
greatnesse of their Office, nor is eating in it selfe so generous
an Act, that they ought so much to prize and esteeme it. In
the booke of the <hi>Iudges,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iudg. 9. 8.</note> we finde a Parable of the trees, who
hauing resolued with themselues to choose a King, to whom
all the rest should owe homage, they came first to the Oliue,
afterwards to the Fig-tree, and lastly to the Vine, intreating
them that they would be pleased to take the Crowne vpon
them, and to raigne ouer them. The first answered; That he
could not leaue his fatnesse, to goe to be promoted ouer the
Trees; The Fig-tree, hee excused himselfe in the like manner,
saying; Hee could not forsake his sweetnesse, and his good
fruite, for the inioying of a Crowne; And the Vine, he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told them, that he would not leaue his wine, which chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
God, and Man, to become a King. The purpose and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of Parables, (according to the doctrine of glorious S.
<hi>Austin,</hi> and other holy Doctors) is, to infold in them the
truth. And in this is it giuen Kings to vnderstand, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
in their Tastes and delicious meates, is not compatible
with their Estate, nor doth it become a Crowne Royall, (that
wee may say all we can, though we somewhat exceede from
the obiect of the Tast) to loose it's time in pleasures, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
but that in that very instant, wherin Kings take them,
they should as sodainly leaue them; in regard, that they haue
so many and so great businesses committed to their charge,
wherein if they should bestow all their time, they haue scarce
time enough. Which requiring (so much as it doth) the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:2459:158"/>
assistance, and obseruation of kings, if they should mis-spend
this time in sports and intertainements, they must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
want time for that which is more necessary; &amp; be driuen
(considering that there is not any thing, that doth cause a
greater relaxation, and distraction in the vnderstanding, and
that more abateth the edge and vigor of graue and weighty
consideration, then sports, pastimes, and pleasing of their
owne gustes and palates) to neglect State-businesses, vnlesse
they will be pleased to vse them seldome, and with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Insomuch, that they being to repart and diuide the time
betweene themselues and the Common-wealth, they should
so employ it, that it might not be wanting vnto them for
their businesses, nor super-abound vnto them for their
Vices.</p>
               <p>Yet for all this doe not I pretend (it being the least part of
my meaning) to take from Kings their intertainments, but
rather much desire that they would take them with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and without neglecting businesses of State, and after
that they shall haue fully cumply'de with the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
affayres. To the end, that all the world may see, that
these their pleasures, are not as principall, but accessary, and
as an <hi>ayuda de costa,</hi> an ayde and helpe, the better to beare
their trouble, &amp; to wade through that wearisomenesse, which
the continuall assist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 1.</note> inspired by the Holy Ghost, did prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
&amp; foretell vnto vs; That in the last dayes, perillous times
shall come (which are now wholly and truly ours) wherein
men shall be louers of their owne selues, and their pleasures,
more then louers of God; and shall regard more their owne
particular then either their neighbour, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and their delights, then to please God, and therefore shall fall
into innumerable sinnes. The Apostle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint
<hi>Iude,</hi> doe much indeare the great euills which vsually arise
from corporall pleasures, &amp; the terrible chasticements which
are reserued for those, that giue themselues over vnto them.

play away so many thousand Ducatts, and to spend, I
know not what, meerely for their owne pleasure, whilest
their souldiers are ready to perish through hunger for
want of pay, and their house-hold Seruants runne in debt,
because they cannot receiue, their wages in due time, this
sorteth not with that rule, which the wise man would
haue vs to obserue. And is it not I pray you a dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
and vnseasonable thing, to spend the time in
intertainments, and sports, which is due vnto publicke
causes, and businesses of State? In the second booke of
the <hi>Kings</hi> is set downe a notable case, wherewith God
was highly offended. And the case was this; <hi>Factum est

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:2459:161"/>
procedere,<note place="margin">2 King. 11, 1.</note> misit Dauid Ioab, &amp; seruos suos cum eo, et vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersum

                     </gap>a. Dauid autem remansit in Hierusalem. Dum haec
agerentur, accidit, vt surgeret Dauid de strato suo post
meridiem, et deambularet in solario domus regiae, viditque
mulieremse lauantem ex aduerso super solarium suum &amp;c.</hi>
And it came to passe, that after the yeare was expired, at
the time, when Kings goe forth to battel, that <hi>Dauid</hi> sent
<hi>Ioab,</hi> and his seruants with him, and all <hi>Israel,</hi> and they
destroyed the children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> and besieged <hi>Rabbah.</hi>
But <hi>Dauid</hi> tarryed still at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> And it came to passe
in an Euening tyde, that <hi>Dauid</hi> arose from his bed, and
walked vpon the roofe of the Kings house, and from the
roofe hee saw a woman washing her selfe, and the woman
was very beautifull to looke vpon &amp;c. What a companie
of aggrauating circumstances did heere precede the sinne
of <hi>Dauid?</hi> It fell out about that time of the yeare when
Kings vsed to goe into the field against their enemies, and
to muster vp their souldiars. But instead of going himselfe
in person, hee sent forth his Captaine <hi>Ioab,</hi> with all the
choyse men of <hi>Israel,</hi> himselfe remaining in the meane
while sporting and recreating himselfe in his princely Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.
And not thinking on those cares, which so dangerous
a warre did at that time require, hee rose one day after
dinner from his Table, and went to walke in a gallerie or
Tarras, that lay open to the Sunne, and from thence it
was his chance to espie <hi>Vriahs</hi> wife washing and bathing
of her selfe in a place of the like nature, right ouer against
him, who likewise on her part gaue occasion to this sinne,
for that her husband being abroad in the warres, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
himselfe to so many troubles and perills, she should
take pleasure in washing her hayre, and in the curious
decking and dressing her person in a place, from whence
shee might be so easily seene. Whom he no sooner saw
but coueted, and no soner made loue vnto, but he inioyed
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:2459:162"/>
her. And that he might possesse her with the more safety, and
cloake the adulterie the better, and the childe wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
shee went, hee gaue order for the making away of her
husband, vpon the neck whereof an infinite number of
other euills did insue. When Kings wage warre, and their
subiects fight their battailes, hazarding therein their liues,
or when any other common calamities happen, as of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
or Pestilence, in their Kingdomes, they are not then
to follow their pleasures and intertainments, but to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine
from them, and to shew and make knowen to the
world, that they haue a fellow-feeling of these common
euills, and generall afflictions; For so did the King of
<hi>Niniue,</hi> as soone as hee was informed what the Prophet
<hi>Ionas</hi> had preached in his Court, threatning them with the
punishment which God would send vpon that Citie. And
the holy Scripture saith; That the King himselfe was the
first man that forsooke his pleasures, layd his roabe from
him, and couered him with sack-cloath, and sate in ashes,
and caused it to be proclaimed through <hi>Nineue,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ionah. 3. 6.</note> saying,
Let neither man, nor beast, heard nor flocke tast any thing;
let them not feede, nor drinke water. But let man and
beast be couered with sack-cloath, and cry mightily vnto
God; yea let them turne euery one from his euill way,
and from the violence that is in their hands, &amp;c. And this
was the Course, that hee tooke for to appease Gods anger.
When King <hi>Dauid</hi> heard of the great slaughter which
the Pestilence had wrought in his Kingdome, sorrowing
exceedingly, that the Plague was so hot amongst his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and shewing, that it grieued his very heart and soule,
hee cryed out vnto the Lord,<note place="margin">

there was so great a Famine, and so fore a Death in that
Kingdome, that two women by consent did agree to kill
their children, and to eate them by turnes. Which the
King had no sooner heard of, but that he was so inwardly
grieued therewith, that in expression of his sorrow he rent
his garments, (according to the custome of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi>
on such like sad occasions) and put on sack-cloath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

who being returned from the Armie to the Court, called
thither by the King, would by no meanes be perswaded to
goe home to his owne house, to refresh himselfe, and make
merry with his wife, though his Maiestie willed him so
to doe; And the reason which he rendred, why he would

               </p>
               <p>But some will say, that we do not well in aduising Kings
or the Common people, on sad occasions, to forbeare
their sports and pastimes, it seeming vnto them, that they
ought rather then to seeke after them for the diuerting of
melancholy, and banishing of sorrow; Vrging <hi>Plutarkes</hi>
authoritie, who reprehendeth those men, who when they
are already merrily disposed, hunt after intertainments and
pastimes, wishing them to doe that, when they finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
sad and heauie, for then they haue most neede of it.
Here vnto, I first of all answer, that the reason is not alike
in a particular person, as in a King, and a Common-wealth,
which (as wee sayd before) are to be considered and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
as a body, with it's Head. And as in a mans
body, the head doth naturally feele the paine of the arme,
the foote, or any other member; So Kings, which are the
Heads of the people, are to haue a feeling of their subiects
miseries, &amp; to pittie the ill case, wherein they at any time are,
as if it were their owne. And this was that, which moued the
Apostle S <hi>Paul</hi> to say; <hi>Quando patitur vnum membrum,
compatiuntur omnia membra.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 26.</note> When one member suffreth,
all the members suffer with it. This is that <hi>Trauazon,</hi> or
coupling peece of timber in a Common-wealth, and this,
both humane policie, and mans naturall disposition, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
that when we see others suffer we should suffer with
them in our common co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passion towards them. And the Law
of charitie, goes some what farther and would stretch this
obligation to a greater and higher perfection, as was to be
seene in the sayd Apostle. <hi>Quis infirmatur, et ego non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmor?
Quis scandalizatur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and I am not weake? Who is offended,<note place="margin">Cor. 11. 2. 29.</note> and I burne

crossing the Kings humour, and opposing his vaine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and delights, and representing the truth of things
vnto him, and what was fitting for him to doe, his heart
was all on a flame, a burning fire was shut vp in his bones,
and hee was weary with bearing, and could not holde, so
farre was he transported, and so mightily inflamed with the
zeale of the Kings, and the Common-wealthes good.</p>
               <p>Secondly I say; That (as before hath beene deliuered
by mee) I do not pretend, to debarre Kings and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths
of their pleasures and recreations; But my
desire is (which I wish with all my heart) that they may
be such as may be harmelesse and vn-offensiue, with out
remordment and sting of Conscience, and without the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muration
and notice of the people. And this may easily
be done, by doing of that which the glorious S. <hi>Ierome</hi>
aduiseth vs to doe, <hi>ex necessitate virtutem:</hi> making a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of necessitie; but I doe not say <hi>ex necessitate,</hi> but <hi>ex vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptate,
virtutem:</hi> That is to say; I would haue them to
place their delight and content in that, which is true vertue
and godlinesse, in cumplying with the obligations of their
Office and Calling, in giuing free and frequent Audience,
in hearing those that are wronged and oppressed, in dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Offices, in Dispatching of businesses, or in causing
them to be dispatcht, and to spend their time, or the most
part thereof in these, and the like, cumplying with that
of that Royall Prophet:<note place="margin">Psal. 21. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>In virtute tua Laetabitur Rex, &amp;
super salutare tuum exultabit vehementer:</hi> The King shall
ioy in thy strength, O Lord; And in thy Saluation, how
greatly shall hee reioyce? And from thence will follow
that, which presently followeth in the next Verse; <hi>Desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derium

and hast not with-holden the request of his lips. King
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:2459:165"/>
                  <hi>Salomon</hi> sayes of himselfe, that he gaue his desires as much as
they could desire, &amp; that he gaue himself ouer to his delights
&amp; contents with that freedome and libertie, as suted with the
greatnes of so powerful a king. But that which he got therby,
was not the content which he sought after, but distaste, irke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnes,
wearines, griefe, &amp; vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of spirit; which he himself
hath left firmed &amp; signed with his own name, for an example
not only to all kings, but to all the whole world. <hi>Vidi inomni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
vanitatem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 2. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>et afflictionem animi, et nihil permanere sib
sole:</hi> Behold, all was vanitie, &amp; vexation of spirit, and there was
no profit vnder the sunne. Who could more giue themselues
to their delightes, and pleasures, then those, whom the booke
of <hi>Wisedome</hi> speaketh of, who with such a deale of care and
greedinesse did runne after all the content, that the world
could afford? Yet they say and confesse, that they were so
vaine and so false, and such a wearisomnesse vnto them, that
they were quite tyred out with them, and are now in hell
for their labour, and shall continue there for euer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I say; That to the end our sports and intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
may be the more pleasing vnto vs, it is fit that they
should be vsed with much moderation, and very seldome.
Feastings and banquetings, when they are too frequent and
too ordinary, they cause a wearinesse, and loathing; And as
the glorious S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> wisely saith, <hi>Gratiores post famem
epule fiunt, quae assiduitate viluerant:</hi> Feastings please most
after fasting, which by affiduitie and continuance grow into
contempt. And here by the way occasion may be taken, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
kings of the remedy which they ought to apply in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Playes &amp; Interludes, as wel in the quality of that which
is represented, as in the requency wherewith they are vsed;
Comedies being now as common as our meate &amp; drinke.
But I see, that that succeedeth now, which did in those
more ancient times; Which though they were often ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
out of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet the times altering, they came to be
introduced and brought in again. And King <hi>Philip</hi> the second
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:2459:165"/>
who is now in glory, in the latter yeares of his raigne did
wholy prohibite them, and for the better furthering of this
his determination, he had many, and those very effectuall
reasons for it. And that which of late hath beene obserued,
is, That neuer in any time, hath there beene seene so much
loosenesse and shamelesnesse in youth, as since the time,
they haue beene dayly permitted to be playd and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
on the stage, and in those places, where is the greatest
Audience, there is the greatest dissolutenesse of manners,
especially among your younger sort of people; For those
their words, Accents, Tunes, Songs, wanton carriage of the
body, idle gestures, and actions, performed with so much
artifice and cunning, is no other thing (as the Prophet
sayd) but to sow tares, and vicious weedes in good ground,
whence they ought with much care to be rooted out. And
very blinde is that man, which doth not see the danger that
there is, in prouoking and stirting vp wanton blood, with
such lasciuious behauiour, being able enough of it selfe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
the appetite of sensualitie. Euen those dishonest
pictures, which neither speake, nor moue, doe catch and lay
hold on our eyes, and dragge the Soule after them, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if they be drawen to the life, and haue the true postures
and expressions of a wanton woman. Questionlesse, they
cannot choose but leaue a liuely impression in the Soule.
And I know not (I confesse) what worke of pietie, or
of charitable Almes for Hospitalls, (to which vse a great
part of the Stage-Players gaynes goe) can recompence this
harme. For of more weight and moment, is one sinne of
theirs, which is there committed; then all the Almes that
are giuen throughout the whole world. And we know, it is
the Apostles rule, That we are not either to doe, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
an euill, that good may come thereof. And that which
I know is; That they which enter in there, doe not come
thither to giue an Almes, but for those ends and purposes,
which haue beene sufficiently deliuered and reprehended,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:2459:166"/>
by many holy Doctours, and famous Preachers. Nor doth
it boote them to say; That the people, that spend their time
in seing of Comedies, are there met together to see a harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Interlude. Which were they not shut vp in that open
Assembly, would perhaps be wandring abroad, committing
worse sinnes, which by this Intercourse are excused; for in
this one particular, in this very thing, is it plainely to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
how bad Playes be, since for their defence, they
haue neede of the fauour of avoyding a greater euill. And
in realitie of truth, they doe not excuse, or diuert sinnes, but
sinnes are there rather learned, the spectators carrying them
away with them conceiued in their minds, by the ones vaine
apprehension, and the others fowle and wanton representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and anon after, bring forth monstrous birthes. And
in very truth, the troubles, and temporall scourges, of warre,
famine, and pestilence; the many Cities that are battred and
beaten downe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Besides, we are to vnderstand, that God sendeth these his
scourges, that wee may feele his stripes, and repent, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
our sinfull liues. And therefore the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenteth

would not correspond with his gentle admonitions, nor be
reclaymed by those his fatherly chasticements, which were
for the calling of them home, and to make them to returne
from their euill waies. And if (besides all that hitherto hath
been sayd) wee shall but consider how deceitfull and vaine
are these pastimes and delights, we shall therewith likewise
see, what little reason Kings and men that are, (or at least
ought to be in regard of the grauitie and greatnesse of their
places) of a constant and settled disposition, to be carryed
away with such idle toyes which presently dis-appeare, and
do not only not giue that fullnesse &amp; satisfaction, which they
promise; but rather, as vicious thirst &amp; hunger, which ariseth
from a corrupt and euil humour, increaseth the more, the

the more we vse them, the more in seeking after them doe we
finde our selues mocked and deluded, and the lesse satisfied.</p>

rigorous is that qualification, which the greatest, and most

wherwith we pronounce our words, which are the thoughts
Interpreters. I omit here to treate, of good, or better language,
or whether this, or that, ought to be in greatest request,
since the Master himselfe of Eloquence saith;<note place="margin">Cicero Tuse. lib. 2.</note> That in euery
part, and place, wee are to speake with those words, which
are there vnderstood; And that such a people, or such a
Nation, is Lord of a Language, and may by a kinde of
prerogatiue power, either coyne new, or call in old words.
It being like vnto money of seuerall Kingdomes, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces,
that being currant in one Countrie, which will not
passe in another. And therefore that language, ought to be
spoken by vs, which is generally approued, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vsed and receiued. And therefore many times men alter
the fashion of their Language, as they do of their cloathes.
And wee our selues finde, that in this our <hi>Spanish</hi> tongue,
wee haue made almost as many changes and alterations, as
we haue of our garments, and are able to make two such
different languages, that the one should not vnderstand the
other. For, wee make such hast to inuent new words, and to
take them vpon loane from other Languages, that thinking
thereby to inrich it, we come to loose and forget our own
naturall Language. So different is it (to some mens seeming)
in these, from what it was informer times. For the <hi>Spanish</hi>
tongue in it selfe, is an humble and lowly language, if they
had not painted it ouer and adulterated it with new words;
Not considering in the meane while with themselues, that
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:2459:170"/>
the best Language (according vnto <hi>Tully)</hi> is that, which
wee haue beene taught by our Mothers, and which chaste
Matrones, and those that haue beene well bred, speake fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly
at home in their owne houses. And the reason
of it, is, for that they hauing not gone abroad out of their
owne Countrie, to forraine nations, nor treated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersed
with strangers, they conserue the naturall phrase
and speech of their own Towne, or Country, without so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisticating
their Language with new words, or those that
are not of ordinary vse. And therefore it is fitting, that
wee should speake in that, which is most passable, and which
is best vnderstood, vsing sober, proper, and plaine words;
for words were ordayned to that end, that they might be
well vnderstood. He speakes best, and in the best Language,
that is best vnderstood; not hee, that shall speake in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the Moderne, in their Language. And <hi>Quintilian</hi>
tells vs, <hi>Loquendum, vt vulgus; sentiendum, vt pauci.</hi> We
must speake, with the many; but thinke, with the fewest.
Many moe therebe, which speak much in matter of tongues,

treate of those, which imports Kings, and Kingdomes. Such
as is that truth and sinceritie, wherewith they are to treate,
that faith and word, which they are to cumply with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and that secret, which they are to keepe. Two things

by Kings speaking Truth, and by suffring others to

shall scarce meete with one in an Age, that dare tell Kings
the Truth, there being so many about them, that sooth them
vp with lyes and flatteries. <hi>Seneca</hi> saith; That of ten hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand souldiers, which <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had in his
Army, there was but one onely that told him the truth
in a case wherein all the rest did lye. And amongst innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:2459:172"/>
Prophets, which concealed the truth from the king,
only <hi>Michah</hi> made bold to tell it him. And only <hi>Solon</hi> did
the like with king <hi>Croesus.</hi> Seldom times doth the truth enter
into the Kings priuy-chamber, and when it enters, they scare
expresse it in that bare and naked maner as did <hi>Iohn Baptist.</hi>
And for this cause, did <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Philosopher</hi> wish king
<hi>Ptolomie,</hi> to reade bookes &amp; Histories, which treated of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
for Kings, and Captaines, for they would tell him that
which none durst deliuer vnto him. <hi>Socrates</hi> sayd; That
there was not any one, that made open protestation to speake
the truth, that attained (as he did) to the age of 70. yeares.
And certaine it is, that Kings cannot indure to heare those
plaine and naked truths, which the common people, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their subiects are able to tel them, and proue vnto them;
nor must they that are in place presume to vtter them, for
feare of indangering their authoritie, and reputation; And
therefore it is fit, that they should haue some such persons
about them, which should both heare, and vnderstand them,
and take their time to informe them of them. And this is a
rul'd, Case, taken out of those great Instructions, and wise <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorismes,</hi>
which <hi>Mecaenas</hi> gaue to <hi>Augustus,</hi> worthy to
be taken notice of, and to be kept and obserued, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from so great a Counsailour, and proposed to a Prince,
who was so wise in this kinde. To wit; That Kings,
ought to giue libertie and way, that their subiects vpon
occasion might be admitted to tell them the Truth, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them on their part, that they will not bee offended
with that which they shall say vnto them. For, it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
vnto a Physician to prescribe corrasiues, and to cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the dead flesh till it come to the quicke; And it may
as well be lawfull for a good subiect, a faithfull Minister and
Counseller of state, to speake freely vnto his King with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and reuerence to their royall dignitie) the truth of
that they thinke, and to condemne him in his iudgement, or
otherwise, when he shall goe about to doe any thing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:2459:172"/>
to Iustice, and reason. Nor ought this to seeme oftensiue to
any man, nor to the King himselfe, who (if he haue a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
feeling) will approue in his minde &amp; vnderstanding the
reasons that they shall represent vnto him; so that if he be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to heare the truths they shall tel him, it may turne much
to his profit. And if he like not well of it there is no harme
done, neither doth he receiue any preiudice by it. And if he
shall thinke it fit for the furthering of his ends to follow the
Counsaile of any, let him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend, &amp; honour that person: For
by that plot, which he shall haue deuised, &amp; inuented, he shall
gaine honour and greatnesse by it. And it is meete &amp; conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
that he should incourage both him, and others with
thankes, and rewards. Because this is the sunne, which giues
life, and the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

actiue, &amp; nimble. And in case he shall not admit of his aduise,
let him not disgrace him, nor finde fault with him for his
good will, and the desire that he hath to do him seruice. But
like a great Prince (wherein he shall shew his goodnesse) let
his eye rather looke on the good desire and affection where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he doth it, then on the effect thereof; As likewise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
others may not be disheartned, for there is not any
the poorest plante, that hath not some vertue in it; nor any
brayne so barrene, whence at one time or other some
fruite may not be gathered for the publickegood.</p>
                  <p>I conclude then this first point of that plaine and sincere
truth, which Kings are to treate, and wherewith they are
to be treated, in signifying vnto them, that their own
and the Kingdomes safety relyes on searching out the truth,
and in hauing those about them which will freely speake
it (a thing so necessarie for to gouerne vprightly) and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
him (though it cost him well) that shall tell him.
For Kings shall meete with few, that will tell it them (as
they say) for a song. For, considering the danger where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
they put themselues by speaking the truth, it costes
them much. And it is an old and ancient kinde of cosenage
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:2459:173"/>
and deceit, which Kings and Princes suffer in not hearing

it, for it is a very painefull and troublesome thing to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
our necke to the yoake of the Gospell and to submit

we will doe. When the Emperour had thus exprest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
those that were flatterers &amp; Sycophants, and time plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,
sayd vnto him; Wee thinke your Maiestie shall doe
well in so doing, and wee shall be obedient to what you
shall ordaine therein. But those good and faithfull seruants,
which desired the good and prosperous estate of their
Prince both in soule and body, humbly besought him on
their knees, saying; Sir For Gods honour, and your own,
doe not doe so vile a thing, for it is neither fitting nor law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
nor shall wee follow you therein, or serue you one day
longer. Then did the Emperour know by this, which were
good seruants, and of greatest trust, and presently dismi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Perswading himselfe, that they would neuer be faithfull to
their Prince, that would so soone turne traytours vnto God.
And if Kings would know how true this is, and the errour
wherein they liue, by hauing the truth kept from them, let
them at some one time or other (when they see fit) make
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:2459:173"/>
shew to affect the contrary to that, which before they were
hot vpon, and did earnestly desire; and then shall they see,
that those very men, which approued the one, will likewise
make good the other, and then will they know how in the
one, or in the other, nay in all, they are deceiued by them;
or at least, that they dare not plainely and simply tell him
that truth, which their hearts thinke. If they be Ministers
and Counsellours of State, if they once finde out their
Kings homour, and the ayre that most delightes his eare,
they play vpon that string: If they be bed-chamber men,
or the like familiar Attendants about his person, they haue
naturally a seruile inclination, and make it their common
custome to intertaine him with matters of mirth, or iolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and intertaynment: if they be his freinds, or his
fauourites, they also are not without their applauding and
adulation, and by so much the more to be suspected, by
how much the greter it is. But what if all these shall ioyne
to abuse a good King? Then this miserie likewise comes of
it. That what a few of them shall begin to say, all the rest
will approue it. And if Kings (as they cannot without
being knowen) could but heare their talke and conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they might heare and know many truths, they should
know the mindes of many, and the desires of all, and they
would reioyce in knowing the truth of that, which none
durst tell them. For some, nay many of them, will report
what they heare, and amongst themselues speake plainely
the truth one to another, so as they be sure that the King
cannot heare them. This would be somewhat, if not much
remedyed, if Kings would but doe that, which we but euen
now deliuered of the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, who
would not suffer that Minister or Fauourit that hee had
once caught in a Lye euer to see his face any more, but
wholly dismist him from his seruices: For both in
wisedome and Christianitie, it is to be presumed, that in
all or alwayes that hee can, at least as oft as it toucheth
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:2459:174"/>
his owne particular, hee will not make him a faithfull rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and liuing in this iust iealousie and suspicion of his
truth, and plaine dealing, with much scruple of conscience,
and in great danger, doth that King liue which giues him
his eare, or vpholds him in his office. But let vs pause heere,
and passe to that second point, which is the faith and word,
which Kings ought to keepe.</p>

one, is <hi>Hombre de fee,</hi> a man of faith, is
all one, as if we should say, that he is a man of Credit,
and that wee giue saith and credit to that he saith. <hi>Marcus

proper signification and elegancie of the Latin words,
saith: That <hi>fides,</hi> is so called, <hi>quasi fiat, quod dictum est,</hi> That

And hence it is, that men hauing shewen themselues honest
in doing that which they had past their word they would

And this humane faith, being taken in this sence, is so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,

and indeede, for which hee hath past his honest word
and promise. And by how much the more noble a man
is, so much the more obligation hee hath, to keepe this his
faith and word. And if not, see the offence which is taken
at it, when men are taxed with this faulte, who are satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with no lesse, then with taking away that mans life, that

at, (or to say better much to be lamented) to see the great
folly and rash proceeding which passeth in this kinde, and
concerning this matter for they acknowledging in these

much, that they sticke not to fall into a worse sinne
such as is a very Lye it selfe, a loude lye, by lying so easily,
and ordinarily, as some doe. I aske the question; which is
worse, to bee lame, or crooked, or to say such a one is so,
when as there is no such thing? Certainly, it is much worse
to be so, then to be sayd, to be so. And to him, that is not
so, me thinkes he should make but little reckoning of what
they say in that kinde; and should rather indeauour to

thereinto, and make so little scruple of Lying, and more
Lying, vying Lye vpon lye; yea euen those, that will lay
downe their life, rather then indure that men should tell
them they Lye, though themselues know they lye, and
that they lye not, who tell them they lye, being onely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with them, that they will not take a Lye, for a truth;
or at least let them goe away with it, without the lest
reproofe or contradiction, which ingenious natures can
hardly indure, especially when they know that they are in
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:2459:175"/>
the right, and the other in the wrong. Certainely, of all
other Vices, Lying, is the most vnworthy noble and gentle
blood. And it is such a Labrinth, that the more a man
seekes to get out of it, the more he findes himselfe out of
the way. So that a man striuing to get out of one lye, falls
into another, and from that to a third, and all of them worse
then the former. Heere I will aduertise by the way, that
it is a common and vsuall Language with your Courtiers,
which may seeme to carrye a shew of truth, but indeede is
full of lyes and falsehood. And this it is: When they will
cumply in words, with them who recommend themselues
or their suites vnto them, they say; Sir vse you your best
diligences, for I will doe my part, and God knowes, that
I haue, and doe that, which belongs to mee; And true
it is; for God knowes, that his part, is to lye, and onely to
compliment with this poore pretender, and to doe nothing
at all in that, which he pretendeth. I apply my selfe, to that
olde and ancient language of the Noblemen of <hi>Castile,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen
on the sword, of <hi>Cid Rui Diaz. Si, si,</hi> no, no, yea yea
nay, nay, which is a Lesson, that is taught vs by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
<hi>Christ</hi> in his holy Gospell. This is that, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitteth
all men, but more especially Kings; for, to indeare
this or that mans truth, we vsually say, <hi>Que tiene palabra
de Rey:</hi> That a King cannot keepe his word, better then
hee doth, or is more precise of his promise, And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I hold for certaine, that that which <hi>Plato</hi> yeelds vnto
Kings and Magistrates concerning this point, if it bee well
vnderstood, is not to lye, but to vse stratagemes and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
deuises, for to defeate and deceiue the enemies spyes,
and Intelligencers. And I very well remember that my selfe
communicating this conceit, vpon occasion, with one of the
learnedst men, and greatest <hi>Platonists,</hi> that this Age affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
he approued of it, and did much commend it; for, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that truth, and faith, whereof we now treate, <hi>Plato</hi>
himselfe, and all other the good Philosophers, teach the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:2459:175"/>
rigour and strictnesse, wherewith men ought to keepe their
word. In the booke of <hi>Iosua,</hi> is recounted the craft, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the <hi>Ghibeonites,</hi> mooued the Princes of <hi>Israel</hi> to plight
them their faith, that they would doe them no harme. And
though afterwards this their cunning dealing was discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and brought to light, and that all the people were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
that this promise should not be kept; yet the Princes of
the people made answer thereunto, that they could not but
cumply with their word, especially hauing confirmed it
with an oath.<note place="margin">Iosh. 9. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Iurauimus eis in nomine Domini Dei Israel,
&amp; idcircò non possumus eos contingere.</hi> We haue sworne
vnto them by the Lord God of <hi>Israel,</hi> and therefore wee
may not hurt them. And because many yeares after, King
<hi>Saul</hi> (out of a zeale to the good of his people) broake
that their word and promise, there fell vpon him and his
people a great famine, which continued for the space of
three yeares. King <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> whom they slew by treason,
confessed; that that death, lighted worthily vpon him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee had broaken his word, giuen to his father King
<hi>Don Fernando,</hi> to passe the partition made with his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
And the constancie of <hi>Dauid</hi> is knowen to all, in
keeping that his word, which all the while he liued hee
gaue to <hi>Shimei,</hi> that hee would not put him to death, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the desert of his irreuerent language, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respect
to his person. And both diuine, and humane
Letters are full of the seuere chasticements, which God hath
inflicted vpon those, who haue not beene faithfull in the
keeping of their faith and word. For, being that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
is most faithfull, and doth boast himselfe to bee so, he
will likewise that men should be so one towards another.

we ought not to deceiue any man: and that all infidelitie,
is sinne; That no man ought to faile in that which he hath
promised; That it is requisite in all men, that their workes
concurre with their words, without admitting any excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:2459:176"/>
more then in two Cases; As when that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
cannot be performed without sinne; Or when the
businesses, or the persons, admit some notable change. And
hee citeth the example of Saint <hi>Paul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Who promised to go
to <hi>Corinth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 19.</note> but could not be as good as his word, for those
lawfull impediments, which hindred this his intended Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
Whence, it followeth; That things continuing in
the same Estate, a man may not, for the conueniences of his
priuate profit, be wanting to his promise: And to maintaine
the contrarie, is to lay trapps against the truth of faith, and
to arme policie against the religion of an oath. In a word,
all doe resolue, that all promises are to be kept, and that no
deceite or faithlesse dealing ought to be tolerated. And the
reason, whereupon they ground it, is common; for that <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitas
est fundamentum Iustitiae;</hi> Faithfullnesse is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Iustice, and all Contractation; And that this being
taken away, all commerce amongst men, must expire with it,
without the which the world cannot be conserued. For
they, not resting assured, that that which is promised, shall
be performed, they will not trust one another. <hi>Marcus
Tullius,</hi> sayth very well, that this humane faith is so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
amongst men, that, euen Thieues and Pyrates could
not liue, if they were not true amongst themselues, and kept
their word one with another. And though all, euen the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
ought to keepe their word, yet much more carefully
ought Kings, and Princes; for there is nothing more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
them, then to fayle in their faith, and word, which
aboue all earthly things they ought to keepe, and cumply
with all, because they are as Gods vpon earth, and the Head
of their people. Wherefore, their single word ought to be as
an Oracle, and to be more firme, sure, and of greater credit,
then any bond or obligation whatsoeuer that is sealed and
signed with an oath. Let the Politicians say what they
please, and that it is good and sound aduise, that a Prince,
for to conserue his State, may do an act contrary to Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="315" facs="tcp:2459:176"/>
Religion, and neither keepe his word, nor oath; yet must
I be bold to tell them, that this is wicked, vngodly, and
beastly Counsaile, and contrary to the whole Schoole of
learned Doctors, and holy fathers; who affirme: that a
Prince is bound to keepe his word, though hee take not
an oath for the performance thereof, but much more if he
shall sweare, and binde it by an oath. And if they will
not yeeld to this, let these Politicians plucke off their maske,
and let those that be their sectuaries, speake plaine language,
and tell mee what they thinke of those Princes, (as of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and others) who made no reckoning of that they
promise and sweare, when as by the breach thereof, they
haue beene vtterly ouerthrowne, when they most assured
themselues of Victorie. I doubt not but they will hold it for
a foolish reason of State. For by this falsifying, Princes shall
presently loose all their credit and reputation, and all their
cunning shall not profit them, for they will neuer afterwards
be beleeued.<note place="margin">L. 3. Tit. 4. Part. 2.</note> As it is in one of the lawes of the <hi>Partida. No le

for all sortes of persons, but more particularly, for
Kings and Princes, who should rather see Heauen and earth
to fayle, then that they should faile in their promises. Let

they either say, or promise, that it be agreeable to the
Law of God, and to the precepts of the Church, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
let them infallibly obserue and keepe the same.
For in this, consisteth the conseruation, and augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of great States; And is that true reason of State, which
makes Kings more powerfull, more rich, more esteemed, and
more obeyed. For hee that keepes his faith, and his word,
holdes the hearts of men in his hand, is Master of all their
wealth, and all because they rest assured, that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
relye vpon his faith and word. Wheras, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
hath insued the destruction of Common-wealths, the
distrustfullnesse of their subiects, the scorne and contempt of
their enemies, and the iealousie of their friends and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates,
who all hang and depend vpon the truth of his
words, and the performance of his Contracts. And this
being once lost, with it hee looseth his credit, and after
that all goes to wracke with it. For <hi>Malignitas</hi> (saith the

it is a most wicked and abhominable thing, to breake that

For (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmeth) Pacts and Couenants, being
broaken &amp; violated, there is taken away from amongst men,
the vse, trading, and commerce of things. These, and the
like effects, cause in a King, either the keeping, or loosing of
his Credit. But of no lesse importance is that third point,
which followeth in the next place, concerning secrecie.</p>

So that a wise, discreete, and prudent Tongue, and such a

are in a manner Gods, at least Gods Liuetenants, should in

Tongue, to know when to open the doore of the lips, and
when to shut them, what to vtter, and what to conceale.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:2459:179"/>
And in Kings, this is so much the more important, by how
much the more graue and weighty are those businesses,
which are treated with them. For, it doth not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
them, in not hauing their purposes preuented, nor
their designes ouerthrowne, but likewise winn's them much
authoritie and credit. For the world will stand as it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished
and amazed, and men will wonder at that, which
they both doe, and say, and out of euery kinde of gesture,
or word of theirs, will make a Mystery, deliuer their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and draw thence a thousand discourses, all which
are but cranes and pullyes to make them mount higher in
opinion, and reputation. Likewise, when Ministers shall
take notice, that their King knowes how to heare, and how
to hold his peace, and in it's due time, to execute his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
they liue in a great deale the more awe and feare,
lest such and such things (wherein they doe amisse) might
come to his knowledge: And when they see, that he knowes
how to conceale a secret, till it's fit time and season, it keepes
them within their Compasse, and is the only bridle, that
restraines them from doing ill, either by way of oppression
(whereunto great Ministers are too much subiect) or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
And therefore, it shall much concerne a King, not
onely to be secret in those things, which might cause some
inconuenience, if he should speake of them, and make them
knowen, but also in those things, which bring no profit
by their publication. For, if they shall once perceiue, that
their King cannot conceale, what is deliuered vnto him
vnder the seale of silence, in preiudice of this, or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
party, no man will dare to informe, and aduise him
of that, which may redound to Gods seruice, and the good
of the Common-wealth. And so like bad gamesters, they
will for want of keeping close their cardes, let their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
winne the game, by discouering their hand. A Kings

And that therfore their secretes &amp; mysteries, are not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged,
and made common, no not to his neerest Minions and
Fauourites; &amp; when at most, but to some one particular <hi>priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
and that vpon very good &amp; iust cause. Our Sauiour <hi>Christ,</hi>
once, (vpon necessary occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) discouered a secret to his great
<hi>Priuado,</hi> or fauourite, S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> but it was with these circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
That thee told it him in his eare, forbidding him to
speake therof vnto any. And because, neither by signes, or any
other outward demonstration, he might make it knowen, he
bound vp all his senses in a deepe and profound sleepe, to the
end, that by none of them, he might expresse that, which it
behooued him to conceale. Great is the importancie of secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
&amp; the authoritie which it giues to the iudgements, &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues
of those that gouerne. For, if all might know the causes,
which moue a Prince to make this or that prouision, to giue,
this this or iudgement, to pardon, or to punish, to craue, or to
giue, many censures wold passe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, &amp; it might cause many
scandalls &amp; alterations in a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth. And therfore it
much concerneth so supreme a Maiesty not to suffer the secret
which is shut vp in his bosome, to be published to the world.
And in some cases, it may come to be a mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sters, or fauourites, in regard of the great hurt, opposition,
and dissention, which there-fro may arise. But hee may doe
this, in case it may well sort with the secret it selfe, to take
out the pithe and substance of it, and without shewing
any firme, or vttring any word whereby the Author may
be knowen, and shew it to the Delinquent (if so he thinke

names should not be thus confounded, or that that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and Title should be giuen to him, to whom by Office
it not appertaineth. Secretaryes I say, shut vp with that
secrecie,<note place="margin">Apoc. 5. 1.</note> as was that booke of those secret Mysteries which
Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> found sealed with seuen seales,<note place="margin">Tobit. 12. 7.</note> which none, but

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:2459:181"/>
of a King, but it is honourable to reueale the worke
of God. Which is as much to say, as that the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a King should be kept secret, but that the effects
and execution of them should be published and made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
when it is fitting for the seruice of God, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
For a Kings secret, is his heart, and till that God
shall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> moue him to expresse it by some outward worke,
there is no reason that any one else should discouer it. To
reueale a secret, is by the Lawes of God, and Nature, and
by all men generally condemned, and all Lawes, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
doe seuerely punish the same, for the great hurt, and
many inconueniences, that may follow thereupon. The
Lawes, they are defrauded, the resolutions of Kings, they
are hindred; their enemies, they are aduertised; their friends
they are offended; mens mindes, they are perturbed; king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
they are altered; peace; that is lost; the delinquents,
they are not punished; And lastly all publicke and priuate
businesses are ouerthrowen. And there is not any thing,
that goes crosse, or amisse in a State, or that miscarryes or
is lost, but by the reuealing of the secrets of Kings, and
of their Counsells. As that great Chancellour <hi>Gerson</hi> told
the King of <hi>France,</hi> touching the ill successe of some things
in his time, for that some of his Ministers did publish that
which was treated and determined at the Counsell-Table.
And the like befell <hi>Enrique,</hi> King of <hi>Portugall;</hi> Who,
because hee was deafe, they were faigne to speake so loud
vnto him,<note place="margin">Valer. lib. 2. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabi. Caepola; Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancus de rep. lib. 7. cap. 14. &amp;<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cap. 15.</note> that all men might heare what they said. <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius

was no feare of plumping them, or being able to draw

he is a periur'd and infamous person, hee sinnes mortally,
and is bound to satisfaction of all the harme, that shall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

his Office. For, if hee be sworne to secrecie, or bee made a
Secretary, and hath silence for the seale of his Office, he is
iustly depriued thereof, if he vse it amisse. And the Law of
the <hi>Recopilation</hi> saith, that hee is lyable to that punishment
which the King will inflict vpon him, according to the
qualitie of the offence, or the hurt thereby receiued. And
the Imperiall Law, (chapter the first, <hi>Quibus modis feudum
amittit.)</hi> that hee shall loose the fee, which hee holdes of
his Lord. <hi>Plutarke</hi> reporteth of <hi>Philipides,</hi> that he being
in great grace and fauour with <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> King of <hi>Lacae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonia,</hi>
begged no other boone of him but this; That he
would not recommend any secret vnto him; As one that
knew very well that saying of one of the wise men of <hi>Greece:</hi>
That there was not any thing of more difficultie, then to
be silent in matters of secrecie. As also, for that it being
communicated to others, though it come to be discouered
by anothers fault, and none of his, yet the imputation is laid
as well vpon him, that was silent, as on him that reuealed;
and so must suffer for another mans errour. And in case any
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:2459:182"/>
man shall incurre any iust suspition thereof, let the King
withdraw his fauour from him, dismisse him the Court,
and put another in his place, that shall be more secret; for
that which they most pretend, is their fidelitie in this point.
And howbeit, they haue neuer so many other vertues, and
good abilities, yet wanting this, they want all; and are of
no vse, no more then were those vessells in Gods House,
which had no Couers to their mouthes. For such open
vessells are they, that cannot keepe close a secret, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together

which an euill tongue causeth,
one amongst the rest, and not the least,
is that of Adulation and flattery. Which
is so much the greater, by how much
the more dissembled and feigned it is.
The sacred Scripture tearmes it abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
a sinne, and says, that a flatterer,
is absolutely a sinner. So some doe paraphrase vpon that
Verse; <hi>Oleum autem peccatoris:</hi> The oyle, or balme of a
sinner. For in it is included all sortes of sinne whatsoeuer,
and aboue all a great neglect and contempt of God: for
although this be to be seene in all kinde of sinnes, yet doth
it more particularly expresse it selfe in those, which draw
not with them any delight, which they doe as it were
vnprofitably, and <hi>sine pretio;</hi> for it brings them no profit at
all, vnlesse (when most) a little Vanitie, which they more
esteeme, then God. These, that they may gaine the kings
elbowe, or that they may not bee put from it, speake al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
vnto him in fauour of that, which hee desireth; and
all their Artifice and cunning is, to conceale the Truth,
and that the doore may be shut against him, that may tell
it him, or those that know not (like themselues) how to
please the Kings palate. And being confident, that they
will giue eare to euery word which they speake, they lay
falsehoods and lyes athwart their way, fathering such Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Prowesse and valour vpon Kings, that they haue
much adoe to for-beare laughing, that heare their folly.
For there are some prayses, that are dis-prayses, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
much to the disgrace and dishonour of Princes.
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:2459:184"/>
For by those vntruths, wherewith they sooth and flatter
them, they breed suspition of that good which is in them.
And because they make pleasing the marke whereat they
shoote, they neuer looke, whether it be a lye, or a truth,
which they deliuer, nor haue an eye more vnto good,
then ill; iuste or vniust, against God, or his neighbour,
all is one: Cannonizing their King for a Saint, though
they know the contrary. These (saith <hi>Nazianzene)</hi> are
like to your Sorcerers of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which were about <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
person, who with feigned Prodigies, did pretend to ease
his heart of that griefe which those plagues did cause in
him. Ambitious and proud men are these, which thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
the truth, and that they may not fall from their bias,
oppose themselues to those that speake the truth, and
minde nothing else, but to cast a fayre colour on those
things, whereunto they see their Prince stands affected.
They come of the race of your Cameleons, which liue by
the ayre, and cloath themselues with the colour of that
whereunto they approach neerest. If they see the King
troubled, they are troubled; if merry, they are merry; if
sad, they are sad; Hauing their teares as neere at hand, as
their smiles, for to deceiue him; And the better to content
him, they change themselues into a thousand colours: in all
they imitate him: in all doe they labour to represent him
to the true life. There is not that glasse, which so liuely
represents the face, the semblance, and actions of those
that looke therein, as the flatterer (who is that shadow
which alwayes followes the body of him hee flattereth)
doth his Kings countenance, his motions, his postures, his
gestures, his saying, and his doings. For, as they see him
either say, or doe, so doe they. Being like vnto the Echo,
which answereth to the last syllable of euery word that is
voyced in the Ayre. These are the Kings Echos, which
answer him in all, not onely in that which the voyce soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth;
but in that which they imagine to be to his liking:
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:2459:184"/>
Being herein very like vnto those lying Hypocrites which
thinke one thing, and make shew of another. But they
are presently discouered, and this their second intention
soone vnderstood, which is, To lye, and flatter, to make
themselues gratious, and to bring their businesses the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
about, though it be to the hurt of others. With one
single truth, they will dawbe ouer a thousand lyes; As per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumers
doe a great deale of Leather, with a little Ciuit. And
thus soothing and suppling the eares of Princes with a
subtill softenesse, and deceitful sweetnesse, thy powre lyes
into them, and working them with a gentle hand, they passe
for truths, Whilst these false perswaders falsifie the Truth,
and are worse members in a Common-wealth then those
that falsifie the Kings Coine; and sinne more grieuously
then those that beare false witnesse. For these, by their
testification, deceiue onely the Iudge, that is to sentence
the cause; but these with their faire and false flatteries, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cozen and deceiue Kings, but corrupt and infect them, &amp;
make them to perseuere in their errours. <hi>Per dulces sermones,

by good words, and faire speeches they deceiue the hearts
of the simple. And therefore with the greater and more
grieuous punishments ought they to be punished. They
are not so squezy stomackt, as to make dainty of Lying,
nor make they any bones to tell an vntruth, if thereby
they thinke they may please. And as soone will they lay
hold on a Lye, as a truth, so as they rest well apayd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to whom they vent their flatterie and their Leasings.
And some are so trayned and bred vp to them, that they take
delight to heare them, and doe as verily beleeue them, as
they doe their Creede. And so close doth this falsehood
cleaue vnto them, that without any occasion or cause giuen
they leane thereunto, and stedfastly beleeue, that they haue
that goodnesse in them, which they want, and not that bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
wherein they exceede. For, being sencelesse of their
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:2459:185"/>
owne defects, they no sooner heare themselues commended
but they are presently puffed vp, and conceit themselues to
surpasse all other Princes. And thus doe they liue all their
life long deluded, taking themselues to be othewise, then
they are, being abused and vndone, by Lyes, and flatteries;
Whence it is now growne to be a Prouerb; <hi>Princeps, qui

If a Ruler hearken to Lyes, all his seruants are wicked.
For euery man will frame his Tongue, according to his
eare and feede him with that fruit, which they know best
pleaseth his palate. It being a dangerous disease in Kings,
not to indure the truth; and as mortall in the subiects, that
they know not well, how to acquaint them therewith.
The one, because they minde no other things; The other
because they dare not speake their minde. Many seekeing to
please them, most to flatter them, and some not to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
them, being loath to distast them, of whose helpe &amp;
fauour they may stand in neede, hauing so much the kings
eare, and such great power in Court. They know that
the bread of Lyes is sauory, and that flatterers are too well
heard, that they buzze into Kings eares a thousand ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and falsehoods, which they themselues inuent, and by
their smooth carriage of them, perswade them to be truths.
And for that Kings (vsually) treate with few, they cannot
be informed of the truth, and so are forced to beleeue
those, who of purpose seeke to deceiue them. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the wise men of <hi>Athens</hi> did set such a watch about
their Kings, that flatterers should not bee suffred to speake
with them. For these their smooth words, their adulations,
and flatteries when they are once receiued by the eare, do
not slightly passe away, entring in at one eare, and going
out at another, but they cleaue vnto the Soule, and make
their way euen to the innermost part of the heart, and
there make their seate, and abode. <hi>Verba susurronis, quasi

And albeit they be cast out, and doe not wholy either pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse,

and in what mould they are cast, yet at least they leaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them a kinde of guste, and content, and with that
wherewith they seeme to please, they kill. As water doth
those, that are sicke of a Hectick-feuer, which they drinke

greedinesse: so these men come to tast that, which turnes to
their owne hurt. Crossing the opinion of <hi>Iob;</hi> who would
haue none to tast that, which being tasted, should occasion
his death. Of your rich red wine, the wise man saith, that
it is pleasant and sweete in the going downe, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that it biteth and gnaweth in the belly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like a Serpent;
In like manner, soothing is very sweete and sauory, and
and seemeth least sower, to those, that are most powerfull,
and, although they see the poyson that it is mingled with,
yet they drinke it downe with a good will, and their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
will be sure to serue them with the best and the
strongest, contrary to that precept of Gods, which saith;
<hi>Noli vinum dare regibus:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prou. 31. 4. 5.</note> Giue not wine vnto Kings, lest

of these flatterers, and false deceiuers, who pretend no more
then to vphold themselues in their place, and grace, and
to receiue thankes for doing ill. And the miserie of it is,
that they finde this to be a good way for their rising in
Court, and to grow in fauour with Princes; and the onely

dispositions, whose pills of poyson, are confectioned with
Sugar, and fairely, but falsely gilded ouer. The Emperour
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> was such an enemie vnto them, and to whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
did sauour of flattery, that neuer either in publicke,
or in secret, did hee giue way to intertayning any speech
with them, and held those hearts to be base and vile, which
did vse the like feigned courtesies. And the two <hi>Seueri,
Alexander &amp; Septimus:</hi> did seuerely prosecute these beasts,
and pursued them to the death, as most mischeiuous to
a Common-wealth. <hi>Theodoricus,</hi> stabd one of his seruants,
because thinking thereby to please him, and to curry fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour

beheaded an Embassadour of theirs, whom they
imployed to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> because in an insinuating
and flattering kinde of fashion, hee made his entrance,
when hee came to haue his Audience, with great submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and thereupon enacted a Law, whereby they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
flatterers to death. And the Emperours, <hi>Arcadius</hi>
and <hi>Honorius</hi> ordeyned the like in their Lawes. And good
King <hi>Dauid</hi> did well instruct Kings,<note place="margin">2. Kings. 1. 15.</note> how they were to
deale with these Traytors, in that rigorous chasticement,
which hee exercised on an <hi>Amalakite,</hi> who thought to
winne his fauour by bringing him newes of <hi>Sauls</hi> death;
whom presently there vpon the place in his own presence,
hee caused to be slaine. This kingly Prophet, did hate
them exceedingly, and was much the more wary and

met with such good and rich <hi>Indyes.</hi> And therefore did
so earnestly beg of God, that not one drop of that oyle

though their words seeme to be like oyle, or Balsamum
that is powred forth, yet are they sharpe arrowes, and
deadly Darts. This oyle, or Balsamum (saith <hi>Casiodorus)</hi>
is flatterie, which is an inuention of the Diuells to bereaue
men of their sences. He tooke this course with the first of
men, and neither hath, nor will giue ouer till hee haue
made an end (if hee can) with the last. For great is that
vngodly gaine which hee maketh by this kinde of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise.
With this pleasant bath, and mouth-oyntment
hee came to our first parents, and began to smooth, and
annoynt them with his inticing flatteries, telling them,
that they should be no whit inferiour vnto God, if they
would but taste of the forbidden fruit. They (vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

The fall of that Prince, is very neere at hand, if not very

For a flatterers tongue does more harme, then a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers

<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great was incensed against his friends,
because they tolde him,<note place="margin">Seneca. epist. 124</note> that hee was the Sonne of a God.
Hee told them they ly'd. And hee was in the right. For
all that flatter, lye; and that is not to be beleeu'd which
they say, but that which euery man knowes of himselfe,
and what his owne conscience dictates vnto him: And
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:2459:188"/>
what good doth their commendation doe mee, if that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
mee? And in case that they doe not doe this base
office, but that they themselues sooth vp themselues, and
beleeue that of themselues, which they are not, this, of
all other adulation, is the worst, and the most incurable,
because it ariseth from selfe-loue, and a proper estimation
of our owne worth, which is that inward flatterer which
we all beare about vs in our owne bosomes, and are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to intertane his false perswasions. For hee that is flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by another, doth sometimes know, that all is Lyes
and adulation, which they tell him, and makes a game and
scoffe of it, which hee doth not doe, when it proceedes
from himselfe, but doth rather desire, that all should fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
him in this his opinion; And it is a strange thing,
and much to be wondred at, that without himselfe, and
in another, a man should so easily perceiue adulation, and
should not see it in himselfe. But the reason of it is; That
some doe rest so well satisfied of themselues, that all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
they imagine in their owne conceit, they opinion it
to be truly in them, and to be their due.</p>
                  <p>Let vs therefore conclude this discourse, with aduising
Kings, that it is basenesse in a brest and heart that is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
noble and royall, to suffer himselfe to be so lightly
led away by men of such vile thoughts, and base preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
which follow more a Prince his fortune, then his
Person. They feare not his hurt, nor pittie his paines, for
that they are Traytours, and easily vary from their faith
and loyaltie, and passe ouer to another. They flatter this
man, and backbite that: They sooth one, and flout another.
Their tongues, are like double sawes, which sawe on both
sides, which comming and going, cut wheresoeuer they
come, and slice and mince all that they light vpon, not
sparing any man. There is no trusting of these men, nor can
we safely haue ought to doe with them; for, to serue their
turne, they haue still two contrary weapons ready at hand,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:2459:189"/>
and with one and the same Prince, make vse of them
both. One while they lye, and another while speake
truth, but flatter in both. Their tongue droppeth forth
words of hony, and their lips are canded with Sugar;
for they know, that in Kings houses much sweete meates
are spent, and they hold him that shall season things with
a contrary relish for their palate, to be offensiue and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome,
and it will not goe downe with them, so harsh
doth it seeme vnto them in the swallowing. King <hi>Ahab</hi>
renders no other reason of his hatred towards the Prophet
<hi>Micah,</hi> but because hee did not speake pleasing things, and
such as did agree with his guste and palate; for hee that
is accustomed to this kinde of diet, will hardly be brought
to digest any other.<note place="margin">

wee may inquire of the Lord; But I hate him, for hee
neuer prophesieth good vnto mee, but alwayes euill. Hee
had signified some truthes vnto him, but hee did not like
well of them; for those eares, that haue beene accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

and to heare that, which may dis-deceiue them, and put

                     </gap>olly, at no lesse a rate then his life. For
these his false Prophets, and flatterers, led him along into
the doores of death, as fooles by faire words are led vnto
the stocks. But hee, that is a good King, will not suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to be carried away with euery winde, nor be moued
with soothing and artificiall words; and all such, as are of
a generous minde, and of a graue and constant disposition,
and men of reckoning and authoritie, are enemies to such
kinde of lightnesse, and meere strangers to all manner of
leasings and adulation. This being so, wee ought not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to keepe the doores of our eares shut against these their
accursed tongues, but of our houses against these vaine
and lying Sycophants, and to desire of God, that he will
be pleased to illighten the vnderstanding of Kings and
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:2459:189"/>
Princes, that they may get at least out of this blindnesse
wherein they liue, and that he will free them from these
eare-wiggs, and incroaching flatterers, who onely for to
please, and for their particular Interest, celebrate their
euill actions, and approue for lawfull, all their disordinate
appetites. Whilest they, out of seelinesse, or willfullnesse,
will not see the truth of that saying; <hi>Qui te beatum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt,</hi>

                  <p>Lastly, That wee may put an end to this discourse, I say,
That there are another sort of flatterers, which they call
Iesters, and men of pleasure, very hurtfull and preiudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
both in the Common-wealth, and Kings Courtes; And
by so much the more, by how much the more eare is giuen
vnto them. Their Laughters, their applause, their flatteries,
and their fooleries, are all Lyes; one word crossing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and their last reasons incountring with their first, and
by laying hold on all, confound themselues in the end in
all. Their Office is to persecute the truth; and whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
they are, there is heard nothing but Musicke, songs,
and inchantments of lyes and falsehoods, wherewith they
deceiue, and fill mens heads with ayre. Hee hath small
store of braine (saith a wise man) which hearkens vnto
such kinde of idle Companions; who, for that they finde
they haue entrance into the Courtes and Palaces of Kings,
loose all shame, and feare, and assume vnto themselues the
libertie to runne this large course of life, whereby they
thriue so well, and get their bread with so much ease. <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
amongst those beasts, which represent the Actions
and gestures of men, which liue by their trickes, and sustaine
themselues by their arte and industrie, reckoneth vp the
Ape. And according to the Hebrew truth, and <hi>Pagninu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his translation, that word <hi>Stellio</hi> signifieth as much. And

<hi>Stellio manibus nititur, &amp; moratur in aedibus regis.</hi> And
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:2459:190"/>
thereby vnderstand this linage of mimick men, which liue
meerely by their industry, exercising a thousand Apish
gestures before Kings and Princes to please them all they
can, and to make them to laugh and be merry. They are
birdes of rapine, hauing long bills, and double pawes, sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
on what they see, and you must part with something
to them either by faire meanes, or by force, vpon paine
of putting you in feare, that they will speake that of you,
which they doe of others. These ill condition'd birdes;
are vsually bred in high places, although, like lewd women,
they stoope to all, admit of all, and take of all, with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension
to deceiue all, fitting euery one according to his
humour, soothing that sinne, whereunto they see the party
most affected. They are traytours of their tongue, cogging
Companions, and lying Knaues, who, a man hath no sooner
turned his backe, but they scoffe most at him, that giues
them most; and not onely rob him of his money, but his
honour, and goe laughing away at their owne folly; They
are Rogues by consent, Villaines by permission, Knaues
<hi>Cum priuilegio,</hi> instruments of the Diuell, and Hawkes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meate
for Hell; Deseruing to be banished for euer from
the presence of Kings, and men of authoritie. But the
greife of it is; That the more they lye, the more they are
beleeued; and the more impudently and vnciuilly they
talke, they are the better heard. Vnhappy are they in
themselues, and as vnhappy they that heare them: The
one, in their tongues, the other, in their eares. But they
shall not remaine without punishment, for their Harpes
and their Ghitterns, their Lutes, and their Vialls, their
singing of new and lasciuious songs, their descanting vpon
other mens liues, their lyes, and their flatteries, in that
sad and miserable hower of their death, shall be turned
into sighes and groanes, into roarings and howlings, and
into hideous and fearefull shrikes, as they write of the
<hi>Syrens,</hi> to whom <hi>Esay</hi> compares them; Who in their life
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:2459:190"/>
time sing sweetly, and deceiue the hearing with their sweete
notes, and murder the men that listen to them; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
die themselues, bellowing forth terrible and rauing
out-cryes. For then, doth that blood faile and forsake
them, which did cheere their heart. In like manner, the
Sea-beasts, of this Sea of the world, when this their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
heate shall goe decaying, and their blood shall waxe
cold and frozen within them, they will depart hence with
horrible anguish of Soule, terrible gripings of the heart,
stinging vexations of conscience, rauing yellings, and shreike
vpon shrieke, one ouertaking another tearing the very
soule in sunder, caused by their euill Conscience, which neuer
leaues racking and tormenting them, till it haue brought
them downe to the deepe pit of Hell, where they shall abide
for euer weeping and gnashing their teeth. Where I will
now leaue them, and passe on to the sense of Touching;
which though it be the first in being, yet is it the last, that

of all the other sences it is the most pernicious, because
it trailes and draggs the rest after it, or seemed to haue

them pay it tribute and custome of all their gaines and
commodities. For, that which the eies see, the eares, heare,
the nose smells, and the heart desires, is onely there with
to serue this sence, letting it share with them, and inuiting
it to take part of their best and choysest morsells. The

Cambricks, and Hollands, such large beds, rich bedding,

whether or how farre this Humour will extend it selfe. But
sure I am, that thereby houses are disordred, much monyes
consumed, ancient Inheritances solde away, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
other inconueniences introduced. And (to say the
truth) this sense hath not neede of so much nicetie, but
abuse hath now brought it to that passe, that it hath no
sooner a liking to a thing, but it greedily runn's after it,
as a beast that is put into a fresh ground, runnes vp and

For if yee liue after the flesh, yee shall dye. Wee
haue examples of Kings good store, and of ancient and
moderne Kingdomes, forraine, and domestick. The first
shall be of <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. King of <hi>France,</hi> in whom vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuousnesse
and delights, wrought so great an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in that his most fortunate and happy entrance, which
hee made into <hi>Italy;</hi> where without putting hand to his
sword, hee became Master of all the whole Kingdome of
<hi>Naples,</hi> and did so amuze and affright all the World, that
the Great Turke was afraid of being ouer-runne by him,
and many of his Commaunders, which had the keeping
of his Fortes on that Coast, forsooke them and fled. And
if that King had but well followed that Enterprize, hee
had beene Lord of all <hi>Greece.</hi> But being a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tileman,
hee suffered himselfe to be ouercome by the
Dainties and Delicacies of that Countrie, spending his
Time in delightes, banquets, shewes, maskings, dancings,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:2459:193"/>
and feastings; So that hee, who had so soone filled the
world with feare, was as soone ouercome by yeelding
to the pleasure of this sense. For hee and his did so
glut themselues with the fruites of that Country, and so
followed the delights of the flesh, that hauing entred
victorious, they became subiect, and were subdued by
that new and loathsome disease, which possesseth the

(which is another notable Example) who hauing wonne

themselues in the victorie, layd aside their Armes,
and gaue themselues in that manner to their pleasures
and delights, that within a few dayes they were growen
so lazye and so weake, that they were not able to fight,
nor to beare armes against the enemie; and being forced
to take them vp in a certaine skirmish, which they had
neere vnto <hi>Veles,</hi> they were ouerthrowen and shamefully
put to flight, leauing dead in the place the sonne of their
King. Who being very sensible of this so great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie,
consulted his Physicians, what should be the cause
of this so great a weakenesse both in the strength and
courage of his soldiars, who in the first incounter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
shew'd themselues as fierce as Lyons, in this last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
seemed as fearefull as Hares. Who answered him
with that,<note place="margin">lin. nat. Hist. lib. 2. cap. 3.</note> which <hi>Pliny</hi> speakes of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who fell from
their ancient greatnesse, because in their meate, drinke,
and apparell, and in the delicacies of their bathes, and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:2459:194"/>
companie keeping with women, they exceeded all those,
whom before they had ouercome. And therefore, <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendo,

And thereupon, that good King forthwith commanded
the bathes to be destroyed, together with the houses of
pleasure, gardens, and other the like places of recreation,
wherewith that dammage was in part repayred. In these
two things, daintinesse in diet, and wantoning with
women, the Diuell imploies his vttmost strength and
force, that hee may quit those of it, and vtterly dis-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
them, that giue themselues thereunto. And this
was that Counsaile and Aduice, which that member of
Satan, and false Prophet, <hi>Balaam</hi> gaue to the King of
<hi>Moab;</hi> That in those places, through which the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Israel</hi> were to passe, hee should appoint certaine
of his fayrest women to be there in readinesse, to receiue
and intertaine them, to cherish and make much of them,
and to inuite them to eate and drinke with them, as the
onely meanes to draw them on to their destruction as
it afterwards fell out.<note place="margin">Num. 25. 1.</note> This is pointed at in <hi>Numbers</hi>

That those are not to be feared, which giue themselues to

of armour, and taking pleasure in the sound of
musicke, in putting off harnesse, and putting on silkes; in
changing a field-Tent, for a soft bed; and forsaking the
conuersation of soldiars, and Captaines, to follow the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
of women, they stuck a naile in the wheele of their
fortunes. These are examples, that cannot be excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst;
But much lesse that which followes of King <hi>Salomon,</hi>
whose pompe, musick, dancings, feastings, huntings, dainties,
delights, and passe times, were such, as he himselfe, inspired
by the Holy Ghost, reckons vp. Now that, which he got
by all these, what was it? Onely this, that these Vices,
and wanton delights, made him forget himselfe, and to blot
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:2459:194"/>
out all the good of his felicitie, and that good correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which hee held with God, and in such sort did
turne his braines, that hee came to committ idolatrie, and
to call his saluation in question. And therefore let euery one
command his flesh, as hee would command his slaue, lest
it make him a slaue. For to him that yeelds himselfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
it is a fierce; to him, that feares it, a cruell; and to
him, that deliuers the keyes of his libertie vp vnto him,
a dominering Tyrant, which like a haltred beast, it hales
after him. There are two remedies found, for the curing
of so many dammages and disorders, as we perceiue to be
in this sense of Touching, and that of the Tast. One
generall for all; which is Temperance, whereof wee will

                     <hi>adijciet vitam:</hi> Excesse of meates
bringeth sicknesse; By surfeiting haue many perished, but
hee, that taketh heede, prolongeth his life. King <hi>Masinoja,</hi>
was wonderfull temperate, his fare was ordinary and with
out curiositie, which made him liue so sound and so heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
that, at 87. yeares of age, hee begat a Sonne, and at
94. wanne a battaile, wherein he shewed himselfe a very
good Soldiar, but a better Captaine. And therefore let those
dis-deceiue themselues, and acknowledge their errour, who
thinke they shall preserue their life, by faring deliciously<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>Pliny</hi> saith of grasse;<note place="margin">Plin.</note> That, <hi>Quanto peius tractatur, tanto
prouenit melius:</hi> The worse it is vsed, the better it proues.
As with it, so is it with man. <hi>Homo sicut faenum:</hi> Man is
but as grasse, or as the flower of the field; Which is no
sooner vp, but is cut downe; no sooner flourisheth, but it
fadeth; and all it's beautie no sooner appeareth, but it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth,
and withereth away, and is no more to be seene.
And the more wee make of much our selues, the lesse while
we liue. We are alwayes crazy; soone downe, but not so
soone vp; Quickly fall into a disease, but long ere we can
get out of it; Loosing our strength, before we come to it,
and waxing olde, before euer wee be aware of it. But if a
man will lay aside this Cockering and pampering vp of
himselfe, and habituate himselfe to labour and trauaile, he
shall passe his life the better. For health neuer dwells with
delights; nor strength, ioyne hands with choice fare. Nor
shall hee euer doe any famous Acts, and worthy renowne,
that feares to take paines, and is willing to take his ease.
The Emperour <hi>Hadrian,</hi> was singular herein. <hi>Frigora enim,
&amp; tempestates, ita patienter tulit, vt nunquam caput tegeret:</hi>
Hee did indure colds, and all kinde of fowle weather with
that patience, that hee neuer put on his hatt, but alwayes
went bare-headed. And <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, would tell
his Soldiars that it was for lazy Companions, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:2459:196"/>
fellowes, to apply themselues to the pleasures and
contentments of this life; but for Noble hearts, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
spirits, to accustome themselues to labour, and to take
paines. In a word, Temperance is a vertue very necessarie
for all estates; it will sute well with all: but more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with Kings, and Princes, and great persons; because it
is in it selfe a vertue so gentleman-like, so worthy Noble
persons, and so proper for royall Maiestie. As likewise, for
that they liue, as they doe, amidst so many regalos, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
so many curious meates, and a thousand other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
whereby, if they doe not arme themselues with this
vertue, not onely their liues, but their soules, are like to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
the great danger. For like theeues in a mans owne
house, or close traitours lurking in secret corners, some while
one, some while another, are neuer from their elbow, till
they deliuer them ouer into the hands of death; or at least
hoxe their courage, and cut off their health. Which in
good Kings so much importeth, and which all men desire
may be long and prosperous. The want whereof in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
person importeth little; but in them it mattereth
much, in regard of the great losse which the Common-wealth
thereby receiueth. For on their welfare, dependeth
the generall comfort and gouernment of the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which when it is wanting in them, that want is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all.</p>
                  <p>Let then the conclusion of this discourse be, That Kings
ought to keepe an orderly and temperate diet, hauing more
regard to the law of Nature, and vnto Christian reason,
then to their greatnes of state, and Maiestie of Empire; And
to carry themselues amidst so many occasions of pleasures
and delights with that modestie and moderation, as if they
were without them, if they haue a minde to preserue their
bodies and their soules healths; and to giue vnto all a good
example; which is another (as already hath beene said) so
powerfull a remedy for to perswade other Princes and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:2459:197"/>
of his kingdome, to the embracing of this vertue.
And besides that obseruation of <hi>Hipocrates, Quod plures
cecîdit gula, quam gladius:</hi> That surfeiting hath killed
more then the sword. Let those that place all their care in
these their delights and pleasures, consider that saying of
<hi>Cato,</hi> That our much carefulnesse in this, causeth much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnesse
of God. And there are some that count it an
honour and reputation vnto them to eate and to drinke,
(though <hi>Sanitas est animae &amp; corporis sobrius potus)</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are great in estate, they will also be great feeders.
Which indeed is not Greatnesse, nor Lordlinesse, but great
basenesse, and vnbeseeming their authoritie, to suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to be giuen to gluttony, and to the excesse of eating
and drinking. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> did blesse himselfe, and much
wonder, at so much time and wealth as herein was spent;
and at so many Cookes, and other Officers, herein em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.
And that he should be the most commended, and
best rewarded, that could inuent any other new kinde of
choice dish, then had by gluttonies curious enquiry been as
yet found out And all to giue gust to the Gust, and to please
the palate, with the losse of their honour, the wasting of
their wealth, and to their great hurt both of bodies and
soules. But these must I inroll in the list of vnfortunate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,<note place="margin">Eccl. 10. 17.</note>
and account that kingdome happy (as the wise man
saith) where the King and his Peeres liue soberly and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately.

soule and heart of a kingdome, and like
another Sunne, which with its light and
motion, affoords light and health to the
world; being the true picture and liuely
Image of God vpon earth; and he that
is most (being iust) like vnto him, hath
a great and precise obligation lying vpon him, both by his
life and example, to giue life vnto his kingdome, and to set
himselfe, as a patterne, before his subiects, that, and they,
being that mysticall bodie, whereof he is the head. And see
what dependencie the members in mans bodie haue on the
head; the same, or little lesse, haue subiects on their Kings.
And if that be sound and good, it is well with all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
but if ill affected, all of them suffer with it. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe
saith, <hi>Cum caput dolet, caetera membra dolent.</hi> When
the head aketh, the rest of the members ake with it. And
as it is so true, as nothing more, so it it more in Common-wealths,
then mens bodies. For, as the humours of these
are in or out of order, according to those which the head
communicateth vnto them. So likewise the composition of
a whole kingdome, dependeth on the good or ill compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of their King and Head. Whence it followeth, that
the same necessitie which a body hath of a good head, the
very selfesame hath a kingdome of a good King; being that
he as hee is King (as already hath beene deliuered) doth
therein supply the Office of the Head. And therefore it
was well said of <hi>Plato,</hi> That the inclining of a King to
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:2459:198"/>
good, or ill, is the inclining of the whole kingdome, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his scale or ballance; they bend all the same way, &amp;
follow him, as the shadow doth the body. <hi>Mouetur cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe

multitude. In vaine do we seeke to rectifie the shadow, if
the body be crooked. The waues of the sea, go that way as
the winde driues them; and the vulgar are led along by the
example of those their Kings, that gouerne them. <hi>Aquae
multae populi sunt:</hi> The common people are as many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
The spirit and winde that moues them, is the King,
who with great force carries the mindes of his subiects
this way or that way, as best pleaseth him. By onely seeing
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> abstaine from some meate, and eate of other
some, without commanding it, or saying any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to those new conuerted Christians,<note place="margin">Galat. 2. 14.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that
he carried them away, and drew them to doe the like. For,
there is neither Law, nor Precept, nor force, can be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with that which the example of a King works vpon his
subiects, forcing them to imitate and follow him. King
<hi>Manasses</hi> (saith the sacred Text) <hi>fecit malum coram Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no:</hi>
He did that which was euill in the sight of the Lord; for
he forsooke him to follow strange Gods, like vnto the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination
of the heathen. And anon after drawes thence
this consequence or conclusion:<note place="margin">2 Chron. 33. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Igitur Manasses seduxit po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulum,
vt faceret malum:</hi> So <hi>Manasses</hi> made <hi>Iudah,</hi> and
the Inhabitants of Ierusalem to erre, and doe worse then
the heathen, &amp;c. But tell me, I pray, how came it to passe,
that this King should cast such a mist before his subiects
eyes, that he should thus deceiue them, and make them doe
as he did? For we doe not finde there, that he said any one
word vnto them, or induced them thereunto by any other
diligences, whereby to perswade them to commit the like
sinne. Though he did not, yet he did enough, in doing that
which he did, as being their King and Head. For, as the
Soueraigne doth, so doth the subiect. King <hi>Hamor,</hi> and
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:2459:198"/>
Prince <hi>Shechem</hi> his sonne, by their bare example onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
their people the Shechemites, to leaue that law,
wherein they had beene bred and brought vp, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
that of the Hebrewes, though it turned to the losse
of all their liues. Of Kings, saith a Romane Philosopher,
<hi>Quaecunque vitia ipsi concipiunt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iulius lib. 3. de Legibus.</note> 
                     <hi>ea infundunt in ciustates;
plus exemplo, quam peccato nocent:</hi> Whatsoeuer vices they
conceiue, they infuse the same into their Cities, offending
more by their example then by their sinne. By the sinne,
they doe but aggrauate and wrong their owne conscience;
but by the example, the consciences of all the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which haue no other eyes whereby they see, no other
rule or square whereby to rule and gouerne themselues in
their actions; Nor is there any other meanes, whereby vices
are communicated with more facilitie, and larger licence.
And therefore it concernes them very much, not to make
any the least breach in good manners, nor to turne (though
neuer so little aside) from the way of vertue. For they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
build vp so fast by their good, as they pull downe by
their bad example. Besides, the vulgar iudge thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> vitious
actions, for vertuous; their bad, for good. And if not so,
then will they iustifie their owne loosenesse, by laying the
same on their King: Hee doth thus and thus, And why
should not I? This same <hi>Regis ad exemplum,</hi> runnes ouer
all the world; and men are willing enough to make their
aduantage of it. Of <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Siracusan, Plutarch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth,
that at first he was very studious, and much giuen
to his booke, and whilest hee so continued, all his subiects
applied themselues to the exercise of good letters. But
growing weary of so good a worke, he left off his learning,
and betooke himselfe to the vice of gaming and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
and presently all his subiects, as if they had beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched,
began to loath their bookes, and fall to vice. <hi>Isi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi>
saith of the Ethiopians, that they were such Apish
counterfeits of their Kings, that they held it a kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:2459:199"/>
and infamie, that if their King did want a member,
or were lame, all his houshold seruants were likewise of that
fashion; and would willingly mayme and dismember them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
that they might be like vnto their King.</p>
                  <p>I say therefore againe; Let Kings looke well vnto that
which they affect, and whereunto they are inclined; for the
same will his Subiects affect, and thereunto will they all be
inclined. And therefore <hi>Isocrates</hi> did counsell his King, that
hee should loue and esteeme the Arts, and such Offices as
might be most profitable for the commonwealth, and should
abhorre the contrary; for these would bring him augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of honour, when those other would bee forgotten, or
but ript vp to his shame; that he should approue good, and
reproue bad customes, and euill manners, that these might
fall, and those other be in vse. For in regard that the King is
<hi>Censor morum,</hi> he that censures our manners and behauiour,
and sets downe and determineth, which we are to flie, which
to follow: Looke which he approueth, and keepeth, are kept
and approued by all, and euery one does his best to excell
therein. And those which he shall reproue and mislike, all men
will shunne and auoide them. And more particularly, these
two pernicious ones, which appertaine to Tasting and Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
I desire to haue them be condemned and reproued by
the example of Kings; such as are excesse in sumptuousnesse
of apparell, and in meates and drinkes, and the like publike
and common vices. For, by these two abuses, great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies
haue beene ruined, and ouerthrowne.</p>
                  <p>Let vs fall a little vpon the first; wherein is such excesse
and superfluitie in this age, as neuer more. Howbeit, as it was
not wanting to former times, so was there a great deale of
care taken for the reforming thereof. Your Romanes made
Lawes, for to moderate the expences and excesses of appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
and diet. The imperiall Lawes of the kingdome, and those
of the <hi>Partida</hi> prohibite it, and many other <hi>prematicas</hi> and
Statute Lawes, which haue beene made thereupon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:2459:199"/>
by Act of Parliament. And the sacred Scripture like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in many places doth condemne it. And therefore a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
in this kinde (if possibly it can bee procured) is very
needfull: For excesse, doth not serue so much for sustenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as for pompe and ostentation, wherewith is fomented
Ambition, vaineglory, concupiscence, and dishonestie, euen
to the falling into those vices, that were neuer before seene,
or vsed. Their expence, that increaseth, and their substance
decreaseth: what wealth can a man haue, that will suffice for
the arraying and apparrelling of women, as also for the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of men, which is no lesse vicious, and expencefull then
theirs? What doth it benefit vs, that the riches of our times
are greater then those of our predecessours, if our expences
be more excesssiue? By running on in this lauish course, great
and ancient houses haue beene brought to nothing, and new
ones haue started vp in their roome, borne and bred in bad
Trades, and worse manners, who alwayes haue a smacke with
them, or some touch or other of their former meaner fortune.
And for this cause onely, are there so many misfortunes and
disorders in the houses of many your ordinary and common
sort of people, and euen in some of those that are of meaner
ranke. For they had rather perish and vndoe themselues, then
to be accounted needy and poore. And without doubt, the
most of their substance is spent in meate, and clothes. Which
vice shame would moderate in them. But the feare of seeming
to be oflesse abilitie then their neighbours, hath quite altered
the case, and serues to helpe them on to their ruine. For
euery one counts it a disgrace vnto him, that he shall not go
as well clad as his neighbour, and eate as good meate, and
drinke as good drinke as he doth, though he pay soundly for
it, both in his honour and estate. And hence proceede your
briberies, corruptions, subornations, and iniustice. For ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie,
the mother of vice, and that which makes (as we say)
the old wife trott; putts them so hard to their shifts, that for
to free themselues from want, there is not that wickednesse
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:2459:200"/>
which they will not giue way vnto; and all, because they will
not lacke these instruments of their gustes, nor want the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence
of Maiestie in their houses.</p>
                  <p>And another no lesse mischiefe then the former, is the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie
in the estates, and qualities of the persons; and the
equalitie wherewith the said accoutrements both in meate
and apparrell is vsed. For (as <hi>Plato</hi> saith) in a well ordered
commonwealth, all ought to be equall. And yet we see, that
meane women, that haue neither meanes nor qualitie, weare
Kirtles, Peticoates, and Gownes of cloth of gold, and rich
imbroderies, that Queenes can scarce weare better. And as
for our ordinary sort of men, there are very few of them, but
will go in such good clothes, that Kings can not bee better
clad. Of the Emperour <hi>Tiberius Caesar, Tacitus</hi> reporteth,
that by a Decree of the Senate, he did prohibite men the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of gownes of silke, saying, That they did disgrace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
by putting on such an effeminate habite. And of the
Emperour <hi>Aurelius</hi> it is noted, that hee did not onely not
weare silke, but would not so much as suffer any to be in his
wardrope, saying, That hee would not buy clothes at the
weight of gold. And <hi>Lampridius</hi> saith, That the first Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
that euer had any Wardrobe, was that wicked and lux<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Emperour <hi>Heliogabalus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Scipio Aphricanus,</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
Magnus,</hi> were very singular in this carelesse many
weare, whereof others are so curiously carefull. And let vs
say no more hereof, then what <hi>Isocrates</hi> said, writing to his
King, Haue a care (saith he) of the things of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and thinke that those that liue at high and excessiue
rates, waste and spend out of thy treasure; and that those that
take paines to scrape vp a little mucke, and to get into some
wealth by their thrift, are the onely men that s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll your coffers,
and increase your treasure. For the Subiects purse is as the
Kings owne purse, if he rule and gouerne well. But when men
shall not haue meanes sufficient for to supply that excesse in
diet, and clothes, which vice and mans foolish pride hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:2459:200"/>
how is it possible that they should serue and assist
their King in the necessary occasions of the kingdome? it is
impossible but that there must be a failing in the one, being
that the ends are so opposite. How can they haue any heart
or guste for the one, hauing placed all their care and content
in the other? And questionlesse, if these superfluities were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, the Subiect would haue wealth enough, and then
it would neuer grieue them to part with part thereof to their
Kings, or to spend it in his seruice. But that which is now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
amongst vs, is the same which the Romans permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and procured in the Nations, they had subdued, for to
consume and eate them out, and to keepe them in the better
obedience. But in their owne commonwealth they did euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
feare it, and seeke to excuse it. What Prince hath there
euer beene, either of those that were held to be good or indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
that did not treate of this remedie? Not any, Yet they
did most of them erre in the manner.</p>
                  <p>Now, to remedie this excesse, experience hath and doth
shew vnto vs, that it is not the penaltie, nor rigour of the
Lawes and Statutes that our Ancestours seemed to haue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in, who by those penalties alone, thought to amend these
extrauagancies in their subiects. But the cure of this exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancie
is that which the Ancient did prescribe, and we haue
declared, touching the example of Kings, and of their imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The desire of giuing them content, is more powerfull
with them then the feare of punishment. This doctrine <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi>
taught, rendering the reason of that temperance and
moderation, which was in the Emperour <hi>Vespasian</hi> his time
in clothes and diet, and in the vitious superfluitie of these
vices. And after that he hath gone varying from one reason
to another, he saith, That this Prince was the principall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of that sparingnesse and thriftinesse amongst the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
of those times in their wastfull expences; by exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
himselfe in that their ancient manner of liuing in matter
of maintenance, apparell and the like. And hence it succeeded,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:2459:201"/>
that all his subiects did the like, conforming themselues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his fashion, their respect to their Prince, and their
desire to imitate him, preuailing more with them, then the
punishment or feare of the Lawes. And this is a sure and
sound point of doctrine, and of that great consequence, that
it neuer ought to slip out of the memorie and good liking of
Kings, and their principall Ministers, as being the mirrour
or looking glasse wherein the Subiects see and behold whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their manners be foule or faire, become or not become
them, according to the liking which they take from their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Augustus Caesar, Dion</hi> reporteth, That because hee
would not weare such clothes, as were prohibited by his
Lawes, there was not a man in all his Empire that did offer
to put them on. <hi>Componitur Orbis</hi> (saith <hi>Claudian) Regis
ad exemplar, nec sic inflectere sensus Humanos edicta valent,
quàm vita regentis.</hi> The whole world shapes and fashions it
selfe according to the patterne their King sets before them;
nor can Edicts and Decrees worke so much vpon mens hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
as the life of him that ruleth. Of all the reasons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
that the wit of man can deuise, there is not any more
effectuall to perswade hard and difficult things, then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Kings. Let therefore a Prince lay a more hard and
cruell punishment vpon them, then either imprisonment, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
or some sound fine, or pecuniary mulct, as not to
doe them any grace or fauour, or not to affoord a good looke
on him, that shall not imitate and follow his fashion. For
there is no man such a foole, that will loose the fruite of his
hope, for not apparelling himselfe after this or that manner,
as he sees the Prince himselfe is contented to go. Let Kings
amend this fault in themselues, and then his Peeres, and other
their inferiours, will not be ashamed to imitate them. I pray
tell me, if men of the baser and meaner condition should one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be those, that were vicious in their meate and clothes, who
would imitate them therein? Assuredly none. All would be

Noblemen, or Gentlemen, or at least seeme to be so in their
fashion and apparrell, howbeit they would bee lesse curious
and dainty, if they saw those that were noble, or gentile, go
onely plaine and handsome. That ancient Romane, pure,
neate, cleane, and comely attire of those who conquered the
world, did then wholly loose it selfe, when your great and
Noble persons of that commonwealth left it off. For in all
things, but more especially in those that are vicious, men
seeke to make a fairer shew then their estate will beare, and
thereby procure to content and please their Kings vnder
whom they liue; knowing that there is no intercession or
fauour like vnto that, as the similiancie of manners, and the
kindred which this doth cause. Let Kings, by their example,
cut off the vse of costly clothes and sumptuous banquets, and
whatsoeuer in that kinde is vicious and superfluous, and
they shall straightway see, how a great part of the greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of gaine, and couetousnesse of money will cease, and
many other euils and mischiefes which proceed from thence,
which would not be sought after nor esteemed, were it not for
the execution of the appetite, and fulfilling of our pleasures.
And for this end and purpose, money is kept with such great
anxietie and trouble, but procured and sought after with
much more; because it is the master and commander of all
pleasures and delights whatsoeuer. For which we will buy
and sell, and giue all that we haue.</p>
                  <p>The second point concerning vices and sinnes, common
and publike, the hurt that comes thereby is well knowne
both to God and man, and is harder to be reformed then the
former. That, is moderated either with age or necessitie; but
this, neither necessitie nor time can lessen, but with it increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
and shooteth forth new sprigges and suckers, neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seene, nor vsed in the world, against which neither suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
Lawes nor Statutes. And that doctrine of <hi>Tacitus</hi> is now
come to bee verified, That there is not any gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ter signe of
corruption of manners, then multiplicitie of Lawes. And
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:2459:202"/>
we now liue in those dangerous times, whereof Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
speaketh; and I know not whether I may be so bold as to say,
That it is likewise an argument or signe, that the Subiect is
neare it's end, or at least daily growes decaying, wherein these
signes and tokens are to bee seene; One disorder begetting
another, which is the order which Nature keepes with
things that are to perish, till at last all comes to ruine; and
this vniuersall fabricke sinkes to the bottome, neuer more to
be repaired. I wot well, that whilest there be men, there must
be vices, and sinnes, and that few or none will cease to bee
that which they are, in regard of humane weakenesse, and
mans propension and inclination to sinne, and that there are
not any remedies which will serue and turne wholly to cure
and cut them off, it being a thing impossible, for that their
beginning and cause doth proceed from Nature it selfe being
corrupted. That which the worth and wisedome of Kings,
and their Ministers, may be able to effect, is; That they may
daily proue lesse and lesse preiudiciall to the publike: and that
the dissembling of abuses in the beginning, before they take
head, be not a cause of seeing our selues brought to that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
which <hi>Salust</hi> writeth Rome was found in in <hi>Catilines</hi>
time, there being so good cause for to feare it. As also that
they will draw after them Gods comminations and chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
When a kingdome (saith hee) comes to the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of manners, that men doe pamper and apparell them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in curious manner, like women, and make no reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their honestie, but deale therewith as with any other
thing that is vendible, or set out to sale; and that exquisite
things, for to please the palate, are diligently sought after
both by sea and land; that they betake themselues to their
ease and sleepe, before the due time of their rest and sleepe be
come; that after their bellies be as full as euer they can hold,
they neuer cease crauing and cramming till it be noone; that
they doe not forbeare from eating and drinking, till they be
either hungry or thirsty; not that they ease themselues out of
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:2459:202"/>
wearinesse, or keepe themselues warme against the extremity
of the weather: but that they do all these things out of vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
and before there is neede; well may that Empire be
giuen for lost, and that it is drawing neare to its last gaspe.
For the people thereof, when their owne meanes shall faile
them, for to fulfil their appetites, out of a thirsting and greedy
desire of these things, what mischiefes will not they moue,
or what villanies will not they attempt? For the minde that
hath beene ill, and long accustomed to delights, can hardly
be without them. And, that they may enioy them, by hooke
or by crooke, by one meanes or another, though neuer so
vniust and vnlawfull, they will make a shift to get themselues
into money, though they spend it afterward idly &amp; vainly in
that profuse and lauish manner, for which they did intend it.</p>
                  <p>Let euery good King begge of God, and let vs all ioyne
in the same prayer, that in our times, it may not come to these
termes, and that Kings will striue and studie to quench these
sparkes before they breake forth into a flame, and to put out
the fire whilest it is but newly kindled, lest it take hold on the
whole building, and helpe come too late. And because there
are so many sortes of vices, that it is not possible to procure
an vniuersall cure for them all; that which is likeliest to doe
most good, will bee that selfe same medicine mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in dyet and apparrell, to wit, the good example of Kings;
and in imitation of them, that of the great Lords of the land,
and those that are nearest in Court about their persons; ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
herewith the feare of their disfauour: letting them both
see and know, that the vicious fall backward, and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
come forward in honour; and that onely vertue is the
true meanes and surest way to bring men to great place and
preferrement in the commonwealth. Let Kings hate these
idle droanes, these honey-suckers of other mens labours, that
liue all vpon the waste and spoile. Which kinde of people,
euen in reason of state, are not good for the quiet of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
in regard of the euill cogitations and dangerous deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:2459:203"/>
that are bred in their mindes, and in their time breake out.
I would haue this imitation to bee the remedie for this so
great an ill; for neither penalties nor feare of punishment will
doe any good vpon them. For hee that will not forbeare to
sinne for feare of Gods Law, will hardly refraine from mans.
Let Kings therefore say and doe those things, that they would
haue their Subiects say and doe. And let their fauourites,
and those that are nearest about them, runne the like course,
and let it extend to the better sort, and those that are of ranke
and qualitie; for by this meane it will descend to those like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
that are of meaner condition: and then shall they see,
how much more good it will worke, then either lawes or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
And this is the more naturall of the two; for the
one is founded vpon imitation, and the other grounded vpon
feare. And men doe more easily imitate those better things
which they see actually put in execution, then depart from
those worser things, which they either heare or know to be
prohibited. And when they shall see that their superiours,
and those that are in place and authoritie, command one
thing and doe another, they neither dread their threatnings,
nor obey their commandements. For perceiuing that they
doe but imitate their actions, they perswade themselues that
none can, without blushing, punish the same sinne in them.
<hi>Salust</hi> did aduise <hi>Caesar</hi> in the entrance to his Empire, that
if he would order his commonwealth aright, he should first
of all begin with reformation in himselfe, and his; (as <hi>Pliny</hi>
saith) <hi>Vita Principis censura est, eaque perpetua; ad hanc di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigimur,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plin. Iun. lib. Epist. ad semp. Rufum.</note>
                     <hi>ad hanc conuertimur.</hi> The life of a Prince is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
censure; and according thereunto doe we guide and
gouerne our selues. And let it not seeme vnto any, that this
remedie of the imitation of Kings is slow, and long, and will
aske a great deale of time; for where there is met together,
as it were in it's center, whatsoeuer may corrupt and hurt
that, which is capable of being corrupted, when as neither
Kings nor their Lawes are able to hinder it, in vaine is it
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:2459:203"/>
indeuoured, or to be imagined, that that may bee cured in a
few yeares, which hath layen sicke so many. But till such
time, as men grow vp like new plants, and haue accustomed
themselues to vertue, to the end, that through the tendernesse
of their youth they may not grow awry; Being therein like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
holpen, by the example of their betters; for there is not
any Artifice, so powerfull and effectuall, as that of imitation,
which I now speake of; for it being a cure so conformable
vnto nature, it will worke by degrees; whereof we shall not
know the benefit, till we haue enioyed it.</p>
                  <p>And because there are both diseased persons,<note place="margin">Chrysost. hom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19. in Gen.</note> and diseases
(as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath obserued) which are neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied
by sweet potions, nor purged away by bitter pills;
A maine reason whereof is, because they themselues are not
willing to be cured, nor will admit of the example of Kings,
nor the feare of their Lawes: it is fit this other remedie
should be vsed, of punishment and chastisement, without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation.
For many times the motiue of sinning is the faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of forgiuing. And it is a knowne case, that people by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
become obedient; but by pardoning, proud and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent.
The ill and vicious, are so possessed and inabled in
their vices, by their long continuance, that if Kings should
not shew some mettall and courage, they would possesse the
world, and carry all things away before them, in that violent
manner,<note place="margin">Bald. in l. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinoiarum C, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferijs.</note> that the good should not be able to liue amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
By chastising the bad, (saith <hi>Baldus)</hi> the good liue in safety.
And for this cause (and not in vaine) according to <hi>Plato,</hi> and
others, were Lawes instituted, and regall power, the stroke of
the sword, the discipline of the Clergie, and the common
hangmans whip, all of them as necessary for mans life, as those
4. Elements, by which we liue &amp; breathe. Let Kings take this
from me, and beleeue it, That that commonwealth is in great
danger, where the Kings reputation goes decaying; and the
force of Iustice looseth it's strength. For thereby vices as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
licence vnto themselues; and their owners perseuere,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:2459:204"/>
and go on in them. Here a remisse Prince is a sharpe sword,
and doth neuer more grieuously punish then when hee doth
most pardon. Punishment and chastisement onely offend the
delinquent; but remission, <hi>la ley, al Rey, y la Grey,</hi> the Law,
King, and people. By remission, Lawes and Kings grow in
contempt, and the whole commonwealth infected. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
by chastisement the Law is obeyed and kept; the King
feared and honoured; and the kingdome maintained in peace
and iustice. I doe not treat here of those cruell and rigorous
punishments which some seuere Iudges inflict, for remedies
and cures of so much rigour, are violent, and do sooner kill,
and make an end of their Subiects, then heale and recouer
them by little and little. Wherefore in point of correction, a
commonwealth must vse a great deale of caution and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
And for that hee who pretends by maine strength to
resist the furious current of a swift riuer; or by roughnesse, to
tame a head-strong horse, shall shew himselfe as insolent, as
impertinent; rigour with gentlenesse, and iustice with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
will doe well: which if they go not hand in hand, and
kisse each other, they are both but the occasion of greater
corruption. For it is an erronious discourse in those that
thinke, that publike conseruation consisteth in the execution
of cruell chastisements, and sharpe and rigorous sentences,
bee they of death or otherwise; For these doe rather dispeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and desolate, then correct and amend a kingdome. And
as it is a signe of bad Physitians, or of a corrupt and infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
aire, to see many fall sicke, and dye; so likewise is it of
carelesse Ministers, and ill preuention, and of a contagious
corruption of vices, and euill manners, when there are many
criminall iudgements, many punishments, and cruell cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements.
And who is he that knowes the principall cause
thereof? it may bee this, or it may bee that, or all together,
howsoeuer I am sure it is all ill. And in a word, so great, so
vniuersall, and so pernicious an ill, that if Christian Kings
carry not a very watchfull eye ouer their Subiects manners,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:2459:204"/>
in not suffering them to flie out, they shall not, when they
would, be able to refraine them, and remedie what is amisse;
for euill custome being once habituated (according vnto <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi>
and others) is an acquired nature, and engendreth an
habite, which being mans naturall inclination, carries him
along after it; and so great is his inclination to delights, and
so many the prouocations, and ill examples which draw him
thereunto, and poure oyle as it were vpon that fire, that if
there be not the more diligence and care vsed in the quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, it must necessarily spread it selfe abroad, and extend
it selfe daily more and more, and more especially into those
Cities and countries where there is much commerce and
trading in Merchandise, and in the Courts of Kings, where
there is such a concourse of diuerse and sundrie nations, there
being not any one of them which hath not it's proper and
peculiar vertues, as also it's proper and peculiar vices. Their
vertues men hardly take hold on; but their vices, those cleaue
easily vnto them of themselues: and by this their Commerce
and Trading, remaine engrauen in their hearts. And what
was before but an inclination, being now become a custome,
vice engendreth vice; and one appetite maketh way for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>Lycurgus</hi> saith, That it more importeth a State to see
that it's Cities bee not infected with the ill customes and
manners of Strangers, then to preserue them from the plague,
the pestilence, or other the like contagious diseases. For these,
Time asswageth and consumeth; but those, are with time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
and augmented. Three Embassadours of the Cretans,
each of them being of a different Sect, made their ioynt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into Rome. The Senate gaue them audience. And
<hi>Cato</hi> being there, whom (for his great authoritie) they did
much reuerence, and was indeed as an Oracle amongst them,
gaue his <hi>vote,</hi> and opinion, that hee would haue them d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht
thence with all possible speed, before the corruption
of their manners should corrupt the Romane Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="370" facs="tcp:2459:205"/>
This care ought Kings to take; and so much the rather,
for that they haue neuer a <hi>Cato,</hi> that will tell them; neuer a
Councellour that will aduise them, that in no kinde of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
nor vpon any occasion whatsoeuer, ought they either in
their Court, or kingdome, suffer any man (no though hee
be an Ambassadour) to reside there, being different in his
Religion, manners, and Ceremonies. For their treating and
conuersing with vs, serues to no other purpose, but to bring
in vices, and banish vertues, to worke vpon weake and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
mindes, and to draw the naturall Subiects of another
Prince, from Gods true worship, and due obseruance of his
diuine Law. And this was the care of the Ancients of those
times, who would neuer giue consent and allowance, that
there should bee any thing intertained or receiued into their
commonwealths, whereby mens mindes might grow cold,
or be withdrawne in any one point or tittle from the worship
and adoration of their Gods. And very fit for these times
were that Law of the Persians, which did punish him with
death, that should bring in any new vse, or strange custome.
And the Cretans, did in their ordinarie Letanies desire, that
no new custome might enter into their city, which is as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
disease, and cleaueth as close as the plague or pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
Nor did the Lawes of Egypt permit any new tune in
their Musicke, or any new kinde of song, vnlesse they were
first examined by those that were in place of gouernment.
For (as <hi>Plato</hi> affirmeth) a Commonwealth, as well as Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,<note place="margin">Plato Dial. 2. de Legibus.</note>
admitteth changes; And that for the auoiding of this
mischiefe, it ought not to be permitted, that there should be
introduced any new kinde of tunes, or Musicke, together
wherewith mens mindes receiue some change and alteration.
<hi>Aristotle</hi> did aduise those that would bee vertuous, that
they should not vse Musicke, nor musicall instruments, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
them to be vicious. For Musicke being a diuine gift, and
very powerfull to moue the hearts of men, and to perswade
the thing that is sung, if they accustome themselues to play
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:2459:205"/>
and sing holy lessons, &amp; honest songs, they therby accustome
themselues to be honest and vertuous. And therefore anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
your Kings, as <hi>Dauid,</hi> the Prophets, and Priests, the
better to apply themselues to contemplation, did vse Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,
wherewith they suspended their senses, and remained
as it were swallowed vp in God. In a word, many men haue
therewith beene robbed of their soules, and of their honours,
and daily much hurt doth ensue thereby. For it is able to doe
much, and greate is the force and power which it hath ouer
mens manners. And if you will not beleeue me, obserue but
the hurt, which your new wanton tunes, together with the
lasciuious wordes, and gesticulations vsed in them, haue
wrought of late amongst not onely the common, but better
sort of people.</p>
                  <p>Now to shut vp all that hath beene said in three points.
First of all I say, that it much importeth, that a Prince bee
good in himselfe; for that all men make their Imitation after
that patterne that hee sets before them. And for this cause,
God placed him in so high and eminent a place, to the end
that by the resplendour of his vertues, hee should giue light
to the whole kingdome; and that both by his life and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
he should exemplifie and indoctrinate his Subiects: for
it is not onely included in the name and office of King, to
rule and gouerne the kingdome by good and wholsome
Lawes, but likewise to teach and instruct the people by his
vertues. This ought to bee (say <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato)</hi> the end
and ayme of Kings, to direct their Subiects in the truth, they
practising it first themselues, which is the strongest and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciblest
argument to perswade it. For the execution of that
which is perswaded and commanded, doth secure the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
doth make the worke sauourie, and doth facilitate the
trouble. Secondly, to the end that the Lawes may bee the
better kept, Kings must obey, and keepe them; for it will
seeme an vniust thing in them, to establish and ordaine that,
which themselues will not keepe and obserue. They must
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:2459:206"/>
doe as <hi>Lycurgus</hi> did, who neuer enacted any thing which
he himselfe did not punctually performe. And it was a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Edict; <hi>Vse el Rey de la Ley, que hiziere para la grey:</hi>
Let the King that law keepe, which he makes for his sheepe.
Lastly, that they bee very carefull and watchfull ouer the
whole kingdome, but more particularly ouer the Court; for
from thence is diffused all the good, or ill; as likewise in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talling
the excesses of apparrell, the superfluities of feasts and
banquets, of gaming, of sports, and pastimes, of lightnesse
in behauiour, of licentiousnesse in courting of women, and of
those wastefull expences which might very well be excused,
in weddings, in iewells, and dressings both in the women and
the men. Then began Rome to grow ranke in Luxurie, and
prophanenesse, when your gilded bed-steds, your costly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilions,
your stately canopies, your ritch hangings, your cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
tables, your glorious cupboords of plate, your gybing
Iesters, and your various Instruments of Musicke were
brought in, which were then in great vse and request, for to
prouoke and stirre vp the appetite in those their tedious and
sumptuous suppers; as if, for to go to hell, there were neede
of such a wind-lace, or wheeling about, the way being (as it
is) so easie and direct, that a man may go it blindfold. Causes
all of them of iust feare, and fore-runners likewise of the
ruine and perdition of any Monarchy whatsoeuer, as they
haue beene heretofore of others that haue been ouerthrowne
by the like meanes.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude with this sense, and to shut vp the doore
likewise to all the rest; wee are to presuppose that, which is
very common both in diuine and humane Letters, That by
the hands, wherein particularly consists the Touching, are
vnderstood workes; because they are the Instruments by
which they are done, <hi>Moses</hi> deliuering vnto vs, that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes
did see the wonders which God had wrought in their
fauour,<note place="margin">Exod. 14. 31.</note> saith, <hi>Viderunt manum magnam, quam exercuerat
Dominus:</hi> They saw that great worke (which the originall
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:2459:206"/>
renders, that great hand) which the Lord exercised vpon the
Aegyptians.<note place="margin">Fier. lib. 35. Tit. Opus.</note> And besides this, it hath another signification (as
is obserued by <hi>Pierius Valerianus)</hi> an open hand, being the
Symbole of eloquence; expressing that efficacy, and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue
power that lies in well couched words. Works and
words being both very necessary in Kings, Execution in
the one; and Elocution in the other. And because all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
cannot performe these offices of doing and saying, by
themselues, they must haue another tongue, and other hands,
by which they must speake, and doe; and the tongue
whereby they must speake; and the hands, whereby they
must touch, and handle all things (for their owne are not
able to doe it) must bee their fauourites. <hi>Policratus,</hi> in his
booke directed to <hi>Traiane,</hi> saith, That your great Lords in
Court, and Kings fauourites, are the hands of the kingdome.
And, as in mans body, they are naturally disposed, and ready
prepared for to succour and assist all the other members; so
they should be at hand for to helpe and reliue all the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of the kingdome, and to be the formost in all dangers,
and a thousand other occasions that will offer themselues,
which neither are, nor can bee wanting to Kings and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
And therefore the Philosopher said of the hands, that
they are the Instrument of Instruments. For without them
nothing can be done; neither can Kings of themselues do all.
They haue need of their Ministers, and Fauourites, which
are their feet, and their hands. In the subsequent Chapters,
we shall discourse somewhat a little of them. God grant, that
little, or somewhat, what ere it bee, may worke some good.
And first of all we will treate, whether it be fitting to haue
Fauourites.</p>

of Kings, receiuing their forme
and fashion from their good liking;
which creatures of their making, wee
haue mentioned in the former Chapter.
We shall handsomely fall here vpon that
which in this is put to the question. Nor
is the answer thereunto very easie. For a
Fauourite being of the same nature, as a particular friend, and
friendship being to bee <hi>inter aequales,</hi> betweene those that are
of equall condition, it seemeth that those that are Subiects
and seruants to their King and Master can not hold it with
him; whom they are to behold, and treate with, with a great
deale of reuerence, respecting alwayes his royall Maiestie,
which (according to that other Poet) <hi>No cabe en vn saco con
el Amor;</hi> is not in one and the same sacke with loue. And
without loue, there is no friendship. True it is that <hi>Aristotle</hi>
and some other Philosophers affirme, that this difference
may easily bee reconciled, forasmuch as hee that is in the
higher and more eminent place, may stoope so low, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
himselfe in that euen measure to his Inferiour, that they
may both remaine vpon equall tearmes. But this can hardly
square and suite well with Kings towards their Fauourites.
For, as it were an <hi>indecorum,</hi> and vnseemely thing in a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
bodie, that the head should abase it selfe, and become
equall with the shoulder; so, were it prodigious and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous,
that Kings, which are Heads, and hold that Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie
which God hath giuen them, should stoope so low
to their Subiects, that the eminencie should not appeare
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:2459:207"/>
they haue ouer them. And that other meanes which may
be vsed in raysing a subiect, or Fauorite to that hight that hee
may be equall with his King, bringeth with that a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience.
For a Crowne &amp; Scepter royall, cannot endure
any fellowship with equality. And therefore these two
meanes may pare and fit well with friends, that hauing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
friendship, when their estates were equall, the one
growes inferiour to the other, eyther good fortune, or good
diligence, hauing preferred his fellow and friend. But with
Kings there cannot be held this correspondency and equality.
And it is King <hi>Salomons</hi> counsaill, who saith; That it is not
fitting for any man to entertaine friendship and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with those that are too mighty. <hi>Ditiori te, ne socius

that is mightier and richer then thy selfe. For how agree the
Kettle and the earthen Pot together? For, if the one bee
smitten against the other, it shall be broken. And againe, if
you will but diligently obserue the sacred history of the
Kings which were ouer Gods people, you shall there finde
little mention of Fauorites. On the other side, it will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
seeme vnreasonable, that kings should be debarr'd that,
without which (to all mens seeming) mans life cannot bee
well past ouer. <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>Nemo sine amicis, spectet viuere;</hi> (said the said
Philosopher) Let no man looke to liue without friends. And
the holy Scriptures are full of the commoditie, and benefit,
which faithfull friends afford, being as necessary for the life
of man, as fire, and water; and for no estate so important, as
for that of Kings, who for that they haue so many, so weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and so secret businesses, their estate were intollerable, and
more then they were able to beare, if they might not
haue the libertie of hauing friends, with whom they might
communicate, and by whom they might receiue some ease,
of those troubles, and care, which great offices (ordinarily)
bring with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:2459:208"/>
Now for to giue satisfaction vnto that which is here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be auerred, we are to consider, That <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and
other, both Philosophers and Diuines teach (which is
no more then what experience plainly prooues vnto vs)
That there are two sorts of Loue, or friendship; The one
Interessall, or <hi>cum foenore,</hi> whose end, is its proper profit.
The other hath with it a more gentile &amp; noble intent, which
is, to loue and wish well to that which deserueth to bee belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
and this is called <hi>Amor amicitiae,</hi> the loue of friendship.
The other, <hi>Amor concupiscentiae,</hi> the loue of concupiscence.
And with very good reason, for that therein there is not to be
found the face of true friendship. From these two Loues,
as from two diuerse rootes, spring forth two different sorts
of Fauorites. The one, who for their great parts and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
haue deserued to carry after them, not only the good
wills and affections of their equals, but euen of Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
And when these abilities are so extraordinary and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantagious,
no man can deeme it inconuenient that Kings
should more particularly, and in a more extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
apply their affection vnto them. Nay, it would rather
lay a spot and blemish vpon them, if notice should be taken,
that they equally entertaine all, or not esteeme and prize
them most that merit most to be esteemed. For in all good
reason; there is no greater inequality, then to equall all alike.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> said very well, That there is not any virtue of that
force and efficacie, for to catch and steale away mens hearts.
Nor herein doe we need the testimonies of Philosophers,
for the holy Ghost saith, <hi>Vt mors, est dilectio,</hi> loue is strong
as death. The coales thereof are coales of fire, which hath
a most vehement flame, it beares all away before it. And
in this its force and strength, friendship and loue are much
alike. And building on this ground, I say; That very well
there may be said to bee friendship betweene a King and a
Fauorite; for that their soules haue in their birth and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or (as I may say, their first originall) equall noblenesse.
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:2459:208"/>
And your noblest friendship proceeds from the soule. Very
famous and much celebrated was that friendship betwixt
Prince <hi>Ionathan</hi> (the onely heire of the kingdome) and that
worthy noble <hi>Dauid.</hi> And so great was the loue that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 18. 2.</note> that the sacred Scripture saith, That <hi>anima
Ionathae conglutinata erat animae Dauid, &amp; dilexit eum Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thas
quasi animam suam.</hi> The soule of <hi>Ionathan</hi> was knit with
the soule of <hi>Dauid;</hi> and that <hi>Ionathan</hi> loued him, as his owne
soule. And I further affirme, that it is very fit and conuenient
that Kings should loue those with aduantage, that haue the
aduantage of others in vertue, wisedome, and learning. And
such should be those, that serue and attend the persons of
Princes; for ordinarily, out of that Nursery are these plants
your Fauourites drawne. When <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> King of
Babilon, besieged and tooke by force of armes the Citie of
Ierusalem, he carried away from thence great spoiles of gold
and siluer; but that, which hee much more prized then all
this Treasure, were the sonnes of the chiefest Noblemen,
and such as were lineally descended of the Kings of that
kingdome; and gaue especiall order, that they should choose
and cull out those that had the best and ablest parts, both of
nature and acquisition; those that were of the best disposition,
the most learned, and best taught, to the end that being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with these good qualities, they might merit to
attend in the Court and Chamber of the King.<note place="margin">Dan. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the Kings palace. And this election fell out so luckily, and
proued to be of that profit and benefit, that amongst those
which (indewed with these qualities) were made choice of,
for to serue the King, there were three of them did excell,
but one more then all the rest, not onely in vertue, but in the
knowledge likewise of secret businesses, and matters of State
and gouernment, which was <hi>Daniel;</hi> who so well deserued
to be a Fauourite to those Kings of Babylon, and more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to <hi>Darius,</hi> that hee did not content himselfe with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him onely a priuie Councellour, but the prime man
amongst them. For hauing set ouer the kingdome an 120.
Princes, which should bee ouer the whole kingdome, and
ouer these, three Presidents (of whom, <hi>Daniell</hi> was first)
that the Princes might giue account vnto them, that the
King might haue no damage; And as hee was the greatest
Subiect and Fauourite in the world, so was hee superiour in
the vertues and qualities of his person. <hi>Igitur Daniel supera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat

The holy Scripture likewise tells vs, that <hi>Ioseph</hi> was such a

his owne seate, and haue a Crier go before to proclaime the

And <hi>Pharaoh</hi> said vnto <hi>Ioseph,</hi> I am <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and without

great industrie and wisedome, he freed that King and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from that terrible famine, besides those many other
great and troublesome imployments, wherein he was busied
for the space of seuen yeares together. In the fourth booke of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:2459:209"/>
Kings, we reade that <hi>Naaman,</hi> who was Captaine of the host
of the King of Syria, was the onely Fauourite of the King;

the reason of this his great priuacie with his King,

Because by him the Lord had giuen deliuerance vnto Syria;

A certaine Philosopher being taken captiue, was brought
forth into the open Market to bee sold, and they that were
to buy him, demanded of him, what hee could doe; He told
them, That the best thing that he was skild in, was, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his Masters. In many places of Scripture, is repeated
and confirmed the Testimonie of King <hi>Salomons</hi> great power
and wisedome; And amongst other things, which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
of the Maiestie of his house and Court, it is said;
That therein he had a great many Princes, whose names are
registred in the third booke of the Kings. And amongst them
there is but one onely that is made remarkable by the name
and title of the Kings Fauourite and friend. <hi>Zabud, filius Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
amicus Regis;</hi> And <hi>Zabud,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Nathan,</hi> was
principall Officer, and the Kings friend. Some Translations
in the place of principall Officer, put Priest. And these two
titles of Priest, and the Kings friend, are therefore thus ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together, that they may giue vs to vnderstand, that the
friendship and affection towards a Fauourite, should take it's
growth from that learning and vertue which is annexed to
the state and condition of the Priest. And in the first booke of
the Chronicles, in that Catalogue, which is there made of
those which bare principall offices in King <hi>Dauids</hi> Court,
it is onely said of <hi>Hushai</hi> the Archite, that hee was the Kings
companion. And in the second booke of the Kings, are set
downe at large the great and many reasons, why <hi>Hushai</hi> on
his part might well deserue this Title. Our Sauiour Christ
likewise seemed to make shew of his more particular affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <hi>Peter, Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> making choice of them from
among the twelue, to retire himselfe in priuate with them, and
to make them witnesses of his glorious transfiguration; and
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:2459:210"/>
afterwards of diuers other particular things. Whence it
seemeth that they might haue the name of Fauourites; but
not without great grounds, and those extraordinary vertues,
wherein they out-shined others. Howbeit the choise and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of this supreme King, is not to bee ruled and measured
out by that of the Kings of this world; for they can not by
the alone power of their loue better men, nor affoord them
necessary parts, whereby to merit to bee their friends. But
this true King and Lord of all, in placing his good will and
affection on those whom hee is pleased to make choice of for
his friends, doth likewise indow and adorne them with
strong abilities, whereby to bee accounted worthy of his
friendship and fauour. Whereas with the Fauourites of the
Kings of this world, it fareth cleane contrary. For those,
which before they were Fauourites, were good and honest,
by their priuacie, and great power with their King, haue
come to be starke nought; and the more footing they haue
in the Kings friendship, they are vsually the lesse worthy of
it. Whereof we shall more in the Chapter following.</p>

Saint <hi>Austen</hi> writ, <hi>De Ciuitate Dei,</hi>
lay before vs two sorts of loue: That loue
which man beareth vnto God, euen to
the contemning and despising of himselfe;
And from this is the constitution and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke
of that holy Citie of Ierusalem;
vnder which name, is vnderstood the good concord and
agreement of the Christian Church and commonwealth, as
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:2459:211"/>
also of all Christian soules. The other loue is that which
euery one beareth to himselfe, in that high manner and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
that it reacheth euen to the contemning and despising
of God. And from this is built that City of Babylon, which is
as much to say as Confusion; &amp; signifieth that, which euery
sinner hath within himself, as also that which is in ill ordered
commonwealths. And therefore (as wee said in the former
Chapter) that from those two Loues of friendship and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence,
did issue forth two sorts of Fauourites: The one
good and profitable; the other, bad and couetous: So, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Loue, not in respect of outward things, but in respect
of it selfe, it differenceth the vse of Fauourites, according to
the different meanes and ends, wherewith, and for which
they are made choice of: And the vse likewise, which they
make thereof, when they see they are thus aduanced, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
into fauour. The meanes haue the denomination of
their goodnesse, or badnesse, from their end. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
that when Kings shall make choice of their Fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
by good meanes, not out of a selfe-humour, or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manish
kinde of longing, nor for to please his owne proper
affection, but that they may comply the better with those
obligations, which they haue to the good dispatch of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

meanes likewise bee. For to obtaine good ends, bad meanes
are not taken. And therefore Kings shall doe well, in taking
such Fauourites vnto them, as shall bee sollicitous, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the dispatching of businesse, faithfull in their seruices,
and endowed with such parts afore specified, as were those
Fauourites, recommended vnto you in the former Chapter.
For <hi>Ioseph</hi> (as we told you) grew in fauour with King <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
for his great wisedome, and for his supernaturall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of things to come, and reuealing such secret mysteries
as other his Ministers could not tell what to make of them.
The like befell <hi>Daniel,</hi> with the Caldean, and Macedonian
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:2459:211"/>
Kings; for before euer he became a Fauourite, they saw his
great wisedome and constancie in the true seruice of his God,
his singular prudence, and those other his good gifts, which
are recorded in the booke of his prophesies. The extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
graces of <hi>Peter, Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> who is he that is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of them? Being that the Euangelists say of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>
that his extraordinary loue was examined, and proued in
those so often repeated questions: <hi>Petre amas me? Simon Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannis,
diligis me plus his?</hi> And againe, <hi>Simon Iohannis, amas
me?</hi> And the Apostle Saint <hi>Iames</hi> was the first of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
that by his bloud and death gaue testimonie of this his
loue. And Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> shewed no lesse, at his last Supper, at his
passion, and at the foote of the Crosse, hauing followed and
accompanied his Master euen to his death, when the rest fled
and forsooke him. But when Kings make not choice of their
Fauourites for the foresaid ends, and for the publike good,
but for their owne particular gusts and humours, and to let
loose the reines with more libertie and freedome to their
owne delights and pleasures, such kinde of Fauourites set
vsually before them the same ends, and commonly preferre
their owne priuate gustes and interests before those of their
Kings, or the publike good of the commonwealth, and come
to be the firebrands and destruction of States. This lesson the
holy Scripture doth likewise teach vs, whose mysteries are
so high and so deepe, that euen in that which it silenceth, it
speaketh vnto vs; and in saying little, instructeth much. I
haue much obserued that which is recounted in the History
of <hi>Esther,</hi> touching the priuacie of that proud and vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
<hi>Haman,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioseph. de An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. lib 1. cap. 6. 1. Reg. 15. 33.</note> whom King <hi>Assuerus</hi> raised from so low a
degree, and from so wicked a race, as he came of. For (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Iosephus)</hi> he descended from that Amalakite whom
the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> caused to be hewen in peeces. And for
that it is the condition of Kings, when they once begin to
fauour a man, to make him like froath to rise and swell, this
fauourite grew to that heighth through his Kings grace and
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:2459:212"/>
fauour, that all the Subiects of that Monarch respected him
as a God, and kneeled downe in his presence, his person
being much more adored, serued, and feared, then the Kings;
because the King had put the staffe (as they say) into his
hands, giuing him the absolute command ouer all his estates;
insomuch that neither in, nor out of Court, nor elsewhere,
was there ought done, but by the order of <hi>Haman;</hi> and the
King himselfe held him in the place of a father. And for that
Vanitie is the daughter of Pride, all this his great fauour and
priuacie with his Prince, did but make the more for his owne
hurt, as doth the Ants wings, for hers; or like those of <hi>Icarus,</hi>
which being of waxe, the nearer they came to the Sunne, the
sooner they melted, working then his death and downfall,
when he was at the highest. For <hi>Haman</hi> came to hang, and
dye on that gallowes which he had prouided for <hi>Mardoche,</hi>
and for no other offence in the world, but because he would
not bowe the knee vnto him, and adore him as the rest did.
So that (if you marke the Storie) <hi>Hamans</hi> owne greatnesse
and power was the axe, which did frame and hew out that
gallowes, whereon himselfe was hanged. And hauing often
thought with my selfe on this mans end, and considering
likewise the beginning of this his priuacie, I doe not finde,
that it was for the excellencie of his merits, or for any heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
vertues that were in him; such as were those which King
<hi>Pharaoh, Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> did consider in
those their Fauourites, which they made choice of, but for
some particular guste and liking, that his King tooke to him.
For the Scripture speakes not one word, nor maketh not any
the least mention of the merits of this Fauourite, nor of any
notable thing, that hee had done either for the good of the
kingdome, or the seruice of his King; but rather without

et adorabant Aman:</hi> King <hi>Assuerus</hi> did promote <hi>Haman</hi> the
sonne of <hi>Amedatha,</hi> the <hi>Agagite,</hi> and aduanced him, and
set his seate aboue all the Princes that were with him. And
all the Kings seruants, that were in the Kings gate, bowed,
and reuerenced <hi>Haman.</hi> And in this so true a relation, and so
fully setting forth the priuacie of this great Fauorite, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any foundation or ground of desert; the Scripture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
hath instructed vs, how inconsiderately this King did
proceed in the choice which he made. But he did correct this
his errour, by opening his eyes, and inflicting that punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vpon him which he deserued, and is there set downe.
I could wish that Fauourites would likewise open their eyes,
and consider with themselues, that the happines which they
hold, is but borrowed ware, lent vnto them but for a short
time, and that they neither vse, nor possesse it as their owne
proper good or inheritance. And being that by one meanes
or other, it must leaue them, that they would not wholly giue
themselues ouer thereunto; for it forsaketh few without their
finall ruine. Let them bire vpon this bit, and with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
thereof, bridle their pride and insolencie, lest (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
they flatter themselues) that hand may pull them
downe, which raised them vp. For there are some, which
will neuer be able to indure this their felicitie and happinesse,
but one way or other, will worke their ouerthrow, and make
them pay the price of their ambition at too deare a rate: Nay
the King himselfe will sometimes put to his helping hand,
as we see King <hi>Assuerus</hi> did, who after that hee had made
<hi>Haman</hi> his onely Fauourite, and raised him to that highth
of honour, as could not well bee more, turned his face from
him, and did so much distaste him, for his sower and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
behauiour, that for to make him stoope and hang the
head, he commanded him to be hanged vpon the same gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
that he had set vp for another, who had deserued well
both of the King and State. The Emperour <hi>Alexander</hi> did
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:2459:213"/>
the like, who waxing wearie of the arrogancie of one of his
Fauourites, and not being able longer to endure it, caused
him to be staked, and the stake to be set on the top of an high
hill; giuing him a death answerable to his vanitie. For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
Kings loue them, and in some sort acknowledge a
kinde of beholdingnesse, yet they vsually withdraw their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
quite from them, and are oftentimes ashamed of their
choice; whereunto being added the complaints of the people,
and other principall persons, offended with the iniuries offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vnto them, remoue that scandall, by remouing their Fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
and make them satisfaction by making him be punished,
neuer in this case aduising with any, nor so much as hearing
what the Fauourite in his owne discharge can say for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
for in such desperate cases, when things are brought to
that extremitie, Kings vse to take that course as your <hi>Prot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and skilfuller sort of Physitians doe with their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours;
who in weightie and vrgent occasions fall speedily to
worke themselues, without any further consultation; but in
ordinarie diseases, heare, resolue, and consult with others.
Againe, let Fauourites, for their learning, reade the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and peruse the generall booke of Time, and they shall
there finde a thousand of these examples, and other as many
faire warnings, worthy their sight and knowledge, for the
admonishing of men, for to feare their priuacie with Kings,
and to tremble at humane prosperitie, and the securitie
wherein they liue. And hee that shall diligently reade these
things, will seeke to come fairely off from these his high for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes

God, is deriued from a word, which
signifies to see. So that to say God, is to
say, Hee that sees. For, as the Apostle
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and faith teacheth vs; all is
subiect to Gods view; and vnto Kings,
who are his Lieutenants here vpon
earth, nothing can conuene so well with them, as to seéme
to the world, to haue so quicke and large a sight, that they
may see all whatsoeuer mans capacitie is able to reach vnto.
And because they cannot doe this alone by themselues, <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi>
said very well and wisely, that it was needfull, that
they should haue other eyes, whereunto to trust as much, as
vnto their owne, and to see as it were by spectacles; for Kings
are so vnhappy, that they cannot come to see all without
them. And those (as the same Philosopher said) are those
friends and Fauourites, who are to see, and know that which
passeth in the world, as also what is needfull in common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,
and to giue notice thereof vnto their Kings, and to
helpe them to ordaine, and execute that, which is fitting and
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:2459:214"/>
conuenient. And Fauourites being intertained (as we said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
for this end, and for the publike good of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
it is requisite that Kings should not haue one onely,
but many. One day, some about the person of <hi>Alexander</hi>
the Great, shewed him a maruellous faire Pomegranate, which
being cut in two, discouered a great company of kernels: and
one of them asking him, of what he would wish to haue such
store, as of those Pomegranate kernels which appeared vnto
him? He answered, that he would wish that hee might haue
so many <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>piri;</hi> This <hi>Zopirus</hi> being a Fauourite of his, and
one that was very faithfull vnto him, and of great abilities.
For, it is not contrary to royall greatnesse, to haue many, but
very necessary for the better dispatch of businesses. For if
they should passe onely through the hands of the Prince,
their dispatch would bee very slow, and subiect likewise to
many errours, whereinto they would ordinarily runne, for
want of their care and assistance. <hi>Darius,</hi> King of Persia, tooke
three Fauourites vnto him, to whom the rest of the Princes
rendered an account of all the affaires of the kingdome. And
from the beginning of the world, euen to this present time,
Kings haue had, some more, and others lesse. For this must
be regulated and ordered according to the greatnesse of the
kingdomes. For by how much the more they are in number
and greatnesse, so much the more increase haue those weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
affaires which are necessarily to haue their recourse to
their royall persons; and according to the measure of them,
is there an addition to be made of those, that are to assist and
attend businesses, to passe through all, to prouide for all, and
in all places. The people of Israel, when <hi>Moses</hi> gouerned
them, were all ioyntly together in one body in forme of an
Armie; and all that made not vp so much as a meane king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
and they remaining (as then they did) without pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions,
incamped in a desart, and being all Israelites, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
in all likelihood, that their ordinary businesses could
not be either so many, or so great, as those which are incident
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:2459:214"/>
to a King, who is Lord and Master of diuers kingdomes and
Prouinces, and of sundry seuerall Nations. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
that great Gouernour <hi>Moses,</hi> by negotiating from
morning vntill night, without diuerting himselfe, could not
giue conuenient dispatch vnto all, but was forced (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
specified) to take vnto him no lesse then seuenty assistants,
all chosen men, and endewed with those good qualities,
whereof we now treate. Let Kings therefore haue many for
to aide and helpe them, and let them be the Ministers of his
minde, and the Conducts whereby to conuay his will and
pleasure to his Subiects. For in the administration of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
affaires, it is euermore to bee indeauoured, that many
beare a part therein; As well for the common satisfaction,
that shall thereby be giuen vnto all; as also for that they may
be able to make the better account of all businesses, bee they
neuer so many. And likewise, for that few being instructed
and experienced in them, occasion may not bee giuen; that
(those failing) the commonwealth and publike gouernment
may thereby incurre any danger. This was <hi>Augustus</hi> his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
deliuered by <hi>Suetonius;</hi> which that he might the better
execute, and that his bounty might inlarge it selfe towards
the more persons; he inuented new publike Offices, wherein
to imploy them. But I do not speake this, as inferring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
that there should bee so many, but that at least (for the
foresaid reasons) there should bee some: And in conclusion,
more then one, because it will bee more easie to negotiate
with them, and lesse costly and troublesome; and bee a
meanes, that the Prince may be the better eased, and freed in
great part of those cares and troubles, which otherwise must
needs weary him out, and worke his vnrest and disquiet. For
his body is not made of brasse, nor can he occurre to all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions;
Besides, being more then one, their competition
will make them the more both carefull and fearefull: as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that in case they shall grow carelesse, there are persons
enough besides of sufficiencie to supply their place; Whereas
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:2459:215"/>
the opinion and conceit of the contrary, puffes him vp with
pride, and vndoes it's Master. For they fondly and foolishly
perswade themselues, that their King and Master cannot liue
and subsist without the assistance of their wit, and that there
is not that fault they commit, but must be forgiuen them, out
of the necessitie of their seruice. Forgetting in the meane
while, that their King may imagine them to bee dead, and
how that in such a case, though it grieue him, yet must hee
prouide himselfe of others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let Kings therefore bee beaten
from this their errour, for he that shall otherwise aduise them,
and seeke to be the onely man in their fauour and seruice, and
take vnto himselfe both the right side and the left, thrusting
all others from thence, and gouerning both high and low,
letting nothing escape his fingers, which hee pretendeth out
of the necessary vse of his person, and so absolutely to become
Master of their wills, and to haue that hand ouer their Kings,
that they must not looke vpon any, but with their Fauorites
eyes; such a Fauourite (I say) pretends to tyrannize a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and by little and little will go crushing the Princes of
the bloud, the ancient Nobilitie, and such as are of power to
stand in their way, thrusting this man out of Court to day,
and that other to morrow, that hee alone may rule all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any contradiction or opposition in the world. Let euery
man say or thinke as they list, for mine owne part I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that this is his maine end and drift; And the cause
thereof is his feare of falling; knowing (besides his owne
consciousnes) that there are not onely one or two, but many
in Court, that are able to supply his place, and farre better
deseruing then himselfe. Your Alchymists make gold: But
how? Onely in the colour; they will not let it come to the
Touch, nor any other reall Essay; neither will they endure to
haue it compared with any other minerall gold, for feare lest
it should bee discouered, that theirs hath no more but a bare
shew and apparence. Let Princes therefore assure themselues,
that those Fauourites are but Alchimists, that will not admit
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:2459:215"/>
of any other companie, as being priuie to themselues, that
their vnderstanding is not such pure gold, that it can abide
the Touch, nor any reall Essay. But say it should passe for
currant, and that their mindes were all made of pure gold,
me thinkes they should aduise and consider with themselues,
that those that are ingenious and wise men, will therefore the
rather desire that there should be many: for, by comparing
the one with the other, the true light shineth the more, and
makes it selfe knowne whether it be so or no. And onely your
fooles, and such as are vnworthy of that they possesse, are
iealous of that good, which they feare to loose, when by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
they shall come to be knowne. God did not in vaine
place so many members in mans bodie, and most of them
double; had it not beene thereby to teach vs, that many are
needfull in humane actions: and that one is not able to doe
all, without an infinite deale of toyle, extraordinary spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his spirits, and the sudden wasting and consuming of
his body. And here will suite very well to this our purpose,
that which <hi>Tiberius</hi> affirmed, when feigning not to bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to accept of the Empire, hee said, (going about the bush
to discouer the mindes of the Romane Nobilitie, and Senate)
that he alone of himselfe, was not sufficient, nor yet with the
helpe of another, for so great a gouernment. Whereupon, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustius
Crispus</hi> taking his Qu, a great Fauourite of his, starts
mee vp, and makes me a long <hi>Harenga,</hi> or artificiall oration;
shewing that Signiorie and Empire could not well consist,
without being conferred vpon one particular person (which
is the maine foundation and ground-worke of the good and
safetie of a Monarchicall gouernment) and that therein him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
(if no body else would take the paines) would bee as it
were another <hi>Ioseph,</hi> his faithfull Vice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gerent: lest the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of things, depending on the will of many, it might
cause a distraction in businesses, either by way of competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or of passion. In conclusion, after <hi>Tiberius</hi> had heard
this, and had throughly sounded their mindes, he took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:2459:216"/>
to tell them, That in such a Citie as Rome was, sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and vpheld by so many and such illustrious persons, it
was not fit that the businesses of State should be remitted to
one man alone, for many would much more easily execute
the offices and affaires of the commonwealth by a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
of the burthen. For, as vnitie in some degrees is both
profitable and pleasing; so in other some it is hatefull, and
preiudiciall. And therefore, (out of this consideration) I say,
That a King, as the supreme person, and principall Head of
a kingdome, ought to be one alone. For the couetousnesse of
ruling being insatiable, and the nature of power incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
it is not possible that two Princes of equall authoritie
should continue any long time, but both of them suffer in the
end, or at least the businesses that are committed to their
charge. But for Fauourites, there may bee two, or three, or
more, the vnitie remaining reserued for the greater and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premer
person. And likewise this pluralitie will not be much
amisse; for if any one of them shall by some accident faile,
there be others, whom the King knoweth, and they know
him, that are fit for his seruice, and that haue good experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and knowledge of businesses, and all such matters as are
current and passable in the commonwealth, without being
driuen to seeke out new Ministers, or to instruct them what
to doe in a time of necessitie, when things go not well, but
stand in ill Tearmes, laying otherwise hold on the first that
offer themselues vnto them, to the ouerthrowing of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
in hand, and the proper hurt and dammage of their
Lord and Master; at whose cost and by meere erring in great
matters, they must come to get their learning. Let Kings (a
Gods name) reserue for themselues those businesses that are
of greatest importance (for in this likewise must there bee a
setled course and order) as is in all well gouerned kingdomes.
Referring (as we said before) to the ordinary Councells and
Tribunalls, ordinary businesses, consulting with their Kings
those that are of most importance; And these Kings by
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:2459:216"/>
themselues (as before mentioned) ought to dispatch, if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they be not hindered by default of their health, and not
to remit and referre them to their Fauourites; who, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Iustice (were it but distributiue) should haue no lande
of power. For thereby they oppresse those Tribunalls and
seates of iustice, together with their Ministers and Officers,
who, for that they know, they must haue much dependancy
on the Fauourite; if he shall haue a hand in Courts of Iustice,
and distribution of Offices, cannot but remaine much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
and debarred of their libertie, and the more, if they
haue any pretension for their owne interest, or increasing of
their estate and honour. And the reason of all this will plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeare, if wee will but weigh those words of the wise
man;<note place="margin">Prou. 8. 15.</note>

the particular fauour which God giues to the lawfull Kings
and Gouernours of their kingdomes and commonwealths,
to hit right in that which appertaineth vnto gouernment.
And therefore was it well said of that wise King <hi>Salomon;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 16. 10.</note>
                  <hi>Diuinatio in labijs Regis, in iudicio, non errabit os eius:</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie
is in the lippes of the King; his mouth shall not go
wrong in iudgement. And your Diuines are of opinion, that
Kings haue more helpe and aide from their Angels of guard,
then other men haue. And besides all this, the publike pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
that are poured forth throughout all their kingdomes and
Prouinces, are of most great vse for Gods illightning of their
vnderstanding. And therefore for these reasons aforesaid, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
your Fauourites and more secret Councellours of
State may be very learned and wise vnderstanding men, yet
is there a great deale of reason, why in graue and weightie
causes, they should craue and attend their Kings opinion;
esteeming it as the more certaine, being it comes from a head,
so much fauoured by God, and so well assisted and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
on all sides. Which doth not concurre in Fauourites;
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:2459:217"/>
for God hath not made that promise vnto them, as he hath
vnto Kings; nor (peraduenture) doe they deserue it. And if
he bee the sole and onely Fauourite, much lesse can hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,
that either his opinion or paines can be greater or surer
then that of so many learned Councellours and Councells,
that haue met and sate thereupon, and haue spent so much
time and studie in State-affaires. Nor is it to bee imagined,
that when Councellours doe consult, and craue their Kings
opinion and resolution, that they doe it to that end, that they
should receiue it from another inferiour person; whom let
Kings loue them neuer so much, or conferre all that they
can vpon them, they cannot giue them more vnderstanding,
or more knowledge, nor a better minde and disposition, then
what they haue already; for this is reserued for God onely,
as also it properly belongeth vnto him to giue light vnto
Kings, that they may giue a fitting and direct answer to that
point wherein they are consulted, who alwayes supplyes
them with that knowledge which is needfull for them, if they
shall but begge it at his hands, and make good vse thereof.
Hence are two things inferred, which are very sure and true.
The first, That Kings are bound in conscience to attend in
their owne person graue and weightie businesses; for that
this is their principall office; which is euidently proued by
this reason. Whosoeuer beares an Office, and hath salarie for
the same, is thereby obliged to cumply fully therewith, <hi>Sub
poena peccati,</hi> vpon penaltie of sinning. And by so much the
more grieuous shall the sinne be, by how much the greater
is the Office, and by how much the more the stipend is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.
Now Kings (you will confesse vnto me) haue the
greater office, and greater stipend in all things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shall they more grieuously sinne, if they do not cumply
therewith. And this is made good in the sixth of Wisedome,
wherein these very words it is expresly said: <hi>Potentes poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
tormenta patientur;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wisd. 6. 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; fortioribus fortior instat cruciatio:</hi>
A sharpe punishment shall be to them that be in high places;
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:2459:217"/>
and the mighty shall bee mightily tormented. The second;
That Fauourites are obliged, on paine of the said penaltie, to
serue their Kings in their owne persons well and faithfully
in those businesses, which they shall commit to their charge;
and that in taking their pleasure and ease, more then their
Kings themselues, and substituting others to performe that
trust and charge which is put vpon them, they cannot iustly
enioy that authoritie, nor those interests and profits which
doe result from their priuacie. And let they themselues tell
me, what title they haue to enioy so much as they doe, when
they take lesse paines then their Kings, but pleasure more?
And to conclude with that which is here questioned in this
Chapter, I say, That admitting Fauourites, to bee such as
they ought to be, it is fit notwithstanding that there should
be more then one, or two. For thereby Kings shall haue the
more helpe, and out of that emulation and zeale, which is
wont to bee amongst them, each of them will striue to bee
more considerate and better aduised in commanding others,
and in begging and applying things to himselfe, and his
owne priuate profit, and more solicitous in doing seruice to
the State, lest others might get the start of him in his Kings
fauour. And howbeit the name of fauourite seemeth not to
indure a companion, yet, if they fixe their eyes on that which
they ought, which is the common good of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and the seruice of their Kings, it would neuer grieue
them, that there should bee others to assist for the same end
and purpose; but like that great Fauourite and friend of God,
<hi>Moses,</hi> they would say, <hi>Vtinam omnes prophetarent:</hi> Would
to God they did all prophecie.</p>

admit betwixt the King and his subiect, a certaine kinde of
friendship, howbeit and disparitie and inequalitie bee very
great, your Histories doe celebrate the friendships of great
Princes, held with their particular subiects. And those which
with other their equalls are called faithfull friends; with
Kings, carry the name of Loyall-Subiects. Which (for that
effect which wee pretend) importeth little this altering or
changing of the name. That which most importeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueneth
most, is, That we giue you some notice of those qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:2459:218"/>
which they ought to haue, and of those signes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
those may be knowne, that are fittest and best for so great
a Ministery.</p>
               <p>There are two qualities amongst the rest, which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
necessarie in a Fauourite. And first I will set downe the
first. First of all then he must loue his King truly, and must
not suffer himselfe to be ouercome by couetousnesse, and his
owne priuate interest. In the first particular, all doe agree
with <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Plato.</hi> For no man can more faithfully giue
counsell, then hee that loues his King more then his gifts.
Which of all other is the most necessary to make one man
trust another, and to beleeue that which hee saith. For who
will not credit that man whom he knowes loues him, and in
all that he can, seekes to procure his good, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to his owne particular interest? He (saith Saint <hi>Gregory)</hi>
that is fit to be a Fauourite, must haue a loue that is full, and
dis-interessed.<note place="margin">Gregor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

This qualitie of Loue and friendship, <hi>Nazianzene</hi> likewise
handleth.<note place="margin">Part. 2. Tit. 9. L. 5.</note> And a certaine Law of the <hi>Partida</hi> maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>de buen seso:</hi> That those,
that are to counsell Kings, must bee friends that haue beene
throughly knowne and tried, and that are of good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and iudgement. <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, That hee is a true
Fauourite indeed, that studies to walke in cleannesse of heart,
and purenesse of tongue; that is to say, when hee shall place
all his care in seruing his King with Loue; and informing
him nothing but what is truth, and desiring him to walke in
that way, which shall make most for Gods seruice, and the
good of the kingdome; Qualities sufficient for Fauourites to
insinuate themselues into the grace and fauour of good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> in the Apocalypse, sets before vs (though
somewhat darkly shadowed) a picture of good Fauourites
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:2459:219"/>
and Councellers. Which were certaine old men, clothed in
white, wearing Crownes on their heads. To bee somewhat
ancient, and well stricken in yeares, was a qualitie wont to
be required in those that were to aduise Kings, and giue them
good counsell, in regard of their great experience and mature
iudgement, which commonly accompanies such kinde of
men. And they are said to be clothed in white, because this
colour signifies a pure heart, and a cleare conscience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they ought to bee as it were apparrelled and adorned.
How can he giue good counsell that is not clothed in white?
That hath not <hi>Cor candidum,</hi> a white and vpright heart,
pure and cleane from those affections and passions that may
smu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t and sullye it? And it is there likewise set downe, that
euery one of them had like a King, a Crowne vpon his head.
To giue vs thereby to vnderstand, that hee that is to giue
counsell vnto Kings, for the maintaining and vpholding of a
kingdome, and to remedy what is therein amisse, may in some
sort conceit himselfe to be a King; my meaning is, that he is
to giue counsell, as if hee himselfe were the King, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
for him, as he would for himselfe, were he in his place.
And that hee is to giue his vote and opinion, as if the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
were his. And to be so free from expecting or respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his owne particular interest, as if he were King himselfe.
Who neither expecteth nor pretendeth any merced, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
nor any addition of honour, or otherwise in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
for that hee hath already attained to the highest and
supremest dignitie, which is the Crowne. In like manner,
Kings Fauourites, and Counsellours should liue as free from
pretensions, as if (hauing already got the Crowne) they had
nothing more to pretend. Whose breast and bosome must
be as white and as pure as whitenesse it selfe And will be the
better able to iudge betwixt white and blacke, right and
wrong, by reason of their many yeares, and long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
               <p>This kinde of seruants and friends, which must be the life
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:2459:219"/>
and soule of their actions; let Kings bee very carefull how
they make choice of them, and receiue them into fauour. For
there is not any one thing, that doth so much manifest a
Kings minde, as the election which he makes of his Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
and Councellours of State. For by them is his naturall
inclination as well knowne, as in a workeman, by his manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,
is discouered the Art and Trade whereunto hee is
most inclined. And therefore I shall make bold to aduise
Kings, that they make such their Fauourites, that are men of
worth, wise, prudent, dis-interessed, and of a noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
disposition. For by their choice, men make iudgement
of their King accordingly. And likewise when the Kings
grace and fauour shall fall vpon good Subiects, his owne
glory will be the greater. Let Kings (laying aside all affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
choose such as are men of knowledge and experience,
and that are powerfull in perswading, and disswading. That
know how to go in and out, with good satisfaction, amidst
those so many, so diuers, and such important businesses, as
daily offer themselues; and to giue good, subtill, and graue
answers, both by word of mouth, and by writing, to such
Ambassadours, and other great persons, that shall come to
treate and negociate with them. That haue seene and read
much, and haue a generall knowledge in all things, but more
particularly in the countries and Prouinces that are vnder
their Kings command. That know what forces they are able
to make, and to vnderstand the strength as well of their
friends, as of their foes. Let them be of a franke and liberall
minde. For this vertue the common people much loue and
affect, and are wonderfully well satisfied therewith. And on
the contrary, couetousnesse is much hated and abhorred by
them. Let them (I say) bee bountifull, and desirous to doe
good to all in common, and to euery one in particular. In a
word, let them be men well knowne to be faithfull and trusty,
and such as loue their Kings so well, as that they will preferre
their authoritie and reputation before their owne, and studie
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:2459:220"/>
and endeuour in all, and aboue all, what may make most for
their good and aduantage. That they be wise, discreet, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced,
patient, without passion, disinteressed, and more
zealous of the publike good, then of their priuate profit. For
if they shall regard their owne interest and proper commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie,
they are neither good for the seruice of their Kings, nor
for the gouernment of the commonwealth. For, in going
about to measure out their priuacie by the yard of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
profit, they will make merchandise of all; and their
doing good to others, shall bee for the benefiting of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Nothing comming vnder their hands, whereof (that
they may not be accounted bad Cookes) they will not licke
their owne fingers. The clingenst and strongest affection,
is that of couetousnesse; it is like the head<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the free vse of mans faculties and senses, not suffering
him to doe any thing that is good. And though it bee true,
that there are other vices, of greater offence to God, and
more hurtfull to a mans neighbour, yet this hath I know not
what mischiefe in it, and more particularly in publike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
which doth shew it selfe more openly then all the rest,
and doth breede, and nourish other sinnes, as the roote

The Philosopher <hi>Her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>litus</hi> saith, That those that
serue Vanity and Couetousnesse, suddenly depart from Truth
and Iustice; and hold that onely for iust and most right,
which is directed aright to their owne priuate interest. And
this onely doe they make their aime, in all whatsoeuer they
aduise their King; as was to be seene in that so often repeated
case of King <hi>Assuerus,</hi> with his great Fauourite <hi>Amann<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> of
whom hee demanded, what grace and fauour should bee

to honour. Whereupon, the winde of vaine-glory wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in the head of him, and thinking this could be no man,
but himselfe, shewed himselfe very magnificent and liberall
in ordaining the honours and fauours, that were to be done
vnto him. The vaine conceit of a couetous man, cuts out for
himselfe large thongs out of another mans leather. And when
hee growes a little warme in the King his Masters bosome
(poore snake as hee was) with a false and feigned loue, hee
goes hunting after his commoditie; and this failing, his loue
also faileth. For his heart stretcheth it selfe no farther to loue,
then what his hands c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Michah</hi> bids vs beware.<note place="margin">Micah 7. 6.</note> For no friend, that seeketh his owne
gaine,<note place="margin">Arist. lib. 8. Ethic. cap. 4.</note> can euer (according vnto <hi>Aristotle)</hi> be faithfull and
loyall to his King. Let Kings (I say) consider once againe,
and haue an especiall care, that those Fauourites, whom hee
maketh choice of for his friends, be out of his owne proper
election, and approued by his owne minde, and by the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and fame of their vertue, and not intertaining them at
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:2459:221"/>
any time by the sole intercession of others, especially such as
are great and powerfull, nor let them suffer themselues to be
carried away with the secret considerations of those familiar
and particular persons which are about them, nor by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuating
and soothing perswasions of your flatterers and
Sycophants; Who, as they are men, worke vpon discourse,
and corporall meanes, altogether framing them in order to
their owne ends; Let them not giue beliefe and credit vnto
them, but to the common fame and good report that goes of
them; and thereon, let them place their eares and their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
For (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith) that is it which vsually
makes the best choice. For it is not to bee doubted, but that
concerning such a ones vertues or goodnesse, we ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to giue credit to the generall report, then to the voices of
one or two. For one, may easily bee deceiued, and deceiue
others by his tricks, and his particular interest; but neuer
yet could one deceiue all; nor is it possible, that all should
in that their approbation, deceiue another. As for those other
seruants, which are to attend and waight vpon the Kings
person, more for dignitie of place, and for outward appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and ostentation of greatnesse, then for vse and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie,
which likewise in their kinde are very necessarie; let
Kings a Gods name receiue them into their seruice, either
vpon the intercession of others, or out of other particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.
For in this, there is little hazard, and may easily chop
and change them, if they proue not good and fit for their
turne. But in the choice of the former a great deale of care
must be taken, for the chopp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng and changing of them is very
dangerous, and vnlesse there be very great cause for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, it breeds an opinion of inconstancie; which as it
cannot but be hurtfull vnto all, so is it of great dishonour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Kings, much weakening their authoritie. But say there be
iust cause of remouing them, why it is but as a Vomite;
which howbeit it be true, that it remoueth the malignant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and expells it from the stomacke, yet withall it carries
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:2459:221"/>
the good likewise away with it, and makes an end of that
Subiect it works vpon, if it be too often vsed. For our horses
wee seeke bits and bridles, wherewith to make them to go
well and handsomely, and if with those they do not raigne,
and carry themselues according to our mind, we take others;
and when we finde once that they are fitted as wee would
haue them, we neuer chop nor change, but still vse the same.
In like manner, it is not good to chop and change either Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourites,
or priuie Councellours too often, but to seeke out
such as are fit for their turne, and to carry such a hand ouer
them, as to bridle their insolencie, and to reyne them in hard,
if they finde them head-strong. For being that they are those
horses which guide the chariot of a Monarchie, if they bee
not well bridled, of a gentle and tender mouth, and an easie
reyne, they will play the iades, and breake both their owne
neckes and their Masters. In a word, euery King hath, or at
least representeth two persons, one publike, the other priuate.
And therefore his actions ought likewise to be of two qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.
In those that are particular, let them proceed therein
as they will themselues, according to their owne guste and
pleasure; but in those that are publike, as shall make most for
the publike good. Hauing still an eye to it's conseruation and
augmentation; and to the common approbation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
And those qualities, which formerly wee required in
Councellers of State, wee here likewise conclude, that all of
them are necessary for Fauourites. And if Kings peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(in regard of humane imperfection) cannot meete with
men so perfect, let them bee as absolute, as they can possibly
light vpon; at least, let them haue these two qualities, of loue,
and an vnspotted life; And let not Kings content themselues
that they haue them in a mediocritie, but in all perfection.
For without these two, there are not any <hi>Statuas</hi> so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
as are such men, being not good enough to be slaues,
or to serue in the basest and vilest offices about a house, much
more vnworthy to be Fauourites, and priuie Councellours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:2459:222"/>
And because the heart of man, which God hath hid out
of sight, to the end that he might reserue it to bee the seate
and mansion of his loue, is hard to bee knowne, and the
thoughts thereof very secret and hid; for that by one and the
same instruments, it worketh and expresseth it's conceits, be
they false, or be they true, it is necessary that by some meanes
the truth or deceit of it's words may be knowne, for to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
thereby the true loue from the false. Amongst other
signes and coniectures whereof Kings may make vse, for to
know the minde of those that are to hold so great and neare
a place about their persons, and to treate and communicate
with them as it were the secrets of their soules; let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
and obserue very well, in what kinde of manner they
do proceed, and haue proceeded with those with whom they
haue formerly held friendship, and to whom they stand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
and obliged for curtesies already done; if they shall
see they carry themselues well towards them, and performe
all offices of true loue and friendship, then may they be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to beleeue, that shewing themselues louing and thankfull
to others, they will be so towards them. And he that loueth
not him, whom hee ought to loue, out of this or that other
respect, will not loue his King, do he neuer so much for him.
For this difference of more or lesse altereth not the substance
nor condition. The true loue of Fauourites (they being such
as they ought to be) consisteth (as we said already) in louing
their King dis-interessedly, and to aduertile him of all that,
which is fitting and conuenient for him, and that all, or the
most desire, that in their workes and actions for their greater
perfection, there should be credit and estimation; And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
of all that which (according to the more common opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
requireth reformation and amendment (for onely the
workes of the most high can be wholly inculpable) And of
that which may in some sort withdraw his Subiects loue
from him, and aduising him thereof, worke so with him for
to gratifie them in this or that publike benefit, whereby to
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:2459:222"/>
wedge the peoples loue the faster vnto their Prince and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne.
But false and feigned loue, that runnes a contrarie
course; it alwayes hunts after it's owne commoditie, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
all, whatsoeuer his Prince doth; he excuseth it in
his presence, and qualifies it for good, iust, and conuenient.
Which being no other but a tricke of Court-cunning, and
though they may well march vnder the standard of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
enemies, yet are they esteemed and rewarded as
friends. And notwithstanding all this, their Kings backe is
no sooner turned, but they murmure at him, or set others a
worke to doe it for them; Complaining, that in regard of the
naturall ill disposition of Kings and great Princes eares (fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
enough to heare smooth flatteries, but too harsh and
hard to hearken to the truth) they dare not for their liues
tell it him, not aduenture to giue him the least distaste, though
it concerne him neuer so neare, and that they plainly see, the
not doing of it cannot but redound much to his hurt. And the
true reason thereof is, for that the former, loue more the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their Prince, then his fortune, and let him take it ill or
well, all's one, they will treate truth, especially in those things
that may concerne his safetie, or the good and quiet of his
kingdome; and their good minde, true heart, and plaine-ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
meaning, make them bold to speake, without fearing to
offend, in that their good aduice, which they shall giue him.
But this second sort of Fauourites loue not his person, but
his fortune; And these, for their owne proper interest, and
that they may not hazard their hopes, dare not speake the
truth, though they see the danger before their eyes: as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that would easily alter their faith and loyaltie, and take
part with him whose sword is strongest, and therefore
care not though their King fall, so as they may stand. And
of such, it may bee suspected that they desire a change, like
those which in gaming liue by <hi>Baratos,</hi> who for their owne
benefit would haue fortune turne from the one to the other,
their good wishes no longer following their first man, as not
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:2459:223"/>
hoping to haue any more from him, then what they haue
already receiued; not caring to see them blowne vp, one after
another, so as they may get by the bargaine. And most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it is, that those who so much loue themselues, and their
owne proper interest, there is no trusting of them; for they
haue no loue left either for their owne Lord and Master, or
any body else. For such base soules, and vngenerate spirits,
drowned and swallowed vp in those muddy materialls of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and Auarice, cannot loue any other thing with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie,
and in a noble fashion. And therefore it importeth
much, that Fauourites bee dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>roabed, and stript quite and
cleane of all that, which goes vnder the name of proper or
selfe-loue, priuate interest, vsefull friendship, faction or kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred;
and that they should bee clothed with a wise and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
kinde of goodnesse, which nor knowes, nor can, nor
will fauour ought, but vertue, and Iustice, and that which is
good and honest. It is likewise spoken by way of Prouerbe,
<hi>Quien ama à su Rey, ama à su grey:</hi> He that loues his King,
loues his flocke. And he that is in the place of a Fauourite,
and so neare about his Kings person, ought to bee as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
father to all his Subiects, treating them as if they were
his children, and procuring that not any one of them may
depart discontented from his presence, which would be the
the onely Load-stone to draw all their loue and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him. So did that great Fauourite of the King of Syria,
<hi>Naaman,</hi> whom all the people with a full and open mouth,
called Father, corresponding with him in the loue of so many
sonnes, or children. For those that are seated in so high a
place, haue great cause, for many reasons, to procure pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
loue; and, together with the grace of their Prince, to
haue the good wills and affections of the people; for this,
makes the other to be more durable and firme. For this is the
naturall miserie of great and powerfull persons, that Enuie
and Greatnesse go alwayes hand in hand: the one still accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying
the other. And there is not any poyson like vnto it,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:2459:223"/>
which moues and stirres vp such violent pangs and passions
in the stomacke, and more especially if it worke vpon the
priuacie and inwardnesse of Fauourites with their Kings, as
if that it selfe were not a true and sufficient strong poyson.
Seeing that it is held for certaine, that one word of a King,
nay (which is more) one angry looke, or bended brow, hath
sent many a Fauourite to his graue. For (as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith)
the life of the Subiect depends on the countenance of the
King. And if we will not beleeue him, let vs see and obserue
how many Fauourites escape, which doe not dye of that
wound, or the feare thereof; and more particularly with those
Kings which are of that condition (as one said) that there is
not two fingers breadth betweene their smile and their
sword; to the end that this their priuacie might bee had in
the lesse esteeme. For your best Fauourites are but like your
better sort of fruits, which are soonest subiect to be worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten.
For Enuie is a very worme, and hath the same quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as a worme hath; and spreads it selfe so farre, that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
it selfe euen to those that haue beene benefited by the
Fauourite; the couetousnesse and risentment of that which
they doe not receiue, working more vpon them then the
Law of thankfulnesse, or of a gratefull acknowledgement for
that, which they haue receiued. So that wee may say, That
few are they who loue those from whose hand they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
some good, because it was no greater. And those that
haue receiued none, that they are therein iniured, and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
So, that to qualifie and temper this inconuenience, it shall
be wisedome in Fauourites (and it will concerne them to vse
all the meanes they can deuise to effect it) to procure to bee
wellbeloued. And no lesse in Kings to seeke out such as are
modest, louing, affable, vertuous, honest, well beloued, and
of a gratefull and thankfull disposition.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or to resolue this Question, and to giue
satisfaction to that which is here propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in this Chapter, it being a matter of
so tender and dangerous a touch: I will
first lay for my foundation, a true point
of doctrine in naturall Philosophie, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
with that sentence of the glorious
Saint <hi>Austen; Amor meus, pondus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
illo feror, quocunque feror:</hi> The plummet which peaseth
man, and the wings wherewith the heart makes it's flight, is
loue, which doth leade the dance to all the other passions of
the soule. And as those that saile in a deepe sea, with full sailes,
runne on their course without any danger; but when they
draw neare the shore, they take them downe and ruffle them
that they may not runne their ship vpon some shelfe, or split
it selfe against some rocke; so likewise, when the heart is lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vp vnto the loue of God, which is infinite goodnesse, it
may without perill plough the seas of this world, and with
full sayles cut the Maine, without danger of shelues, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,
or rockes. For (according to that saying of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Saint <hi>Bernard)</hi> as the cause of our louing God, is God
himselfe: so, the measure of louing him, is to loue him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
measure. <hi>Causa diligendi Deum, Deus est; modus dilectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,
sine modo diligere.</hi> As the cause of our loue is infinite; so
must it be without taxe or limitation, wherein there can be
no excesse. But when the heart drawes but little water, and
touches too close vpon these things of the earth, which haue
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:2459:224"/>
their goodnesse much limited, it will be high time, and very
fit and conuenient, to strike the sayles of our loue, and to go
on with a great deale of caution and consideration, lest this
our vessell should sticke in the sands, neuer to bee gotten out
againe, or fall vpon some rocke or other of vnaduisednesse
and indiscretion. And this is so certaine a truth, that albeit
the loue to our parents be so naturall, and obligatory, and so
giuen vs in charge by God, with the promises of so many
blessings on those children which shall cumply with this
loue, and with so many threatnings on those that shall faile
therein; yet notwithstanding God himselfe will, that therein
there should be a limitation and moderation.<note place="margin">Mat. 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

loueth father or mother more then me, is not worthy of me.
And the common old Adage saith, That friendship must go
no further then <hi>vsque ad ar as,</hi> and stop there. And howbeit
some would haue the limit, which is here put to loue, to be
Death; I say, that it's limit, is Reason, and obedience to Gods
Commandements. For when our Loue shall come to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with them, it is to make a stand, and go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Our second ground or foundation whereon we shall build,
is this, That in Kings, next vnto the loue of God, and his
Christian Religion, no loue ought to be like vnto that, which
they ought to beare vnto their kingdomes and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths;
for the end, for which Kings were first instituted
and ordained, was the common good of their kingdomes.
And as children haue a naturall obligation to loue their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
because from them, they haue receiued their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
being; so Kings owe the like to their kingdomes, and
Commonwealths, because next vnder God, they gaue
them their being of Kings, and that power and authoritie,
whereby they were to protect, defend, and augment them.
Vpon these grounds and foundations must that loue and
friendship be laid, which is to be held with Fauourites. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:2459:225"/>
them, and giuing them power and authoritie, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to that, which for this end shall be thought most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient.<note place="margin">Senec. lib. 1.</note>
For albeit they (as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith) keepe the key of
their Kings heart,<note place="margin">Epist. 3.</note> and in matters of secresie and benefits, are
preferred before the rest; yet this must be done with a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
kinde of prudence and discretion. Hauing euermore an
especiall care, that the force of his loue be not so violent, and
so boundlesse, that to giue content to one sole Fauourite, hee
discontent all the rest of his Subiects; and to shew himselfe
faithfull and true vnto him, breake that faith and truth,
which he owes vnto God, and his diuine Law. And that he
proceed likewise therein with that freedome and libertie, that
his Loue may not passe the bounds of reason, nor bee (like
some ships that are runne on ground) so surely setled, that he
cannot get off when hee will, and to turne that loue into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
and a full determination and resolution of punishment,
when the faults of a Fauourite shall deserue his iust displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<hi>Non habitabit in medio domus meae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 101. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>qui facit superbiam,
&amp;c.</hi> Whoso hath a proud looke, and an high stomacke, I
will not suffer him. Mine eyes looke vnto such, as be faithfull
in the land, that they may dwell with mee. And whoso lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
a godly life, he shall be my seruant; but there shall no
deceitfull person dwell in my house. And he that telleth lies
shall not tarry in my sight. As likewise it is iust and meete,
that on the contrary, hatred, punishment, and chastisement,
should be turned into amitie, loue, and friendship, when the
person hated, shall deserue well. And this is the meaning of
that ancient Prouerbe, <hi>Ama, tanquam osurus &amp; odio habe,
tanquam amaturus.</hi> The drift and scope of all which is this;
That when wee shall place our loue and affection vpon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
things, it be done with aduisednesse, considering how
subiect they are to change and alteration. So that, that which
to day deserues our loue, may to morrow deserue our hate:
And on the contrary, that which is disliked and abhorred,
may merit our loue, and good esteeme. And we haue hereof a
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:2459:225"/>
very good example in the foresaid King <hi>Assuerus,</hi> who so
soone turned that loue which he bare vnto <hi>Haman,</hi> into that
hatred, that hee caused him to be hanged vp; and <hi>Mardoche,</hi>
that was condemned to the gallowes, he raised vnto honour,
and put him into that place of priuacie and greatnesse, which
proud <hi>Haman</hi> so lately enioyed. Nor can Fauourites haue
cause to complaine, if it be granted vnto them, that their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacie
may reach so farre, that their Kings may loue them, as
they do their owne royall persons. But it is a doctrine recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by all the Philosophers, That the rule of that true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and loue, which one man beareth vnto another, is to be
measured and considered by that which euery man beares
vnto himselfe. And that which equalls it selfe in this, is very
perfect loue.<note place="margin">Aug. lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> (saith Saint <hi>Paul) animam suam
odio habet, sed nutrit, &amp; fouet eam:</hi> No man euer yet hated
his owne flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it. And yet
notwithstanding this selfe-loue ought so to bee ordered by
reason, that whensoeuer it shall desire any thing contrarie
thereunto, it must sharply be denyed it. <hi>A criter reijciendus
est</hi> (saith the learned Saint <hi>Chrisostome)</hi> In like manner, when
Fauourites shall craue or desire any thing contrary to reason,
or the publike good of the commonwealth, they must bee
denyed, what they demand, and Kings vpon those occasions
must shew themselues seuere and austere towards them. And
this doctrine is so cleare and so plaine, that our Sauiour
Christ left it for a patterne vnto Princes, in that answer of his
which he gaue vnto his two kinsmen and Fauourites, <hi>Iohn</hi>
and <hi>Iames,</hi> when hee told them; <hi>Nescitis, quid petatis; Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
is bibere calicem? &amp;c.</hi> Ye know not what ye aske. Can ye
drinke of the cup, &amp;c. <hi>Non est meum dare vobis, sed quibus

                  <note place="margin">Mark. 20. 37.</note> To sit on my right hand, and on
my left hand, is not mine to giue, but it shall bee giuen vnto
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:2459:226"/>
them, for whom it is prepared. And how beit the words in
this answer haue so many sundry expositions, and diuers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
as the Interpreters vpon this place doe render;
yet haue I noted three things therein, worthy the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and of much conueniencie for Kings. In the first place,
I obserue the tartnesse and sharpnesse of the answer, together
with the ill-aduised and indiscreete request of those two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourites,
set downe in these three words: <hi>Nescitis quid petatis:</hi>
Ye know not what ye aske. And when Fauourites shall not
weigh and consider with themselues, what, and how they
aske; Let Kings bethinke themselues, what, and how they
giue. And let them not giue so much to one, as may giue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to all the rest to murmure, and complaine. And let
them likewise take into their consideration, that the common
condition of your Fauourites, is like vnto that of other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
men, still to desire to better themselues in their estate
and degree. And therefore it shall bee a great point of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
not to grant vnto them all that they shall aske; as here
our Sauiour Christ aduiseth Kings. Wotting well, that
though they grant them their request, yet are they not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
therewith, but rather take heart and courage vnto
them to craue more and more, and with greater earnestnesse
then they did before. For, Ambition and Couetousnesse are
not satisfied, nor slackened with abundance, but are like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those that are sicke of the Dropsie, who the more they
drinke, the more they thirst. And besides this heaping of
honour vpon honour, and gift vpon gift, hath a greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
with it, in regard of those persons that receiue them. For
most certaine it is, that the appetite of man is Hydropicall,
which the more he drinketh, the more he thirsteth; and the
more he getteth, the more he desireth. And Princes may giue
so much, that like Lucifer, they may come at last to couet
and desire that, which their Kings possesse. What an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
creature was he, and of what singular parts, yet did he
rebell against his Creator, out of Enuie and Pride, and onely
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:2459:226"/>
occasioned through those many graces and fauours which
God had enriched him withall. And for that we are all of vs
creatures, the like may be feared from vs; Being that we are
not so incapable of this, as was that Angell of that which hee
desired. And it is fit, that wee should leaue our selues some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to giue; for ordinarily we do all of vs desire (a qualitie
wherewith mans appetite is well acquainted) and which hath
caused the greatest and the foulest falls. For who is he, that
would not (if he could) haue command, and be a King? And
wee ought likewise to keepe something in our hands to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow,
that we may not grow weary of seruing, being we can
expect no further fauours, nor looke for any more rewards.
For this also is very naturall, and a fashion of ancient stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with most men, to waxe weary of standing at a stay, not
contenting themselues to continue that grace, place, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
which they haue already acquired; but hold that for
an affront, being now growne rich, which before they would
haue taken for a great fauour, when they were poore. Thus
doe we grow vnthankfull; and thus doe we grow forgetfull,
being vainly carried away with the conceit of what we are.
And we loose the sight of that low and meane estate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we were, by being raised to that highth and eminencie,
wherein wee see our selues to bee seated. A naturall fault in
mans eye-sight, which knowes not how to looke downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
and as vnwilling to looke backward, but as much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
as you will. But these forward birds, doe well deserue
to haue the waxe, wherewith their wings are fastened, to be
melted by that very Sunne, that gaue them their first warmth
and light, and by their fall to be left an example to the world,
to terrifie others. And in case, for some especiall respect,
Kings shall resolue with themselues, that all the beames of
their greatnesse shall illighten and giue life to one particular
person, let the foundation of their fauours bee layed vpon
those qualities, desarts, and seruices, which ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
on those persons on whom they purpose thus to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularize.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:2459:227"/>
Kings likewise are to consider the Petitions of those that
sue vnto them; which is my second obseruation, and taught
by Christ himselfe:<note place="margin">Mark. 10. 38.</note> 
                  <hi>Potestis bibere calicem, quem ego bibiturus
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m?</hi> Can ye drinke of the cup that I drinke of? Iudging
by himselfe, in this demand which hee makes to these his
Fauourites, who so rashly and vnaduisedly came vnto him to
petition him for the two principall places, that for to possesse
them, they should haue all sufficient and requisite necessaries;
vpon which point Christ examines them; and the like exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
ought Kings to make of those qualities, specified
by vs, touching both Pretenders and Fauourites.</p>
               <p>The third thing which I recommend to your considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and which Christ teacheth Kings, is, the great caution
and warinesse which they are to vse, in not being too facile,
in granting all that their Fauourites shall require of them.
Which is to bee gathered out of the last words of this his
answer: <hi>Non est meum dare vobis:</hi> It is not mine to giue.
Which, to my seeming, soundeth thus; It will not stand
with my truth and iustice, to giue for kindreds-sake, or other
humane respects, that which my eternall Father hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for those which deserue best. Kings ought to bee very
circumspect in promising, and not ouer easie in granting; for,
if he shall be facile in granting what others shall desire, hee
may haue cause to repent himselfe; and if he promiseth, hee
looseth his liberty. A great gentleman of qualitie, whom
King <hi>Philip</hi> the second much fauoured for his worthy parts,
and great abilities, talking one day with him, and walking a
good while with his Maiestie, after that hee had discoursed
with him of diuers things, to the Kings so great good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and liking, that hee thought with himselfe, that there
was now a faire occasion offered vnto him, to propound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him (as he did) a businesse of his owne. He told a friend of
his, anon after that hee came from him, that in that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
he proposed it, he cast such a strange and austere looke
towards him, as if hee had neuer seene him before. Which
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:2459:227"/>
was no want of affection in the King towards him, for hee
had had many sufficient testimonies thereof; but because it
was fitting for so wise and prudent a King to haue that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection,
lest this his affection might minister occasion
vnto him to call his discretion in question, in granting, or not
granting that which either is not, or at least shall seeme vnto
him, not to be conuenient for him. For Kings must haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to these two things; To haue a good and safe consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
with God, and intire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>horitie, and good opinion with
men. For with none doth that holy and prudent counsell of
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> suite more properly,<note place="margin">2. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 11.</note> then with them; <hi>Prouidemus
bona, non solum coram Deo, sed etiam coram hominibus:</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding
for honest things, not onely in the sight of the Lord,
but in the sight of men. Which cannot be, when as Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
either doe all what they list of themselues, or get their
Kings to doe it for them. When the Sensitiue appetite ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth
whatsoeuer it affecteth, the vnderstanding (which is
the soules king) remaines oppressed and disgraced, and with
that soule note, which the kingly Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> giues it;
<hi>Homo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 49. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>cum in honore esset, non intellexit, comparatus est iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis
insipientibus &amp; similis factus est illis:</hi> Man being in
honour hath no vnderstanding, he is like the beasts that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.
And therefore when Kings out of their particular affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or for the auoiding of trouble, and the fuller inioying
of their ease and pleasure, shall giue absolute power to their
Fauourites to doe and vndoe, as they please, presently one
blot or other (which they will hardly euer get out) will bee
laid vpon their royall persons. Nor need wee here to relate
the hurt which comes thereby, and the occasion which it
giues vnto the Subiects, neither to thnke nor speake of their
Princes with that respect which is fitting; especially when
the Fauourites are none of those which helpe to beare the
weight and burthen of businesses, but shake them off from
their owne shoulders, and lay them vpon other that are fitted
to their hand, and of whom they rest well assured, that they
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:2459:228"/>
will doe nothing but what they will haue them to doe, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
their will and pleasure in all that they are able. And
this is not that which Kings and Commonwealths need: but
it much importeth, that their Fauourites should bee of that
good and quicke dispatch in businesses, that all the people
might loue them for it; for from the contrary great inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
are wont to arise. When the <hi>Shechemites</hi> were so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly
and vnciuill in their language against their King
<hi>Abimilech,</hi> amongst other things which they vttered and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
against him, they said this in scorne of him; <hi>Nunquid

that he should be made Prince, as it were, ouer all the
people of <hi>Hemor</hi> and <hi>Sichem.</hi> And howbeit the naturall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,
which Subiects owe to their Kings, is so great, that
they are bound to obey them in all that which is not against
God; And that it is a token of great noblenes, to suffer with a
good courage, whatsoeuer burthens, be they neuer so heauy,
which they lay vpon them; yet notwithstanding they haue
no such obligation to their Fauorites. For they may, for their
pleasure, or their profit, substitute other their Fauourites, and
oblige the people, that they either negociate with, or buy
out their negociation of them. The History of King <hi>Don
Iuan</hi> the second of Castile, doth affoord sufficient examples of
the great persecutions that followed, by letting that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourite
haue so great a hand in businesses. For the people
seeing their King so led by the nose, as it were, and to yeeld
to all that he would haue him doe, were verily perswaded
that he was bewitch't; for he had such power ouer the will &amp;
vnderstanding of the King, that he neither vnderstood what
he gaue, nor knew not how, or at least had not the face to
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:2459:228"/>
deny him any thing, that hee was willing either to aske, or
take; whilst like the vnthankfull yuie, he went sucking away
all the iuyce and sappe of the tree, all that good Kings wealth
and substance, his being, his authoritie, and little lesse then
his kingdome. And lost by this meanes so much of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
that some of the <hi>Grandes</hi> of the kingdome, and the

betooke them to their Armes, and made warre against
him; he seeing himselfe vpon some occasions disobeyed by
his sonne and Prince, and forsaken of his wife and Queene.
Whereupon grew many ciuill broyles, and all vnder the title
and pretext of recouering their libertie, and of pulling their
neckes from vnder the yoke of that slauery and subiection
wherein they were, rendering that reason in their excuse,
which all the whole kingdome could but take notice of, That
all businesses past through his Fauourites hands, and that the
King did not negociate in his owne person. The prosecution
whereof I remit to those Histories that make mention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And it cannot bee denyed, that this Fauourite notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
had many good things in him, that might very
well deserue his Kings loue; for he had serued him valiantly
in great and vrgent occasions, and had put his person and
life in perill for his sake. But as his priuacie and fauour went
increasing, so with it increased his ambition and couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and that in that high degree, that he grew hatefull to
the whole kingdome; and in the end no lesse odious to the
King himselfe: who comming at length vnto himselfe, fell
into the account of those damages and losses, which he had
receiued in his kingdome, both in his reputation and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
by putting the reines wholly into his hands, taking
thereby too much libertie to himselfe, and ruling the State as
he listed. The <hi>Grandes</hi> represented to his Maiestie the abuses
that insued thereupon, as the ingrossing of the greater Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and selling of the lesser, and ouerswaying the Courts of
Iustice; And vsing many other effectuall perswasions, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:2459:229"/>
vpon other iust complaints, proposing for remedie and
redresse thereof, the interest &amp; profit that might accrew vnto
him, by calling him to account, and that he might thereby
get into his hands an infinite deale of treasure; the King liked
very well of their propositions, and admitting their reasons,
he fell off from his Fauourite, waging warre against him with
his owne money, wherewith hee thought, if neede should
serue, to sustaine and vphold himselfe. This slippery footing
haue all those things which haue not their hold-fast in God.
For they turne to the hurt of those that put their trust in
them. And it is his mercie to mankinde, that they should pay
for it in this life, howsoeuer they speed in the life to come;
which we will leaue to Gods iustice, and the strict account
that will be taken of them. In conclusion, this great Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
dyed, being fallen from his priuacie with his Prince, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued
of all that wealth and treasure which he had so gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
scraped together, ending his life with a great deale of
sorrow and discontent, and to the great reioycing of his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites.
Though this did not serue for a warning to those
that came after him, but without feare of the like terrible and
desperate falls, they ranne themselues out of breath in the
pursuite of the like priuacie.<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 29.</note> Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> (we know)
was Christs great Fauourite; and the Gospell stiles him to
be <hi>Amicus Sponsi,</hi> the friend of the Bridegroome. But his
great goodnesse and holinesse of life did the more gloriously
shew it selfe in this, that by how much the more Christ did
in-greaten and authorize him, by so much the more did hee
lessen and humiliate himselfe; and laboured by all possible
meanes, by diminishing his owne, to increase the authoritie
and credit of his Lord and Master, saying, <hi>Illum oportet cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
me autem minui:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 30.</note>
He must increase, but I must decrease.
And this is that glasse wherein the Fauourites of Kings are
to looke; taking into their consideration, that by how much
the more they seeke to greaten themselues, in making osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of their power and authoritie; by so much the more
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:2459:229"/>
they lessen and dis-authorise that of their Kings, with whom,
is so dangerous any whatsoeuer shew, or shadow, of equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
or competition, that euen in the highest top of priuacie,
the more certaine, and lesse reparable, vsually, is the fall. How
iocond, and how well contented went <hi>Haman</hi> out of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
when Queene <hi>Esther</hi> inuited him to dine with the King
and her selfe. When loe, the very next day after they draggd
him from that banquet and royall Table to the gallowes.
And therefore let no man trust or relye on the fauour of
Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be he neuer so rich, or neuer so fortunate; for in them
it is ordinarily seene, that all these faire shewes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
conuerted into manifest demonstrations of hatred.</p>
               <p>Out of all this that hitherto hath beene said, let Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
make vnto themselues this vse and instruction, to know
the danger and slipperinesse of the place wherein they stand,
euen then when they finde themselues most of all inthroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.
For most true is that saying, of, <hi>Fulmen petit culmen;</hi>
The highest Towers, and the highest hills are most of all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to <hi>Ioues</hi> thunder-bolts, and lightning. And let Kings
likewise take this into their consideration by way of aduice,
That when they shall haue found their Fauourites to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with those qualities before specified, and that they are
such, that thereby they may merit their grace and fauour, and
so great, both place and part in their heart, it stands with very
good reason, that they shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d bee honoured by them with
particular mercedes and fauours, because they helpe them to
beare the burthen of their cares, and are exposed to great
dangers, and greater enuyings; as it happened to that great
Fauourite of the King of Persia, whom the Princes of his
kingdome did pretend to remoue from the Kings elbow, and
to put him in the denne amidst the Lions, that by them hee
might be there rent in peeces. Whereof, no other cause could
be found against him, but his Kings fauour, bearing enuie to
his priuacie (that common Moath to high places) from which
none, be he neuer so good, neuer so honest, can escape. For,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:2459:230"/>
it is very naturall in men to risent, that hee should out-strip
them, who but yesterday was their fellow and companion.
They hold that honour for an iniurie, that is done to their
equall, and thinke themselues go backward, and loose of their
authoritie and reputation, if another bee preferred before
them. Which is such an offence, that God presently takes
notice of it, and passeth it not ouer without punishment.
For this priuacie with Kings is a thing of his disposing, and
for such ends as hee pretends; and there is not any Subiect,
that rises to such great place, but that he must passe through
the weights and ballance of his diuine prouidence, who
chooseth these, and refuseth those, vsing them as meanes to
worke his secret ends.<note place="margin">Prou. 29. 26.</note> Many (saith <hi>Salomon)</hi> seeke the Rulers
fauour, but euery mans iudgement commeth from the Lord.
The election comes from God, it is not so much the King,
that chooseth them, as God, who moues his heart thereunto.
And if he do vphold them with his powerfull hand, in vaine
is it for others to go about to trippe vp their heeles. For (as

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His place requireth that we auerre that,
which amongst discreet persons, and
such as are zealous of the common
good, is vsually called in question, and
made a doubt: To wit, whether or no,
it be inconuenient, that the Kinsfolke,
friends, and followers of Kings Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
should bee put into places of Office and Gouernment?
For, it cannot but seeme an vnreasonable thing, that those
who haue such parts and qualities as well deserue to bee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in such places of charge and command, should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
onely and <hi>eo nomine,</hi> bee excluded from them, for that
they haue alliance and friendship with the said Fauourites.
Being that this, in it selfe, is not ill. Besides the loue and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which Kings beare vnto their Fauourites, cannot
(like your bad-made-clothes) so shrinke vpon themselues, or
be so straight-laced, that it shall not likewise extend it selfe to
the friends and allyes of those, to whom they professe so
much loue. Againe, a good, if not a greater part of these
mens happinesse and content, consisteth in being able to do
good, and to raise their friends.</p>
               <p>But for the better satisfying of this doubt, it is fit that we
should first consider and distinguish of the qualitie of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of this Alliance and friendship with those Fauourites, as
also of the condition and qualitie of those offices. For in your
offices there are some of grace, and some of Iustice. In the
distribution of the former, we are to looke no further then
to grace, and the Kings good will and pleasure. In the latter
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:2459:231"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:2459:232"/>
to that distribution which is agreeable to distributiue Iustice.
There is likewise a great difference in the persons. For some
are of better qualities and desarts, then other some. And
these are in all prouisions that are made to be first preferred,
be they, or be they not, of kinne and acquaintance with the
Fauourites. And there are many good reasons that make for
their part. Others there are, that are inferiour in merit, and
the foresaid qualities; and these in no wise, may or ought to
be preferred for the kindred or friendship which they hold
with Fauourites. For it were a sinne of accepting of persons,
which is contrary to distributiue Iustice. Others there are,
that are euery way equall with the rest of the pretenders; and
on this Hinge, hangs the force of the Question. Now if they
shall stand in this equalitie, and vpon these equall tearmes
with the rest, in those qualities that are fitting for Office, it
seemeth that they should receiue some wrong, in being exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
without any fault of theirs; For it is no fault, to bee the
friend or kinsman of a Fauourite. To this doubt, the answer
would be made the more difficult, if your Fauourites through
their too much ambition and couetousnesse had not taught
vs the great inconueniences which result in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
by opening this doore vnto them, and conferring
the said Offices on their friends and Allyes, vnder colour and
pretext that they are as well deseruing as others. First of all,
for that Kings, as Shepherds and common parents of the
whole Commonwealth, are to make a distribution of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and of wealth, equally reparting and diuiding them,
in that indifferent manner, that they may reach to all houses
and families, or at least to extend t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>em as farre as they are
able. Like a good Husbandman, who, that hee may haue a
good and plentifull crop, throwes and scatters his seed on
this side, and that side, and euery where. Secondly, for that
it is a very odious thing, and which breedeth bad bloud, and
ingendreth ill humours in those who onely in regard of this
their kindred and friendship, see themselues depriued and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:2459:232"/>
of that, which they might otherwise challenge by
desert. And others on the other side, when they see that they
can neither come to be kinsmen, nor friends, nor of familiar
acquaintance with Fauourites (which are the references that
must preferre them) the first nature hauing denyed it them;
the other their bad fortune, or the Fauourites disaffection,
seeing themselues hopelesse of all helpe and remedie, either
they runne themselues headlong into some desperate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
or at least fall to flagge in their vertue; either of which
cannot choose but bee of great inconuenience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
Thirdly, for that it is not fitting, that Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
should come to be very powerfull, either in their owne
proper wealth and substance, or in the greatnes and strength
of their friends and Allies. For the more they increase in
these, the more doe their Kings decrease; and sometimes it
hath beene seene to grow to that excesse, that powerfull Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
haue seene, or at least imagined themselues to be of lesser
power then they could haue wisht it, or had beene need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to haue repressed, and cut short the ambitious wings,
and high flowne insolencies of their Fauourites. Fourthly,
for that vnder this colour, occasion might bee giuen to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourites
to dispose in such sort of the gouernment of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
that Kings should not come to the knowledge of
ought that passeth in them, be it good or bad, more then shall
stand with the good liking of their Fauourites, and make
most for their owne ends. So that, neither those that are
wronged, shall finde meanes to bee righted; nor those that
are zealous of the common good, and of their Kings autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
and reputation, be admitted to aduertise and giue notice
vnto him, of that which doth most concerne him. For Kings,
by reason of their retirednesse, cannot come to the full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of all that passeth. One of the things wherewith they
charged that great Fauourite of King <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> in that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
which they pronounced against him, was, That hee
had put into the offices of the Kings house, and without his
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:2459:233"/>
house, and in places of gouernment, persons that were tyed
and wedged to his house, either by see-tayle, or by friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
I referre my selfe to that, which the sentence saith, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in the person of King <hi>Don Iuan</hi> the second. And it is
not to be doubted, that when Fauourites shall wholly apply
themselues to seaze vpon all the Ports, thereby to know all,
and so to stoppe vp all the doores and passages, that none
can come to negociate with their Kings, but by their hands,
it is no other but a binding of their Kings hands, and to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
them with a palliated and cloaked kinde of tyranny,
with relation to their priuate Interest. And because from our
very first entrance into this our discourse, our purpose was to
confirme whatsoeuer we proposed, by the testimonies of holy
Scripture, to the end that no man vpon any false presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall,
should so much as surmise, or thinke, that we go about to
tread too neare vpon the heeles of Fauourites, I will likewise
remit my selfe in this particular, to that Letter registred in
the Scripture, which that great King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> wrote to
all the Dukes and Princes, and to all his vassalls of 127. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces
of his kingdomes, wherein with indeared reason hee
propoundeth the insolencies and tyrannies, exercised by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourites,
who vsing amisse the fauours and mercedes, which
their Kings doe them, seeke to carry all things before them,
with a high hand. And for that the holy Ghost would haue
all this set down in the sacred History, we may here very well
intersert some part thereof, which is well worthy the noting,

Princes, the more proud they are waxen; And indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to hurt not our Subiects onely, but not being able to
beare abundance, doe take in hand to practise also against
those that doe them good. And take not onely thankfulnesse
from among men, but also lifted vp with the glorious words
of lewd persons, that were neuer good, they thinke to escape
the iustice of God, that seeth all things, and hateth euill. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:2459:233"/>
also, the faire speech of our friends put in trust to
mannage the affaires, haue caused many that are in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to bee partakers of innocent bloud, and hath inwrapped
them in remedilesse calamities. Beguiling with the falsehood
and deceit of their lewd disposition, the innocencie and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Princes, &amp;c. And it oftentimes commeth to passe,
that the good actions and intentions of Kings are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and the light of their Iustice eclipsed, by the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of some terrestriall bodie, which doth darken the glory
thereof, as the interuention of the earth, obscureth the Sunne.
And the publike misfortunes which befall the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and the particular wrongs and iniustices, which men
by this meanes must indure, euen vnder the raigne of a iust
and religious King, make his Empire hatefull; for it is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
property incident to the vulgar, when any misfortune
shall befall a State, to remoue the blame from themselues, and
to lay the fault vpon those that are of greater ranke and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
But to returne to our intended purpose, I say, That in
the Offices of Iustice (I meane) wherein distributiue Iustice
requireth consideration of merit, way is not to bee giuen to
the friends and kinsfolke of Fauourites, but respect rather
to bee bad to the common good, wherein is to bee vsed the
fore-specified warinesse and circumspection. And in such
sort may the risentment and complaints of the kingdome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
that howbeit the said friends and kinsmen, should in
their abilities haue the aduantage of others, yet ought they
to be excluded. For this reason, in point of weale publike, is
of more weight and consequence, then any sufficiencie what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
in those other pretenders. Marry, in those other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which we call Offices of grace, (for that they neither
haue the administration of Iustice, nor gouernment, the
hand may be stretched out in a freer manner vnto those that
haue any reference of amitie or alliance vnto Fauourites. But
these offices are but few, and of no great importance; and in
case an exact consideration should bee had, there being not
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:2459:234"/>
that office, bee it neuer so small, wherein a man shall not
meete with some opposites and pretenders, wee must not be
too hasty, but hold the hand awhile, that fitting prouision
might be made according to the qualities and merits of the
person. One, that was a principall Councellour of State, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
a certaine graue and worthy person, that he being <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calde
de Corte,</hi> the common hangmans office fell voide, and
that hee was so earnestly sued vnto, and such intercessions
therein vsed, that he was faigne to make two, the better to
cumply with his owne obligation, and their importunitie.
And of the Catholicke Queene <hi>Donna Isabel,</hi> it is said, That
when she gouerned the State, together with King <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando,</hi>
her husband, there fell by chance a paper from forth
her sleeue, wherein shee had written with her owne hand;
Let the Cryars place of such a Citie be bestowed vpon such
a one, for that he hath the best voice. And if in so meane an
office, these Catholicke and prudent Princes had such great
care and respect to the qualities of the persons; what care
ought there to bee had in those of Iustice and gouernment?
What in Ecclesiasticall dignities, which are the pillars of our
sacred Religion? When the day of that strict and rigorous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
shall come, which God shall require at their hands,
they will then see how much this did import them.</p>
               <p>Let then the finall resolution of this question be, That
supposing that the naturall inclination of Fauourites, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
all, and that those that are nearest vnto them, for what
respect soeuer it be, are to bee preferred vnto Honours and
Offices, I will not straighten them so much, nor my words,
and counsell, and seeme to be too much republike, and intire,
in condemning all their actions; for that it hath been a thing
alwayes permitted to those that are put in such high places.
But I would not haue it passe for a rule, in the prouision of
publike offices, through which haue past such persons as
well vnderstood what belonged to State affaires, and the
conseruation of Kings, and their kingdomes, and that were
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:2459:234"/>
complete in all kinde of good learning and knowledge; who
witting, that those, who had power with their Kings, would
fauour those that were theirs, out of that inclination which
is common to all men, haue not stickt to say, that this may
be done, but with this consideration, that it bee not to the
hurt of the commonwealth. For there is not that ground,
plant, or man, so barren, but hath some vertue in it, and is
good for some Ministrie or other. In confirmation whereof,
wee are likewise to consider, that in naturall things, there is
not any so vile, and so base, which alwayes, and at all times
is vnprofitable. And there are some cases, wherein Experience
hath taught the profit, that may be taken therefro, for the
vse and conseruation of mans life. And on the other side,
there is nothing so precious, so estimable, and so wholsome,
which is alwayes, and at all times, profitable. For there are
some, as also some infirmities, which would proue mortall,
should they bee applyed vnto them. And therefore mans
prudence doth come to consist in this, to know it's qualitie,
and to vnderstand aright the estate and complexion of the
man, and according thereunto to make vse thereof, and of it's
vertue. And therefore hee that hath (by his Kings fauour)
the supreme disposall of all, let him consider and know, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by himselfe, or by others that are his confident friends,
(being as free, as free may bee, from naturall affections) the
dispositions and inclinations of men, and together with this,
the qualitie of the offices, and persons, which are to gouerne,
and bee gouerned; and let him imply euery one in that, for
which hee shall bee found fit and good. And keeping this
course, he shall cumply with his owne inclination, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
desires. And shall therein do his King and countrey good
seruice. But for a conclusion and vpshot of all that is past, let
those aduertisements serue, which follow in the subsequent
Chapter.</p>

that he be Lord of many kingdomes, if

any other. Which aduise (amongst many other good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions)
the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth gaue likewise vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the King his Sonne, to wit, That he should be a very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
louer of Truth; That hee should not giue himselfe ouer
vnto Idlenesse; And that he should alwayes shew himselfe a
free and independant King; not onely in apparence, but in
substance. For it is very proper vnto Kings to rule, not to be
ruled. And to administer their kingdomes themselues by
their owne will, and not by anothers. For he will not be said
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:2459:235"/>
to be a King, who being to command, and correct all, should
easily suffer himselfe to be led away, and gouerned by others.
And therefore it is fit, that hee should alwayes stand vpon
his owne bottome, and in none of his actions expresse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to depend on the aide and opinion of others. For this
were to acknowledge a Superiour, or a Companion in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,
and to discouer his owne weaknesse. <hi>Infirma enim

That's but a poore power, that must bee vnder-propt by the
strength of others. In stead whereof, I would haue him to fit
in Councell, and to treate and communicate businesses with
such persons to whom it appertaineth, as heretofore I said.
Saying onely now, That that King is in a miserable and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
case, that must depend on anothers helpe. Vpon a
certaine occasion, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great said; <hi>Se malle mori,
quam regnarerogando:</hi> That he had rather die, then raigne
by supplicating and intreating. And no otherwise doth that
King raigne, who shewes himselfe a Coward, and suffers the
excellencie of his courage to bee ouerwhelmed and carried
away with the current of hard and difficult things, which
many times offer themselues, leauing the resolution of all to
the mercie and fauour of others, by whose helping hand it
seemeth that he liueth and raigneth. This (said the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Vespasian)</hi> is to dye standing. And as that King is
dead, which leaues that to another which hee can doe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and which doth properly appertaine vnto his office;
and as he shall not truly cumply with his obligation, if he
should go about to draw solely to himselfe the gouernment
of his whole kingdome; much lesse in like manner shall
he cumply therewith, if hee should cast off all care from
himselfe, and relye wholly vpon others. For Extreames,
in all things, are ill. And an extreme thing it were, that hee
should take vpon himselfe the whole weight and burthen of
businesses, and to haue all things passe through his owne
hands; it being likewise no lesse, if he should shift off all from
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:2459:236"/>
his owne shoulders, and put his hand to nothing, as did <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius,</hi>
and <hi>Iouinianus,</hi> who did in such sort dis-loade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
of their offices, and ridde their hands of all matter of
gouernment, that all was ordered and gouerned by other
mens arbitrement, and none of theirs. Of the former it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
that he forgot that hee was Emperour. And of the
other, that hee intended nothing but eating and drinking,
gaming and whoring. So that both of them came to such
miserable ends, as their retchlesse and carelesse kinde of
liuing had deserued. <hi>Childericke,</hi> King of France, and third
of that name, is (and not without iust cause) condemned by
the writers of those times, for that hee did wholly quit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
of businesses, and led so idle and vnprofitable a life, that
he tooke care of nothing, recommending all to his great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourite
<hi>Pipine,</hi> who did rule and gouerne him as hee listed.
And there was not any meeting or conuersation through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the kingdome, wherein men did not mutter and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
at it. For their nimble and actiue nature could by no
meanes indure, that their King should be but the shadow of
a King, and stand for a Cypher, sheltering himselfe vnder the
shade of another. Which could not choose (considering how
vsuall a thing it is) but put spirit into <hi>Pipine,</hi> and adde met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
to his power. For it is very proper to the condition of
men, the more high they are in place and dignitie, to desire
the more honour, and the more wealth. There are but few
of your great and powerfull persons, which are not hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall,
and doe not thirst after new honours, and new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancements;
And some haue proceeded so farre in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions,
that they haue presumed (as this Fauourite did) to
quit the King of his Crowne. Willingly hearkening vnto
those flatterers about him, which did whisper this in his eare,
and egge him on vnto it. It likewise began to bee treated of
amongst the great Lords of that kingdome, How much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
command and rule were in one Head, then in two: And
how that all kingdomes had euermore a desire to haue but
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:2459:236"/>
one Prince; And that all prudent and wise men, haue (in
reason of State) held this gouernment to be the best and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
and that it was not fit, that the vniforme body of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
or kingdome, should bee subiect and obedient
to two Heads: To wit, that one should enioy the name and
title of King, and the other possesse the power. And that it
were better that all should obey one, that had wisedome and
experience, and that had beene bred vp in businesses, and the
mannaging of State-affaires, whereby to gouerne them in
peace and Iustice. And sithence, that in <hi>Pipine</hi> these qualities
did concurre, and that on him all the businesses of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
did depend, it were good that hee should bee their
King, and that <hi>Childericke</hi> should take his ease and pleasure.
Hereupon they treated with <hi>Pipine,</hi> who though hee gaue
eare vnto what they said, yet would not rashly aduenture
himselfe to accept of the Crowne, vnlesse Pope <hi>Zacharias</hi>
might first be consulted therein. Whereupon they sent their
Embassadours, who had instruction to render such reasons to
the Pope, that might moue him to approue thereof, and
iudging <hi>Childericke</hi> to bee vnfit for the gouernment, might
absolue the French of their oath which they had taken, and
that obedience which they ought to their King, and that he
should depriue him of the kingdome, and further declare,
That since <hi>Pipine</hi> did rule and command all, and had so many
good indowments, that hee might likewise be inuested with
the title of King. And the Archbishop of <hi>Maguncia</hi> was the
man, that was nominated to set the Crowne on his head, and
to declare him to bee King of all France. Being thus back't,
they summoned a Parliament, degraded the poore seely king,
and thrust him into a Monastery, and <hi>Pipine</hi> was sworne
and proclaimed King of those so many kingdomes and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nories,
as were then subiect to the Crowne of France.<note place="margin">There remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth testimony hereof in the Decretals. <hi>C. Alui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had it's first beginning, and that hand and power giuen vnto
Popes, in so great a businesse, as the setting vp and pulling
downe of Kings; and which is more, of creating new Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:2459:237"/>
and depriuing the old ones of their Empire. Whereof
there are many examples. And that which this Pope did
with that King, who had no more then that vmbratill, and
apparent power, other Popes afterwards did the like with
<hi>Henries</hi> and <hi>Fredericks,</hi> and other Tyrants of great puisance
and power. The one offend in the more: the other in the lesse.
The one, out of the ambition that they haue to bee Kings,
that they may command, and doe all, loose all, and so go to
hell. And the other go the same way, for that they will not
bee (as they should be) Kings, but giue themselues wholly
vnto idlenesse. It was the Emperour <hi>Galba's</hi> vtter ouerthrow,
that he had put the whole gouernment into onely three mens
hands, which he brought along with him, possessing them
with so much power, that hee was not Master of himselfe,
depending still vpon their wil, and through that great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
which they had, they ouerthrew all whatsoeuer their
King did ordaine, thrusting their armes (as we say) vp to the
elbowes in all affaires, and making vse of their present for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
And for that this vnfortunate Emperour could take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of no more, then what hee had from them; for none
(without their permission) could, or see, or speake with him,
they made him to do that, which that other Potter did, who
going about to make a pot, to boyle meate in, made a larre,
to put drinke in. And he thinking to substitute Iudges, that
should administer Iustice, appointed theeues in their place,
which robbed the Commonwealth. All which was imputed
vnto him. And for that Vanity is the mother of so many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
all this their great fauour serued to no other vse, but to
cause their Soueraigne to commit many actions of iniustice,
and indiscretion, and of vnheard of, and vnthought of
wrongs, violently breaking through the ordinary course of
Iustice. By which exorbitant proceedings, this imprudent
Emperour grew to be hated and abhorred of all, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able longer to beare with him, they depriued him at once
of his life, and Empire. And these kinde of Caterpillars (said

that put their affiance in them. At this carelesse ward, liued at
first <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> King of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
(like a wise Prince) hee did rectifie this errour. And
the case was this; Hee let his friend and Fauourite <hi>Lisander</hi>
carry a great hand ouer him, and did honour him in all that
he could, expressing alwayes much loue vnto him; <hi>Lysander</hi>
puft vp herewith, tooke great state vpon him, being attended
with a great traine, and manifesting in his very gate a kinde
of extraordinary grauitie and Maiestie, and all did so farre
forth serue and obey him, that it seemed he had vsurped the
dignitie royall, and the Empire, leauing good honest <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silaus</hi>
onely the bare Titulary name of King. Which his
Maiestie taking into his consideration, to the end that the
people might not say, that hee raigned by <hi>Lysanders</hi> helpe,
he withdrew the dispatch of businesses fromforth his hands,
and would not remit any thing vnto him, and if he spake to
him touching this or that businesse, he made as if he did not
heare him, or not well vnderstand him, dispatching all him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
to the good contentment of his Subiects. Hereupon
<hi>Lysander</hi> began to cast vp his accounts with himselfe, and
forbore from that time forward to conferre fauours, or to
promise Offices; and told such suiters as came vnto h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m, that
they should go themselues to petition the King, and would
by no meanes permit, that they should accompany him to
Court, as before. And yet notwithstanding all this, he assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
very carefully in all such seruices, as were by his Maiesty
recommended vnto him, without any the least shew of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment.
Within a while after occasion was offered vnto
him to speake with the King; and talking with him, hee told
him; O King, how well hast thou learned to make thy
friends lesse? yes (quoth the King) when they will make
themselues too great. The King played his part well, so did
the Fauourite, and all ought to doe the like. Kings must bore
a hole in that ship with their owne hand, to stop it's course,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:2459:238"/>
when it hoyseth it's sayles too high, and goes with too still
a gale. For the taking notice of their Fauourites ambition, is
that ballast, which doth secure them against those their
windes, and puffes of vanitie.</p>
               <p>Let then the first aduice, and which is of greatest impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for Kings and Christian kingdomes, bee that which
(amongst other) the Catholicke King of Spaine, and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, left vnto his sonne King <hi>Philip</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
wherein with many indeared and effectuall words, he
recommends vnto him the obseruing, augmenting, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
of the Christian faith, in all his kingdomes, States,
and Signiories, seuerely punishing with all rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ur and iustice,
without exception of persons, all such as should bee either
suspected or found culpable in points of Heresies, Errours,
and depraued Sects, contrary to the Catholicke saith. For
therein consisteth all our good words, all of them, worthie
consideration, and worthy so Catholicke a Prince, esteemed,
approued, and perpetually obserued by his most happie
sonne (howbeit to his great cost.) As one, that knew very
well, that in the obseruance of Religion, and Catholicke
faith, all the happinesse that we can hope for in this or that
other life, dependeth thereupon, and hath it's sure ground
and foundation.<note place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>b. 11. 1.</note> And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls it <hi>Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam
rerum sperandarum, &amp;c.</hi> Faith is the substance of things
hoped for, and the euidence of things not seene, &amp;c. For it is
the foundation whereupon is built in our soules all our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
good: insomuch that the selfe same Apostle said, <hi>Sine
fide, &amp;c.</hi> Without faith it is impossible to please God. And
seeing it is a Iewell of such great worth and value, Kings are
to make that esteeme of it, that they doe not onely retaine
it, but maintaine and defend it, especially in their owne
kingdomes, and in all other places, where they haue any
power. For besides the obligation, which they haue, as
Christian Kings, it concernes them likewise in their owne
proper interest. For in giuing way to their Subiects, that they
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:2459:238"/>
be not faithfull vnto God, it will pull that punishment vpon
them, that they shall not be loyall vnto them. And most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it is, that they who shall not cumply with the greater
obligation, shall easily faile in the lesser. And this is made
cleare vnto vs in the sacred History of the Kings; where,
whosoeuer shall diligently obserue the same, hee shall finde,
That after <hi>Ieroboam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. King. 13.</note> King of Israel, had set vp those Idolls
in <hi>Dan,</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> of purpose to withdraw the people from
the true worship of God, were commenced and continued
(as there wee may reade) the treasons and rebellions of the
Subiects against their Kings. For this vnfortunate Prince
thought with himselfe, that for to settle and secure himselfe in
the kingdome by those ten Tribes, which had rebelled, and
made choice of him for their King, that it would be a good
meanes to induce them to his deuotion, to draw them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
the adoration of the true God, which they were wont to
performe in the holy Citie, and Temple of Ierusalem, and to
humble and prostrate themselues before those Idolls. But the
iust vengeance of God ouertooke him; for instantly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he lost his eldest sonne, who dyed a violent death. For
<hi>Baasha,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Ahijah,</hi> of the house of <hi>Issachar,</hi> conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
against him, and smote him at <hi>Gibbethon,</hi> and anon after
all the house of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> not leauing vnto him any that
breathed. And not onely hee, and his, did miscarry, but the
whole kingdome was laid waste and desolate for that sinne,
and led away captiue. And as when one man hath receiued
from another some extraordinary great wrong, he can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forget it: so, vpon all occasions, wherein mention is made
of the sinnes of the Kings, which afterwards succeeded, and
of the punishment which they deserued for them, still is the
remembrance reuiued of this most grieuous sinne of <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams,</hi>
and are attributed vnto him, as being the first that open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the gappe vnto them. And all those troubles which are
there particularly set downe in those sacred bookes, befell
that kingdome for a punishment to them, and a warning to
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:2459:239"/>
all Christian Kings, that by how much the greater light they
haue for to know the excellencie of Faith, and the truth
of Christian Religion, so much the lesse are they to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the more seuerely to bee punished, if they should
be wanting to so great and so apparent an obligation. Let
Christian Kings therefore know, that if they shall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
firme in the faith, and cause all their subiects to continue
constant therein, God will protect both King and people,
and will establish their kingdomes, and all shall obey and
feare them; but if they shall faile therein, all runs to wracke,
and vtter ruine. So that, as a naile, if you will haue it to hold,
must be fastened in some other thing that is firme and strong,
lest it, and all that hangs thereon, come tumbling downe to
the ground, So in like manner, if a King will vphold himselfe
firme and sure in his power, Maiestie, and greatnesse, hee
must be firmely fixed to the faith, strongly vnited with God,
and close wedged to his diuine will: but if he begin once to
sinke, or shrinke in this, all his kingdomes, or whatsoeuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
thereon, come tumbling downe to the ground, with a
sudden and fearefull fall. For nothing doth more vphold a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable
life, a Monarchie, and kingdome, then Religion linked
with Iustice. <hi>Noah</hi> for his Religion and Iustice, was after the
Flood obeyed by all. The Romans, for the vpholding and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
of their Empire, held not any meanes comparable to
that of Religion and Iustice, wherein they surpassed all of
those times. The Emperour <hi>Seuerus</hi> being at the point of
death (which is a time for men to speake truth) ended his life
with these words, <hi>Firmum impe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

my Sonnes, if they proue good; a weake, if bad. For the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
force and strength of a kingdome, both for the present,
and the future, is the vertue of it's king. So that with no lime
and sand are the walls and foundations of States more firme
and surely setled for lasting and continuance, then with a
Kings vertue and goodnesse. Which is that recompence and

                  <hi>Iudas Machabeus</hi> heard tell of the

of Armes, being a stranger-Nation to Gods people. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he sent his Ambassadours vnto them, to make a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
league and confederation with them. Wherewith God
was much displeased, and so hurtfull vnto them was this ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and alliance, that many haue obserued, that after this
Peace was concluded betweene them, <hi>Iudas</hi> neuer after obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
any victory ouer his enemies, but was flaine in the first
battell that he fought. And some say, the like succeeded to
both his brothers, <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>Simeon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs draw then from this discourse and sound aduice of
this Catholike Emperour, how much it importeth Kings to
maintaine their faith and Religion, and to conserue and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the same in all their kingdomes and dominions. Now
for to conserue the faith, it is likewise requisite, that there be
great care had in procuring, that the commonwealth be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and cleansed of it's vices and sinnes. For (as the Apostle
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith) when vices grow to that head and rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that they come to make men to be of a bad and corrupt
conscience, they go disposing such to suffer shipwracke in the
faith; as it hath happened in these our times, in many parts of
Europe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="438" facs="tcp:2459:240"/>
The second aduice that I shall giue vnto Kings, is, that
they carry themselues so in the dispatch of businesses, that
notice may not bee taken, that they are dispatched by any
other arbitrement, but their owne. For most certaine it is,
that if it come to be knowne, that all the Orders that come
forth, passe through the Fauourites hands, and as hee shall
giue direction, they loose much of their force and efficacie;
and the King much of his reputation and credit. His subiects
will grow to contemne him; and strangers will make little
reckoning of him; and many other mischiefes will ensue
thereupon. Amongst the Romanes it was held for a great
affront and dishonour, that the Emperour should dispatch
(as they say) <hi>porcarta-pacio,</hi> by a note booke, or some penn'd
thing for him; or (like some young practitioner in physicke)
by his Masters <hi>Recipes.</hi> And therefore in those generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions,
which they made, they besought God that hee
would not punish them, by giuing them Princes, which had
need to be ruled and guided by Gouernours and Tutors. For
they knew well enough, that when God is angry, offended
with the sinnes of the people, he punisheth them, by sending
them Princes without knowledge and wisedome; that are not
able to gouerne of themselues, but to doe as others shall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
them. Wherein they did confesse and acknowledge,
That to be a King, consisteth in being knowne and reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of all; to be an independant Lord, not relying vpon any
other; whose Mandates and Decrees all should subscribe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
and obey; whom all should seeke vnto, with whom all
should negociate, that are pretenders; from whose liberalitie,
resolution, and will, they onely should acknowledge all the
graces and fauours that are done them, and from no other
hand. For if they should giue way thereunto, their Subiects
will bee induced easily to beleeue, that together with this,
they will giue away their greatnesse, and minister occasion to
loose that common loue and respect which solely and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is due vnto them. For Subiects vsually honour no other
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:2459:240"/>
Sunne, but that from which they receiue their light. They
naturally abhorre that man, that does them hurt; and loue
that person, who does them good, bee he what hee will be,
good or bad, all is one. They call God <hi>Optimum maximum,</hi>
because he both doth, and is able to do them good. And he
himselfe doth glory therein, as being vnwilling that men
should acknowledge the good they receiue, from any other.
What wisedome then can there bee in that King, that shall
suffer a Fauourite to haue all the thankes, and all the honour
and glory of those fauours and rewards, whereof he is the
owner and donor? Reseruing for himselfe nothing but the
scorne and contempt of his Subiects, then the which there is
no miserie can be greater? God forbid that Kings should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any such lessening of their power and authoritie, which
is the necessariest thing that can bee, for the conseruation of
their estates and kingdomes. Likewise in regard of their owne
proper particular, it will be a very good lesson for them; for
if their subiects are beholding for the good they receiue, vnto
another, they will loue him more then them; and when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
shall serue, will not sticke to shew it, though it bee to
their owne hurt. Examples hereof, there are good store
amongst those ancient Kings and kingdomes of elder times,
that by this meanes haue beene ouerthrowne and brought to
ruine. We finde it storied, that the Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi> at
the intercession and instance of <hi>Agrippina,</hi> made such a
one Generall of his Army; <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> toucheth vpon
this Mysterie, and saith of him, that hee was a man of much
fame and renowne, and very expert in militarie discipline;
yet knowing very well withall, by whose good will and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance,
that command was conferred vpon him, he could
not (when occasion should offer) bee behinde hand for so
great an honour done vnto him, but recompence it to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of his power. Such great places of imployment ought
to be bestowed by no hand, but by Kings, and that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
lest another may go away with the thankes. And he
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:2459:241"/>
shall doe well, if hee take the like course in all other Offices
that are in his gift; for (if it were possible) it is fit that all
should stand bound and obliged to him.</p>
               <p>Let Kings likewise bee aduised, that they carry a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
eye ouer those that are ambitious, which are either so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
or by conuersing and communicating with others,
are made so (for this is an infectious disease) and the more,
the more it taketh hold on great persons, and men of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
spirit; for they are as dangerous as theeues, where
there is store of treasure to bee had. For questionlesse such
kinde of men do vsually labour to increase their estate. For it
is very naturall to this passion, as to those other affections,
neuer to giue ouer, till they come to the end and full satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of that which their appetite or desire representeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them: neither the Law of God, nor of thankfulnesse, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
to moderate their mindes, and to keepe them within
the due and lawfull bounds of their dutie. In that houre, and
in that very instant of their rising, nay, before they come to
that greatnesse, there is little trust to be giuen vnto them; for
nothing workes vpon them, but their proper honour and
profit. And all the rest they esteeme as nothing, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of bettring their owne fortune. But if of necessitie some
must bee raised to honour;<note place="margin">Arist. lib. 5. po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit. c. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Si quem extollere oporteat</hi> (saith
the Philosopher) <hi>non tamen eum, qui sit moribus audax.
Nam huinsmodi homines aptissimi sunt ad inuadendum circa
res omnes:</hi> Let them not be of base and meane condition, nor
such as are naturally proud and haughty, for being vainely
transported with their fauour and priuacie, they thinke with
themselues, that they haue already clapt a nayle in fortunes
wheele, and that they cannot fall from the top of their feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.
And being thus blinded with their ambition, there is
not any thing which they dare not aduenture on. Let Kings
therefore well weigh and consider with themselues, what
manner of men they put into great places, and neare about
their persons, that they may relye more on the goodnesse of
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:2459:241"/>
their nature and disposition, then on the Law of obligation
and thankfulnesse; for these are but weake bonds, and easily
broken. And because I know not whether I shall hereafter
come to light vpon the like occasion, I will here propose that
Question, which is disputed and doubted of by some (and
may likewise serue for an <hi>Auiso</hi> vnto Kings) whether it be
better that the great Lords should be farre off from them, or
neare about them? The Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth (of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
memory) amongst other Aduertisements which hee
gaue to his sonne <hi>Philip,</hi> one was, That he should not let the
great offices of the kingdome, nor places of great command
rest any long time in one mans hands, nor should put his
<hi>Grandes</hi> and great Lords into them, but Gentlemen of good
qualitie, such as were creatures of his owne making. And as
for his <hi>Grandes,</hi> hee should honour them with some places
and offices neare about his person, which would be a greater
grace both to himselfe and his Court.</p>
               <p>Others are of a quite contrary opinion, and alledge reasons
for the maintenance thereof. Great men (they say) if they be
not like those little ones, which Christ speaketh of, are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
of an extraordinary spirit, and endeauour, all they
can, increase of honour, till they come to occupie the highest
place. And then will it bee seene, of what little esteeme are
those great fauours which they haue already receiued. There
is not that friendship, that kindred, nor any other bond, be
it neuer so strong, which is not broken, through the greedy
ambition of ascending to some higher throne. For to bee a
King (saith <hi>Euripides)</hi> all Law is broken. For this Appetite
is of that force and strength, that it breaketh all Lawes, both
Diuine and Humane. For proofe whereof, they cite many
examples, which I purposely omit, that I may not offend,
and tire out the Reader. All of them admonishing Kings, that
they should throughly weigh and consider where, and in
what places they put them. For if they be neare about their
royall person, it is the torment of <hi>Tantalus</hi> vnto them, to see
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:2459:242"/>
the water and the fruit so neare their mouth (that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and power I meane) and not to enioy it; Which will
but prouoke a more hungry appetite in those which doe not
possesse it, and will breake through hedge and ditch, and
runne (as they say) through fire and water transported with
this so faire and beautifull a prize, as is set before their eyes;
neuer being at quiet till they come to enioy it. For there is
not that loue to any thing here vpon earth, which doth so
much alter, suspend, and seaze on the minde and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>art of
man, as that of ruling and commanding, and to grow great
therein. And when they see things succeed not according to
their minde, yet at least in satisfaction of their enuie, they will
be well content that the waters should be troubled, and the
world be turned topsie-turuy, taking pleasure therein, though
it be to their owne hurt. And what King can secure himselfe,
that such ambitious persons, being neare about him, will not
at one time or other attempt their ends. For greatnesse (say
they) after that it is once possessed, quits the memory of the
meanes, whereby it came to bee so great, and findes a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
excuses for it's weaknesse in offending. And the rather,
for that ill vse hath taught all men this lesson; That the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of an honest man is not to be preferred before his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
profit and greatnesse. Lastly, they say, That he that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth,
and makes good his clayme by his sword, needeth
not to study excuses, and to make Apologies; let those doe
that, that haue the worst end of the staffe, and stand at the
mercy of the Conquerour. In conclusion, they resolue this
question thus; That it is very fit that your great Noble-men
should rather liue farre from Court, then neare about their
King. For all of them will be of good vse, for the gouernment
of Prouinces and Armies, whereby both the one and the
other will be secured. And when they cannot content them
in all that they would haue, they may entertaine them with
these, which will be a good meanes to diuert their thoughts,
and to bridle those Prouinces that are committed to their
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:2459:242"/>
charge, with whom the Maiestie and greatnesse of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours
will be able to doe much. And there they are not
of that danger. For in kingdomes by succession, and well set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and where there is no colour of wresting the Scepter out
of the bloud-royall, there is no feare of trusting the <hi>Grandes,</hi>
and great Noblemen with these kinde of Gouernments, but
it is rather requisite that it should be so. For, like vnto starres
in heauen, and their influences on earth, they serue for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and conuersation in those kingdomes and Prouinces,
wherein there are ancient and noble Houses, for which they
are to seeke out men of Noble bloud, and good qualitie, and
of knowne greatnesse, to bee conuersant amongst them. For
the Nobilitie of those kingdomes and Prouinces will thinke
themselues not well dealt withall, if they shall haue but an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
man set ouer them to be their Gouernour, be he neuer
so wise, or neuer so valiant. For being that they are to attend
all at the gates of him that holdeth that place, they may
esteeme it as an iniurie to see themselues obliged, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
homage vnto him, whom out of that place they would
scarce vouchsafe him their companie. Besides, that greatnesse
and largenesse of minde and heart, that knowes not how to
shrinke, or be deiected with aduerse fortune (a thing so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in him that gouernes) will sooner bee found in these,
then men of meaner ranke. For (as Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> saith) hee
that owes much to his bloud and familie, will alwayes beare
that obligation about him, and neuer faile therein. Againe,
he that is borne to command, will be lesse insolent in his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,
as hauing that noble qualitie from his cradle; And
the people on the other side will more willingly obey him,
whom they haue alwayes knowne to haue liued in honour
and greatnesse: And his example will bee of greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
to reforme the disorders and abuses that shall there be
offered.</p>
               <p>Ouer and aboue, they further adde, That your <hi>Grandes</hi>
and great Noblemen, may, and haue obligation to content
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:2459:243"/>
themselues with their present estate, if they will but weigh
the difference of that it was, with that which it is now, did
not men that are now in honour grow forgetfull of their
former meane condition. That grieuing them more, which
falls short of their desire, then that doth please and content
them, which fortune hath with so liberall a hand bestowed
on them. For no man rests contented with his present estate
and condition; nor doe we esteeme that so much which wee
possesse, as the lacke of that we desire, doth torment vs. And
therefore doe they say, that they are not so good to be about
Kings, and more particularly those which are so qualified;
for they are like a lingring kinde of Calenture, or aguish Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
which makes an end of vs before we are aware of it, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it's effect, before wee can looke into the cause. Or like
vnto the hand in a Clocke, or Dyall, which tells out the
houre, and strikes, without perceiuing how it moues or goes.
Or like vnto those plants of your tallest trees, which grow to
their full height, whilest neither our eyes, nor our vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
can scarce comprehend, how this comes to passe, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
doth it sproute and shoot vp. This is the question,
and these, in briefe, the conueniences, which (for mine owne
part) I know not what they are, vnlesse such conueniences
as are proper to euery one in their owne estate. But be it as
it may be, and let them say what they list, let Kings resolue
by the illumination of that light which they haue from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
on that which shall be best for them. That which I say,
is this, That it will well become them to liue with a great
deale of warinesse and circumspection, and not to trust or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
too much vpon fortune. For this Lady, howbeit some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
shee suffers her selfe to bee commanded by them, yet
now and then she ouerrules them, as she doth the rest. And
therefore it shall bee good discretion and prudence, to feare
both her, and her frequent mutabilities and changings, as it
behoueth euery man to doe the like. For she, without any
respect or distinction of persons, will oftentimes lash out
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:2459:243"/>
from that way and course wherein she is, and runne a quite
contrary bias, and commit the current of those effects to
time and Nature.</p>
               <p>Let Kings likewise take heed, that they doe not put offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
persons into such places, where they may reuenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues;
For a receiued wrong or iniurie leaues still some roots
behinde, which, when occasion is offered, will bud forth most
bitter and venemous plants. Nor are there any rewards, or
benefits, be they neuer so great, that can blot out the print
of that impression, which an iniurie stampeth in the minde
and heart of man. Courtesies are soone forgotten by them;
for it seemeth a troublesome thing vnto them, to endure the
weight and burthen of so great a debt and obligation; but a
receiued wrong or iniurie, that shall euer be remembred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they hold reuenge to be the character of courage, and
the badge of a noble minde and braue spirit. <hi>Puluere, qui lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
scribit, sed marmore laesus:</hi> He that does a wrong, writes
it downe in dust; but he that receiues it, in marble. <hi>Tacitus</hi>
teacheth vs to know this minde of man, and it's passions;
telling vs that the greatest and strongest inclination in man, is
to receiue satisfaction of the iniuries done vnto them, for
thankfulnesse lyes as a heauy loade vpon them; whereas they
make light of those benefits they receiue. Esteeming the latter
to be a diminution of their greatnesse; and the former, to wit,
reuenge, to bee a great gaine vnto them; for they imagine,
that they gaine thereby in their authoritie, in their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in the manifestation of their valour, when the world
shall take notice that they haue righted themselues. Such as
these can neither bee good as they are Fauourites, nor as they
are Councellers. For out of the desire and pleasure they take
in reuenge, they will rather aduise that which shall seeme
conuenient for the execution thereof, then for the authoritie
and profit of the Prince, whom they aduise. They will aduise
him (I say) to venture himselfe vpon some voyage, to enter
into a warre, to go himselfe into the field with a royall army,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:2459:244"/>
or to vndergo some dangerous enterprise, for the better effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
of their designes, plotting a thousand mischiefes to
bring him vnto ruine. And let them say what they will, yet
shall they neuer perswade me, that this proceeds out of the
loue which they beare vnto their King, and his increase of
honour, but out of hatred to his person, &amp; their owne proper
satisfaction, thinking that by that meanes they may worke
their reuenge. And hereunto I adde, that no man can bee
found of so perfect a minde, of so temperate a nature, and so
vertuous, but that in the first place he will treate of his owne
businesse; and that treating of this particular, the eye of his
thought still ayming to hit this white, will not sticke to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
any danger in hope of reuenge. And therefore I
shall aduise Kings, that of necessitie must sometimes giue eare
and credit to these or the like persons, if they chance to bee
preferred to great places, that they be very carefull how farre
forth they trust them, for they are a dangerous kinde of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
vnsafe, and more couetous of their owne priuate interest,
then carefull of the publike perill, or common hurt. For this
loue vnto themselues, and hatred vnto others, couered and
strewed ouer with the cloud and ashes of iniuries and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
either receiued or conceiued, doth reuiue and quicken
the coales by those blasts of fauour and greatnesse that are
blowne on them; procuring (though to others cost) to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
themselues therein, and to ingage Kings in that which
they pretend for their reuenge and satisfaction. God shield
and protect Kings from such persons, as shall with the snake
take vp their poyson againe, to vent the venome of their ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
and reuenge vpon an old quarrell; and let them likewise
take heed, how they imploy their forces, and their power, in
countenancing and protecting those whom they haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and discontented.</p>
               <p>This (saith the said Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth) is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of great importance, for the safetie, quietude, and good
gouernment of kingdomes, States, and Signiories; which
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:2459:244"/>
for that they are so many, so great, and so farre distant one
from another, it is impossible that they should be visited by
your selfe in person, so often as is requisite: And therefore I
aduise you, that you haue a great care that your Viceroyes
and Gouernours that shall be sent thither, be such, and of such
parts, as shall conuene for such an imployment, men of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
and conscience, of wisedome, prudence, and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and well seene in matters of State and Gouernment:
Well disposed, and free from couetousnesse, briberie, and
corruption; seeking out rather men for Offices, then Offices
for men. Lastly, let them be such persons, from whom you
may receiue that good satisfaction, that by their residence
there may bee found no misse of their Kings presence; For
this is properly to bee Vice-royes. Moreouer, you must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
them in that which appertaineth vnto them, for the
good gouernment of the Commonwealth, and those Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
which are committed to their charge, maintaining them
in equall iustice, and good manners, giuing them good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
by their owne blamelesse conuersation. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that doth so much oblige Vassals and Subiects to keepe
the Statutes and Lawes which are ordained, as to see them
well kept and obserued by their betters; And so it is, that it
is vniustly commanded, which hee that commands keepes
not himselfe, if that which is commanded be good. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good, why should it not be good for him to keepe it, that
commands it?<note place="margin">Bal. in l. 2. c. 8. Num. 4. c. de. Strui.</note> For (as <hi>Baldus</hi> saith) though the King be not
lyable to the Law, yet is hee lyable to the rules of reason.
This pious Emperour goes on, and willeth his sonne, that he
should strictly recommend to his Vice-roys charge, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting,
sheltring, and relieuing of the poore, the defending of
the fatherlesse and widow, and those that are destitute of
friends, and haue none to helpe them. Whom some, that are
in place and authoritie, are wont (and I feare is too ordinary
amongst them) to disfauour and disesteeme them, making
little or no reckoning at all of them. Being ignorant how vile
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:2459:245"/>
and base a thing it is, and how heroycall the contrary, and
how much in imitation of God, to put forth a charitable and
pitifull hand to him that is brought low, and fallen into mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie,
assisting him in his afflictions and troubles, freeing him
from wrongs and iniuries, whose shield and buckler, he that
gouernes, ought to be. And he closes vp this aduertisement
with wishing him to be very carefull, that his Viceroys and
Gouernours exercise their offices as they ought, and not to
exceed the instructions that are giuen them, nor to vsurpe
beyond their authoritie, giuing them this <hi>prouiso,</hi> that in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the contrary, he shall thinke that he is ill serued by them,
and that hee giue order to haue it remedied and amended,
by his displeasure, and their punishment. And howbeit it
be true, that he ought not to giue credit to all the complaints
which are made against such his Ministers (which are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
wanting) yet in no hand that he should refuse to heare
them, and vnderstand them, in forming himselfe fully of the
truth. For the not doing of it, will but minister occasion vnto
them, to be more absolute, and to the Subiects to grow des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
seeing themselues oppressed by iniustice and vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable
dealing.</p>
               <p>Likewise when Kings send an Embassadour to another
Prince, they must looke well into the qualitie of the person
whom they send. For in such an Embassage he doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
treate of the businesses for which hee goes, but likewise of
the honour and authoritie of the King, which sends him.
And therefore it is necessary that the persons that are nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
and declared to go on Embassage, haue many of those
qualities, which we haue mentioned in Vice-roys and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours
of State. For if they shall not fill that place with the
greatnesse of their good abilities, it will be a great lessening to
the credit and reputation of the King, and the businesses will
receiue much hinderance, if not vtterly bee ouerthrowne.
The Romanes did make a mocke of the Teutones, counting
them no better then fooles, for sending an Embassadour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:2459:245"/>
them that was a block-head, and of little or no expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
               <p>Kings and great Princes, all that, from which glory and
greatnesse resulteth vnto them, they ought to doe it without
any the least shew of vanitie, accompanying it with such cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
and consequencies, that it may seeme onely to
bee done for the common good, the exaltation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
and the reputation of their Crowne. In all times
and places they must represent much authoritie, grauitie, and
Maiestie in their persons, and in their Treaties, mixing it
with affabilitie and courtesie. To the end, that by the one
they may cause feare and respect, and by the other quit and
remoue that feare. It is reported of <hi>Octauian</hi> the Emperour,
that all the Embassadours that appeared in his presence, stood
astonished betwixt feare and admiration; but no sooner
spake he vnto them, but they were wonderfully taken with
his words, and did not then so much feare, as affect him. For
albeit the Maiestie wherewith hee receiued them, was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great, yet was his carriage towards them very affable,
and very courteous. In these two vertues, did excell that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
King of Spaine, <hi>Don Philip</hi> the second, whom for
the representing of Maiestie, and regall authoritie, none did
excell, and few equall. And in the carriage and composition
of his person, there was no defect to bee found. Vpon any
accident that befell him, were it good or bad, fortunate or
vnfortunate, there was neuer any man that could perceiue in
him so much as a discomposed countenance, or any other
the least alteration. And hee may be truly said to be a man,
who is not proud in prosperitie, nor impatient in aduersitie.
For it is a great signe of Noblenesse, and the vndoubted
marke of a royall minde, and Princely courage, not to loose
himselfe in his aduerser fortunes, but to sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

against fortune, and to raise vp his spirits, as this King
did, being neuer deiected with any outward Crosse or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
tha befell him. He did neuer (being therein like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  <hi>Xenophons Cyrus)</hi> shew an ill countenance, or speake an

with his Fauourites, that any of them all durst presume to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him in any thing that was vniust; nor yet so austere
and feuere towards others as to make them to forbeare to
preferre a iust suite vnto him. To his owne Subiects he was
kinde, to strangers noble; but withall, reseruing still his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
and greatnesse. For Kings ought not to bee so harsh
and intractable, as to make themselues to bee abhorred; nor
so kinde and courteous, as to cause themselues to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Indeauouring all they can, not to fall into the extreames,
by shewing too much loue to some, and little or none at all
to other some. For too much seueritie ingendreth hatred, and
too much familiaritie breedeth contempt. Let them general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beare themselues in that respectiue manner towards all,
that they honour the better, loue the meaner sort, and despise
not the rest; but as farre as they are able, extend their grace
and fauour vnto all. For that being but little, which they
haue to giue, in comparison of the many that are sutors, and
the great rewards which they pretend, they rest better satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with those good words, and mannerly answers, that are
giuen them, then with those fauours that are done them.
For the generous hearts, modest countenances, and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
dispositions of those noble spirits which follow Princes
Courts, much more risent the disfauour that is done them in
receiuing courtesies with disgrace, then if they were denyed
them. And therefore it is good wholesome counsell, and much
importing Kings, to returne a faire and equall answer vnto
all, according to each mans qualitie and merit, and that they
carry the same euen hand in the conferting of their fauours,
and in the manifestation of their loue. And if they shall in a
more particular manner, expresse the same to some one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
person, let him likewise more particularly deserue it.
For neuer shall that loue be stedfast, where deserts are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the partie beloued.</p>
               <p>

I shall likewise aduertise Kings, that they doe not make
such vse of this their great both office and power, as to assume
vnto themselues to be absolute, and to cumply in all things
with their affections and desires, nor to exercise any other
personall passion. For the vse and custome of absolute power
is dangerous for Kings, odious to the subiect, and offensiue
both to God and Nature. And for that the last Kings of the
Romanes vsed this power, the name of King grew so hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
that those that afterwards succeeded in the Romane go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,
durst not take vpon them the name of Kings, but
that of Emperours. Which is by so much the more absolute,
by how much <hi>Imperare</hi> doth differ from <hi>Regere.</hi> Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the people of Rome did not so much feare this
name of Emperour, as that of King, because those, that last
bore that name, exercised on them this their absolute power.
So that it is not the name, nor the office, but the ill vsing
thereof that makes it odious. For it is neither the Title, nor
the Man, that moueth or altereth the honest meaning minde
of the plaine downe right subiect, but deeds and actions,
that are done contrary to all right and reason. Whereas on
the contrary, good vsage, and good treatment keepes them
in loue and peace, and drawes them after him as it were in a
string, and to offer vp for his sake a voluntary sacrifice of
their liues. Let Kings consider that the Crowne speakes as
much, which they weare on their heads in forme of a Spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
round figure, which signifies <hi>limitem,</hi> or <hi>terminum,</hi> a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
or bound, or rather that Circle, out of which it is not
lawfull for them to go, no not one steppe. The Crownes (I
say) that they weare, are Circles and Limits, seruing to put
them in minde, that their power is limited and measured out
vnto them, that they may not passe the bounds of reason, nor
doe any thing, but what is iust and lawfull. Let the great
Kings and Potentates of the earth moderate themselues, and
refraine from making themselues Gods, by exercising this
their absolute power; let them acknowledge ouer them a
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:2459:247"/>
God, as well on earth, as in heauen. That hee may not grow
wearie of their Monarchies and their gouernments, as he did
of that of the ancient Romanes, and vtterly ouerthrow them,
prouoked and incited thereunto by the abuse of humane
power.<note place="margin">Sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but much more daintie in matter of iurisdiction and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
power, punishing the same with grieuous chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

when he vnderstood that he was permitted to doe what hee
listed; and that many did approue all his actions for good. It
is the ancient language of adulation, to speake absolute power
vnto Princes, and to perswade them to follow their owne

the resolutions of such a power, will not suffer themselues to
be so subiect, as they ought, to the iudgement of reason, nor
humane discourse. In such a case, a power from heauen is
more needfull. And this errour is now come to be in such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
that to agree in all things with the will and pleasure of
Kings, is now made in the minds of some, not onely a meanes
of hope, but esteemed as a great seruice, and pledge of merit,
to receiue honours and rewards. But this deceitfull meanes,
whereby they thinke to thriue, shall (when God shall see it
fit) be the onely knife to cut their throates; for such kinde of
men neuer escape punishment, and most commonly receiue it
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:2459:247"/>
from their Kings owne hand. In strange and extraordinary
cases, and vpon iust occasions, and iustifiable meanes, Kings
may somewhat inlarge the limits of their power, so as they
doe not go beyond that which reason and Christian pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
permitteth. <hi>Plato</hi> saith, that Prudence and power are
to embrace each other, and to walke hand in hand. Qualities
which ought to concurre in a good King, signified in that
Scepter with eyes, which <hi>Ieremy</hi> saw, power being in the one,
and wisdome in the other. And in that other old ancient por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture
of a good King, being a Lion placed on the top of
<hi>Mercuries</hi> Mace, which is a Scepter with two Snakes twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
about it; This, signifying prudence, and wisedome, and
that fortitude; which should neuer be separated from a King.
By his power, he is feared, respected, and obeyed; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
prohibites, and executes. By his wisedome, he auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the truth of his actions, and doth nothing, but what is
lawfull. Wisedome tempereth power; and both together vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the world. But if power forsake the fellowship of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
it growes to be absolute, and runnes into a thousand
indiscretions, and commits as many wrongs and iniuries,
wherewith it desolateth and destroyeth euen the greatest
States. For, there is not that ill, wherein power doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
if it haue not wisedome for it's bridle. And for that a
powerfull hand is so dangerous a thing, Nature hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and so ordered the businesse, that the braine where wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
hath it's residence, should bee placed ouer it. Which
those ancient Doctors amongst the Gentiles did point at,
when they placed <hi>Minerua,</hi> the Goddesse of wisedome, vpon
<hi>Iupiters</hi> head, who, of all the Gods, is the most powerfull.
And therefore it was well said of him, whosoeuer hee were

               <p>The particular and generall experience which we haue of
Histories, teacheth vs, how much it importeth for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
and augmentation of a great Empire and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,
that he, that is Lord and Master thereof (if it lye diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
through diuers parts of the world, by seas, and enemies,
in the midst thereof) should striue and indeauour by all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
meanes to make himselfe likewise Lord and Master of
the sea: for thereby shall he come to bee Lord and Master of
the Land. And an absolute dispenser of those things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we sustaine our selues, and liue. For by the helpe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigation,
we passe from one part to another, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
of what they haue by way of commerce or otherwise.
And by this meanes is made of many Prouinces and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
yea, euen of the whole world, one sole Citie and
commonwealth. This was the counsell of <hi>Themistocles,</hi> and
<hi>Plutarch</hi> makes it good, saying, Let no man deceiue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
in imagining with himselfe, that Armies will suffice for
to conserue himselfe, and to make himselfe Lord of those
kingdomes and Prouinces, that haue the Sea to friend. For if
he be not likewise prouided, and well furnished with a strong
fleete at Sea, howbeit hee may with a Land-armie ouercome
the naturalls of those kingdomes or Prouinces; yet it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for him, without the other, to make an intire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
and to go through with that which hee pretendeth.
That disposeth the Land to his will, and giueth Lawes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:2459:248"/>
The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> (saith <hi>Polibius)</hi> were not ignorant
of what great consequence this was, for all kinde of busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and therefore aduiseth, That that which a Prince ought
to procure, whereby to come to be a great Monarch, is, by a
strong Nauy, to make himselfe Lord of the Sea. For there
are not any forces that worke such strange and great effects,
or so much import, as these. And all your Ancients held it
for a <hi>Maxime,</hi> that without the command at Sea, there was
nothing safe or secure on the Land. <hi>Archidamus</hi> a great
Captaine, and King of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> was wont to say;
That those that are to deale with a strong enemie, being
powerfull at sea, need not to put themselues vpon the fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of fortune, but to place all their care in maintaining
their Nauie; for with this alone, will they be able to wearie
out the enemie, to quit him of the succour of their friends,
to debarre him of Nauigation, and of the commodities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and vtterly by this to vndoe him. And (which may seeme
a thing impossible) be able to beleaguer and girt in a whole
kingdome, and to take it (forcing it by famine and other
wants) as if it were onely one single Citie that were besieged.
For that (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith) a strong fleete at sea, is the Castle
and Magasine of victualls. And therefore the Empire and
Signiorie of the Sea, by a powerfull and commanding Nauy,
is held to bee of much more power and safetie, then your
Land-armies or Citie-garisons, which of force must in the
end yeeld vnto him, which shall become Master of their
ports, and thereby hinder them of all commerce and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique,
and humane communicat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And this was the aduice which that great Monarch and
Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth gaue likewise vnto his sonne, to
whom hee left so many and such great kingdomes, so farre
distant and diuided one from another, with such large and
deepe seas. Hee (saith he) that is or will bee Master of them,
must haue his fleetes still in a readinesse, well fitted and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
as well with good tall ships, well rigg'd and mann'd,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:2459:249"/>
and all other necessary prouision, as with store of Gallies, for
the safeguard and defence of his subiects, as also to resist and
offend <hi>Turkes, Moores,</hi> and Pyrats, because he cannot repose
any confidence or assurance in those Leagues and Truces
which he shall make with them. With this shall hee keepe
them all in awe, when they shall see his great forces at Sea,
by which he may (as it were in an instant) from all parts send
succours and reliefe, and whatsoeuer else shall bee needfull.
And it will bee no lesse then a hard rayne, and cruell strong
curbe, for to bridle and restraine the sinister intents and vaine
pretensions of such as shall plot strange proiects, dangerous
designes, and scandalous attempts. And vtterly to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
them from vndergoing any enterprise, or to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
any action of aduenture, with hope of recouering such
Townes or Prouinces as they haue lost, or by landing of
their men to encroach vpon new. And say they should serue
for no other vse, saue to hinder the excursions of Pyrats, and
Sea-rouers, in these our seas, onely in regard of that, it could
not choose but bee a matter of mighty consequence, and of
wonderfull great importance, considering the daily incursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
losses, flaughters, the continuall captiuatings, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries,
which they vsually commit vpon these our Coasts; so
that if there were not a fitting preparation, and sufficient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of ships and Gallies, it were impossible for vs to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
against those necessities, and to bee prouided against
those new and strange accidents which may offer themselues
in those Estates, kingdomes, and Signiories, Seas, Coasts,
frontiers, ports, promontories, Castles, and forts, which we
hold in them. Which by this our continuall nauigation, and
prouision of good shipping, are well man'd and victualled,
and sufficiently prouided of armes, munition, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
else is necessarie, in fit and conuenient both time and
manner against all occasions. Whereby the enemie percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
how well they are prouided for them, dare not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
those places, nor touch vpon them. Besides this easie
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:2459:249"/>
and short aduice, there are many other causes that may moue
vs not to be wanting herein. In a word, it will put the enemy
into a continuall care, and driue him to take a different reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
in those his ill-grounded motiues and pretensions: And
howbeit it be true, that the charge is great, so likewise great
losses are thereby excused, and some such sometimes as can
neuer bee repaired. So that, there is no passing to and fro
without nauigation, and the vsing and maintaining of these
fleetes.</p>
               <p>They are the words of that victorious Emperour, which
no King for want of experience should dis-esteeme.</p>
               <p>And for the better and fuller prouision in this kinde, it is
very fit that these Fleetes should haue their particular rent
approprietated vnto them, and that it should not, vpon no
occasion whatsoeuer, be spent or laid out in any other thing.
For a set and deputed treasure for this purpose, or the like, is
that which most importeth for the good dispatch of busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and that they may bee done in their due time, and with
lesse charge, and more profit. This course did the Grecians
take; and after them, the Romanes. And of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi>
both <hi>Suetonius</hi> and <hi>Dyon</hi> report, that he was the first inuenter
of a perpetuall militarie treasure, raised out of a certaine kind
of Tributes, which out of his owne curiositie he had sought
and found out. For Souldiers and warlike prouisions, in your
great Empires, require a particular treasure, wherewith to
be payed; which must not in any hand be otherwise imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nor go intermixed with those other expences. Hauing
persons of much experience and honestie, appointed for the
good managing and ordering of it, vsing their best care and
helpe, that it may bee preserued and continued, and that it
may not be exhausted, and drawne dry. And more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
Kings themselues, the <hi>Grandes</hi> and Peeres of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
as also the commonwealths, and your Cities, should
carefully looke hereunto. Being that they do most participate
of the profits which issue from a warre. And most certaine it
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:2459:250"/>
is, that nothing is more necessarie in a Monarchie, then this
particular treasure, or that causeth more respect in our friends,
or feare in our enemies. Or that with more commoditie and
conueniencie, puts in execution all plots and proiects, in this,
or that other enterprise, of what qualitie or condition soeuer
they bee. And to this aduice I shall adde that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>All wise and prudent Princes in Empires, that are runne

take this businesse into consultation, and to cast vp all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
and to see what the Kings rents and in-comes are for

with the other, and seeing how they will answer each other,
if they finde the expence to exceed the In-come, to cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
which way it may be best spared; and to husband the
businesse so, that there may be some ouerplus still remaining
for the publike treasurie. For if by disorder &amp; ill gouernment,

&amp; bibamus, cras enim moriemur:</hi> Let vs eate and drinke,
for to morrow we shall dye. Your Atheists, they propose an
end vnto themselues, thinking by this their prodigalitie to
procure vnto themselues an immortalitie of fame; But these
and the like, who so inconsiderately runne out of all, are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
and negligent euen of this, taking care onely to eate, and
to drinke, and to feast one another, without so much as
thinking that there is another world, or any honour, or fame
in this: And spending their whole life in belly cheare, and
bezeling, they are neuer satisfied, but call in still for more, till
their crawes be ready to cracke. And notwithstanding the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue
rents, which some Kings haue, and the great store of
treasure that comes to their coffers, besides the Tributes,
Taxes, Imposts, and Subsedies that are duely payed them,
they are neuer out of debt, the Crowne-land lying impawned
for the payment thereof, and that for no small summes of
money. Ordinary expences are ill husbanded; extraordinary,
worse payed. The Cities, they are consumed; Trading de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed;
the Subiects out of breath and purse, and by hauing
too much imposed vpon them, are growne (like ouer-labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
oxen) so poore, and so weake, that they are no longer
able to beare so great a burthen. And yet all this to them
(though the Subiect infinitely suffer) is no more then a drop
of water throwne into the sea, nor makes no more shew.
Which sea though it swallow vp all the fountaines of the
earth, all the brookes, and all the great and principall riuers,
and lesser springs, and this daily and hourely, and at all times,
yet we see the Sea is neuer a whit the more increased, nor
growes greater one yeare then another. But what should bee
the cause of this, let your Naturalists, and your Kings, render
such reasons as pleaseth them, in their excuse; for mine owne
part, I am of opinion, that the Kings Exchequer is not well
ordered, making him not onely a small, but a bad account;
That there is a great deale of disorder in the laying out of
those monies, whereof much might bee saued, if there were
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:2459:252"/>
some orderly course taken for the dispending of them, and
imploying them for their Kings best aduantage. And I feare
me, (which I could wish were causelesse) that a great part of
this water which should come directly to the Kings owne
cisterne, passeth through broken pipes, that is, through the
hands of euill Ministers, which soake and sucke vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
a great part thereof, and no man the wiser, where the
leake is, till it discouer it selfe. But it is now high time to grow
to an end, and I will conclude this Aduertisement with that
common Prouerbe, which speaketh thus; <hi>Quien mucho abar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,
poco aprieta:</hi> The ouer-griping hand holds but little; su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

that which that great Courtier and Fauourite <hi>Maecenas</hi> said,
That great treasures and riches are both more and better hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
vp, and receiue a fairer accumulation, by spending little,
then by scraping much.</p>

end grow iealous, and fearefull of the great power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of Fauourites, and more especially if they once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to waxe insolent, and abuse this their greatnesse. For
Kings are Companions, and fellow-seruants with vs in their
affections, and naturall passions; nay (by their leaue bee it
spoken) more subiect then we are vnto them; saue that they
suppresse them more in outward shew, and make not that
exteriour demonstration of them, in regard of that diuinitie,
which they pretend, and represent. And all of them will be
Masters of their entire will and absolute power. And that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourite
is fouly deceiued, and in a strange kinde of errour,
who in Court, by his secret plots, and close conueyance, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
to possesse his Kings heart, if hee conceiue by this
course to be the more secure. For very dangerous is that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
and place, which is built vpon such a foundation; and
very ticklish the state of a Fauourite, when a King carries
such respect vnto him. And the reason of this danger is
drawne from mans nature it selfe (which cannot, but in
Kings, be of farre greater force and strength) for there is not
that man liuing, which doth not hate and abhorre subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And this is so certaine a truth, that I perswade my selfe,
that I may truly giue this censure, and that I am no whit
mistaken therein; that the reason, why Kings doe more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
make and raise vp men vnto honour and greatnesse for
their owne proper guste and appetire, then for seruices and
deserts, is, for that in the former, they shew themselues to
be powefull, and to be owners of their owne cloath, which
they may cut out to more, or lesse, as it pleaseth them; But to
the second, they are debtors, a thing that is hatefull euen to
the best nature and disposition. And Fauourites likewise on
their part, are not to haue men, like swarmes of Bees, to hiue
themselues in their portalls, and to hang about them in clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
lest when that day shall come (as come it will) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they shall fall, the world take notice that it was his fauour,
and not his person that they followed. There are few <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,</hi>
                  <pb n="463" facs="tcp:2459:254"/>
but may <hi>Crateri,</hi> in Court; many that will follow
<hi>Alexanders</hi> fortune, but few his particular person.</p>
               <p>Let Fauourites likewise receiue this aduice and counsell
from the hand of the Euangelist Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> which was one
of the greatest Courtiers and Fauourites, which the King of
heauen had. The thing that I shall recommend to their
consideration, is this; That when <hi>Iohn</hi> fell downe to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
before the feet of the Angell, which had opened great
mysteries vnto him, and showne him the things which were
shortly to be fulfilled,<note place="margin">Apec. 22. 9.</note> the Angell said vnto him, <hi>Vide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to himselfe, and make vse thereof; so shall he be in grace with
King and people, and when men shall go about as it were to
adore him, and to make him a little God almighty, in doing
him worship and honour, let him by no meanes giue way
thereunto, but meekly acknowledge that he is but a creature,
as they are, and preuent them with that answer of the Angell,
<hi>Vide ne fec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

am your fellow-seruant. And great is that obligation which
they haue, which are raised to great place, to know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and not to shew themselues strangers to those that
haue beene their associates and companions in their meaner
fortunes, and with whom they haue held priuate familiarity
and friendship. And not to be like vnto <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Cup-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
who when he saw himselfe in that fauour and priuacie,
which his fellow-prisoner <hi>Ioseph</hi> had foretold, and progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticated
vnto him, neuer thought no more of it, but quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
both in and him, as if there had beene no such matter, or
man. It argues extreame lightnesse, and a naughty nature, that
a man should hoyse saile and be gone, when he hath a faire
winde, and not take him along with him, that hath ruune
through all perills and dangers with him, and indured all
brunts and stormes whatsoeuer. How shamefull a thing then
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:2459:255"/>
is it for them, who seeing themselues in prosperitie, turne
away their face from him, who ranne along with them in
their aduerser fortune. Especially considering they are not
certaine, how long this calme will endure, and what a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
it is in a storme, to haue a true friend to sticke close vnto
him. For it is a vsuall thing, to see him lowermost to day, that
yesterday stood vppermost in Fortunes wheele. And the
Moone, when it is at full, fore-tells a wane; and therefore that
which importeth them most, is, That they carry themselues
in a gentile fashion towards all men, and that their dealing be
plaine, and dis-interessed; whereby they shall not onely
keepe their old friends, but gaine new, and may very well
hope to be holpen by them, when they shall haue occasion
to vse them. For they must thinke, that the skie will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
bee cleare, clouds may arise, the Sunne withdraw his
light (for Kings wills and affections, like other mens, are
ambulatorie) and then in what a poore case is a Fauourite, if
he be left, like a single proposition, alone to himselfe: He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
(if he be wise) but make this account with himselfe, that
the greatest power stirreth vp the greatest enuie; and if many
combine against him (be he the greatest Fauourite that euer
was, or can bee supposed) they will shrewdly put him to his
trumpes, and if they be of as noble courage and wit, as they
are nobly descended, they will heaue him out of the saddle,
when he thinkes he sits surest. For concealed hatred is worse
then open enmitie. And therefore let him gaine new friends,
keepe his old, and not loose any one, of those he hath gotten.
For being left single, and alone, he shall bee like vnto that
white Crow in the Fable, whom the crowes would not
come neare, because of his colour; nor the pigeons keepe him
company, in regard of his greatnesse; so that all will flie from
him, and in the time of his greatest need hee shall be left all
alone. <hi>Vae soli:</hi> Woe bee to him that is alone. And the holy
Ghost seemeth to take pittie of him that is alone, for that if he
fall, he hath no body to helpe him vp.</p>
               <p>Let Fauourites likewise consider, that they are not, for
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:2459:255"/>
that their King hath exprest his affection vnto them, and
profest himselfe to bee their friend, to thinke, that (like a
dogge in a slip) they may leade him whither and which way
they list. For there are many things to be done, which hee
is to doe without them. For (as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith) that friendship
which admitteth not exception in some cases, is not so much
<hi>Amicitia,</hi> as <hi>Coniuratio;</hi> Amitie, as conspiracie. It is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by the learned Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> That true friendship is
grounded vpon that which is iust and honest; and is so limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that if it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> those bounds, it doth not onely loose it's
name, but affoords iust cause for a man to forgoe his friend.
Friendship is to be held, but alwayes with this <hi>prouiso,</hi> that
the Lawes of Iustice and Charitie bee duely obserued; and
when ought, contrary thereunto, is pretended, it is not lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
said to bee friendship; though vowes and protestations
haue past, for the better strengthening and confirming of it.
For if a King shall sweare amisse, and contrary to the rules
of charitie, he is not bound to cumply with his oath, nor is
there any reason for it in the world, why hee should in such
sort make deliuery and reason of his heart to his Fauourite,
and let him haue so much the hand of him, as to promise to
sticke vnto him, or to stand his friend in those things that are
vnlawfull and vniust. As those Kings. <hi>Assuerus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius</hi>
proceeded with <hi>Haman</hi> and <hi>Seianus;</hi> who, out of the fauour
that they bore vnto them, gaue them leaue to reuenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
of their enemies, and to execute all the tyrannies and
cruelties which they could deuise or imagine, to satisfie their
malice. A fault which deserued rather (and afterwards drew
on) their speedier and greater fall. And well doth that Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
deserue to be ruined, that shall presume to pretend <hi>hazer
raga</hi> (as they say) <hi>con suamo.</hi> To stand iust in the same streake
or line with his Master. For if God, who surpasseth in glory,
and from whom it is impossible to take the least atome there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and is able to turne all that he hath created into dust, will
not admit of a companion in matter of adoration and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:2459:256"/>
How much more will Kings of the earth bee offended,
and how ill must they take it, that any Subiect should equall
his shoulder, or share with him in his greatnesse, being his
honour is so shortned, and his power so limited? For, if out
of their loue to the person of the Fauourite, they beare with
him for a while, either for to shew themselues thankfull for
his good seruices, or haply to make him the instrument to
worke their reuenge on others; Yet these affections and
proofes (which I speake of) being once passed ouer, there
enters presently in the place thereof, a natural<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> are and iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
of their authority and greatnesse; which doth much
more sway with them, then the loue and affection which they
beare to the Fauourites person. Enuie likewise she comes in,
and playes her part (which is a neare neighbour, and still
ready at hand in Princes Courts and Pallaces) as if she were
Attorney generall of all those great places, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

her venome, secretly lying in waite, and watching her time
to doe mischiefe, stabbing suddenly, deaths wound being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
before it be dream't on; and great is the hurt which this
so neare a neighbour to the Kings elbow, doth; and out of
an in-bredspleene) aymeth at nothing more, then the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
of Fauourites. Complaints and grieuances, they also
make their appearance in Court, being the maine witnesses
that Enuie and Passion bring into the Court, to make good
their plea. Next after these, comes in the respect (not to say
the feare) of those that are discontented in all states; for no
King will be willing, that their Subiects vpon this ground
should build their rebellion, and cause an alteration in the
kingdome; and will be as loath to bee ball'd on, by grieued
and discontented persons, vpon iustly pretended complaints;
nor will he be so vnwise (for feare of other claps) to fauour
one, to offend many. All of them being shrewd blowes, for
to allay, if not quell the courage of the most passionate King
towards his dearest Fauourite; and are such fierce and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
conflicts, that they tosse his iudgement to and fro, with
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:2459:256"/>
farre greater violence, then a strong raging winde doth the

               <p>Gouernours and such as sit at the sterne of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and such, vnto whom Kings haue deliuered vp the
keyes of their heart, and hold the rudder of the Monarchie
in their hands, to steare and shape their course, as they will
themselues, there is no question to bee made of it, but that
they are in great danger vpon euery storme th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t shall arise;
for looke what misfortune shall befall the Commonwealth,
the blame shall be laid vpon them, and the fault imputed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to their ill counsell, or their ignorance, or their passion:
For ordinarily (nay I may say continually) the misfortunes
and ill successes of Kings, and kingdomes, I say the cause of
them is attributed to those that are nearest and dearest about
the Kings person, and possesse the highest places. And euery
one running along with the common opinion (and few are
they which haue not a smacke or taste thereof) laboureth to
lay the fault on his neighbour, though he be of his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
flesh and bloud. And this is an inheritance which wee
haue from our father <hi>Adam.</hi> And no man is ashamed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
for we are all of vs his heires; and therefore ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
(as much as in them lies) that the peace and quiet of
the kingdome bee not disturbed or troubled in the time of
their gouernment. As well for their glorie and reputation, to
haue in all their proceedings carried themselues in such sort,
that no ill accident hath betided them, or any maine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace;
as also for the not subiecting of themselues to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
chances of fortune, which are ordinary vpon euery
alteration, and may serue to worke their ruine and perdition.
Let therefore those haue an eye (I say it, and say it againe)
that are Priuie-Councellours to their King, and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
the Fauourite, to whom hee shall haue deliuered vp
the possession of his heart, that the aduice and counsell which
they shall giue vnto him, bee good, pure, and cleare water,
issuing from forth a pure, cleane, and disinteressed bosome.

which it passeth; if through mynes of brimstone, it scaldes
and burnes, if through craggy rocks, it cooles and stupefies;
and if through salt-pits, it is brinish and brackish. The like
iudgement may wee make of counsell; if it proceed from a

So that counsell is figured forth vnto vs in water: which in

much, that he giue good and sound aduice; for if it bee not
good, God doth permit, that it maketh for their owne great
hurt and perdition. As it succeeded with those Princes of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,
who so ill aduised their King against iust <hi>Daniel;</hi> God
so ordering the businesse, that the same ill that they intended
against him, fell vpon themselues, their wiues, and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
When God is willing to put his armes athwart, and to
crosse wicked purposes, little will auaile all the ill counsell in
the world, be the pate, that hatcheth it, as wise and as subtill
as <hi>Achitophels.</hi> As it fared with that great Fauourite of king
<hi>Assuerus,</hi> in that deuillish and malitious plot of his, which
he had imagined, and contriued against poore honest <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochee.</hi>
But this was to him, <hi>elsuenno del perro</hi> (as it is in the
Fable) like to the dogges dreame. There was a dogge that did
dreame, that he was eating a good morsell of flesh, and as he
was chopping of it vp, vttered some broken notes in his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
of the great content that he tooke therein. His Master
seeing him in this manner, takes vp a good cudgell, and
soundly lamm's him; the dogge awakes, findes himselfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
and runnes whining away. <hi>Haman,</hi> carried away with
the like conceit, prepares a gallowes for <hi>Mardochee,</hi> fiftie
cubits high, thinking thereon to hang him the next day; but
it was his ill lucke to supply the place himselfe. <hi>Consilia enim</hi>

<pb n="470" facs="tcp:2459:259"/>
are giuen contrary to good manners, light vpon their heads,
that gaue them. And therefore let Councellours bee well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised,
what counsell they giue. <hi>Aelian</hi> reporteth that there
was a very ancient Law, and duely kept in the kingdome of
<hi>Persia,</hi> that if any should aduise the King to any thing that
was not beneficiall to his person, and the commonwealth,
presently by the common Cryer, his ill counsell was publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and himselfe taken and stript, and openly whipt vp and
downe the streets. And if there were such a Law in force
here with vs, and as duely obserued, I assure my selfe, that
neither Kings would be so often deceiued, as now they are;
nor would there be so many vndertakers and proiectors, who
impudently presume to put into their heads, things that
are so pernicious to their owne conscience, and the publike
good.</p>
               <p>Supreme authoritie, Kings neither ought to giue, nor Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourites
take it. Let them (as much as they can) conceale
from the world, that great grace and fauour wherein they
stand with their King; but if there shall bee an impossibilitie
in that, yet there is none in this, to let pretenders know, that
all consisteth in the Prince; and to referre the conferring of
all benefits, fauours, and graces vnto him; and to let him haue
all the thankes, in matter of pensions, offices, or rewards;
and to attribute vnto him, all those successes, that fall out
well and happily, and all other good and prudent resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and to free him from the blame of those that shall
otherwise succeed. To treate him with much reuerence and
respect; to beare him exceeding great loue; And together
with these, to be wonderfull solicitous and carefull in all that
shall concerne his seruice. All of them being notable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
qualities, for to conserue Fauourites in their Kings
grace and good opinion, and to wedge their affection vnto
them. For loue must bee the doore, by which the grace of a
Prince is to enter. For hee must loue, that will bee beloued.
And hauing gained it by this meanes, he must keepe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:2459:259"/>
it, by reuerence and humilitie in his carriage, and by
being faithfull and diligent in his seruice. All which will be
lost by doing the contrary. And not onely ought they to
carry themselues thus towards their Kings, but are also to
esteeme and honour all, of all estates, in a fitting proportion,
according to euery mans qualitie and condition. Shewing
himselfe liberall, solicitous, peaceable, patient, louing, kinde,
and courteous towards all. All of them qualities that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
a Kings fauour, and gaine the peoples good will. A Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourite
must be modest, affable, and affoord a courteous hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
vnto all men. Besides, it is a part of Iustice so to doe, and
a very necessarie meanes to come to the knowledge of all
things, and to be the better prouided against whatsoeuer shall
occurre. Whereas on the contrary, to looke to be intreated,
and sued vnto, and not easie to bee spoken withall, argues a
kinde of pride and statelinesse, which all abhorre. This is
the doctrine of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> citing the example of <hi>Seianus,</hi> the
Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> his great Fauourite; who being growne
into grace with him, the better to conserue himselfe therein,
forthwith endeauoured to fauour and pleasure all your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
and noble persons in their pretensions. For in all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
he conceiued, hee might expect more kindnesse from
them, then from the baser and meaner sort of people; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he came to bee loued of the one, and feared of the other;
and by all of them, to be serued and obeyed. Insomuch that
there was not any one who did not seeke vnto him to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
and make intercession for them, with <hi>Tiberius.</hi> And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he was not ignorant, that hee was superiour to them all,
and inferiour to none, yet did he neuer grow neglectfull of
his humble carriage, and reuerent respect to his Prince, and
a due regard vnto all. Hitherto hee proceeded fairely, and
went on well, and may serue for a patterne and example for
Fauourites; but in the rest for a <hi>prouiso,</hi> and admonition for
Kings. For after that ambition and couetousnesse entred into
his heart, that consuming moath, and deuouring worme of all
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:2459:260"/>
goodnesse, he presently procured the charge or place of <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus
Praetorius,</hi> or Captainship of the Guard; and within a
short time grew to be so absolute therein, that he became as
it were Lord and Master of his Prince, and crusht all that
stood in his way, or might be of any impediment to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacie.
He sought alwayes to bee with him, lest others might
creepe in betwixt him and home, and possesse his place: still
humbly beseeching him, that he would imploy him in busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of greatest danger and trouble, and such as might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
most to the benefit of the Emperours life and state. A
maine point, wherewith to oblige his Prince vnto him, and
to make him the more acceptable in his sight. For those that
are nearest about Kings, and are in greatest fauour with him,
ought in the greatest dangers to set their foot formost, and to
be the forwardest aduenturers. He did seeke to ouercome Art,
by Art, inducing <hi>Tiberius,</hi> to retire himselfe to places of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
that were remote and farre from Court, to the end that
whilest he was recreating himselfe abroad, he might dispose
of him, as it pleased him. He told him, that solitude was the
best and onely course for the resoluing of the graue and
weighty affaires of the Empire, which otherwise by diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
might receiue the same hurt and hinderance, as they
were wont to haue heretofore. And what with this, and with
giuing him to vnderstand, that he would quit him of all the
ordinarie cares and troubles of Court (most men vsually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
to shunne trouble, and to take their ease and pleasure)
hee perswaded him to go to <hi>Capri,</hi> that hee, in the meane
while, might rule and gouerne all. And in the end grew to
be so great and powerfull, and to take such state vpon him,
that hee would not giue audience to any, reducing them to
those tearmes, that they should speake and negociate by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
to the end that nothing might bee treated or resolued
of, without his priuie saying; That by reducing businesses to
papers and memorialls, answer might bee giuen vnto them
with more deliberation, and better consideration then by
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:2459:260"/>
word of mouth. A meere Artifice, &amp; cunning trick of his own
inuention, to make himselfe absolute Master of all, and (which
is more) of the heart of his Prince. God deliuer vs from such
ambitious, interessed, and couetous Ministers, whose maine
care, is their owne particular, and to heape vp riches for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and his; and make it their whole study and onely end to
keepe and continue themselues in their kings grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour;
and to deale with their Prince, as the Ante doth with
the corne, which that it may not grow againe, and that hee
may the better and more conueniently make profit thereof,
presently eates out the heart of it. God likewise free Kings,
from this base subiection, and insensibilitie, and from men of
that qualitie and condition, which desire to rule and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
all. For the one cannot escape a storme; and the other
must runne great hazard of being drowned therein.</p>
               <p>Let the last aduertisement bee the example of a great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourite,
whose name is <hi>Aurelius Cassidorus,</hi> borne in the
Prouince of <hi>Calabria,</hi> and highly aduanced in Magistracies,
and Gouernments of both Empires, Rome and Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople;
who being renowned for his cheualrie, and noble feates
of armes, defended the Islands of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Calabria</hi> from
many, and those very powerfull enemies. In his younger
yeares, he attained to all the liberall arts, in that perfection,
that hee made the present and succeeding times, to admire
him. And for his great parts and abilities, was entertained
by <hi>Theodoricus,</hi> King of the <hi>Ostro-Gothes;</hi> hee was receiued
into his seruice, and grew so farre into his fauour, by reason
of his vnderstanding, wisedome, and dextrousnesse, in treating
businesses, that he first of all made him his Secretarie; in which
Office, he behaued himselfe so well, that by degrees, he went
climbing vp to the high Offices and dignities in the State;
which in those dayes were not conferred out of fauour, but
meere desert. From being Secretary, he came to bee Lord
Chancellour, and Senatour in the Citie of <hi>Rauenna,</hi> being
honoured besides with diuerse offices in the Kings Court.
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:2459:261"/>
Afterwards he was made Viceroy of the Prouinces of <hi>Sicilia</hi>
and <hi>Calabria;</hi> and for addition of honour, had the title of
<hi>Patritius</hi> giuen him, which in those dayes was in great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme.
Hee was Lord Treasurer, and Master of the Palace;
which was as it were a superintendent ouer the <hi>Palatines,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an order of Knights and Gentlemen, that had Offices,
and other preheminences in Court. He held the dignitie of
<hi>Praefectus Praetorius,</hi> being as it were the second person of
the King; to whom, the weightiest businesses of peace and
warre were remitted: and what therein he determined and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
vpon, was receiued as an oracle that could not erre.
Though now adayes, little credit is giuen to the words of
great persons and powerfull Ministers, and not without
cause; for that many of them say, and do not; promise much,
and performe little. And your Fauourites, which haue great
both place and power about their Kings, are in such good
opinion and credit likewise with the world, that they present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleeue whatsoeuer they say; and see what they professe,
is approued by them, as if it were a sentence pronounced
from the mouth of a most iust Iudge: And therefore they
ought well and wisely to consider what they speake, and not
to inlarge themselues in words, putting those that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
in great good hopes. Which if they shall not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
take effect, will proue to bee no other then that faire
and beautifull fruite, whose sight pleaseth the eye; but whose
taste killeth the body. In conclusion, this Fauourite, by round
after round, clambred vp to all the honourablest offices, and
greatest dignities of the kingdome. He came to bee <hi>Consull,</hi>
which charge hee administred with extraordinary integritie
and vertue. All the Magistracies, Offices, and Gouernments
which he held, were but as so many steps one to the other;
which the Princes, vnder whom he serued, went still increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and augmenting. For he carried himselfe so wisely and
discreetly in them, that there was not that office that hee
bore, which did not make him the meritour and deseruer of
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:2459:261"/>
another farre greater and better then it. And all did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and confesse, that his merits and deserts were farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then all the offices put together which hee enioyed and
administred. In those whom he represented and recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his King, to the end that his Maiestie might conferre
some one fauour or another vpon them, he euermore had an
eye to the necessitie of the office, and the qualitie of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Things wherein Fauourites ought to bee very carefull,
when they imploy their fauour in furthering any man; as
whether they be moued thereunto vpon a iust or ill affection,
or by the sole vertue and merit of the person, &amp;c. And not to
thinke with themselues, that because they are in great grace
and fauour with their King, that it is lawfull for them to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the Law of Iustice, which ought to bee equall to all,
(which in eyes, not blinded with passion and couetousnesse,
she her selfe makes it plainly appeare) and to thrust the better
deseruer besides that dignitie and office which is due vnto
him. Which is a Law that obligeth all, for that it is a naturall
obligation, and hath all the Lawes of reason on it's side,
which are more powerfull then either the will of Kings, or
their Fauourites. The not keeping whereof, is but a large
and swift running fountaine of complaints and distasts. The
one, to see themselues reiected, and excluded from publike
honours: The other, to see them put forward, whom nature
hath not adopted, nor learning, nor vertue, but either good
or bad diligences. And that these shall haue preferments, and
get the start of other men, it is because either loue or interest
makes them to be held more worth; when as the other, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for that they are not in the like fauour, or not so fit for their
ends (for Fauourites fauour few, saue such as will bee instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their wills) though otherwise they bee of better
parts, better qualified, and of stronger abilities, are left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded,
and are quite forgotten. And these that are thus
made vp in haste, and so suddenly raised from that nothing,
which they were, to that greatnesse wherein they are, must
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:2459:262"/>
of force sometimes with the same haste and speedinesse
(though fore against their wills) for the auoiding of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences,
bee pulled downe from this their high seate, and
placed in some other, that may seeme to sute better with them,
wherein the like suspition may iustly bee conceiued of their
insufficiencie.</p>
               <p>This great Fauourite had likewise so good a Head-peece,
and knew so well how to gouerne vpon all occasions, and all
the accidents of that age, as well the good, as bad, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
and vnfortunate successes of those times, that howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
many were the changes of those Kings, yet was he still in
the same height of esteeme, was superiour vnto fortune, being
in all those alterations, her Lord and Master. All the Kings
of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> whom hee serued, did him very particular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours.
And although King <hi>Theodoricus</hi> was a very fortunate
and valiant Prince, yet did a great part of his happinesse and
felicitie consist in this, in hauing his Fauourite <hi>Cassiodorus</hi>
alwayes at his elbow, and in receiuing his good proiects, and
sound aduice which (when occasion offered) were neuer
wanting vnto him.<note place="margin">Sen lib. 10. Epist. 72.</note> That being (according vnto <hi>Seneca)</hi> the
best part of counsell, which comes in it's due time and season;
Whereas that comes too late, and without any fruit, which is
not ready at hand. For occasion (whereunto wee must oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre)
oftentimes betakes her selfe to her wings, and flies out
of our reach, if we be not quicke and nimble in laying hold
on her foretop. So that all the while that this <hi>Cassiodorus</hi>
was in their seruice, their kingdome and Signorie continued
in a most flourishing estate. So much can a man of such cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and counsell doe in a commonwealth. For with such a
Ministers presence, all things stand vpright, and go well and
handsomely on; but in his absence, and when he is wanting,
all things go backward. For, being that all these things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
next after God, on the worth and wisedome of him
that hath the managing of them; by his death or absence,
they runne a great hazard of miscarrying, or suffer some
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:2459:262"/>
great hurt or detriment; as was to be seene in those successes
of the Grecian Empire; which (no sooner was that great go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour
<hi>Alexander</hi> dead, vnder whose protection it went
increasing, and liued in so much peace and securitie) but it
vanished like so much froath. For of how much the more
price and esteeme peace is, by so much the more is it hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the losse of those that maintaine and vphold it. Now
this so excellent and worthy a Minister, when as nothing
was wanting vnto him, saue the putting on of a Kings
Crowne, refused it, became a Friar, and tooke vpon him the
habite of the order of <hi>San Benito.</hi> And did so exercise himselfe
in continuall prayer and contemplation, that euen whilest he
liued here vpon earth, they held him for a Saint. And if he
were so worthy a man in that age, seruing the Kings of the
earth, with so much punctualitie and sinceritie; it is not to be
doubted, but that hee was as precise in his sanctitie and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of life, when he rendred himselfe a slaue, and seruant to
his Lord and Master the King of heauen. For your excellent
wits, which know how to make aduantage of all things, and
that nothing comes amisse vnto them, when they are once
resolued to serue God, they do truly humble themselues, and
with a strong determination, tread and trample the world
vnder their feet, and whatsoeuer therein is, and imbrace and
take hold on Christ. And being thus occupied in holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,
laden with yeares, hee departed out of this life, to that
which was eternall, hauing inioyed some yeares of that quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and abundance of peace, wherewith he did essay to die
well, (which being so dangerous, so difficult, and darke a
passage, too little care is commonly had therein) hee passed
from this short stride betwixt life and death, to the eternitie
of such an estate, as we yet know not what it shall be, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames
being (as we see) so farre distant.</p>
               <p>All that hath beene hitherto said both in generall and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
concerning a Monarchie, and kingdome, shall not be
fruitlesse, nor the time lost, that hath beene spent in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:2459:263"/>
or shall be spent in the reading of this Treatise, if it be
well and truly considered. For by the perusall thereof, Kings
and Princes may come to know a thousand seuerall semblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Ministers, and disguised countenances of hypocriticall
Courtiers, and the diuers dispositions and humours, as well
of the ambitious as the couetous; their affections, conditions,
and naturall inclinations, whether they be by nature of great
and vnruly spirits, or whether they bee by fortune put into
great places. For this, without doubt, changeth man from
his first estate, and apparrelleth him with other particular
affections; And in the true knowledge of these, consisteth
the augmentation, conseruation, and good gubernation of
kingdomes, and commonwealths: as also the reputation,
credit, opinion, and authoritie of Kings. In a word, they may
out of these doctrines, and aduertisements, collect and know
how at one time the naturall dispositions, customes, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the vulgar, stand affected, and how at another time
those that are not so vulgar, and of so low a ranke, and how
at all times to make vse of this knowledge, for the better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
and inlarging of their power and greatnesse; and
how, and in what manner, they are to carry themselues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them; as also those other, that are to aide and assist in
gouernment. For there is not any thing of more price, or more
to be valued by Kings, then this knowledge of the affections,
as well for the discerning those of others, as the moderating
of their owne. And as it were to make a iudgement, and to
prognosticate by them, the end of the actions of those that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> about, and where they intend to make their stop, and set
vp their rest, be they foes, or friends. And by the actions of
those that are present (be they Confederates, Ministers, and
dependents) their ends, designes, and pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ensions. And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in those who cleaue closer to their Kings fortune,
then his person. Points, whereon doth hang the hinge, and
wherein are included and shut vp, all both the particular and
generall passages of gouernment, and of that art, and science,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:2459:263"/>
which they call by the common name of Reason of State.
And although I know for certaine, that there will not such
be wanting, that will laugh and scoffe at these my Politicall
Aduertisements; some because they would be accounted the
onely men seene in this Science, and would make themselues
the onely admired men amongst the vulgar, and that there is
not any one that is a professour in that Art, that vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
their plots and designes: Others, lesse malignant, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ignorant of the secrets of this Science, iudging it to be an
Art, full of impossibilities, will not trouble themselues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall,
nor looke into the Mysteries thereof, as if by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
they were not able to iudge of the causes of things; and
by the carriage and successe of former businesses, to diuine of
the ends and designes of those which are now on foot. And
others, farre worse then these, who although they come to
know this truth, deny the same, and seeke many colours both
for the disgracing of it, and the Author; and for no other
reason in the world, but because they are professed enemies,
to whatsoeuer counsell, that is not of their owne hatching,
fearing that it might quit something of the glory of their
ambition. And for that they will haue nothing thought to be
good, but what issues from forth their owne braine, they blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
(saith Saint <hi>Iames)</hi> and speake euill of that which they
know not; and not onely not admit and receiue that good
which is propounded vnto them; but (as that kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
saith) because they will neither vnderstand nor heare it,
like the Adder, they stop their eares with the taile of their
ignorance, fearing lest they should be charmed by some supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
wit, and better vnderstanding. Yet notwithstanding, fall
backe, fall edge, come what will of it, I haue cumplyed with
my desire, and (which is more) with my obligation. And
if it shall proue to be of any vse, profit, and seruice, for King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
and for the great Councellours and Ministers of their: king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
(which haue most need thereof) to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

which are not in that nature. And though haply it may not
bee auaileable for amendment, yet may it serue for a <hi>desen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganno,</hi>
and dis-deceiuing of those that are in an errour. And
in case it shall not take this effect, there will be no harme done
by committing it to the Presse, though it bee afterwards bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in the dust, as it hath befallen other farre better things
then these; And Time, which couers what is past, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
what is to come, will in it's time discouer this, and such
other things, as are not yet come to light. And for this cause,
they called <hi>Archimedes</hi> the Syracusan, The Inuenter of new
Things, and the Register of old. And certaine it is, that
amongst the Ancients, there was a great agreement and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice
in the gouernment of some commonwealths, as was
that of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> of the <hi>Allmanes,</hi>
and aboue all, of the <hi>Romane</hi> Commonwealth; Which Saint
<hi>Austen</hi> did so much admire. And men looking no further
then to that which is before them, haue, in a manner, quite
forgotten that, and therefore it is fit that there should bee
some Remembrancer, that by putting them in minde of that
which is past, they may the better performe things for the
present, and prouide for that which is to come. For (as <hi>Plato</hi>
said, though in another sence) all our knowledge is but a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordation
of things past; and therein he said well. For a great
part of those nouelties, which are daily introduced, are but
old things, that haue layen long in obliuion; and that which
is done to day, we finde, is forgotten to morrow. And in the
reuolution of time, comes (in after ages) to represent it selfe
for new. And this (amongst many others) was the maine
cause which moued me to write this Treatise, and which may
incourage me to go on further, though I must confesse, that
my penne hath out runne my intention, finding that I haue

proper, as that which all, and euery one, doth or ought to
beare vnto his owne King and Lord Adding thereunto mine
owne particular respect, in regard of my nearer reference to
his Maiesties seruice? And no small spurre hereunto, was my
honest true meaning heart, and the assurance of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
whose whole studie and desire in this my labour
hath beene, to hit as right as I could vpon that which might
be most conuenient, for the augmentation, conseruation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
authoritie, and greatnesse of Kings; as likewise,
what I thought would bee most necessarie for the wellfare
and good gouernment of kingdomes and particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths.
For this doth depend on that. Though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
there be few that thinke thereon. For most (I feare me)
treate onely their owne businesse, making that the principall,
and all the rest accidentall. Howbeit they will not sticke to
say, and publish to the world, that they onely attend the
conseruation of their Kings and Commonwealths, Would
to God that it might not be said of them, which he himselfe
