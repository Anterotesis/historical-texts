         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Inhabitants of the Earth.</head>
            <p>OH Earth, Earth, Earth, hear, fear, dread and tremble before the
Lord God of Power; for with Strength is he riſen to make <hi>inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi>
after his Seed which is ſown amongſt you; and now turn in
and ſee what an account you can give: for of a truth every one of
you in particular have received a talent of the Lord; wherefore <hi>ſtand in awe,
and commune with your own hearts,</hi> and ſee what uſe you have made of your
Lord's money, who are found beating and impriſoning of your fellow-ſervants,
and are found in Pride, Drunkenneſs, Gluttony, Strife, Envyings, Murmuring,
Curſing, Swearing and Lying; Weep, howl, and roar all you, who are found
<hi>lovers of Pleaſures more than lovers of God,</hi> and have <hi>put the Day of the Lord afar
off;</hi> who <hi>hath viſited you dayes without number,</hi> and <hi>would often have gathered you,
even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, but ye would not;</hi> therefore,
behold, Deſolation is near unto all the unprofitable ſervants: for utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
muſt be their portion, and weeping and wailing and gnaſhing of teeth;
becauſe, <hi>when I called none did anſwer, and when I ſpake none would hear,</hi> ſaith the
Lord; therefore is the Day haſtening <hi>which ſhall burn as an oven, and all the evil-doers
ſhall be caſt therein.</hi> And as I was made ſenſible of theſe things, with my
mind ſtayed upon the Lord out of viſible things, a Love ſprang up in me to the
precious Seed of God, which lies hid in your earthen veſſels; and in this Love
was I conſtrained to lay pen to paper, only to ſhew you, how way may be made
for the deliverance of this Seed: And though many Warnings have been ſent
into the World by the Servants of the Lord, yet notwithſtanding, this doth not
clear me in his ſight; for a neceſſity being laid upon me concerning thoſe who
are yet ſenſible of the gift of God, which is given to every one to profit withal:
Therefore, to you that are ſenſible of ſuch a manifeſtation of God's Love, be
faithful, and deal faithfully with your own hearts concerning theſe things
which are here delivered; I ſay, turn in and conſider what you are a doing,
and how it ſtands with you, that if the Lord ſhould require your Lives at your
hands, what an account can you give before the Lord God? <hi>for if you do well, you
ſhall be accepted; but if not, ſin lies at your doors;</hi> for the Vials of God's Wrath are
to be poured forth, and the laſt Trumpet is to be ſounded; therefore you dead,
<hi>Ariſe, ariſe, and come to Judgment:</hi> for through the clouds is God coming, and
through the thick darkneſs is he breaking; that way may be made for his Light
to ſpring through all that ariſes contrary to it ſelf, that his Work may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on by his powerful and out-ſtretched Arm of ſtrength: for he will break
to pieces all that ariſes contrary to himſelf; for as Potters veſſels will they be
before him, who refuſe <hi>to let Him reign, whoſe right it is:</hi> for of a truth our God
is ariſen to plead his <hi>righteous Cauſe</hi> with all the Inhabitants of the Earth; for
the Cauſe of the poor and needy is come before him: Therefore ye high and
lofty ones conſider what you are a doing; for certainly, it is now required of
all, both high and low, rich and poor, to come away and bring their deeds to the
Light, for there you are to be tryed, even by the touch-ſtone of his loving-kindneſs,
which hath weighed you in the equal ballance, and you are found too
light; therefore ſink down to God's ſecret Witneſs, which cryes daily unto
you to return: Repent, ye backſliders, and his free Love you will find, to
which if you take diligent heed, you will do well, and will come to be made
partakers of this ſame free Love which is laid up in ſtore for thoſe that fear
his Name, and walk uprightly before him: for I am conſtrained to beſeech
you in tender bowels of love to your ſouls, that you would be reconciled to the
Lord; for that which is to be known of God is manifeſted <hi>within you,</hi> even as
it is written, <hi>a manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every one to profit withal;</hi> and
this is his Love to you, which ſtands a Witneſs againſt all ſin and evil in your
own Conſciences; and as this is minded, obeyed and followed, it will lead
out of ſin and evil, into Righteouſneſs, Holineſs and Purity of life; for
that which reproves you in ſecret, when no mortal eye ſeeth you, for lying,
ſwearing, cheating and cozening, and all manner of ſin and evil, is the Spirit
of God's Love, which as you keep your minds to it, it will teach you to live
<hi>godly, righteouſly and ſoberly in this preſent world:</hi> Therefore be awakened all
you who have a ſenſible feeling of God's gift, which will not deceive you, but
deal plainly with you, and inſtruct you in the path of Righteouſneſs: come
away therefore and try this <hi>true Teacher;</hi> for God is at work for the glory of
his Name, and the Redemption of his Seed; (Let him that readeth underſtand)
I ſpeak this to thoſe who have not loſt their ſenſible ſtate of the Love of God,
which is made known to mankind; and as your ears are open to this <hi>true Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi>
he will tell you all that ever you have done, and then will it be given
you to know that this is he indeed, <hi>which is come to ſave his People from their
ſins:</hi> Therefore come forth out of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s ſins, or elſe with her muſt you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of her plagues; for the Vials of God's Wrath are to be poured on <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
and all thoſe that with her in her ſins are partakers, they muſt alſo partake
with her in her plagues, even ye <hi>Babylons Prieſts</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> blind leaders of
the blind; therefore into the ditch muſt ye fall together: for the <hi>great Whore</hi>
it is who hath ſet her ſelf like a Queen, and hath ſaid in her heart, <hi>Aha! I ſhall
feel no ſorrow;</hi> who hath made the Nations drunk with the Cup of her Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and hath rode upon the Beaſt and falſe Prophets, and hath made her
ſelf drunk with the Blood of the Saints; with her is God's Controverſie to be
known, and with her will he plead, who hath carried a golden Cup in her
hand, and hath deceived many therewith. <hi>Let them that reade, underſtand:</hi>
for <hi>Kings will he bind in Chains, and their Nobles in fetters of Iron,</hi> for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of his Seed: for the Refiner is come with his Fan in his hand, <hi>who
will thorowly purge his floor,</hi> and the <hi>Droſs</hi> and the <hi>Tin</hi> will our God thorowly
ſweep away; wherefore lift up your eyes and behold, for the Harveſt is near,
wherein the Wheat is to be gathered into his garner, but the Tares muſt be
burnt with unquenchable fire. <hi>Lament, lament</hi> therefore all you that are
<pb facs="tcp:172637:1"/>
ſenſleſs of theſe things; for be it known unto you that the day is at hand, and
on you ſhall it come as a thief in the night, and for your unprofitableneſs your
talents muſt be taked from you, and into utter darkneſs muſt you be caſt, and a
<hi>night</hi> of deſtruction muſt you feel, who refuſe to walk as Children of the <hi>Day,</hi>
but live in <hi>wantonneſs</hi> as if there was no God: but, if his Mercies will not <hi>allure</hi>
you, his Judgments will <hi>affright</hi> you, and then will you call to the Mountains
to fall upon you, to cover you from the Wrath of Him which <hi>now</hi> calls unto
you for <hi>newneſs of life: For the day is far ſpent, and the night cometh wherein no
man can work;</hi> therefore, <hi>repent, repent, and ceaſe from the evil of your doings, or
elſe you ſhall ſurely periſh;</hi> for <hi>Judgment is begun at the Houſe of God;</hi> and <hi>if the
Righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, what will become of the Ungodly? and where will the
ſinner appear, which turns God's grace into wantonneſs, and caſts his Law behind
their backs, and will have none of his Counſel; but harden their hearts, and ſtiffen
their necks, and walk ſtubbornly before the Lord?</hi> Why, for ſuch doth my ſoul
mourn, and I could even take up a complaint for them before the Lord all the
day long, for the ſake of the Seed of God, which lies in <hi>bondage</hi> under your
<hi>Egyptian nature;</hi> and becauſe of theſe things the <hi>Curſe of Egypt</hi> and the <hi>Plagues
of Pharoah</hi> is to be your portion, and the portion of all thoſe who refuſe to let
the Seed of God go free. And be it known unto you all who ſhall reade theſe
lines, That the powerful God of <hi>Jacob</hi> is ariſen in ſtrength, as in the dayes of
old, for the ſakes of his <hi>Choſen Seed;</hi> therefore, <hi>touch not his Anointed, do his
Prophets no harm,</hi> ye ſtiff-necked and rebellious generation, a <hi>ſeed of evil-doers;
for as your fathers did, ſo do ye,</hi> in whoſe Courts are found <hi>all the righteous blood
of the Saints and Martyrs</hi> in the dayes of old, <hi>even from the blood of</hi> Abel <hi>until
now,</hi> it is <hi>all</hi> to be required of <hi>this Generation.</hi> And be it known unto you, <hi>O
ye rebellious Children,</hi> that God's Controverſie is <hi>with you,</hi> and <hi>with you</hi> will he
plead in Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, concerning your Deſtruction which you
bring upon your ſelves; for, this is the Cry that is gone through the Land,
<hi>Why will you die, why will you die you ſinners, and why will you not come to him who
is Life?</hi> therefore is your deſtruction of your ſelves, for our God is clear of
every man's blood, <hi>their blood ſhall be upon their own heads;</hi> for God in his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Wiſdom hath choſen us, who are as a poor deſpiſed people amongſt you, to
walk in a blameleſs life before you faithfully; who, as we have received of the
Lord, ſo have our Lights ſhined before you; and as we have been kept in our
meaſures, ſo have we cleared our ſelves concerning this wicked and adultrous
generation; for long furrows have been plowed on our backs, becauſe with
your evils we could not joyn; <hi>but the rod of the wicked ſhall not alwayes reſt upon
the backs of the Righteous:</hi> Therefore you Saints, lift up your heads and rejoyce
in the Lord, who hath choſen you out of this preſent evil world, and hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
you to be <hi>a Peculiar People to himſelf; who in time paſt did run with them
into the ſame exceſs of riot, but now are redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;</hi> ſo that
<hi>there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh
but after the Spirit;</hi> for the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made
us free from the Law of Sin and Death; and here he helpeth our infirmities,
and doth work all our works in us and for us through the Croſs, which by us is
taken up and followed: And here we can leave all behind us, and nothing is
too dear for us to lay down for the <hi>Teſtimony of a good Conſcience;</hi> and our Faith
hath been tryed amongſt you concerning theſe things, and this hath been and
is the Lord's large Love to us, who hath not left us in our tryals, but hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
us, and hath <hi>been with us in ſix troubles, and in ſeven hath he given us
courage and boldneſs,</hi> that under his Banner we ſhould be Noble Warriors, againſt
all that ariſes contrary to the Lord, <hi>againſt whom</hi> (you will be made to ſay) <hi>it is
in vain to ſtrive;</hi> you Unbelievers who cannot believe our report, when to you
we have been made to bring glad-tydings of the Goſpel of Peace; Oh you
hard-hearted, you unbelievers, no marvel if you periſh! for you wonder at
the works of our God, and yet you cannot believe in them; for, <hi>the ax is laid
to the root of the trees, and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is to be hewen
down and caſt into the fire:</hi> Therefore conſider this, all you high and lofty ones,
and lay it to heart; for theſe Warnings are not come forth in vain. Ye <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Vipers,</hi> how do you think to eſcape <hi>the Wrath of God who neglect ſo great
Salvation?</hi> who have <hi>itching ears</hi> that <hi>cannot endure ſound Doctrine,</hi> do you think
to flee from the Wrath of God? I tell you, Nay; <hi>If ye live after the fleſh, you
ſhall dye; but if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live
for to be carnally minded is death, but to be ſpiritually minded is life and peace.</hi> Wo,
wo unto all you who are found eating and drinking, and riſing up to play! and
this is the reaſon that <hi>Play-houſes</hi> and <hi>Bear-baitings</hi> are appointed, where you
daily meet together on heaps to fulfil the luſts of the fleſh; but thoſe that fear
the Lord are <hi>kept out of their own hired-houſes,</hi> and are made to ſtand in your <hi>open
ſtreets</hi> to worſhip God, as they are perſwaded in their own conſciences. <hi>Lament,
lament</hi> for theſe ſins, for God's Controverſie is with all you who are found in
this ſtate, and as <hi>Witneſſes</hi> do we ſtand againſt you: <hi>For the candle of the wicked
is to be put out, and then a woful day will be known unto all thoſe who are left in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi>
they will not know whither to go, &amp; then no marvel if they ſtumble and are
offended: for, <hi>Behold, in Zion is laid a ſtumbling-ſtone and a rock of offence unto all
thoſe that walk in darkneſs, on whom this ſtone will fall and grinde them to powder.</hi>
Let them that have ears to hear, hear; for the Earth is to be judged, and the
Light is to ſhine. And ſo <hi>to God's pure Witneſs in every conſcience</hi> do I refer my
Cauſe, which will ſeal to the truth of my Lines; which are written for no other
end but for the ſake of the Seed of God, which my ſoul longs (yea, and travels
daily) for the deliverance of, that it might be brought out of Captivity; who
