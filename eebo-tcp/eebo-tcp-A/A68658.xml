            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VNderstande (good reader) that this great clearke and blessed Martir, bishop Nicholas Ridley sought not (by setting furthe this notable godly piece of learned worke) the vayne glorie of the world, nor temporal frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of men for his present aduauncement, muche lesse he hunted hereby for Bishoprikes and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as all his aduersaries (the enemies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes truthe and ordinaunce) the Papistes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly doo: but hauing consideracion of the great charge of soule committed vnto him, and of thaccompte therof which the iustice of God wolde require at his handes, intending therwithall to be founde blameles in the great daye of the Lorde, seing he was put aparte to defende the Gospel. he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forsoke landes, goodes, world, frendes, and him selfe withall, and testified the truthe specified in this boke by his learned mouthe in the open pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the worlde: but also (to leaue a sure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument and loue token vnto his flocke) he hathe regestred it by his owne penne in this forme en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suyng, and sealed it vp with his blood. Forasmuch than as he hath approued him selfe no vayne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putour, no wethercocke, nor hipocrite, seyng he hathe willingly geuen his lyfe for the truthe: and inasmuche also as his loue and most constaunt christian conscience speaketh frely vnto thee, gentill reader: I beseche thee for Christes sake and thyne owne, lende him thine indifferent heart, and pacient hearyng. <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g>

            </p>
            <p>Here wher Luke sayeth, <hi>which is geuen:</hi> Paule sayeth, <hi>which is broken.</hi> And as Luke addeth to the wordes of Paule spoken of the cuppe <hi>(which is shedde for you)</hi> so likewise Paule ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the wordes therof, <hi>This doo, as often as you shall drinke it in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of me.</hi> The rest that folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth in S.

            <p>Thus the Euangelistes &amp; S.

But this reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce which is thus ordayned, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> autor therof is Christ (bothe God and man) so by the almightie power of God, it farre pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth all kyndes of remembraunces, that any other man is able to make eyther of hym selfe or of any other thing. For who so euer receaueth this holy Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thus ordayned in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Christ, he receaueth ther
<pb facs="tcp:16455:6"/>
with either deathe or life. In this (I trust) we doo all agree. For S. Paule sayeth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly receauours in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 10. chap. of his furst epistle vnto the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: <hi>The cuppe of blessing, which we blesse, is it not the partaking or felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weship of Christes blood?</hi> And also he sayeth. <hi>The bread which we breake</hi> (&amp; meaneth at the Lordes table) <hi>is it not the partaking or feloweship of Christes bodye?</hi> Now the partaki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of Christes body and of his blood vnto the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and godly, is the partaking or fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweship of life &amp; immortalitie. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayn of the badde and vngodly recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, S. Paule as playnly sayeth thus: <hi>He that eateth of this bread, eand drynketh of this cuppe vnworthily: is giltie of the body and blood of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde.</hi> O how necessary tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Note.</hi>
               </note> if we loue life, &amp; wolde eschue deathe, to trye and examine our selues, before we eate of this bread, and drynke of this cuppe: for elles assuredly, he that eateth and drynketh therof vnworthily, eateth &amp; drynketh his owne damnacion, bicau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se he estemeth not the Lordes body: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, he reuerenceth not the Lordes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honour that is due vnto him.</p>
            <p>And that which was sayd, that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:16455:6"/>
the recept of the holy Sacrament of the blessed body and blood of Christ is receaued of euery one, good &amp; badde, either life or deathe, it is not me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that they which are dead before God, maie hereby receaue life: or the lyuing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God can hereby receaue deathe. For as non is mete to receaue natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fode, wherby y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> natural life is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, except he be borne &amp; liue before: so no man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fede (by the recept of this holy sacrament) of the fode of eternal life, except he be regenerated &amp; borne of God before. And on the other syde, no man here receaueth damnacion which is not dead before.</p>
            <p>Thus hitherto without all doubt, God is my witnesse, I saye so farre as I doo knowe, ther is no controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie among them that be learned, in the churche of Englande (concerning the mater of this sacrament) but all doo agree, whether they be newe or olde: and to speake playne, and as som of them doo odiously call either other: whether they be protestauntes, papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, Pharisees, or gospellers.

And bicause charitie wolde, that we should, (if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and so farre as we maye with the sauegarde of good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, &amp; mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce of the truthe) agree with all men: therfore me thinkes, it is not charitably done to burthen any man (either newe or olde, as they cal them) further, than such doo declare them selues, to dissent from that we are persuaded to be truthe, or pretende therto to be controuersies, wher as non suche are in dede: and so to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplye the debate, the which the more it dothe encreace, the further it dothe departe from the vnitie, that the true christian should desyre.</p>
            <p>And agayn, this is true, that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the nother nedeth nor wilbe mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned with lies. It is also a true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, that it is euen synne, to lye vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the deuil:<note place="margin">

Alas let men leaue lyeng, and speake the truthe euery one, not only to his neighbour, but also of his neighbour: for we are membres one of an other, sayeth saint Paule. The controuersie (no doubt) which at this daye troubleth the churche (wherin any meane learned man, either olde or newe, dothe stande in) is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the holy Sacrament of the body
<pb facs="tcp:16455:8"/>

For all doo graunt, that S.

               </note>Thus tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hitherto yet, we al agree.

The vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of it, wherin it chiefli sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, is a steppe to the true searching furthe of the truth. For who can seke well a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, if he knowe not before, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> disease? It is nother to be denyed nor dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that in the mater of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb facs="tcp:16455:8"/>
ther be diuerse poyntes, wherin men (counted to be learned) can not agree. As whether ther be any Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substanciation of the bread, or no any corporal &amp; carnall presence of Christes substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or no: Whether adoracion (due onlye vnto God) is to be done vnto the Sacrament or no: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christes bodye be ther offred in dede vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priest or no: and whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euil man recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the naturall bodye of Christ or no. Yet neuerthelesse as in a man dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased in dyuerse partes, commonlye the originall cause of suche diuerse diseases, which is spredde abroade in the body, doo come from one chefe membre, as from the stomacke, or from the head: euen so all fyue afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayed doo chiefly heng vpon this one question: which is, what is the mater of the Sacrament: whether is it the naturall substaunce of bread, or the natural substaunce of Christes owne body? The truthe of this questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truly tryed out and agreed vpon, no doubt shal ceasse the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersie in al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rest. For if it be Christes owne natural body, borne of the virgine: than assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly (seing that all learned men in
<pb facs="tcp:16455:9"/>
Englande so farre as I knowe, bothe newe &amp; olde, grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t there to be but one substaunce) than I saye, they must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des graunt Transubstanciacion: that is, a chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> substaunce of bread, into the substaunce of Christes bodye. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also they must nedes graunt the carnall and corporal presence of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes bodye. Than must the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be adored with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honour due to Christ him selfe, for the vnitie of the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in one persone. Than yf y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priest do offre the Sacrament, he dothe offre in dede Christ him selfe. And finally the murtherour, the aduouterour, or wicked ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> receauing the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, must nedes than receaue also the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Christes owne bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed bodye, bothe fleshe and blood.</p>
            <p>Nowe on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other syde, yf after the truthe shalbe truly tryed out, it shalbe founde, that the substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of bread is the naturall substaunce of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, although for the chaunge of the vse, office and dignitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread, the bread in dede sacramentally is chaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged into the bodye of Christ, as the wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter in Baptisme is sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tally chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:16455:9"/>
remayneth all one, as was before: yf (I say) the true solucion of that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer question (whervpon al these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies do heng) be, that the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall substaunce of bread, is the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial substaunce in the Sacrament of Christes blessed body: than must it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des folowe, of the former proposicion (confessed of all that be named to be learned, so farre as I do knowe, in Englande) which is, that ther is but one material substaunce in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of the bodye, and one only lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the Sacrament of the blood: that ther is no suche thing in dede and in truthe, as they call Transubstanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acion: for the substaunce of bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth stil in the Sacrament of the bodye: than also the natural substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Christes humane nature, which he toke of the virgine Mary is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where it reigneth nowe in glorie, and not here inclosed vnder the forme of bread: than that godly honour, which is only due vnto God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creatour, may not be done vnto the creature without idolatrie and sacrilege, is not to be done vnto the holy Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Than also the wicked, I meane the impenite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t murtherour, aduouterour,
<pb facs="tcp:16455:10"/>
or suche like, do not receaue the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blessed body &amp; blood of Christ. Finally tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dothe it folowe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Christes blessed body &amp; blood, which was once only offred &amp; shedde vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the crosse, being auaileable for the sinnes of al the hole worlde, is offred vp no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, in'the natural substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce therof, nother by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priest nor any other thing But here before we go any further to searche in this mater, &amp; to wade (as it were) to search &amp; trye out (as we may) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truthe hereof in the scripture, it shall do wel by the way, to knowe, whether they that thus make answere &amp; soluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto the former principal questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, do take awaye symplie and absolutly the presence of Christes body &amp; blood, from the Sacrament ordayned by Christ, and duely ministred according to his holy ordinaunce and institucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the same. Undoubtedly they doo denye that vtterlye, either so to saye, or so to meane. Hereof yf any man do or will doubt, the bookes which are writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> already in this mater of them, that thus doo answere, will make the mater playne.</p>
            <p>Now than wil you say, what kynd of presence do they graunt, &amp; what do
<pb facs="tcp:16455:10"/>
they denye? Bryefly they denie the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sence of Christes body in the naturall substaunce of his humane &amp; assumpt nature, and graunt the presence of the same by grace: that is, they affirme and saye, that the substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body and blood of Christ is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye remaynyng in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and so shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be vnto the later daye, whan he shall come agayne in glorie (accompanied with the Au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelles of heauen) to iudge bothe the quicke and the deade. And that the same natural substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the very bodye &amp; blood of Christ, bycause it is vnited vnto the diuine nature in Christ y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de person of the Trinitie. Therfore it hathe not onlye lyfe in it selfe, but is also hable to geue &amp; dothe geue lyfe vnto so many as be or shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be partakers therof: that is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> do beleue on his name, which are not borne of blood (as S.

Euen as for example, we saye, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same Sunne which (in substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueth his place out of the heauens, is yet present here by his beames, light, and naturall influence, where it shyneth vpon the earthe. For Goddes worde and his Sacramentes be (as it were) the beames of Christ, which is <hi>Sol iusticiae,</hi> the Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of ryghteousnes.</p>
            <p>Thus haste thou hearde, of what sorte or secte so euer thou be, wherin dothe stande the principall state and chiefe point of all the controuersies, which do ꝓprely perteyne vnto the na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture of this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

               </note> I doo playnly affirme and saye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the seconde answer made vnto the chief question and principal poynt, I am persuaded to be the very true meanyng and sense of Goddes holy worde: that is, that the naturall substaunce of bread and wyne is the true material substaunce of the holy sacrament of the blessed body &amp; blood of our saueour Christ: and the places
<pb facs="tcp:16455:12"/>
of scripture, whervpon this my faithe is grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, be these, bothe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, &amp; also of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blood.</p>
            <p>Furst let vs repete the begynnyng of the institucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lordes supper, wherin al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> three eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelistes, and S. Paule almost in wordes doo agree, sayeng that <hi>Iesus toke bread, gaue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes, brake, and gaue it to the disciples, sayeng. Take, eate, this is my body.</hi> Here it appeareth playnly, that Christ calleth very bread, his body. For that which he toke, was very bread. In this all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doo agree. And that which he toke, after he hade geuen thankes, he brake: and that which he toke and brake, he gaue to his disciples: &amp; that which he toke, brake, and gaue to his disciples, he sayed hym self of it: <hi>This is my bodye.</hi> So it appeareth playnlie, that Christ called very bread his body. But very breade ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be his body in very substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce therof:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi>
               </note> therfore it must nedes haue an other meani<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. Which meanyng appeareth playnly what it is, by the next sentence that foloweth imediatlye, bothe in Luke &amp; in Paule. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is this: <hi>Doo this in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of me.</hi> Whervpon it semeth vnto
<pb facs="tcp:16455:13"/>
me to euident, that Christ did take bread, &amp; called it his bodye, for that he wolde therby institute a perpetual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce of his body: specially of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> singular benefite of our redempcion, which he wolde than procure and purchace vnto vs, by his body vpon the crosse. But bread reteynyng still his owne very natural substaunce, maye be thus by grace, (and in a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal significacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) his body: wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>as elles the very bread which he toke, brake, and gaue them, could not be in any wise his natural body. For that were confusion of substaunces, and therfore the very wordes of Christ ioyned with the next sentence folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, bothe enforceth vs to confesse the very bread, to remayne still, and also openeth vnto vs, how that bread may be and is thus by his diuine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer his body, which was geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for vs. But here I remembre, I haue red in some writours of the contrarie opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which doo denye that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which Christ did take, he brake. For (saye they) after his taking, he blessed it, as Marke doth speake. And by his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, he chaunged the natural sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce of the breade in to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb facs="tcp:16455:13"/>
substaunce of his bodye: and so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he toke the bread, and blessed it, yet bicause in blessing he chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the substaunce of it, he brake not the bread, which than was not ther, but only the forme therof.</p>

for this purpose, but only to note here briefly, those which seme vnto me, to be the most playne places. Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore contented to haue spoken thus muche of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal bread, I will now speake a litel of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lordes cuppe.</p>

            <p>I know that he that is of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary opinion, wil denye the former parte of myne Argument. But I wil proue it thus, by the playne wordes of Christ him self, bothe in Mathewe and in Marke. Christes wordes are these: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the wordes said vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cup. <hi>I saie vnto you</hi> (saieth Christ) <hi>I wil not dri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cefurthe of this frute of the vyne tree, vntil I shall drinke that newe in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers kingdome.</hi> Here note how Christ calleth playnlie his cuppe the frute of the vyne tree. But the frute of the vyne tree is very natural wyne. Wherfore the natural substaunce of the wyne dothe remayne still in the Sacrament of Christes blood.
<pb facs="tcp:16455:15"/>
And here in speaking of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lordes cup, it cometh vnto my remembraunce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vanitie of Innocentius his sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tastical inuencion, which by Paules wordes I did confute before, &amp; here did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise somwhat more to speake, &amp; that is this. If the transubstanciacion be made by this worde <hi>(Blessed)</hi> in Marke sayed vpon the bread, as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentius that pope did saye: Than su<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rely seing that worde is not sayed of Christ, nother in any of the euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes nor in S. Paule vpon the cuppe: Ther is no transubstanciacion of the wyne at al. For wher the cause dothe faile, ther can not folowe the effecte. But the sacramental bread &amp; the sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mental wyne doo bothe remayne in their natural substaunce alike, and if the one be not chaunged, as of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental wyne it appeareth euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: than ther is no such transubstanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acion in nother of them bothe,</p>
            <p>All that put &amp; affirme this chaunge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> substaunce of bread &amp; wyne in to the substaunce of Christes bodye and blood (called Transubstanciacion) doo also say this chaunge to be made by a certain forme of prescripte wordes and non other.<note place="margin">

For although they graunt, to certayn of the olde au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as <hi>Crysostome</hi> and <hi>Ambrose</hi>: that these wordes <hi>(This is my body)</hi> are the wordes of consecracion of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the body: yet saye they, these wordes maye well be so called, bicause they doo assure vs of the consecracion therof, whether it be done before these wordes be spoken or no.</p>
            <p>But as for this their doubt (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the sacrament of the bodye) I let it passe. Let vs now considre the wordes which perteyne to the cuppe. This is furst euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as Matthewe muche agreeth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Marke, &amp; likewise Luke with Paule, much agreeth herin in forme of wordes: so in the same, the forme of wordes in Matthewe and Marke is diuerse fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which is in Luke &amp; Paule: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde autors doo most rehearse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme of wordes in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe &amp; Marke: bicause I wene they semed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> most cleare. But here I wold knowe, whether it is credible or no, that Luke and Paule, whan they
<pb facs="tcp:16455:16"/>
celebrated the Lordes supper w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their congregaciones, that they did not vse the same forme of wordes (at the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des table) which they wrote, Luke in his gospel, and Paule in his epistle. Of Luke, bicause he was a phisicion, whether some will graunt, that he might be a priest or no, and was ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ordre of priesthoode, which (they saye) is geuen by vertue of these wordes sayed by the bishop: <hi>Take thou autoritie to sacrifice for the quycke and the dead.</hi> I can not tell, but if they shoulde be so strayt vpon Luke, either for his crafte, or elles for lacke of suche power geuen him by vertue of thaforesaid wordes: than I wene, bothe Petre and Paule are in daungier to be deposed of their priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, for the crafte either of fyshing, which was Petres:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Petre and Paule had no such priesthode as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes haue</hi>
               </note> or making of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes which was Paules, were more
vile, than the the science of phisike. And as for those sacramental wordes of the ordre of Priesthoode to haue autoritie to sacrifice bothe for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quyck and the dead, I wene Petre &amp; Paule (yf they were bothe alyue) were not hable to proue, that euer Christ gaue them such autoritie, or euer saied any
<pb facs="tcp:16455:16"/>
suche wordes vnto them. But I will let Luke goo, and bicause Paule spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth more for hym self, I will rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se his wordes: <hi>That</hi> (sayeth Paule) <hi>which I receaued of the Lorde I gaue vnto you. For the Lorde Iesus. &amp;c.</hi> And so he setteth furth the hole institucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; right vse of the Lordes supper. Now seing that Paule here sayeth, that which he receaued of the Lorde, he hade geuen them, and that which he hath receaued and geuen them before by worde of mouthe, now he rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth &amp; wryteth the same in his epistle: is it credible that Paule wolde neuer vse this forme of wordes, vpon the Lordes cuppe, which (as he sayeth) he receaued of the Lorde, that he hade ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them before, and now rehearseth in his Epistle? I trust no man is so farre from all reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but he wil grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t me, that this is not likely so to be. Now than if you graunt me, that Paule did vse the forme of wordes, which he writeth: Let vs than rehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arse and considre Paules wordes, which he sayeth, Christ spake thus vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cup. <hi>This cup is the new testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in my blood: this do as often as ye shal drinke it, in the remembraunce of me.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16455:17"/>Here I wold knowe, whether that Christes wordes spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cuppe, were not as mightye in worke, and as effectuall in significacion to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes, constructiones and purposes (as our Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men doo speake) as they were spoken vpon the bread. If this be graunted, which thing I thinke no man can denye: than fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus. But the worde <hi>(is)</hi> in the wordes spoken vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lordes bread dothe mightily signifie (saye they) the chaunge of the substaunce of that which goeth before it, in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which foloweth after, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, of the substaunce of bread in to the substaunce of Christes bodye, whan Christ sayeth: <hi>This is my bodye.</hi> Now than if Christes wordes which are spoken vpon the cuppe, which Paule here rehearseth be of the same might and power, bothe in working and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieng: Than must this worde <hi>(is)</hi> whan Christ sayeth: <hi>This cuppe is the newe testament</hi> &amp;c. turne the substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the cuppe in to the substaunce of the newe testament.

<pb facs="tcp:16455:17"/>
Christ, that this cuppe is the newe tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, yet Christ ment no suche chaunge, as that. Mary Sir, euen so saye I, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ sayde of the bread, which he toke, and after thankes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen brake and gaue them, sayeng: <hi>Take, eate, this is my body,</hi> he ment no more any suche chaunge of the substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of bread in to the substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his naturall bodye, than he ment of the chaunge and Transubstanciacion of the cuppe in to the substaunce of the newe testament. And if thow wilt saye, that the worde <hi>(cuppe)</hi> here in Christes wordes dothe not signifie the cuppe it self, but the wyne, or thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g conteyned in the cuppe, by a figure called <hi>Metonimia,</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Christes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ment, and so must nedes be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: thow sayest very well.

               </note> to make or to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie any transubstantiacion. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Lordes wordes wherby he instituted the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his blood, he vseth a figuratyne speache.

<pb facs="tcp:16455:18"/>
rule, that in doctrine &amp; in the instituci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the sacramentes, Christ vsed no figures, but all his wordes are to be strayned to their propre significacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as here what so euer thou sayest was in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cuppe, nother y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nor the cup it selfe (taking euery worde in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre significacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but in vnderstanding that which was in the cuppe, by the cuppe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is a figura<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiue speache: yea &amp; also thou cannest not verifie or truly saye of that, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou sayest it was wyne or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes blood, to be the newe testament without a figure also.

howbeit not vnto the learned, but to the vnlearned. Here let any man that but indifferently vnderstandeth the latine tongue, read the place in S. Austen: &amp; if he perceaue not clearly S Augustines wordes &amp; mynde to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary, let me abyde therof the rebuke.</p>
            <p>This lesso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of S.

Euen so sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the same lesson with the example of S. Augustines exposiciones therof, teacheth vs not only by the same, to vnderstande Christes wordes in the institucion of the Sacrament bothe of his body and of his blood figuraty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely, but also the very true meanyng and vnderstanding of the same. For if to commaunde to eate the fleshe of the sonne of man, and to drinke his blood semeth to commaunde an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and an vngodlynesse, and is euen so in dede, if it be vnderstande<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the wordes doo sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre significacion: and therfore must be vnderstanden figuratyuely &amp; spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, as S.

<pb facs="tcp:16455:19"/>

            <p>But I haue taried longer in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting furthe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme of Christes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des vpon the Lordes cuppe, written by Paule and Luke, than I did inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to do. And yet in speaking of the forme of Christes wordes, spoken vpon his cuppe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des cuppe, as the prie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes say.</hi>
               </note> cometh now to my remebrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the forme of wordes vsed in the latine Masse, vpon the Lordes cuppe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I doo not a litell maruaile, what shoulde be the cause seing the latine
<pb facs="tcp:16455:20"/>
Masse agreeth with the euangelistes and Paule, in the forme of wordes sayed vpon the bread: why in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des sayed vpon the Lordes cuppe, it diffreth from them all, yea and addeth to the wordes of Christ spoken vpon the cuppe, these wordes, <hi>Misterium fidei,</hi> that is, the mysterie of faith, which ar not redde to be attributed vnto the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Christes blood, nother in the euangelistes nor in Paule, nor so farre as I knowe, in any other place of holy scripture? yea and if it maye haue som good exposicion, yet why it should not be aswell added vnto the wordes of Christ vpon his breade, as vpon his cuppe, surely I doo not see y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mysterie. And bicause I see in the vse of the latine masse the sacrament of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blood abused, whan it is denyed vnto the laye people, cleane contrary vnto Goddes most certain worde: for why, I doo beseche the, should the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Christes blood be denyed vnto the lay christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priest? Did not Christ sheade his blood aswell for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laye godly ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly priest? If thow wilt saye, yeas that he did so.
<pb facs="tcp:16455:20"/>
But yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the blood is not to be receaued without the offring vp &amp; sacrificeing therof vnto God the fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, bothe for the quicke and for the dead: and no man maye make oblaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christes blood vnto God, but a priest, and therfore the priest alone (&amp; that but in his Masse only) maye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the sacrament of the blood. And call you this (Maisters) <hi>Misterium fidei?</hi> Alas alas, I feare me this is before God <hi>Misterium iniquitatis,</hi> the misterie of iniquitie, suche as S.

Now least I shoulde seme to set by myne owne conceate, more than is mete: or lesse to regarde the doctrine of the olde ecclesiastical wrytours, than is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for a man of my poore learning and simple wytte for to doo. And bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause also I am in dede persuaded, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the olde ecclesiasticall wrytours vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstode the true meanyng of Christ in this mater: and haue bothe so truly and so playnly set it furthe in certayn places of their wrytinges, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which will vouchesafe to reade them, and without preiudice of a corrupte iudgement wil indifferently weighe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strue their myndes non other wise, than they declare them selues to haue ment: I am persuaded (I saye) that in reading of them thus, no man can be ignoraunt in this mater, but he that will shutte vp his owne eies, and blyndfelde hym selfe. Whan I
<pb facs="tcp:16455:25"/>
speake of ecclesiastical wrytours, I meane of suche, as were before the wicked vsurpacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the sea of Rome was growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so vnmeasurably great, that not only with tyrannical power, but also with corrupte doctrine, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to subuerte Christes gospel, &amp; to turne the state, that Christ &amp; his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles set in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, vpside downe.</p>
            <p>For the causes aforesaid, I wil rehearse certayn of their sayenges: and yet bicause I take them but for wytnesses and expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and not as the autors of the same: and also for that now I wil not be tedious, I will rehearse but fewe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is three olde writours of the Greke churche, and other three of the Latine churche, which doo seme vnto me, to be in this mater most playne.</p>
            <p>The Greke autors are <hi>Origene, Chrisostome,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret.</hi> The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyne are, <hi>Tertulliane, S.

               </note>Nowe bicause these two answeres haue ben of late so confuted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, that it is wel perceaued, that they will take no place: therfore some
<pb facs="tcp:16455:27"/>
which haue written sence that tyme, haue forged twoo other answerres, euen of the same molde. The former wherof is, that Origene in this place spake not of the sacrament of bread or wyne of the Lordes table, but of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mystical meate: of the which S.

But Origenes owne wordes in .ij. senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before rehearsed, being put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, proue this answer vntrue. For he sayeth, that he meaneth of that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue and mystical body, which ꝓ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth them, that doo receaue it worthi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, alluding so playnlye vnto S.

Augustine speaketh of, he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not proue that any such thing was vsed in Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes tyme. Yea &amp; though that coulde be proued, yet was ther neuer bread in any tyme called a sacramental bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, sauing the sacramental bread of the Lordes table, which is called of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigene the typical and symbolical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye of Christ.</p>

               </note>The seconde of the two newe fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de answeres, is yet most monstrous of al other, which is this. But let vs grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (saye they) that Origen spake of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des supper, and by the mater therof was vnderstanded the material sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce of bread &amp; wyne: what tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, say they? For though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> material substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was once gone, &amp; departed by reason of Transubstanciacion, whiles the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes of the bread and the wyne did re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mayne, yet now it is no inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to saye, that as the material substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce did departe at the entring in of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body vnder thaforesayd formes: so whan the sayd formes be destroyed and do not remayne, than cometh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayn the substaunce of bread &amp; wyne. And this say they, is very mete in this mysterie, that that which beganne w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the miracle, shall ende in a myracle. Yf I hade not redde this fantasie, I wolde scarcely haue beleued, that any learned ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer wolde haue set furth suche a foolishe fantasie: which not onlye lacketh all grounde, either of Goddes worde, reason, or of any aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient wrytour, but is also cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the common rules of schole diuinitie: which is, that no miracle is
<pb facs="tcp:16455:28"/>
to be affirmed and put without neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie. And althoughe for their former miracle, which is their Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they haue some colour, thoughe it be but vayne, sayeng, it is done by the power and vertue of these wordes of Christ, <hi>This is my bodye</hi>: yet to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke this seconde miracle of returnyng the materiall substaunce agayne, they haue no colour at all. Or elles I pray them shewe me, by what wordes of Christ is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> seconde myracle wrought. Thus ye maye see, that the sleightes and shiftes which crafte and witte can inuente to wraste the true sense of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigene, can not take place. But nowe let vs heare one other place of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene, and so we wyll let him go.</p>
            <p>Origene in the .11. Homilie <hi>Super Le<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiticum,</hi> sayeth, <hi>that ther is also euen in the foure Gospelles, and not onlye in the olde Testament, a lettre</hi> (meanyng a literall sense) <hi>which kylleth. For yf thou folowe</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lettre in that sayeng: Except ye eate the fleshe of the sonne of man, &amp; drinke his blood. &amp;c. This lettre dothe kill.</hi> Yf in that place the lettre dothe kil, wherin is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the eating of Christes fleshe: than surelye in those wordes of Christe,
<pb facs="tcp:16455:29"/>
wherin Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth vs to eate his body, the literal sense therof like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise dothe kill. For it is no lesse crime but euen the same and all one in the literal sense, to eate Christes bodye, &amp; to eate Christes fleshe. Wherfore if the one doo kil, except it be vnderstanden figuratiuely and spiritually: than the other surely dothe kill likewise. But that to eate Christes fleshe dothe kil so vnderstanden, Origene affirmeth playnly in his wordes aboue rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: Wherfore it can not be iustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but to eate Christes body literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderstanden, must nedes (after hym) kill likewise.</p>
            <p>The answer that is made to this place of Origen of the papistes, is so folishe, that it bewrayeth it self, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further confutacion. It is the same, that they make to a place of S. Augustine, in his boke <hi>De doctrina Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiana:</hi>

The papistes answer is this: To y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> carnal ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> literal sense is hurtful, but not so to the spiritual. As though to vnderstande that in his propre sense, which ought to be taken figuratiuely, were to the carnall man

a daungerous perile: but to the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual man non at all.</p>

And whether this autor was Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chrisostome him self the Archebishop of Constantinopole, or no: that is not the mater. For of all it is graunted, that he was a writour of that age, and a man of great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng: so that it is manifest, that this which he wryteth, was the receaued opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of learned men in his dayes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16455:30"/>Or elles vndoubtedly in suche a mater, his sayeng shoulde haue be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pugned of som y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wrote in his tyme,<note place="margin">

Naye (sayeth an other) if this solucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will not serue, we maye saye, that Chrisostome did not speake of the vesselles of the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des cuppe, or such as were than vsed at the Lordes table, but of the vesselles vsed in the temple in the olde lawe. This answer will serue no more than the other. For here Chrisostome spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of suche vesselles, wherin was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which was called the body of Christ, although it was not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true body (say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he) of Christ, but the mystery of Christes bodye. Now of the vessels of the olde lawe, the wrytours doo vse no suche maner of phrase: for their sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were not called Christes body. For than Christ was not but in sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and figures, and not by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament of his body reuealed. Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus which was a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that coulde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande the wordes and sense of the wrytour, although he wolde not be sene to speake agaynst this errour of transubstanciacion, bicause he durst not: yet in his tyme declareth playnely that this sayeng of this wrytour is
<pb facs="tcp:16455:30"/>
non otherwise to be vnderstanden.</p>
            <p>Yet can I (sayeth the thirde papist) fynde out a fyne &amp; subtil solucion for this place,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gard. in the same place</hi>
               </note> &amp; graunt all that yet is say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, bothe allowing here the wrytour, &amp; also that he ment of the vessels of the Lordes table. For (sayeth he) the body of Christ is not conteyned in them, at the Lordes table, as in a place, but as in a mysterie. Is not this a prety shifte, and a mystical solucion? But by the same solucion than, Christes body is not in the Lordes table, nor in the priestes handes, nor in the pixe, and so is he here no where. For they will not saye, that he is either here or ther, as in a place. This answer pleaseth so well the maker, that he hym self (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had played with it a litel while, and shewed the fynesse of his wytte &amp; eloquence therin) is content to geue it ouer &amp; say: but it is not to be thought, that Chrisostome wolde speake after this fynesse or subtiltie: and therfore he returneth agayn vnto the seconde answer for his shoore Ancor, which is sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly confuted before. An other shorte place of Chrisostome I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse, which (if any indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy maye

               </note> than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that the bread abydeth so still? And yet to this so playn a place, som are not ashamed thus shamefully to elude it, sayeng: we graunt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature of bread remayneth still thus, for that it maye be sene, felt, and tasted: and yet the corporal substaunce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread therfore is gone, least two bodies should be confused together, &amp; Christe should be thought impanate.</p>
            <p>What contrarietie and falshead is in this answer, the symple man maie easily perceaue. Is not this a playne contrarietie, to graunt that the natur of bread remayneth so still, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it maye be sene, felt, and tasted: &amp; yet to saye, the corporal substaunce is gone, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide

absurditie of Christes impana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion? And what manifest falshead is this, to saye or meane, that if the bread should remayne still, than must folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we the inconuenience of impanacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? As though the very bread could not be a sacrament of Christes body (as water is of baptisme) except Christ should vnyte the nature of bread to his nature, in vnitie of persone, and make of the bread, God.</p>

And now I will likewise rehearse the sayenges of other three olde auncient wytours of the latine church, &amp; so make an ende.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16455:34"/>And furst I will begynne with Tertullian,<note place="margin">

               </note> whom Cipriane the holy martyr so highly estemed, that whan so euer he wolde haue his boke, he was wont to saye: <hi>Geue vs now the Maister.</hi> This olde wrytour in his .4. boke agaynst <hi>Marcion</hi> the heretike, sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus: <hi>Iesus made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breade, which he toke, and distributed to his disciples his body, sayeng: This is my body. That is to saye</hi> (sayeth Tertullian) <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure of my body.</hi> In this place it is playne, that after Tertullianes expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licion, Christ ment not by calling the bread his body, &amp; the wyne his blood, that either the bread was the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body, or the wyne his natural blood, but he called the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his body and blood, bicause he wolde institute the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be vnto vs sacramentes: that is, holy tokens and signes of his body and of his blood: that by them reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

and fedde to the encrease of all godlynesse in vs here in our pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage &amp; iournaye, wherin we walke, vnto euerlasting lyfe. This was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly Christ our saueours mi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, and this is Tertullianes exposicion.

                  <hi>Gard. to the</hi> .16. <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iection.</hi>
               </note> is so farre out of frame, that it euen wearieth me to thinke on it. Tertullian wryteth here (saye they) as none hathe done hitherto before him. This sayeng is toto manyfest false: for Origene, Hilarie, Ambrose, Basil, Gregorie Nazianzene, saint Augustine, and other olde autors, lyke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wyse doo call the sacrament, a figure of Christes bodye. And where they saye, that Tertullian wrote this, whan he was in a heate of disputaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with an heretike, couetyng by all meanes to ouerthrowe his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie. As who saye, he wolde not take hede, what he dyd saye, and specially what he wolde wryte in so hyghe a mater, so that he might haue the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hande of his aduersarie. Is this credible to be true in any godlye wyse man? How muche lesse tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

to be thought or credited in a man of so great a wytte, learning and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencye, as Tertullian is worthilye estemed euer for to haue ben?</p>
            <p>Lykewyse this autor in his furst boke agaynst the same heretike Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, wryteth thus: <hi>God did not reiect bread, which is his creature: for by it he hath made a representacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his body.</hi> Now I praye you, what is this to saye, that Christ hathe made a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentacion (by bread) of his body, but that Christ hade instituted and orday<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned bread to be a sacrament, for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present vnto vs his body? Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the representacion of one thing by an other, requireth the corporal presence of the thing which is so repre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sented or no, euery man that hathe vnderstanding, is hable in this point (the mater is so cleare of it self) to be a sufficient iudge.</p>
            <p>The seconde doctour and wrytour of the latine churche (whose sayenges I promysed to set furthe) is S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine:<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:16455:36"/>
and euer hathe hade hym for a man of most singular learnyng, witte, and diligence, bothe in setting furthe the true doctrine of Christes religion, &amp; also in the defence of the same against heretikes. This autor as he hathe writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten most pleynteously in other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our faithe, so likewise in this argument he hathe written at large in many of his workes, so playnly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this errour of transustanciaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the papistes loue least to heare of hym, of al other wrytours: partly for his autoritie, &amp; partly bicause he ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the mater more fully, than any other doth. Therfore I will rehearse mo places of him, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hertofore I haue done of the other. And furst, what can be more playne, than that which he wryteth vpon the 89. psalme, speaki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of the sacrament of the Lordes body and blood: and rehearsing (as it were) Christes wordes to his disciples, after this maner. <hi>It is not this body, which ye doo see, that ye shall eate, nother shall ye drynke this blood, which the souldy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> crucifie me, shall spill or sheade. I doo commende vnto you a mysterie, or a sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which spiritually vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed shall geue you life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16455:36"/>Now if Christ hade no moo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and corporal bodies, but that one which they tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> presently bothe hearde &amp; sawe, nor other natural blood, but that which was in the same body, and the which the souldiours did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde cruelly shede vpon the crosse: and nother this body nor this blood was (by this declaracion of S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine) either to be eaten or dronken, but the mysterie therof spiritually to be vnderstanded: than I conclude (if this sayeng and exposicion of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine be true) that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mysterie which the disciples should eate, was not the natural body of Christ, but a mysterie of the same spiritually to be vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For as S. Augustine sayeth in his 20. boke <hi>Contra Faustum.</hi> ca. 21. <hi>Christes fleshe and blood was in the olde testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment promysed by similitudes and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their sacrifices, and was exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in dede and in truthe vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crosse, but the same is celebrated by a sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of remembraunce vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aultare.</hi> And in his boke <hi>De fide ad Petrum,</hi> ca. 19. he sayeth, <hi>that in these sacrifices, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the olde lawe, it is figuratiuely signified, what was than to be geuen: but in this sacrifice it is euidently signi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fied,
<pb facs="tcp:16455:37"/>
what is allready geuen</hi> (vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding in the sacrifice vpon the aultare) <hi>the remembraunce and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes geuing for the fleshe, which he offred for vs: &amp; for the blood which he shedde for vs vpon the crosse</hi>: as in the same place and euidently ther it maye appeare.</p>
            <p>An other euident and cleare place, wherin it appeareth, that by the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall bread, which Christ called his body, he ment a figure of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. As vpon the .3. Psalme, wher S. Augustine speaketh this in playne termes. <hi>Christ did admytte Iudas vnto the feast, in the which he comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto his disciples the figure of his bodye.</hi> This was Christes last supper before his passion, wherin he did ordayne the sacrament of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as all learned men doo agree.</p>
            <p>S. Augustine also in his, 23. epistle to <hi>Bonifacius</hi> teacheth, how sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes doo beare the names of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thinges wherof they be sacramentes, bothe in Baptisme, and in the Lordes table, euen as we call euery good frydaye, the daye of Christes passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and euery Easter daye, the daye of Christes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection: whan in very dede ther was but one daye wherin he suffred, and but one daye wherin he rose. And
<pb facs="tcp:16455:37"/>
why doo we than call them so, which are not so in dede, but bicause they are in like tyme and course of the yeare, as those dayes were, wherin those thinges wer done? <hi>Was Christ</hi> sayeth (S. Augusti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) <hi>offred any more but once? And he offred him self. And yet in a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament or represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not only euery sole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne feast of Easter, but also euery day, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people he is offred: so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the not lye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sayeth: He is euery daye offred. For if Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes hade not so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> similitudes or likenesse of those thinges, wherof they be Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, they could in no wise be sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes: &amp; for their si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes and likenesse commonly they haue the names of the thinges, wherof they be sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. Therfore as after a certayn maner of speche, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Christes body is Christes body, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Christes blood is Christes blood, so likewise the Sacrament of faithe is faithe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this maner of speche (as S. Augustine teacheth in his questiones <hi>Super Leuiticum,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>What can be more playne, or more clearly spoken, than are these places of S. Augustine before rehearsed, if men were not obstinately bent to mayntene an vntruthe, &amp; to receaue nothing what so euer dothe set it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the? Yet one place more of S. Augus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine will I allege, which is very clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to this purpose, that Christes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body is in heauen, and not here corporally in the Sacrament, and so let him departe. In his .50. treatise, which he wryteth vpon Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth playnly and clearly, how Christ
<pb facs="tcp:16455:38"/>
being bothe God and man, is bothe here after a certayn maner, and yet in heauen and not here in his natural body and substaunce, which he toke of the blessed virgin Mary: speaking thus of Christ and sayeng. <hi>By his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maiestie, by his prouidence, and by his vnspeakeable &amp; inuisible grace, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is fulfilled which he spake: Beholde I am with you vnto the ende of the worlde. But as concernyng his fleshe which he toke in his incarnacion, as touching that which was borne of the virgine, as concernyng that which was apprehended by the Iewes &amp; crucified vpon a tree, and taken downe from the crosse, lapped in lynen clothes, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed, and rose agayn, and appeared after his resurrection, as concernyng that fleshe, he sayed: ye shall not euer haue me with you. Why so? For as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng his fleshe, he was conuersau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with his disciples .xl. Dayes, and they accompanyeng, seing, and not folowi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g hym, he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vp in to heauen, &amp; is not here. By y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his diuine maies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie he did not departe: as concernyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his diuine maiestie, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> haue Christ euer w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs: but as concernyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> presence of his fleshe, he sayed truly to
<pb facs="tcp:16455:39"/>
his disciples: Ye shall not euer haue me with you. For as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernyng the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his fleshe, the churche hade hym but a fewe dayes: now it holdeth hym by faithe, though it see hym not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus muche S. Augustine speaketh repeting one thing so often: and al to declare and teache, how we should vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande the maner of Christes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here with vs: which is by his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, by his prouidence, &amp; by his diuine nature: and how he is absent by his natural body which was borne of the virgin Mary, died, and roose for vs, &amp; is ascended in to heauen, and ther sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth (as is in the articles of our faithe) on the right hande of God, &amp; thence (&amp; from non other place sayeth S.

this daye, than shalt thow be glorified with the glorie due vnto thy holy name, and vnto thy diuine maiestie: and we shal syng vnto thee, in al ioye, and felicitie, laude and praise for euer more. Amen.</p>
            <p>Here now wold I make an ende. For me thinkes, S. Augustine is in this mater so full and playne, and of that autoritie, that it should not nede after this his declaracion, being so fir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mely grounded vpon Goddes worde, and so well agreing with the other auncient autors, to bring in for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firmacion of this mater any moo: and yet I sayed, I wolde allege three of the latin churche, to testifie the truthe in this cause. Now therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> last of all shalbe <hi>Gelasius,</hi> which was a bishop of Rome, but one that was bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of that sea, before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked vsur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pacion and tyrannye therof spredde &amp; burst out abrode in to all the worlde. For this man was before <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> yea and <hi>Gregorie</hi> the furst: in whose dayes bothe corruption of doctrine and tirannical vsurpacion did chiefly growe, and hade the vpperhande.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gelasius</hi> in an epistle of the twoo na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures of Christ, <hi>Contra Eutichen,</hi> writeth
<pb facs="tcp:16455:40"/>
thus: <hi>The sacramentes of the body and blood of Christ, which we receaue are godly thinges,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gelasius</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>wherby and by the same we are made partakers of the diuine nature, and yet neuerthelesse the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce or nature of the bread &amp; wyne dothe not departe nor go awaye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note these wordes I beseche you, and considre, whether any thing can be more playnly spoken, than these wordes be agaynst the errour of tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substanciacion, which is the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de and bitter roote, wherupon spring all the horrible errours before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed.</p>
            <p>Wherfore seing that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> falshead dothe appeare so manifestly, and by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes so playnly, so clearlye and so fully, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nedeth to be decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but he that will not see, or will not vnderstande: Let vs all that doo loue the truthe, embrace it, &amp; forsake the falsehead. For he that loueth the truthe, is of God: and the lacke of the loue therof is the cause why God suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freth men to fall in to errours, and to perishe therin: yea and as S. Paule sayeth, why he se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vnto them illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siones, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they beleue lies, vnto their owne condemnacion: bicause (sayeth
<pb facs="tcp:16455:40"/>
he) they loued not the truthe. This truthe no doubt is Goddes worde. For Christ hym selfe sayeth vnto his father: <hi>Thy worde is truthe.</hi>
