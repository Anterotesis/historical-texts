            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I enter into the proceedings of this Exercise, I will relate the willing and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mindes of the Artillery men, who with a generall and unanimous consent (upon the first proposition) liberally laid down their monies for the furtherance of the intended purpose, so that nothing was either wanting, or any way scanting to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the said Designe. Insomuch that there was made a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and large provision of all Materials whatsoever, and the Field and Fort made answerable to either store: They were made and fortified with Ramparts, Ditch, Counterscarffe, Pallisadoes, Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoes, Sally, Ports, Parrapets, Redoubts, and Raveling with La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Bels, Centre Bels, and Beacons, upon which was spacious platformes for the Ordnance, which were mounted to doe execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Assailants, and in which were erected two severall

Tents, one for Captain <hi>Call</hi> then Governour, and the other for Captain <hi>Mantrop,</hi> attended with good Fire-men and warlike Souldiers, fitly appointed for that purpose, with Lieutenants, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, Sergeants, and Corporalls, in a correspondent way ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contred.</p>
            <p>In all points answerable to them were those of the Field fitted with Materials necessary for Assailants to be provided of, as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, Officers, Canon-carriages, Linstocks, Ladles, Spunges, Badge-barrels, Pioners, Scaling-ladders, Horse-tents, Suttlers, Forage-masters, Scout-masters, and whatsoever else was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>And let mee not forget to speake something of that worthy Gentleman Captaine <hi>de Engaine,</hi> who was Sergeant <hi>Major</hi> for that day of the Field, and Captaine of the Artillery-yard, a man well practiced in Military Discipline, and the only man laid the ground-plot for this Exercise, from whom sprung all the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the managing thereof, to his great applause, credit, and commendations. In so much, I verily believe, if such Exercises were oftner practised in the Counties, Cities and Towns of this Kingdome so exactly and martiall like, it would adde a great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause to our Nation, and strike as great a terrour in our enemies to heare and see every man so expert in Armes, and the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Officers so solid, sound, sufficient, and ready upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions to doe both King and Country able service.

            <p>In the morning, the Drums of both parts went about the Town beating a Call, to summon every Officer and Souldier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. And when the Governours Clarke and the Captains, had called them by their Lists over, and found appearance in them all, then they drew them up in a body thus, having two Ensignes cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them to advance to the heads of the Pikes, where they made a stand, their Colours advanced turked, one Ensigne took the right hand, the other the left, according to their senioritie and due place: every Officer did the like, the Governour tooke his about six foot from the Pikes in the Centre, his Serjeant Major upon his left hand, the Captains one on the right hand, and the other on the left, betweene the File-leaders of the Pikes and Musketeers on both Flanks, after which they marched by Squadrons into the Fort, in every way answerable to them were those of the Field, as you shall understand in its due place.</p>
            <p>In the Artillery Yard was the first Randevouze, of those of the Field, where after the said Call beaten abroad in the Town, and also every man upon that Summons found ready; some small time spent thereafter the word of Command was given, the Drum beat a troop, they all advanc't and shouldred, and so troopt into the Market place, where their Cannon, Horse, Ammunition and Waggons were ready to attend them, there they drew them into a mayn body.</p>
            <p>Having a sparious place for the ordering of their Companies and Troops in a warlike maner, marcht into the Field in this order, the Pioners being prepared there before.</p>
            <p>First, a Cornet of Horse troopt into the Field, next a Squadron of Musquetiers, with a Drum in the third ranke of Captain <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes</hi> Company, being eldest Colonell, in the Reare of whom the Colonell in person very laudably and commander-like attended, marcht, the Colours and a Squadron of Pikes, and a Drum fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, then the eldest Serjant in the front of the second Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
<pb facs="tcp:2067:5"/>
of Pikes, after them the second Serjeant and second Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of Musquetiers, with a Drum, and finally, the Lieutenant in the Reare.</p>
            <p>After whom marcht the Company of Captain <hi>Warrens</hi> in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point correspondent to the other, and in one and the self-same uniforme.</p>
            <p>At the Reare of which two Companies marcht the Cannon and Baggage, and another Cornet of Horse to secure the Reare.</p>
            <p>Thus in this martiall manner they marcht into the Field, in which march they made three severall Alts; and at the last Alt, they were all drawne into forme of battaile, the Pikes in the Centre flanckt with Musketiers with the Ordnance, Horse and Baggage upon the Wings.</p>
            <p>Being upon the last Alt, and thus marching a party of Pikes and Musketiers issued from out of the North Sally Port, and fired upon the Army presently, a Squadron of Pikes and Musketiers, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc't from the Army, and fir'd upon the Defendants Squadron, after whom instantly a troop from the Army also seconded the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saylants Squadron, to re-inforce these of the Fort, but they were as soon repeld by their Ambuscado, who routed the Assailants and retreated them to the Army, at which time those of the Fort took two prisoners from them of the Field.</p>
            <p>The while this was in agitation, the Assaylants sate downe and raysed their Tents, made their Huts and setled their Ordnance, they of the Fort firing their Ordnance, all the while on them, which was answered after a short time by the Cannon of the field shot for shot.</p>
            <p>But speedily the aforesaid two prisoners were mist, wherupon the Drum Major beat a parley, which being answered by a Drum of the Fort, made their demand which was imbrac'd, &amp; the Drum of the Field blinded, about ten paces from the Fort, was led into the Governours Tent, and laying down a months pay for captives was led out, and so ransom'd them both again.</p>
            <p>The Army martially setled in the field in their severall quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, were presently disturbed by the Ordnance of the Fort, those of the Field answered them by their Cannon, and set forth their Sentinels, with severall Guards for the Ordnance. At this instant hapned a sudden fire in the quarters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was done by a traytor
<pb facs="tcp:2067:6"/>
from the Fort, for the finding out of whom, it was ordered that by the beating of a Drum and word of mouth, a Proclamation was made, that upon pain of death, every Officer and private Souldier should repaire presently to his owne private Hut, and proper quarter, which being done, and the traytour found alone without a Hut, instantly was apprehended and committed to the custody of the Provost Marshall. And when there was a cessation of Armes, he was to undergo the penalty of the Law, which was to be bound to a stake, and Muskateer'd.</p>
            <p>Then the Pioners were drawne up to the Front of the Army, where they were divided into three parts, two thirds, for the Trenches in the Quarters, and one third for the battery, to draw the Cannon neerer to the Fort, and to raise platformes upon seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall occasions to advantage the Assaylants.</p>
            <p>The Cannon were drawn up by the out-wings of the Front of the Army, and their mettall plac'd in a Horizontall Line of levell towards the work of the Fort, where the breach should be made to do execution.</p>
            <p>After which the horse-troops were drawne from both the Flancks, and distributed into two Guards, a good distance one from the other, right behinde the Quarters of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>
            <p>The Sentinels of Horse were set forth single, round about the outline, to keepe and to discover the Enemies approach from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damaging the Quarters, or otherwise to relieve the Fort.</p>
            <p>The Army thus setled in their Quarters, the Pioners began ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the direction of the Serjant Major of the Field, both in their Trenches, and for their Platformes, to breake ground.</p>
            <p>The Commanders of the Fort seeing this fire their Ordnance upon the Pioners, to hinder, and beat them from their works, and brake the new begun Trenches.</p>
            <p>Neverthelesse by the violence of the Field Cannon, the Pioners (maugre all opposition) advanced their Works, at one and the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same time from the Heads, of both the Quarters, leaving a good large Piasa betweene the Front of the Quarters, and head of the Trenches.</p>
            <p>Instantly were there Wings of Musketiers drawne from the Quarters, fell into the Trenches, &amp; so followed the Pioners still for
<pb facs="tcp:2067:6"/>
their Guard, with Squadrons to defend both the Pioners and Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers from the Sallyers Pikes and Muskets.</p>
            <p>These Pikes and Muskets were many times relieved by parties sent fresh from the Quarters, and the former retreated to refresh themselves.</p>
            <p>A sudden sally was made from the Fort and Court of Guard, to frustrate the Assaylants Pioners in the Trenches, and fired upon them to hinder their work, and beat them out of their Trenches, the Musketiers of the Trenches fire also upon them, that were the Sallyers of the Guard. After certain vollies thus interchanged, the Sallyers presently hasten to their Guard again.</p>
            <p>Hereupon certain Squadrons of Pikes and Musketiers were sent from the quarters towards the Fort, and Court of Guard, to the end suddenly to suppresse and take it from them.</p>
            <p>Those of the Guard did as couragiously withstand them, and in conclusion forc'd them into their quarters, but those of the Field seeing this sent out more force against them to relieve their first Squadrons, against which last reliefes those of the Fort and Works gives vollies, to stop their passage because they could not so conveniently fire before by reason they should have indange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and done much damage to those of their own quarters being they skirmisht betwixt them and the Assaylants.</p>
            <p>The reliefs from the quarters did proceed so on in their purpose (in despight of danger) that they joynd with the first Assaylants, and rowted the Guardians by falling pell mell with the but end of their Muskets, and at push of Pike.</p>
            <p>In so much that those of the Guard finding an impossibility of keeping and holding it any jot longer resolv'd joyntly with mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous spirits to cut their way through the weakest part of the Assaylants, to abandon the Guard and flye into the Ditch, and next work of the Fort, as also those of the Redoubts did abandon theirs, and retreated into the Fort, both which were performed with great dexterity in a compleat martiall manner.</p>
            <p>Presently upon this they of the Field entred the Guards, and maintained it managing it with the supplyes that came last unto them for their reliefe, and upon entrance instantly sent backe the first Assaylants to their quarters again, to refresh themselves, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse
<pb facs="tcp:2067:7"/>
are so charged that they are beaten back again by them of the Fort.</p>
            <p>In which time the Trenches and Workes of the Army are still advanced forward with all advantage towards the Fort, both Works and Platforms raised, the Cannon drawne forward and mounted.</p>
            <p>The Trenches this while were often relieved by new parties of shot and Pike, and the old sent to their quarters.</p>
            <p>The batteries and works of the Trenches were continually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by resolute stands of Pikes, placed behinde them for the Guard of both the Pioners and Cannon.</p>
            <p>Those of the Fort conclude, and make a sudden violent sally out of their Raveling, which inclosed the face and front of their horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, and suddenly did beat downe some of the Enemies Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, wherupon the shot from the Hornworke, and these of the Rampart do give their vollies, upon the Enemy being then laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unto them, on the other side the Assailants and them in their Trenches, did as suddenly repair that breach, with such Materials as were usefull, as sand-bags, and other things prepared for their security and defence.</p>
            <p>The Army having sufficiently fortified their Trenches, and stopt the breach formerly made by the Salliers out of the foresaid Raveling, desperatly (with vndaunted spirits) issued out of their Trenches and quarters; and recharged the Raveling, and both beat and forc'd them out mayntaining it a time, untill those of the Fort made a sudden sally out of the Ditch with clubs: threshing Flayles, and such like instruments apt for hard strokes, falling yet well upon the Assaylants in the Raveling, and by strong hand beat them out and repossest it again, and forc'd those of the Field to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from whence they first issued.</p>
            <p>Wherupon those of the Fort being thus incouraged, suddenly made another sally upon the Trenches, but were quickly repulst by them of the Field.</p>
            <p>When the Commanders of the Fort perceived how the Field Trenches and Works did increase daily upon them, fired their Beacon.</p>
            <p>The Assaylans seeing this took their advantage, and sent out
<pb facs="tcp:2067:7"/>
Squadrons of Pikes and Muskets from the quarters, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly charged that part strongly, where the intended breach was to be made.</p>
            <p>All this while the Pioners proceeded forward, and railed their works neerer and neerer, also brought the Cannon neerer to force a breach the sooner.</p>
            <p>There were six selected Souldiers sent from the quarters to view the Hornworke, armed with Armes of proofe, Pistolets, and Targets.</p>
            <p>Those of the Fort made many firings upon them from the Rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, hornwork, and adjoyning parts within the Fort.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding these noble Spirits finish their Enterprize, (maugre their fiery onset) returned and gave an account of their action unto the Commanders.</p>
            <p>But to incourage those of the Fort, certain troops of Horse ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at the backe of the Armies out-laid for the reliefe of the Fort.</p>
            <p>Wherupon those of the Fort imbracing the advantage made a strong sally out of both their Ports to beat those of the Field out of their Trenches next unto them, and did put their purpose in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution with clubs, threshing flayles, and the but end of their Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, having thus effected their Enterprize fell back from whence they issued.</p>
            <p>The Trenches and batteries of the Field were by this time wrought so neer the Raveling and Hornwork, that they are resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon the first opportunity to enter there.</p>
            <p>The shot from both Works and Fort did continually play upon the Assaylants, they out of the Trenches and Guards did the like upon them of the Fort.</p>
            <p>The Cannon and small shor of the Field did continue their vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies both against the Fort and Rampart adjoyning, as also upon the Hornwork, so as they were constrained to abandon it, and fly into the Fort.</p>
            <p>In which time the mayn batteries of the Field were so much advanced, and so neer the Bulwarks of the Fort that they dismoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Cannon, and fired so much upon that part where the breach was to be made, that the said breach was thereupon made
<pb facs="tcp:2067:8"/>
accessable. Those of the Fort in despight of danger mount the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the breach, and repayreth it with Sand-bags, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Neverthelesse, the battery continued &amp; made a sufficient breach in the Rampart, though their Ordnance are dismounted, yet they continue their firings out of the Fort fiercely upon the Assay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants.</p>
            <p>The Cannon of the Field having made an accessible breach, there presently choice Commanders sent from the quarters presently to view it, during which time the Cannon silenc't themselves, and barter'd not during the time the viewers were upon that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>Who returne and signifie that the breach is accessible, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Counsell of Warre presently determined of the assault.</p>
            <p>Lots were drawne for the avoyding of exceptions amongst the Commanders, by which meanes it was instantly knowne who should mount the breach first, who second, and who last, and the means how consulted likewise of.</p>
            <p>The first Assaylants were couragiously beaten backe by those of the Fort, the second advanc'd and joyn'd with the first, and as manfully repeld with threshing styles and clubs from behinde their Sand-bags.</p>
            <p>The third time the breach mounted by all three parties which did force back the defendants, and lodge themselves neere the top of the breach. During their assault, the small shot in the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches did not fire at all upon that part for feare of annoying the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saylants.</p>
            <p>Those of the Fort being shrewdly gauled by the Musketiers of the neighbouring Trenches of the Field, keeps close within for feare of further danger.</p>
            <p>Vpon this there was a generall cessation of Arms, during which it was ordered that the Assailants were drawn off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the breach, and stand at the foot therof, as it was a guard divided into two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall parts on either side the breach, and a Fugitive taken and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gubasted, and the Traitor that fir'd one of the quarters.</p>
            <p>This was no sooner effected, but that the Drum Major by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, beat a Summons to surrender the Fort.</p>
            <p>The Fort returned no other answer but by a Musket shot
<pb facs="tcp:2067:8"/>
made full at him from the Rampart.</p>
            <p>The Drumme returneth and certifieth the truth hereof to the Counsell and Commanders of the Field, hereupon the battery is renewed, and a generall assault given by the whole Forces of the Field, who were drawne down from their quarters of purpose, and invironeth the Fort round, assaulteth it on all parts at once, and a fresh assault made to enter the breach. Which generall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum and assault did cause them in the Fort to ring out their larum Bell therupon, the Burgers flockt about the Governours, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded a yielding.</p>
            <p>The Governour entring into the resolution of the Souldiers and Townsmen consented to their desire, and with the chief of his Officers mounts the Rampart, and sends a Drum to another part to beat a parley upon the top of the Rampart.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the parley was assured and agreed upon by the Assay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants conditions propounded and consented unto by Field and Fort, and ordred thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>INprimis,</hi> that they should march out of the Fort in a compleat martiall manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> that they might depart the Fort with bag and baggage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impediment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> that the Souldiers should march out with their Muskets loaden and shouldred, matches lighted at both ends, bullets in their mouthes, their rest in their right hands, head-piece upon their heads, and swords by their sides, Pikes in compleat Arms shouldred, Colours flying, and Drums beating like men of Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus those of the Fort are in a Souldier-like manner provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded according to the aforesaid Conditions, marched out of the Fort, all which was compleatly performed in a very seemly and martial manner, who marcht out at the North Pallisado, &amp; wheeld their march towards the Southeast, betwixt the Field Forces and the Raveling, somthing aloof from the Counterscarff, until they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the South Port of the Town where they marcht in and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a volley given at their Commanders doores, lodged their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and past to their severall chambers.</p>
            <p>The Fort thus rendred unto the dispose of the Conquerour,
<pb facs="tcp:2067:9"/>
a counsell is cald by whom it is appointed that the Serjeant Major and his assistance with twenty of the primest Pikes, and twentie choice Musketiers were selected out of both the bands, and being placed in a martiall order, the Musketiers in Front, and Pikes in the Reare, with a large space left for the Colours to march, and thus they advanced and marcht into the Fort. At the North Sally Port rounding the Fort within under the covert of the walls, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing so privatly conceald to view, search and finde out whether there had been any treacherous practices left behind by them that last issued out, but assured themselves that all was secure and no danger to be feared. Then the eight Majors commanded his two Assistants to draw their Companies into two distinct Files, Pikes in Front, and Musketiers in the Reare, then w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> held them off to the right and left, this done, the right hand File mounted close by the North Pallisado to the top of that part of the Rampart.</p>
            <p>The left hand File mounted the Rampart by the South Pallisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, then both marcht upon the top of the Work, and meet upon the midst of the breach where the Serjeant Major took his stand, and presently in a short space marcht down before them through the said breach, and so continued their march to their proper places.</p>
            <p>This being done in forme as aforesaid, the Colonell, Serjeant Major, and the principall Officers (the Lieutenants only excepted, who in the interim attended the Army) guarded with Squadrons both of Pikes and Musketiers, entred the French, and possest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves solely of the Fort, after leaving a sufficient strength to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie it, marcht in a seemly and military manner into the Town.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding this Exercise thus in every particular perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and a world of Spectators in every place, and neer both Cannon and small shot, God be glorified, there was not either man, woman, or child had the least hurt done at all, such was the providence of the Almighty, and such the care of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Officers: as also the expert Musketiers were so respective among themselves that not one Bandeleer took fire to annoy the other, or to endanger the unruly multitude in the least.</p>
            <p>This Exercise was performed with a great deale of charge and care, to the great honour and applause of the Artillery men and
<pb facs="tcp:2067:9"/>
Town. And if I should forget one Alderman that is worthy the memory, one Master <hi>Owner,</hi> I should do him apparant injury, for hee was the motive and principall benefactor who did forward this exercise, not only with his own servants and cattle, but libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally with his purse, and painfully with his own hands, in so much that he was seldome from the work while it was in action, setting forward what might be the furthering therof, sparing no charge, nor horse-flesh upon the prefixed day, but rode well mounted here and there to keep the concourse of people from danger: would there were more of his noble and worthy disposition, which Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman hath done many good deeds besides for the good of the said Town to his credit and applause.</p>
            <p>It was my fortune to be present when this plausible Exercise was put in execution, and although I have seene good service in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> and other places, yet never saw a thing better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and more Souldier-like imitated. And this I say more they are very expert in Armes, and doe performe all their Postures and Motions with judgement and dexterity. I could wish that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in this Kingdome were so well disciplined, and were able to do such service as these can or might, if occasion did importune them therunto.</p>
            <p>To conclude, when all was thus finished and brought punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a period, that noble and free minded Gentlemen Captaine <hi>Meadows</hi> invited his Officers and Souldiers to Supper, where I was my self in person, and there found great store of diversitie of dishes, and I am sure plenty of Wine in a very liberall well besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming way bestowed on them.</p>
            <p>In the same manner did Captain <hi>Warren</hi> provide, and gave free entertainment, together with the rest of the Captains.</p>
