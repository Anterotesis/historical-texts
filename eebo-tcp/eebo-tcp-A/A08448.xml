            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>O immortall God howe sweete and pleasaunte a thing is the glory of the world, trewly it is more to be estemed, then all worldlye treasures or pleasure.

<pb facs="tcp:13756:12"/>
of that simplicitie, and vertuous behauiour as they were in the begynnynge of the primatiue churche, wherfore now it is necessari for them to haue a head whiche may punishe the euill, and rewarde the good. Ye se with your eyes howe many sectes and heresies be nowe in the churche of Christ, and there is smale lyklyhode of amendement, but that it shalbee daylye worse and worse yf some remedy be not founde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes, shortly shall ensue amongest menne suche a licentious and vnbrydled libertie that euery manne wyll attempt to inuent a newe kynde of religion of his owne braine, so that euery man shal beleue what hym listeth, &amp; shal also refuse whatsoeuer shall seme contrary to his priuate commoditie. Wherfore it is very necessary that there bee some supreme head to reduce all menne to an vnitie in religion, wherby all waues of opinions may of a Christian sorte bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ceassed. Experience whiche deceyueth no manne but is the chiefe maystres in consultacion, teacheth thys thynge so euidently that it cannot bee denied. Now that we haue by sage coniecture espied it to be necessary to haue one head in the churche and christian common welth: I iudge that christen men wyl more wyllynglye and readly admit and receyue me for their head and gouernour than anye other manne, whiche thing may be compassed bothe more safely and better without busines, yf the Emperour woulde helpe it forward (being so profitable a thing as it is) with his royall authoritie, agaynst whose wyll and pleasure as I dare attempte nothynge: so would I not doubt but that yf he woulde doe thys thyng hymselfe, it were no smale meanes to encrease his glory, and establishe the continuaunce of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie

I thought the tyme of my tariaunce with this manne to be a whole yere long: he displeased me so with suche a rolling rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical vanitie of wordes. Oh Lorde god that there canne be so muche ambition and desire of honor hid in the brest of a man, and that of a christian man, yea and of a byshoppe whiche will be accounted most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Yt is no meruayle that he intertayned so frendely all straungers that came to Rome, and often tymes praysed them earnestly to the Emperoure, for it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the matter it selfe that it was for none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpose, but to obtaine the fauoure of his negh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and straungers for the better attayninge to this dignitie, whiche he hunteth for. And to cloke his hypocrisie with a gaye outwarde shewe, he sayeth it is very necessary for the church to haue one supreme vniuersal head of the churche in earthe, as thoughe Christe were not the true head of his churche, or els dyd not regarde thynges in earthe, but satte in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen idle and slepinge. He affirmithe also that yf this head be not stablyshed in the churche of Christe, it wyl shortly decay and be vndone: but I am of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye iudgemente: yf Cesars maiestie fulfyll hys ambicious desire the churche of Christ wyll not only
<pb facs="tcp:13756:15"/>
decaye, but it wyll vtterly fall downe, as thoughe it were plucked vp by the rootes. As thoughe the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes which be already were not sufficient for the churches that they haue. And yf there chaunce anye contencion to aryse amongest them they haue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, by whome to make an ende of their stryfe and controuersies. What knowelage canne thys false wretche haue of the churches in Affryke? Or of the churches in Asia, where he was neuer in al the dayes of hys lyfe? but what talke I of Affrike &amp; Asia? How canne he gouerne those churches that bee in Europe whose language for the most parte he vnderstandeth not? By the reason of the great distaunce of places, &amp; varietie of the nacions and menne? Who euer sawe one Crane gyde all other Cranes in the worlde? Who euer sawe a shepard, whiche coulde alone feede all the shepe in the yearth? He were worthye prayse yf he coulde gouerne hys owne well though he were not a whit troubled with caringe for the rest. Who knoweth whether Wolfes maye bee founde in hys owne flocke, and whether he maye worthylye be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the chiefe Wolfe of all? It is not many yeres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone sence Iohn Byshop of Constantinople attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the same interpryse that he might bee made the vniuersall Byshop, whome the whole churche dyd wythstande, and namelye Gregory the fyrste thys mans predecessour, who in hys letters amongest o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thynges wrote vnto hym. That the name of a vniuersall Byshop was a folishe, wicked, proude, and a churche robbing name, and yf he shoulde goe about to vsurpe that name, he shoulde doe nothynge elles but make hymselfe lyke to Lucifer, and be a fore mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of Antichriste, in takinge awaye the glory and dignitie from other bishops hys brethrene, andso to
<pb facs="tcp:13756:15"/>
trouble the concorde, and vnitie of the faythfull, and vndoe the church of Christ. Nowe yf thys ambicious felow may by craft and sutteltie obtayne that thing, which his predecessours with the common prayse &amp; consent of all menne dyd most iustly condempne in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, suerly it shall not be done without great offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of all good menne. Thys I dare be bolde to say, that neither Affcyke, neither Grecia, neither the rest of the churches of the East wyll euer consent hereunto, but wyll rather resist and rebell amongest themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues: and so shall the seameles co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more the churches either wyl not consent thereunto, or elles yf they doe consent it shalbe by compulcion, because they maye easly perceyue howe muche mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe thys meruelous tyranny shall brynge with it. Yf all the tyrantes whiche euer haue bene were ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, they al neuer dyd so much mischiefe to the world as this one is like to doe. I see plainly that thys matter is a thyng most pernicious and hurtful, wherof I ought neyther to thynke, nor speake but onely to put away so great a myschiefe from christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an mens neckes. Yet because I haue made promyse, I wyll see what the Emperour wyll saye to it, and will talke earnestly with hym of the matter, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as this ambiciouse bragger did declare plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he woulde see me well rewarded if I woulde doe that lay in me to helpe the matter forwarde. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, because he is named to be our countrema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one of the Romans I am bownde to promote hys sute and purpose.

he wil forget so great a benefit receaued at my hand. And bee it that there arise contencion amongest the byshoppes, what is that to me? Naye the more they stryue amongest themselues, the more shal they nede themperors helpe with whome I am chief, and so my vantage shalbe the fatter.

And I percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge this thinge to make sumwhat for our purpose did not only confirme and approue hys intente, but also added this thynge more ouer: that he now had such occasion and oportunitie gyuen hym to increase his honour as neuer other Emperor had before him, so that he would speake but one worde. Nowe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these wordes pleased him wonderfully: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siered me earnestly to declare vnto hym how, and by what meanes thys thyng might be brought to passe. Then sayed I: yf your imperiall Maiestie would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte to subdewe the dominions of other princes ye maye not thinke that it would be brought to passe without muche bludshed, without greate daunger and difficultie. But ye haue now an occasion offered vnto you of god, whiche if it will please you to take when it is offered, ye shal not onely without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but also with muche ease and fauour of al partes
<pb facs="tcp:13756:17"/>
subdew all Christian regions. So that those people, whiche be furthest of shall come and submitte them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to youre Maiestie gladly and willingly. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I perceaued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he gaue very good hede to my talke, whyles I shoulde open thys hyd mystery, fyrste I declared vnto him howe the churche of Christe was shaken and tossed with sundry miseries and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and for none other cause but that it lacked one supreme spiritual, and vnyue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sall heade in earthe, whereunto all menne that were afflicted with anye kynde of mysery myght resorte as to a common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and that all menne bothe knewe and desiered this thinge. I declared also howe thys heade for the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s sake of religion, (whereunto al men be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclined,) shoulde easely bee receaued of all the whole worlde. And more ouer by reason of the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der boltes of excomunicacion it should be terrible to all nacions, so that in shorte space it shoulde inioye a fyrme &amp; a perfecte Dominion. Besides this I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that if one of the Emperors subiectes should be chosen to be this supreme heade, whiche shoulde hang all together vpon the Emperors will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, he shoulde bee a very mete instrument easly to compasse the dominion of the whole world. And thus I came nerer by litle and lytle to the communicacion of your moste reuerend hyghnes. I dyd put hym in remembraunce how much you fauoured hys Maies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and howe mete a manne aboue all other ye semed for this purpose, and agayne for the greate eistmaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that ye were byshoppe of Rome, in the whiche roume ye dyd nowe seruice with hyghe prayse and commendacion, and also how muche this thing was desiered of very many menne, which shoulde increase
<pb facs="tcp:13756:18"/>
the renowne of the Emperors Maiestie with a great reioysinge of all nacions. This thinge also I added: Onles his Maiestie woulde declare and establishe this heade by his authoritie, it would shortely come to passe, that some other woulde attempt thesame thinge, and bring it to passe he not knowinge therof, yea thoughe he did gayne saye it, who (to hys Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties greate shame and rebuke) woulde chose some other whiche was no subiecte to his highnes, but (so it might chaunce) his aduersary and foe, that either woulde spoyle vtterly, or at the leste muche vexe the borders of the Romayne Empier. In co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion these and suche lyke reasons preuayled so much with him, that being persuaded he interrupted me of my tale, and spake to me before I had made an ende of shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my mynde, prayinge and besechynge me that I would goe busely about this matter, &amp; that I should come straight way to your hyghnes in his name &amp; so in hys name pray you very earnestly y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye would not refuse thys condicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus offered, neither disdaine to receaue this burden what so euer it bee. And this is trewe also I maye tell your highnes in counsell: The Emperour charged me priuily that I shoulde not tell you that he desired thys thinge so muche for the priuate commoditie, whiche myght thereby to hym insewe, but for the glory of god, and the profit of the churche. Thus your hyghnes hath the begynnynge, the myddest, and thend of my message.</p>

perell, &amp; so harde to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe &amp; so paynful, that I haue repented me more then a thousand tymes sence that euer I begane it. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if I could haue conueniently brought it to passe in time, I would haue cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged my former purpose, and haue desiered you neuer to open your mouth, neither to Themperor, neyther to any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> els for this or such lyke matter.

But nowe am I in suche a perplexitie and doubt that I wot not what is best to doe. For thys is once, I loue quietnes, and my desire is to passe ouer the rest of my lyfe in reste and peace without ruffyllynge and busynes. And on the other syde agayne there is a certaine zeale to the honour and glory of God, which stirreth and prycketh me, neither would I wyllingly resist the callinge of the holy gost. Then commeth in the authoritie of the Emperours Maiestie, whose becke, worde and request, I take to be as a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement vnto me. Therfore tell themperoure howe that when I thought nothyng lesse then thys thing, ye layd glorye of the name of god to my charge, and at the last when ye had proued the thynge to me by excedyng strong reasons, that I coulde not refuse thys heauenly vocation being freely offred vnto me, without a manifest and open iniurie to goddes holy name, and therfore that I was compelled to receyue thys offer. But of thys one thynge I desire you to moue Cesars maiestie very earnestlye, and ye shall moue it to hym in my name, that is, that he wyl con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider agayne and agayne, when I am auaunced vp into thys hyghe estimacyon, I shal haue many ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest aduersaries, whose dartes he hymselfe muste

defend, and also garde and preserue me in that place wherin I am by hym placed. And I thynke it in very dede more wisdome, and more standing with bothe our honours, that euen at the very first begining nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he should grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, neither I vsurpe this supreme authorytie, for the auoyding of all tumult as muche as maye be. Yt is ynough at the first that I bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamed chiefe Bishop of all. And afterwarde as time and occasion shall serue we wyll goe on further a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and litle, vsyng dominion and authoritie mete for suche a dignitie. Therefore let hym spedely cause the wrytinges to bee penned, and proclamacion to bee made throughout the worlde of this hys determinat mynde and pleasure. Shortlye after wyll I come humblye to see hym, and furthermore I wyll haue in remembraunce howe muche I am bounde to you, and what I haue promised you when tyme shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>

            <p>I vnderstande by common reporte that the byshop of Rome is made head of all other churches by Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas oure Emperour.

This priestlynge in continuaunce of tyme, wyll so growe in ambicion pryde and bostyng in vayne glory that he will stablishe hys seate aboue the dignitie of Themperours. There wyll a tyme come, and it is now very nye at hand when it shalbe nedefull for the Emperour if he will haue hys crowne he shall aske it &amp; receyue it (if it please him to geue it) at our bishops handes, and that he shall come as an humble suter to hym and kysse his fete, and he (in the name of God)

Of a lyke fashion the wordes, which Christe spake at hys last supper when he there mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred to his disciples taking breade into his handes, and deliuerynge it broken to them, that sat with him sayinge: this is my body, be semply and planly to be vnderstanded: that is to say, that the bread is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body of Christe, and not the breade is a figure of the body of Christ, of the very same fashion the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours wordes muste be taken when he shewed me all churches sayinge: behold thy doughters, these wordes must be vnderstanded plainly as they stand: wherfore I conclude that they be my trewe lawfull doughtets, and I am theyr mother.</p>

               <p>That talke is more shamefull. Was not Christe hable to gouerne his church as an vniuersal head? In the beginninge of the primatiue churche &amp; a lytle whyle after, the churche of Christe dyd florish very muche, and was wonderfully replenished, and yet had it none other head but Christe. He onely as a true head dyd gouerne it, and that excedinglye well by the instrumentes of hys ministers. Maye it come to passe at any tyme that Christe beinge weried with his painfull gouernaunce woulde nowe rest him? so that he nowe hath committed it to themperours dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecion to apoynt some suffragan, and helper in hys stede? or els truely is he muche displeased with hys churche, and loueth it no more, neither regardeth the gouernaunce therof, but withdraweth his spirite fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, and so shall he be a lyar in that he sayth: I am with you to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worldes ende. Furthermore, themperor as it apereth is more carefull for the church of Christ then god him selfe. For when god withdrewe Christ from his churche, themperour hathe prouided it another head. But accordinge to the doctrine of Paule we be not ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the militant congregacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christe is as one body whose head is, was, &amp; euer shalbe Christ himselfe. He as the only &amp; trewe head hath gouerned it hetherto syngularly well, and will also gouerne it vntyll the latter daye of iudgement, and euen vntill
<pb facs="tcp:13756:24"/>
suche tyme as he hath subdued his enemies and put them vnder hys feete. Thynke ye that christian men be suche bussards that they wyll beleue Christe and hys spirite to be taken awaye vp into heauen as into a place apoynted for hys maiestie: and is there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned as a triumphinge head of the triumphaunte churche? And for that cause the Emperoure hathe apoynted another head of the churche militant in the stede of him, that is abse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? Yf it be so, ye must of force graunt, that theselfe same head, for asmuche as it is destitute of the spirite of Christe, hathe the spirite of the deuyll, &amp; so shall it be a deuelishe head. And yf the churche militant shall from hence forthe haue two heades, surely it shall bee a thynge lyke a monster. Neither canne I perceyue by coniecture howe two headdes being equall in power, and most contrary in condicion, maye quietly and safely liue to gether, and gouerne at one tyme one speciall charge.<note place="margin">Math. 28·</note> Uerely it is to be feared, (so wonderfull is the pryde of oure By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop bred by the bone) that he wyll dryue Christe out of dores from hys owne kyngdome. But peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thys thyng is trewe: yf oure Byshoppe be once made supreme head of the churche militant, by the meanes wherof he maye be estemed aboue Christe: it maye so be that he wyll suffer after a sorte, that at the lest wayes he maye vse hys seruice as he were a slaue.

Thys thyng was very necessary for him to doe. This last reason must we alleage earnestly, and defende it stoutly, yf we intende to obtayne oure purpose. But nowe haue I deuised a farre better waye.

Yf Peter at any tyme woulde haue receyued and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to bee called the chiefe christian Byshoppe, suerlye youre predecessours woulde haue vsurped and challenged thesame title: Which thing because it is not done, but they be called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bishoppes of Rome, many men will thinke that neither they, neyther any of theyr predecessors were euer vniuersall byshoppe of all churches.

And another thing I meruayle at muche more, that althoughe the churche of Christe was at Rome, yea and that many yeres before Paule came thether, and many wyse and godly men were in it (as it appereth in the Epistle, whiche Paule wrote specially to them, wher he saluteth them by name) yet that theyr church was so euell ordered, that it lacked a byshope.</p>

               <p>There were byshoppes there, but Peter was not the first byshop of Rome: but the first chiefe bishoppe of all other, and he made an ordinance that all byshops of Rome, which should afterward folow hym, should also be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> highest bishops aboue all other.</p>

               <p>Uerely I can not see from whence Peter had this authoritie to make suche an ordinance, that all bishops of Rome shoulde be Popes, and vicars of Christ, althoughe they were wicked helhoundes, me
<pb facs="tcp:13756:35"/>
thinketh it had ben done accordinge to iustice, &amp; equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if any shoulde be ordeyned byshoppe aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bishops, and churches, thesame, should be chosen by the consent of all byshops, and all churches. And thys thinge is moste of all to be maruayled at, howe it may come to passe, that all your predecessors from Peter euen vntill thys day were highest byshoppes, and heade of all churches, and yet vsed not they this authorytie? no there was neuer communicacion of it before thys presente.</p>

               <p>Neuer thinke that that is so, as thoughe they were not chiefe byshoppes in very dede: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was not nedeful for them to vse theyr autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and of a certayne modestie, they declared not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues chiefe bishopes, as they were. But nowe there bee so manye heresies arisen in the churche of god, suche sundrye sectes, and dissencions that we haue thought it necessary, for a remedy agaynste so many mischefes, to declare oure selues, what power we haue by Christe, &amp; so to vse oure most high authoritie.</p>

When they came to the very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putacion, themperour had a plentifull oracion, where in he exhortyd all them, that came thether to intreat vpon that matter, to peace, concorde, and vnitie. And when it came to the Popes course to speake, bycause he woulde kepe hys state, he commaunded master Hypocryt to speake in hys name, and he so handled hymselfe with conterfetyd wordes, and gesture, and went aboute wyth suche a force of eloquense to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade them, that the Popes holynes was not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of hym selfe to accept so hyghe a state, but rather earnestly withstode it, and yet hauinge an eye to the

glorye of God, and folowynge the mouynge of the holy gost, at lenghth he toke this heuy &amp; sharpe crosse of the popship vpon him, thys I saye he persuaded in suche sorte, that he had almoste made me beleue it was trewe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he sayed. And so I my sel fe did many times assent to him in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he sayd, that if he could with a saufe conscience leaue thys hyghe authorytye, he bothe redely, and gladlye woulde so doe. But that myght not bee, because by that meanes he shoulde doe God great iniurye. But seynge the matter was so, he was ryght glad that there was at thys present a disputacion appoynted of so greate and weyghtie a matter, whereby the truethe there of myghte bee knowen to all menne.<note place="margin">Thembas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople his reasons.</note> And thus at last beganne the disputacion: Where first arose the embassador of Constantinople, a very wyse manne, and with a loud voyce sayed before the greate audience there assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that all the churches of the vniuersall worlde were highlye offended with thys wonderfull and wickyd primacie of the Byshop of Rome, whyche ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was herd of before. And that Christe hymselfe was the true and onely head of hys churche in thys militant exile: euen as he is also the head of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant churche of the heauenlye Hierusalem, and that he neuer ordayned any other head. Wherefore it was to be thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this wicked innouacion was not of God, and in case it were ordeyned of god, yet could not this supreme honor belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bishoppe of Rome. Therfore was it not onely a diuise of man but wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked also, and wrongfull, and therfore all together de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelishe and not to bee suffered. Not a thinge ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of god, as all myght perceaue, that haue any iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, and so false it was that there coulde be anye
<pb facs="tcp:13756:38"/>
one worde founde in all scripture for the defense of this primacie, that there be a number of sayinges di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly agaynste it. Then arose master Falsidicus, and interrupting the Embassador in his matter spake af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this sorte for the popes defense. Nay in holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there is not one worde contrary, but many thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges be there, which make for it. Fyrst and formost ye knowe right well that Christe saied to Peter. Thou arte Peter, &amp; vpon this rocke wil I buyld my church. Nowe if Peter were made the trewe and only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacion, not of thys or that particular churche, but of the whole vniuersall churche of Christe, by thassente and apoyntment of Christ, it must of force be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the churche was susteyned and gouerned by Peter, whiles he lyued here in earthe, and so was he the vniuersall heade of the churche, as after him Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters successors were, and be the trewe heades of the churche. Hereunto Thimbassador made aunswer. Yf ye fall a gestinge in an ernest matter, it is not to bee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended in: matters of importance. But if ye speake as ye thinke, I maruayle muche that ye bee ignorant. Is it possible ye should be in such an heresie, to thinke Peter was the heade and foundacion of the churche of Christe, that is to saye, of all the faythefull? Truly if it were so, the churche of Christe in tymes paste should haue had a very feble and weeke foundacion, and many tymes shoulde it haue fallen by reason of the feblenes of so slender a grounde. And agayne it is an extreme wickednes and playne ydolatry to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute that to Peter, whiche apperteyneth onely to Christe.

<pb facs="tcp:13756:40"/>
whiche dyd susteyne, and beare thesame, trewlye it shoulde haue weake and verye feble pillers to leaue vpon, and so feble, that it woulde not once, but more then a thousand tymes haue ben ouerthrowen, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because this thing is without controuersie. When the Byshope of Rome is dead, there is not by and by another chosen in his roume, but some dayes at the least come betwen, wherin the church of Christ should lacke a head, thoughe it neuer lacked one at any tyme elles. Nowe maye you perceyue whether the churche were then destroyed or not. And this dare I boldlye saye, yf the churche of Christ shoulde leane vpon men after thys sorte, as vpon the foundacion, hell gates had preuayled agaynst it longe before thys tyme. Furthermore, yf we were grounded vpon men, and shoulde trust to them as to oure grounde worke, and foundacion, we shoulde be all accursed, accordyng to the sayng: Cursed be that manne whiche putteth hys trust in manne.<note place="margin">Iere. ii.</note> And then shoulde not our churche be the churche of Christ, but the Sinagoge of Satan, and Peter shoulde haue erred excedyngly, Christe beyng lyfted vp in to the highe place of heuen, and he lefte for the foundacion of the churche in earthe, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he exhorteth Christian men not to buylde vpon hym, but vpon Christe the true and suer foundacion, and grounde worke of his churche.

Of a lyke sort he aunswered in the name of them all, when he spake these wordes: Thou art Christe the sonne of God.

For by that meanes the trueth might appere, what was ment by these keyes, and what is thys authoritie? To thys master Falsidicus made aunswere: That he assuered Peter of them, when after hys resurrection he asked Peter, whether he loued hym more earnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ly then the rest dyd or not? vnto whome Peter made aunswere, saying. Thou knowest O Lord that I loue the, then Christ gaue him iniunccion to feede his shepe. In the very selfe same houre he made him the chiefe shepard and bishop of al soules. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Thembassador of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople smylinge sayed: yf preachinge the worde of God be the fedinge of soules, (as the holy doctors with one assent doeth expound it, it is with out dout that that office was not onelye gyuen to Peter, but also to al the rest of thapostles, and namely to Paule, who wryteth in special wordes, that he labored more then all the rest did in the ministery of preaching. Yea and Christe himselfe before he spake these wordes to Peter, commaunded the selfe same thynge to all the Apostles sayinge: goe ye throughe out the vniuersall worlde, and preache the Gospell to all creatures. So
<pb facs="tcp:13756:42"/>
that it can not be sayed that the office of preachynge was gyuen by Christe onely, to Peter, and to the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes of Rome in ordinary succession after him, by whose appoyntment it shoulde also descend to other. For then must it be graunted that there hath bene ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fewe lawefull and trewe Byshoppes, whiche had lawefull authoritie to preache, and so fewe that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter onely maye bee accountyd the trewe Byshoppe, whiche preached lawefully, and a fewe besides, who were by him appoynted in such countryes where as he preached. By thys meanes Paule and the elleuen Apostles, and suche as were by them conuerted to the faythe, neither were truely bishoppes, neither yet preached lawefullye, because they neither had their Bishoprike, neither authoritie to preache of Peter. And more ouer none after the death of Peter should haue bene made Bishop, neither haue licence to prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che besydes the Byshoppe of Rome. And truely the Byshoppes of Rome, haue committed a greuouse of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in that they haue hyd this large and greate au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorytye of theyrs, that they had so necessarye in the churche of God. Then replied master Falsidicus, euen as Peter (quod he) loued Christ more earnestly then the rest of the Apostles, as it is plaine by the wordes of his aunswere, when Christe demaunded him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he loued hym more feruentlye then the rest dyd: so had he more authoritie gyuen vnto hym ouer the shepe of Christ, then the rest of the Apostles. To this answered thimbassador of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinoble. And where I praye you haue you founde that Peters aunswere was to Christ, that he was more earnestly beloued of him then of the rest of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles. Not withstandyng that he was so demaunded, yet hys aunswere was
<pb facs="tcp:13756:43"/>
onely in thys wyse. Thou knowest O lorde that thou art belouyd of me. He sayed not: Thou knowest O Lorde that thou ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e more feruentlye belouyd of me then of the rest. For so coulde he neuer haue sayed without greate suspicion of arrogancie, because it was vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hym how much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rest loued Christ. But let it be graunted that Christ was more earnestly beloued of Peter then of the rest: doeth it therefore folowe, that Christ gaue him more power? Or in case he gaue hym more was it therfore most of all? For it is not all one thing to saye fede my shepe, and to saye, be thou head of my churche, or elles: Take thou more authoritie then the other Apostles. And as for that Christe demaundyd of him thryse, whether he loued hym or not: it was done for thys ende and purpose, that hys loue beinge declared by thryse confessynge, myght counteruayle and somewhat make amendes for his fault. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he thrise denied him, he minded to haue Peters loue sealed, (as it were) &amp; warranted before he would commit vnto him the cure of soules, that all menne myghte knowe no man can bee a good shephard onles he loue Christ earnestly. Furthermore yf your reason were a good reason, it shoulde rather folowe therof that Christe declared Ihon the chiefe Byshop then Peter. For it is written of Iohn, this is the disciple whom Christ loued. Wherfore if he were beloued of Chris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> aboue other, he gaue vnto him more worthye gyftes, &amp; replenished him more abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye with grace, and therfore placed hym aboue the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and namelye for that he was more mete for the purpose by the reason of the excellent giftes, whiche he receiued at Goddes handes. And so much the more bycause it shoulde rather appeare, that Ihon loued
<pb facs="tcp:13756:43"/>
Christ more then the other did, &amp; was loued againe of Christ, &amp; knew hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more thorowly, &amp; therfore more like to be iudged worthye to feed the shepe of Christe.</p>
               <p>Yt maybe proued that Christ would haue ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hym the vniuersall shepard, not onely by reason of the noble light of the heuenly spirit, wherwith he was indued, and was alwayes nighe and familiare to Christe, and amongest all the rest of thapostles he alone folowed him to the crosse: but chiefly for thys cause, that when he was vpon the crosse he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his mother vnto him, in whome only (as you your selues doe confesse) the lyuely churche of Christe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned after Christes death. For al thapostles were not a litle afrayed, and dismayd with that terryble &amp; dolefull sight of Christes death vpon the crosse, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as Christe had told hym before. And if Iohn were not ordeyned the supreme head of the churche of Christe, then muche lesse was Peter.

It is plain that the Euangelistes agre hetherto. Iohn further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more doeth adde that Christe sayed vnto them, take ye the holy goste.

Now afterward when he gaue them the keyes, Iohn writeth that he sayed: whose synnes so euer ye forgeue, they bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuen them, and whose sinnes so euer ye retaine they be retayned. That is to say: I deliuer you the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and giue you authoritye and power to open and shit thesame, by the kingdom of heauen he vnderstandeth the kyngdome of grace, and the kyngdome of glorye. The synnefull manne was driuen out of the kingdome of the heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, neither can he fynde any meanes or wayes to entre into thesame agayne but by faithe.<note place="margin">Rom. iiii.</note> Accordinge to the doctrine of paule.<note place="margin">Rom. x.</note> He can not beleue of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sorte onles he heare the worde of the gospell, whiche can not be without preaching.

                  </gap>l, that is to saie to teach that men be saued by Christ. Because that when thei were sinners, and without the kingdome of the grace of Christe, neyther had any waye opened whereby they might entre: thapostles in preachinge the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell opened the gate of the fauour and grace of god vnto them, which guided them in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ready and plaine waye, wherby they might obteyne to them selues the fauor of god by beleuing that Christ died for them, by whose mean and helpe they are saued, thapostles did moue, and styre men to giue credit to this truthe. And suche of them as beleued, entred in the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chryste by fayth, and the Apostles opened the gate vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by preaching the word of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, &amp; did set open the waye for their entrye. But if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hearers of this preachi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g beleued not: thapostles dyd shut the gate of gods fauor, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they taught in their preachinge, that onles they beleued the gospell there was no hope of saluacion, neither any other way or meanes, wherby they mought entre the kingdome of the fauor of god: Not withstandinge they had done as many good workes, as bee in the whole worlde.

               <p>Not that the Apostles themselues should haue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and authoritie to pardon, and forgeue sinne, for that belongeth to God alone.

<pb facs="tcp:13756:46"/>
all nacions in hys name. So that by thys it is easie to be perceyued, that Christe gaue hys Apostles keyes and power, not properly to forgyue synne, but to preache remission of synnes to all them that beleue throughe Christ. The selfe same thyng maye also be confirmed by the authoritie of Saynct Marke: who expondyng thesame sentence (although it be in other wordes) sayeth: that Christe sayed to his Apostles. Goe through out the whole worlde and preache the gospell to all creatures: who so beleueth and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised shalbe saued: and he that beleueth not shall be dampned. Whereby it maye be well perceyued, that the authoritie &amp; power which Christ gaue vnto hys Apostles, was nor to saue and condempne: but onely to preache the gospell, and to shewe the waye of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacion, in that they moued me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to enter into that way, and they declared hym to be within the compasse of condempnacion which gaue no credit to the gospell, and went about to disuade men from thys vnbelefe. These be the keyes: thys is the power whiche Christ gaue to hys Apostles, and not onely to his Apostles, but also vnto all their successors. Which thyng doeth euidently appeare by the wordes of Christ, when he sayeth to his Apostles. That whiche I saye to you, I saye to all.<note place="margin">Mar. 13.</note> Neither semeth it any thing lykely, that he spake that thyng whiche he taught, to them only: but to all. Truelye thys is certayne as Saynct Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome wrot vpon thys sayng. (To the I will gyue the keyes of the heauenly kyngdome). That y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bishops &amp; priestes haue thought hitherto, by the reason of their pryde, and pharisaical arrogancie, that they had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to condempne the gyltles, and to deliuer the gyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But truelye they bee deceyued all ouer the fielde.
<pb facs="tcp:13756:46"/>
Because that the question is not before God of the iudgement of the priest: but of the life of the sinner. Whereby he playnlye declarethe, that the choyse of binding and loosinge is not left in the libertie of the priest, but in the sinner, who is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to beleue. The minister of Gods word doeth not absolue, but he publisheth &amp; declareth man to be absolued: &amp; likewise he declareth man to be bound and condempned onles he beleue. Euen as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scepter royal signifieth a kinges power, and the swerde the empire: So likewise doth the keyes betoken the spirituall gouernaunce of the kingdome of god. For whosoeuer he be that preache the gospell, be it whosoeuer ye will: in that he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, he doeth all that lyeth in him to open the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the hearers, whether it be openly or priuatly that he preache to one or to many. More o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he delyuereth all the beleuers, he forgiueth all theyr synnes, he saueth them, and bringeth them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdome of God, when he teacheth that they be fre by faythe, and because they beleue, that theyr synnes bee forgeuen them they bee saued, and in the kingdome of Christe. Agayne on the other syde, he byndeth al them, which beleue not, he retayneth their synnes, he condempneth them, and shutteth them out of the kingdome of heauen, when he teacheth them that they are bound, that they remaine in theyr sinne, that they be dampned, and shut out of the kingedome of grace by the reason of theyr vnbelefe. But thys thing is worthye to be noted y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is two kinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of Christe in earthe, whereof the one is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and canne not bee seen, wherin dwell onely the godly and righteouse men: and another, that is much greater, wherein abyde not onely the good, but also

Wherfore eyther Christe is a lyar when he sayeth that he taught all: or elles were the apostles wicked, in that they did not put the rest of the articles of our faythe into the Creede, whiche the byshoppes of Rome boaste they could fynd out afterwarde, and that suche articles (as they saie) as be very necessary, besides a greate number of preceptes, whiche they haue inuented.

And because Christe sayed to Simon, from henceforthe thou shalt bee called Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,<note place="margin">Mat. xxvi. c.</note> whiche by interpretacion signifieth a head: ye muste of necessitie graunt that Christe gaue in deede that, whiche he promysed with speciall and playne wordes. Simon was called Cephas,<note place="margin">Iohn. i. d</note> that is to saye a heade, then it foloweth that he was a heade by the name, that Christe gaue him, ergo he was a head in dede, that the trueth might be agreable to the name. To this thembassador aunswered. Truly ye be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be burned, for yf ye burne them, which depraue the wrytinges of thapostles, what ought ye to doe to them, which peruerte falsely the wordes of Christ himselfe?

               <p>First &amp; formost thus he saied. Euen as it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the scriptures of the olde testament that the fyrste begotten, was the Lorde ouer all hys bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, euen so because it is euident that Peter was the fyrste begotten of Christ, he must be lord ouer all the rest, &amp; supreme head of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole church of Christe. Which thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g may be proued by that, that Peter as the chiefe &amp; moste worthy parson speaketh alwaies first for them all: and amongest the reste he was alwayes accounted, and named the first. Yea be it, that it could not bee proued by anye worde of God, that Peter was declared supreme head by Christ: yet ought we to beleue it, forasmuche as we muste assuredlye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade our selues, that Christe ordeyned his churche well, and therefore that it was done by a certayne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>easo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; order, for wher as a certaine order is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, ther must al thinges of force be ful of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13756:51"/>
And certayne order can there none be, where as there be not degrees of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> higher, and lougher. But where as there is a higher degre of men, there muste ye as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cende and come to one, as to a supreme head, that the nature of order maye bee preserued, whiche bycause it can not procede so farre, but that it muste haue an ende, onles there shoulde be some supreme head esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, it shoulde come all together to nothing. Now likely it is not, that Christ appoynted any other head then Peter: ergo Peter was the supreme head. The selfe same thynge maye be proued of the order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural thynges, where all thynges be referred to one, as to a chiefe beginninge and originall cause. For not onely in any ciuile gouernaunce of man (yf the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welthes be well ordered) there is one supreme head: but amongest brute beastes also we see thys dignitie of order obserued. Bees haue their kynge, who gouerne the baser sorte of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ouersee them to doe their dewties. The Cranes haue one chief guide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom all the rest doeth folowe. The shepe also haue their shepehard,<note place="margin">Iohn. x.</note> whose voyce they know, &amp; whom they folowe, and at whose commaundement they be. So that, loke howe muche the church of Christ is more excellent, &amp; more perfect, then other thynges, that belonge to manne, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so better gouerned, so much is it the more lykely, that there must be one supreme head in it, at whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement all menne must hange, as thoughe he were a God. To these reasons the imbassador made aunswere. Yf the first begotten amongest thapostles ought to be lord of al the rest (as Falsidicus said eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nowe) for as muche as Andrewe was called before Peter to the office of the Apostleshipe, Peter shoulde
<pb facs="tcp:13756:52"/>
not take the lordshippe awaye from hym, whiche of ryght shoulde haue a better tytle to it. But trueth it is, that Christ is the first begotten amongest his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, &amp; he is onely the lord of all. And all the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the first be gettyng, whiche was shadowed in the first begotten of the olde testament, is fulfilled in Christ hymselfe. Nowe bycause that the kyngdome of Christ is altogether spirituall, he maye be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted greater, higher, and more excellent, not that is first borne to Christe in this worlde, nor he that is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, or more noble after the fleshe, not he that is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter learned: but he that excelleth more in godlynes, &amp; hath receyued more lighte and strengthe of the holy gost. And althoughe Peter vsed ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times to choppe in, and speake firste by the reason of his boldnes, hys zeale, hys earnestnes, and age: yet foloweth it not of that, that he had authoritie and dominion ouer the rest of the Apostles, neither that he was their Pope. Neither is he whiche speaketh fyrste in any congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacion to be thought the head of all the rest. For then in dede shoulde Peter haue bene Pope not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christe gaue hym the keyes, but also before he promised hym them, bycause that often tymes longe before that tyme, he spake before hys felowes. And Philip also, and Andrewe, and Thomas, and the rest should by this reason haue bene Popes, all the which spake first a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry times. And although Christ whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he numbred the Apostles,<note place="margin">Iohn. vi.xi and .xiiii.</note> named Peter first, yet is it not necessary, that therfore he shoulde be Pope ouer the rest. Euen as our Byshop of Constantinople hath spoken first in sundrye counselles that hath bene, and hath also bene taken for the first Byshop, bycause he spake fyrst, and sat first in the congregacion. And yet
<pb facs="tcp:13756:52"/>
for all that was he neuer iudged Byshop ouer all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Byshoppes, neither yet their head, (whiche ye chalenged to you by tyrannye) I graunte trewly that Christ dyd set in order, and gouerned his church wonderfully well, and that it hathe gone forward in a wonderfull ordre, so that I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>an not deny but there muste bee some supreme heade in that churche. But that heade is Christe hym selfe (as Paule testifieth) who by his spirite is present with hys churche euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and gouerneth it after a more wonderfull fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion then mannes vnderstanding can comprehende. Neither is it nedefull to dreame of any other vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall heade in earthe, for Chryst him selfe without any other Popes, gouerneth hys churche by hys mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters most wonderfully, but let vs graunt that Christ declared Peter to be the heade of thapostles and of the fyrste churche, at the whiche tyme because they were very fewe he might right well gouerne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all. But now when the church of Christ is spred abrod throughe out the whole worlde, it is not possible for him to knowe them all, or to visit them all, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande theyr tonges, to heare theyr matters, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyde for them all, and gouerne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al well.

chiefe prieste of the Iewes, saying: it is plaine, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde testament is a figure of the newe, nowe then, as they by the wyll of god had one chiefe priest aboue all other, so the christian men now a daies must haue one Pope. And he must be honoured, &amp; set forth with such beutie and glory, that the kinges of the world (as the prophetes haue spoken before) shall come to wurship this merueylous godhead in earth.

for many. Wherby it is easie to perceiue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ch of Christ is al together spiritual.

So that for asmuche as Christe onely hathe the greatest plentifulnes of the spirite, he muste without controuersy be iudged, and estemed the chiefe, and head preste of al other. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yf the byshoppe of Rome desier the place of the chiefe byshoppe, he muste of necessitie haue greatest haboundance of the spirite, euen as Christe had, and then, when he is equall with Christe, he shall also be chiefe byshoppe, and chiefe heade equal with Christ: but this also is necessary to bee knowen that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the spirite is verye diuerse and contrary, (eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as Christ taught) to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dominion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flesh, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest carnall men, suche as haue more riches, more stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, more fauour amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, more fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dshipes, &amp; more nobilitie of bloud, they be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lordes ouer other, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, they haue other ministers to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they be honoured and obeyed, &amp; many times they oppresse the weaker, and vse tyranny ouer them. But it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywise in the spirituall churche of Christe: for such as haue greater light of the spirite they be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and greater. And they that bee suche, serue all other by the helpe of the spirite, as menne that hath receyued greater gyftes of god, more light of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, more grace, more spirite and a greater talent. So that he, which hath receaued more habou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance of the spirite helpeth more, and serueth more the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of other, and setteth forthe the glory of god
<pb facs="tcp:13756:59"/>
more plentifully. And because Christe had most sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular plenty of the spirite, therfore came not he to bee serued, but to serue for the helth of his chosen. Yea &amp; he serued all without excepcion,<note place="margin">Mat. xx. d. Mar. x. e. Luc. xxii. b</note> and that also hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinge himselfe extremely, vntyll that he (moued of an exceding greate loue) spent hys own life vpon the crosse. Therefore woulde Christe haue it knowen to hys chosen, that yf ye wil haue a trew nobilitie, and worthynes,<note place="margin">Phil. ii. a.</note> ye muste haue a spirite. Christe abused not this spirituall greatnes of hys, whiche was in the highest degre of honour: therby to chalenge anye honour? before manne, or for thobteynyng of riches, or imperiousely to vse the seruice of hys subiectes, neyther to seke for any priuate commoditie, but to serue other, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eke for the profyt of other. The power therefore, and thegreatnes of the ministers of Christe is alltogether spiritual, and standeth wholly in the seruice, and gouernaunce of soules helthe. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bishop of Rome seketh for no other thing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be estemed greate before the worlde, that he maye bee worshipped in earthe, as it were a god, and haue ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to vse tyranny ouer all churches, to spoyle; and destroy them at his pleasure. Yf the church of Christ wer now as in times paste it was ordeyned to be: he shoulde be thought greater then all the reste, who is indued with more lyght from aboue, and hath recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued more gyftes, and benefites of Goddes hand, and this worthynes of hys woulde he onelye vse in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge forthe of the gospell, whereby he might wynne as many soules, as myght bee to Christ. So that be it that Christe had geuen the power of the keyes of the kingdome of heauen to Peter onely, and by him to you that be byshoppes of Rome: (which thinge is

               <p>Yf therfore our Byshoppe were Pope neuer so much (as he striueth to be) and Christes vicar in earthe, it is very trewe, that he hath no more power or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie gyuen hym by Christ, then had Christe himselfe.

Then the Embassadoure of Antioche spake in thys wise.<note place="margin">Thembassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioche.</note> Because me thinketh it sufficientlye declared that holy scripture doeth not onely not stablishe the primacie of Peter, but also seme quite contrary ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: I will speake my mynde breflye as I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, neither will I bringe any moe reasons, or argumentes then thys one, althoughe it bee easy to fynde a number. Be it that we graunted Peter to be the vniuersall byshope ordeyned of Christe ouer hys churche (whiche thinge is not trewe) yet muste it not therefore bee graunted that the byshoppes of Rome ought to bee popes, but rather our byshoppes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioche oughte to be the chiefe, and vniuersall byshop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes. Because that our byshops, and not the byshop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Rome were the successours of Peter. For Peter was byshop of Antioche, and so vnlykely a thynge is it that Peter was euer at Rome. To this argument master Pseudologus made aunswere in the name of our pope, crying out w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a loude voice vntill his sides cracked again, saying. Peter was here our byshop in Rome, &amp; our pope .xxv. yeares together co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually,
<pb facs="tcp:13756:64"/>
and in this same citie was he afterwarde crucified. Then Thimbasadour aunswered. A prety rewarde, for paynes taken in preachinge. But tell me I praye you. In what place of scripture fynde you that he was euer at Rome? Then aunswered master Pseu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dologus: In no place of scripture quod he. But it may well be founde in our Historiographers, and in many other bokes of our byshoppes. and other holy menne. Whereunto thimbassadoure answered. Then howe knowe you by the worde of god, that your by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes of Rome be the chiefe vniuersall byshoppes of the churche of Christe, if ye haue not that in holy scripture, that Peter was euer at Rome? Trewely if ye intend to proue youre byshoppes to bee popes by the word of God: ye muste fyrste proue by thesame worde that Peter was ordeyned of Christe the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall heade of his whole churche. And then must ye proue by the worde of god, that Christe vndoutedly gaue the same authoritie to Peter to make the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes of Rome after hym chiefe byshops by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These thinges done ye might well beleue that youre byshoppes were popes by the worde of God. But there is not one of these thre thinges, that ye ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proue by scripture, especially the second &amp; the thyrd, as ye youre selfes doe confesse. Wherefore I canne not see with what face ye canne beare downe so manifest a lye. Then master Pseudologus sayd. We know that our byshop is pope, &amp; that with a fulnes of power, &amp; we knowe that he hathe receaued thys authoritie of Christe by the meanes of. S. Peter, and not of man
<pb facs="tcp:13756:64"/>
wherefore we knowe him to bee pope by the lawe of god, and not by the lawe of manne, and we will also holde, and beleue thys trueth as an article of oure faithe notwithstandinge that none of these thinges before rehersed can be proued by thauthoritie of holy scripture. Then sayed thimbassadour.</p>
               <p>Because wee all bee bounde to beleue the articles of our faythe, as the foundacions, and chiefe principles of our religion, it is nedefull that they appeare moste playnly by scripture. And you wyll sette fire, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes before the whole worlde, to make men beleue that thynge, whiche by your owne confession can not be proued by the authoritie of the holye scriptures. Where I praye you can menne laye the foundacion of their fayth, yf they be compelled to beleue, and to confesse as a necessary article of their fayth, your By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe to be the vniuersall head of the churche of Christ, when there is not one word therof in the holy scripture? Yt is an intolerable tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny, the like where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath not bene herd to bynde the conscience of men to receyue so manyfest a lye for an article of their fayth, seing it can not onely not be proued by goddes worde, but also all the whole scripture is agaynst it. You ought to be content to binde men to beleue that the Pope hathe the highest authorite of all. But ye wyll further compel them to beleue that, that power, and authoritie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth fullye, and wholly from God, and not from manne, although that thyng can in no wyse be proued by scripture. Furthermore he would haue it be beleued that it maye bee proued by holye scripture that oure Byshoppe was Pope, when you your selues be forced to graunte that it can not bee proued by holy scripture, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter was euer at Rome.
<pb facs="tcp:13756:65"/>
Of thys chiefe and vniuersall byshoprike of your by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe ye can haue none other opinion, but that it is a deuise of manne, seing the contrary can not be proued by the worde of God: And you wyll haue it receyued for an article of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith, and that it shal be beleued with an heauenly faythe. Yf ye bee not sure whether Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were euer at Rome, or not, for the whiche cause ye chaleng your byshoppe to be chiefe, and the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor of Peter, how can ye haue certayne knowledge of thys your chiefe Byshoprike, but vpon the saying of men onely who naturally be lyars? To thys master Pseudologus made aunswere. The men which sayd that Peter was at Rome were the chiefe byshoppes of all other, and therfore coulde they not lye, when they so sayed. Wherefore we be sure and certayne of our popeshippe. Then the imbassador sayed: Ye take for a grounde that thyng, whiche ye had most nede to proue. That is, that your Bishoppes were chiefe By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes: and then, agayne that they coulde not erre, bothe the whiche poyntes I vtterlye denye. Yf ye would say, some sainctes affirme Peter some tyme to haue bene at Rome. I woulde streight make answere that I knewe not whether they were Saynctes or not, for that there is no worde thereof in scripture. But ye wyll peraduenture saye, they were cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized of oure chiefe Byshoppes, whiche coulde not erre: to that wyll I aunswere as before, that ye take that thynge for your profe, whiche remayneth first to to be proued.

                  </gap>e were assured that they were Saynctes, yet must it be graunted that Saynctes haue sometyme erred. And so it maye be that they erred euen the very same time, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they sayd Peter was once at Rome. Namely the thyng being spoken of them, not to that
<pb facs="tcp:13756:65"/>
ende that it shoulde be receyued for an article of oure fayth necessary for saluacion, as your mynde is: thus by all meanes be you in an error. But let vs graunte that there hath bene some reuelacion touchyng thys poynt, surely I must nedes thynke that it was an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion of the deuill. Yea be it that it were God hym selfe, which had reueled thesame thyng vnto you, &amp; that it were trueth in dede, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was a reuelacion frome god: yet because there is no worde in all scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thinge, neyther haue other menne this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelacion of yours, ye shoulde in no wise force menne to beleue this your popeshippe, as an article of theyr faythe. And furthermore I will proue by strong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that these historiogrephers of yours, these by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopes, and sayntces, whiche wrote that Peter was the chiefe byshoppe at Rome, and was put to deathe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same citie, lyed vnreasonably. And fyrst of all tell me in good faythe. What tyme say they that Peter was at Rome? and howe long dwelt he there?<note place="margin">That Peter was not at Rome.</note> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>swered Pseudologus. That he came to Rome the seconde yere of Claudius themperoure, and was made byshoppe there, and dwelt there .xxv. yeres, by whose preachinge Rome was brought to the faythe of Christe, as both Eusebius, and.

After hym succeded Caius and reygned iiii. yere. Then folowed afterwarde Claudius. Nowe then yf Peter came to Rome the seconde yere of Claudius, ye muste nedes graunt that Peter came to Rome within xi. yeres after Christes deathe. Agayne on the other side: it is playne by the wordes of holye
<pb facs="tcp:13756:66"/>
scripture, that Paule was not onely not conuerted to the faythe when Christe suffered vpon the crosse, but it appereth also that he was not conuerted, when ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane was stoned. Because the scripture is playne that he kepte theyr garmentes, whiche stoned Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to death. This being so, Paule himselfe writeth to the Galathians y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he came to Hierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> .xvii. yeres after he was conuerted,<note place="margin">Gala. ii.</note> and that then he founde Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there. Thys was at the leste the .xviii. yere after the deathe of Christe. Then if Peter were yet at Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem .xviii. yeres after the deathe of Christe, how can it bee that he came to Rome the seconde yere of Claudius, as you saye, whiche was theleuenthe yere after Christes deathe. You youre selues maye easely perceaue when ye saye so, that ye speake directlye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste the manyfeste wordes of the scripture. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore Peter was at Hierusalem, not onely eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tene yeres after the deathe of Christe, but thesame tyme also was he sent to preache the gospell not to the Romans but to the Iewes. And it is to bee bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that he preached y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospell amongest the Iewes.<note place="margin">Roma. xvi. b</note> And Paule also in thesame epistle, which he wrote to the Romans, because he saluteth a great many there by name, trewly he woulde haue saluted Peter also, if he had then bene the chiefe byshoppe there, as you contende. Wherefore it is easy to be proued that it is a very false lye, that youre Historiographers doe wryte. But to say the truethe, they, that be named to wryte thys gear, be not the authors thereof, but they bee youre lyes, whiche you haue annexed maliciously to theyr bokes directly repugninge to the manifeste authoritie of the holy scripture. Then master Pseu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dologus brought forthe a very olde booke, that laye
<pb facs="tcp:13756:66"/>
by hym, so olde that it was eaten with mothes, and wormes, wherein there were certayne Epistles I canne not tell what, wryten by Clement, as he sayed, whome he iudged the fyrste byshoppe of Rome after Peter. In these letters wrytten by thesame Clement to Iames byshoppe of Hierusalem this thinge was conteyned, howe Peter beinge at Rome, and percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge death drawe nere, in the presence of a number of Christian menne, toke Clement by the hand, and in the hearing of them all saied. Bretheren, my death is now at hande, as Christe hathe reueled vnto me. Wherefore I ordeyne thys Clement youre byshop, vnto whome onely I deliuer my seate, and the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge of my doctrine, into whome onely I translate the same power of loosinge and byndinge, whiche I receaued of Christe. Then sayed Pseudologus. Loe here maye you see howe that Peter was at Rome, and ordeyned Clement byshoppe after hym, and set him in hys seate, grauntinge him hys full authoritie. Then thimbassadour would see and reade those epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, &amp; when he had red and weied them he sayd mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myne Pseudologus.

                  </gap>are as they bee, that is to say, lyes, euen at the fyrste sight. For these epistles of youres bee nothinge els but fayninges of youre owne without authoritye, full of vanyties and lyes. And that it is trew, I say, hereby it maye appere, that euen by youre owne Historyographers Linus folowed Peter, and not Clemente.</p>
               <p>And after Linus folowed Anacletus, &amp; afterwarde Clement. Who is numbred to bee the fourthe after Peter, and yet would you falsely place hym to be the
<pb facs="tcp:13756:67"/>
secounde. And more ouer by youre owne historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers, yf ye wyll account the course of the times as ye shoulde, ye shall finde that Iames was dead seuen yeares before your Clement was Byshoppe: wherefore I can not saye by what reason he coulde writ to Iames beinge dead. And agayne euen in the first beginning of the salutacion, he calleth hym By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe of byshoppes, who should gouerne not onelye the churche of the Iewes at Hierusalem, but also all other churches. And yf Iames were then Pope, trewely then was not Peter Pope, and therefore could he not make Clement Pope after hym, neither by Clemente his successours. And more ouer euen by the same very wordes, that ye alledge, that Peter shoulde saye to Clement before hys death, it can not be proued that Clement was ordeyned vniuersall Byshoppe of all churches: but onelye the byshoppe of the church of Rome. Besides this, if Clement was made Byshoppe of Rome by Peter, as you saye he was, and not chosen of the people, no doubt hys suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors woulde haue folowed the same example, whiche thyng they dyd not, and therefore it is false that Peter made hym Byshoppe. I will passe ouer that neither Eusebius, neither Hierome, number these Epistles amongest Clementes workes.<note place="margin">Distinct .xv. Sancta Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mana eccles.</note> Yea &amp; Clement hym selfe in these Epistles prayseth a boke that he shoulde write, the title wherof is Itinerari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Clementis, whiche boke of trueth was neuer of hys makynge. And furthermore thys boke maketh mencion of dioceses, archbyshoprikes, primacies, and bishoprikes, whiche orders, and names were not yet distincted and appoynted out, neyther doeth he anye thyng els in these Epistles, but set forth the dignitie
<pb facs="tcp:13756:67"/>
and fredome, of priestes: whome he wyll haue so free, that they shall not intermedle themselues with anye handycraft, for a profe of the which absurditie he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth certayne places of holye scriptures wrythed beyond the nocke. More ouer in his second Epistle he is so bolde to teach Iames of what sorte he shoulde minister the Sacramentes. And yet that fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not obserued thys daye, namely in the administracion of the lordes supper. Furthermore none of the auncient writers make any mencion of these Epistles, neither yet of them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Anacletus or Euaristus should wryte. He citeth out of the newe, and olde testament that it is not laweful for priestes to sacrifice or syng masse, but when the Byshoppe commaundeth them. which thynge can neither be founde in the newe, neither in the olde testament. In the fyft Epistle he affirmeth that all thynges, wyfes and other, shoulde be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and that yf it be not so it commeth of the wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes of menne. There bee also in thesame Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles many other folishe thynges and lyes, whiche he rehersed, but bycause ye maye read them your selfe, I wyll reherse no more. Master Pseudologus she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed also certeyne other epistles wrytten as he sayed by Anacletus and Euaristus, whereby he minded to stablysh this popeshippe. But thimbassadour proued by good reasons that they all were of none authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, because that it is conteined in them that Clement should be his predecessor, which thing Hierome deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, &amp; also Ireneus. Further, he would not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> priestes should be accused, or iudged, for a profe wherof alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scriptures with out iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he wil haue Byshoppes iudges in seculer matters, and that euery manne maye apeale to them. When it is well
<pb facs="tcp:13756:68"/>

And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more I can proue the Epistles of Euaristus to be of none authoritie, not onely by that he bryngeth manye sentences of scripture sasly writhed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> priestes should not be accused of any lay me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but also because he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ad Gallium, &amp; Bardua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, two Counsels, in whose tyme Anacletus was Byshop of Rome, &amp; not Euari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus which thing is euident by the histories. Master Pseudolog us blushed, &amp; was ashamed wonderfully, when these thinges were layd to his charge, because he appeared openlye to all mens sight to haue played a false parte, whiche thinge, when the embassador of Antioche perceyued, he left hym as he was, and gaue place to the imbassador of Hierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who spake than wonderfully in this wise.<note place="margin">The imbassa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dor or Hieru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>salem.</note> There is no doubt but that Christ, who was the chiefe and vniuersall Byshop of hys churche, preached his gospell chiefely at Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which place he was contented to dye for our sakes. And this is also certaine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Iames succeded in hys roume, who was nexte Byshoppe in Hierusalem after Christ. Wherfore yf there shoulde be any supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, vniuersall, and visible head stablished in yearth of the church of Christ militant (because it is sufficiently proued that Peter was not the chiefe Byshoppe) our Byshoppes of Hierusalem oughte to be Popes and not the Byshoppes of Rome. For you woulde haue your Byshoppes of Rome to be Popes because of none other reason, but that they succeded Peter: we maye muche the better chalenge oure Byshoppes of Hierusalem to bee chiefe Byshoppes, because they
<pb facs="tcp:13756:68"/>
succeded Christ, in so muche as Christ is greater, and more excellente then Peter. As touching Christe it is knowen ryght well that he was the vniuersall head of hys churche, and that he was crucified in Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. And more ouer not onely Paule nameth Iames first before Peter and Iohn:<note place="margin">Gala. ii.</note> but also in the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of the Apostles, where as Peter, Paule, Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas, and the rest of the Apostles speake, he as their heade and iudge, sayed his mynde laste, whiche was aproued of all thapostles, and of the whole congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And it is not to be doubted but that, if the church of Hierusalem be the mother, (as she is in dede) of all other churches, and of whome all other churches had theyr beginninge, wherefore she ought to bee called mother, as it was determyned in Nicene counsell: Then muste the byshop of Hierusalem, as the spouse of the churche be called the vniuersall father of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther churches, and the chiefe byshoppe, and byshoppe ouer all other byshops, as your Clement calleth hym in hys fyrste epistle, if it bee hys as you doe alledge, Then thus he sayed: These wordes haue I spoken, not that I thinke oure byshoppes to bee highest by any meanes (for Christe onely is thuniuersall head of hys churche, who is onelye sufficient) but to declare vnto you by a certayne suer reason, if there muste bee anye supreme heade in earthe, thesame ought rather by right belonge to our byshop, then to the byshop of Rome. Ye maye nowe see howe muche vanitie there is in your reasons, when our reasons bee so sclender and yet better then yours.

Paule nameth hym before Peter, and Iohn. But it followeth not therefore that he was vniuersall by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop aboue all other byshops. Notwithstanding this one thinge is trewe, that our churche muste be called the mother of all other churches, not that it ought to gouerne all other churches, as you make your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

This is very certayne, if the byshopes recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thys monarchie of god: then were these coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selles deuelyshe, whyche toke thys diuine power away from them.

To thys the same imbassador
<pb facs="tcp:13756:71"/>
aunswered saying: As longe as ye can not proue by vnaunswerable argumentes that youre Byshoppe is equal with Christ, in spirite and loue, we wyll ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer assent that he shalbe oure Byshoppe, and supreme head. Yf ye wyll haue vs to acknowledge hym not onely to be our chiefe Byshoppe, but also oure chiefe prince (as by youre argumentes ye appeare to goe about) and that we ought to beleue that he may cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge vnto hym both the authorities, ecclesistical, and ciuill: ye must of necessitie first shewe that he is aboue Christe in wysdome, power, and loue, bycause it is well knowen that Christ woulde in no wise take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hym any ciuile gouernaunce, in thys worlde. We be affrayed of so monstrous, and horirible a head. Wherfore we can not allowe this authoritie, neither that he shoulde be oure superior. Yf you intende to admit hym, take heede ye be not to hastie, for ye shall perceyue, to your vtter vndoinge, that he is no shepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, but a bloudie woulfe. Then arose master Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibristus so sodenly, &amp; so fearslye that it appeared he coulde staye hym selfe no longer. And beinge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with a wonderful power, stoutnes, violence, and fury: thus he sayed. What nede we haue so many wordes for the defence of oure Popeshypppe, seynge there hath bene brought stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g reasons enoughe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome the grossest witte in the worlde, in so muche that a blynde man maye see the truethe of them? Wherfore bycause these our reasons, our pleasures, our gentylnes, and fayre promises, can not content them, our moste holye father must vse hys large and endeles authoritie. And then turnyng hymselfe and speakyng to the Pope he sayed. You moste holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee the supreme head of the churche of Christe,

Your power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is so greate, that if ye wer not pope, (if yet ye once prononced these wordes: we wilbe) ye should be out of hande. Then loking vpon the imbassadors with a fearce countenance, he sayed: Yf ye wilbe rebelles to hys holines, ye shall feele the lighteninges, and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derboltes of his exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munications and cursinges flye in the ayer, euen to the furthest countrye in the Easte, and then shall ye knowe whether he bee pope or not.

Then all the imbassadours arose at once, to aunswer this sayinge with one accorde, but there was a signe made to the popes chaplayne that he shoulde doe as he was bidden, and straighte waye he beganne with a loud voyce, the himne: Te Deum laudamus. The noyse whereof fylled the ayer vp to the sterres, and all the reste folowed them, crying: whow victoria, victoria, victoria. And euen at the very same instante range all the belles in Rome.

So that, incase god had neuer so reproued, and reiected any manne: and the pope (in whose hande all power is) mindeth to saue thesame manne, gods determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion shalbe voyde.

               <p>Ye knowe well that christian menne, whiche be troubled in conscience, be strayght wont to runne to some learned manne for counsell, howe they maye haue liuely faythe, and be increased and established in thesame, howe they maye take hede to themselues from sinne and be perfect, whome the sayed learned menne absolue, that is, they shewe them by goddes worde, that they be absolued, yf they beleue in Christ: and so he geueth them counsell, and sheweth them the light of trueth. Ye knowe also that suche, as bee exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated be wonte after repentaunce to come to the priest, and shewe hym that they be sory for their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who perceyuinge that it is true, absolueth them, and doth notifie to the whole congregacion, that they be absolued and ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, by the meanes wherof they shalbe receyued of al men as brethren. Then doe they
<pb facs="tcp:13756:83"/>
inioyne them penaunce for their publyke offences, whiche they haue committed, not that they canne sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie in the syghte of God by that penaunce, before whose throne Christ hath made sufficient satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but to be an example to other, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neither they, nor anye other committe the lyke any more. These wilbe good and handsome beginninges, whereby to bryng in by lytle and lytle oure confession. For we wyll persuade menne, that the priest muste knowe their consciences, that they maye be absolued of their sinnes. And then wyll they tell all theyr offences both open and secret, yea and they will beleue that they be absolued not by Christ, but per opus operatum (that is) by the worke that is wrought of confessing, that is to say: for the remembryng of their sinnes, for the shame, wherwith they be touched in tellynge their synnes, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricion, for the absolucion of the priest, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> penance to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inioyned, &amp; for the Popes pardons. Neither nede you to doubt, whether the Byshoppe will bee content with this confession, for he wyll gladly commaunde it to all christian men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it maye be the more este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, he shal boast and lye that he receiued it of Christ, with suche a commendacion that he ought to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whiche denyeth it to be of the lawe of God. But thys thynge I would haue not vnknowen vnto you, that suche menne as be opressed with tiranny they be deliuered by death from all boundage and seruitude, yf they be not deliuered before. But as for the poore christians, though they dye, yet canne they not by any meanes auoyde the tiranny of our Pope, for at that tyme especially they be snared, that is to saye, in the houre of deathe, and bee taken prisoners in a place (where or what it is I can not tel) named purgatory.

This purgatorye shalbee buylded by oure Pope full of flame &amp; fire, whereof he onely shall haue the keyes out of whiche place no man can gette out oneles the Pope lycence hym, and yet paying a sume of money, whereof shall so much gayne arise, that the profyt of that only shalbe more vnto hym then of al the reste of his promotions &amp; benefices.</p>

Foure hundreth and foure score yeres after the birth of Christ, that litle horne of Daniel, that is to say, the Byshoppe of Rome had but litle strength and power of manne, because they had none authoritie but onely in their owne dioceses, as other Bishoppes haue. But a bout the yere of our Lorde .480. Odoacer reigninge in Rome, it chaunced that Achatius Byshoppe of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople (who then was placed first amongest the Byshoppes, and yet vsed no authoritie ouer them) woulde haue condempned Peter the Byshoppe of Alexandria of heresie. And bycause the Byshoppe of Rome for the worthynes of the Citie was then in
<pb facs="tcp:13756:95"/>
some estimacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the Byshop of Constantinople wrote to Simplicius then being Byshoppe of Rome, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge hym that he woulde lykewyse declare the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe of Alexandria an Heretyke. And of thys hath ambitious felowes taken occasion (vnworthely God he knoweth) to dispute of the authoritie of the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome. And so farre haue they gone forward in their ambicion, that they haue not bene ashamed falsely to contend, that they are the heades of al other churches. And on the other syde stode they, whyche toke partes with the Byshoppe of Constantinople affirmynge their Byshoppe, and not the Byshoppe of Rome to be the supreme head of all other churches. Thys ambicious contencion continued amongest these most holy fathers, a hundreth &amp; twelue yeres. And at the last about the yere of our Lorde sixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, when Maurice the Emperour was in Grecia, Ihon the Byshoppe of Constantinople gathered all the Byshoppes of Grecia togethyr at Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and there was the Bishop, of Constantinople and not the Byshop of Rome, ordeyned of them to be the Byshoppe of all other churches. But when Maurice wylled the Byshoppe of Rome to submitte hymselfe and hys churche to the Byshoppe of Constantinople, Gregory who then was Byshoppe of Rome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stode it, &amp; called hym y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fore runner of Antichrist. And thesame Gregory wrytynge to the Byshoppe of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch &amp; Alexandria, amongest al other thing sayth: ye knowe that in the counsell of Calcedon the tytle of the vniuersall Byshoppe was offered to the Byshop of Rome, whiche he woulde in no wyse receyue, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any of our predecessors y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> dyd vsurpe that tytle. Yea euen then (as they saye) to confounde
<pb facs="tcp:13756:96"/>
and rubuke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pride of other, he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be named the seruaunt of the seruauntes of God. Howe be it hys successor, Boniface the thirde, a manne to ambici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and craftie, obteyned of Phocas the Emperour by suttill trayne the dignitie of a Pope. What maner of manne thys Phocas the Emperour was it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of hys historye. By violence, fraude, and treason, he came to the Empire, and caused Maurice the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour most cruelly, and most wickedly, and his wife, and all his children to be kylled before his owne face. Thys was the holy manne, who first gaue this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly creature of the Popeshyp to the world. And this is true, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vntill the dayes of Consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine the fourth Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, the Byshoppe of Rome was wont to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of the Emperour. Howe be it at the request &amp; intreatie of Benet the second of Rome, the foresayed Constantine graunted to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Benet and hys successors, that they shoulde be receyued, and taken of all menne for Popes without the Emperours confirmacion. And so by litle &amp; lytle they crepte vp so highe by their craftie diligence, that the Emperour must bothe bee confirmed, and crowned of the Pope, but yet it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that first he take an othe, that he wyll defende the Popehod. Therfore it is not harde to be knowen, what maner of spirite it was, that brought the pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppe into the worlde, and howe the creacion of the Pope, and of the Popeshyp is contrary to the birthe of Christe. Namely when (as Paule writeth) Christe glorified not hymselfe, neither thrust himselfe to be a byshop, but takynge example of Aaron he taried vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyll he was called of hys father. But these men thrust themselues in violently vntyll they haue made them selues not onely equall with Christe, but also aboue
<pb facs="tcp:13756:96"/>
Christe. Christe beinge in the shape of god, dyd caste downe hymselfe willingly, and would take the shape of a seruant vpon him: But this fellowe being in the forme of a man, whiche is a moste abiect and vile sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, so proudly hathe auaunced hymselfe alofte that he is not ashamed to bragge hym selfe to bee a highe light, and a god in earth. And if we will consider, and waye the lyfe, the maners, and the workes of Christ, and the pope, we shall fynde them alltogether quiet contrary the one to the other. Christe was innocente, poore, and would not trouble himselfe with world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly businesses, but was altogether bent to the helthe of soules, whome he desiered to enrich with heuenly threasure, he was meke, gentle, refusing both crown and kingedome, neuer had he any priuat affection of fauour, either towardes himselfe, or others his kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke, or towardes any manne lyuynge, beinge infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a great force of the heauenly spirit always sought he the glory of God the father eternall. He was a peacemaker, sober, subiecte to all men for the honour of hys father: mercifull, and very prone and redye to be pitifull, and therefore he wept vpon Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, he was godly, shamfast, chaste, most liberal, full of loue, and all other vertues. But al the popes be in all poyntes diuerse, &amp; quite contrary to all these vertewes of Christe. For there is a rotten donge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, and puddell within them of all vncleannes, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, and mischefe, as it is ryght well knowen to them, that haue any knowledge of them, that be now a dayes, and reade the hystoryes and lyues of them, that be past: and all thoughe they be very contrary to Christ in these thinges, that I haue spoken of, more then other men be, that is to say, in all outward actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13756:97"/>
of vertue, yet in theyr doctrine, &amp; certayne other theyr wicked abhomynations they bee moste wycked, and moste contrary of all. For there be certayne wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses peculier vnto them, which be of exceding great weyght, &amp; be so hainouse, that they be mete for none other, but for these theues onely. Wherefore it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re necessary to graunte them onely to be the very and chief antichristes for these only be they, who corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge the scripture, and withstandyng the expresse word of god, haue plucked Christ with theyr wicked handes out of hys highe and gloryouse seate, and yet not being contented with that horryble mischief they haue caste downe, oppressed, and buried, and haue bannished quit out of the eyes, and memories of man the redemer of all mankinde, and haue placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in Christes seat, gyuinge to themselues, and with force challenginge lyke tyrannes, all that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, whiche parteyneth to Christe alone. Yea they haue made themselues aboue Christe. So that in conclusion, they woulde not only seme equal to god, but also haue auaunced them selfes with a deuelishe and intollerable boldnes aboue god.<note place="margin">Ephe. iiii.</note> That this thing is, as I saye, it is euident.

for youre saluacion not in Christe alone, (thoughe Peter saye playnly that it canne be founde in none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) but chiefly in me, in my absolucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, benedictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and pardons, and in youre owne workes also, and in the merites, and intercession of Saynctes. Wherfore come to me, all that be troubled with sorowe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and in me ye shall finde peace. Nowe whether all these thynges be most cruell, wicked, and blaphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouse or not, he maye easly perceyue, that is not al to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether blynde. Therfore it is most true,<note place="margin">Dani. vii.</note> that Daniell sayed speakynge of hym, that he shoulde bee suche a shameles blasphemor, that he should speake agaynste God hymselfe. And we also knowe, that accordynge to the doctrine of Paule euery christian manne is the temple of god, and of a lyke sort the congregacion of the faythfull, is called the churche of God: and we se that the Pope reygneth in the heartes of some chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men, which worship him euen now, as their God. And also wee see not onelye howe he reygneth in the heartes of sundrye menne, but also in the middest of the churche militant as the supreme of all creatures. Therefore it is fullye accomplyshed and performed, that Paule spake of hym,<note place="margin">ii.

And bycause these thynges, whiche Paule sayed, can not be applied to none other in the worlde: it must of necessitie be graunted, that he onely is the same ryghte and great Antichriste,<note place="margin">Mat. xxiiii.</note> and the very selfe same horrible abhominacion of whom Christ prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied that he should stablishe hys seat in the holy place.
<pb facs="tcp:13756:99"/>
Neither was it ynough for hym to thrust hym selfe in to Christes place, and to auau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce himselfe aboue god: but also he woulde depraue the holy scriptures, &amp; be in all poyntes quite contrary to Christ. That all these thynges bee true hereof it maye appeare. Euen as Christe hath left nothynge vnproued for vs, whiche are necessary for the mayntenaunce of oure naturall lyfe, so is it to be beleued that muche lesse he woulde leaue anye of those necessaries vnprouyded, whiche shoulde apartayne to the spirituall lyfe. Therefore must we beleue that god hath declared vnto vs in the holy scriptures as much, as is nedefull, wherunto no creature must adde,<note place="margin">Deu. xii.</note> neither take awaye one word, as God by Moses doth comaunde, for they only be in all poyntes perfect.<note place="margin">i. Tim. iiii.</note> Therfore Paule writinge to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie saieth. All scripture inspired from aboue is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to rebuke and amende, to instruct in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that a manne, who is dedicate to God, maye be vpryght and perfect in all good workes. Then by the doctrine of Paule it is playne that those thynges, which be conteyned in the holy scripture be sufficient to make a manne perfecte: whiche thynge must nedes be graunted, for Christe disclosed to hys Apostles as to hys beloued frendes and children, all that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of hys father. And afterwarde he opened their myndes by hys spirite, and declared vnto them the true meanyng of those thynges, which the same apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles dyd writ,<note place="margin">Antichriste saith that the scrypture is insufficient.</note> preache, and publishe abrode plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: So that the gospell is moste perfecte and full, as Paule wrote to the Hebrues. And as for the pope he is all together contrary to all these thynges, that be spoken. First and formost he sayeth that holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is imperfect, and is not sufficient to declare fully
<pb facs="tcp:13756:99"/>
all mattiers that belonge to saluacion, and that he can adde vnto it, as he hathe done, when he allowed those bokes that be apocripha, and of none authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, for holy bokes, as though they were in the canon. And also when he made an innumerable sorte of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and decretalles, and commaundementes of manne, and articles of our fayth. And he sayeth more ouer (thougheit be closly) that the twelue articles of the faythe deliuered and preached by the Apostles be not sufficient to saluacion.<note place="margin">Antichriste corrupteth the articl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that it must folowe (in the name of God) that the Popes were wyser then Christ hym selfe, or at the least wyse were more mercifull, bycause they haue opened so many thynges to the worlde, whiche bee (as they saye) necessarye to oure saluacion, and neuer opened neither by Christe nor god. But what a mischeuous dede is it, that all these articles of the faythe made by the Pope, bee all together repugnaunt, and quite contrarye to the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Apostles, and to all holy scripture, as it is well knowen. For brefely in the Creade, and in holye scripture it is comprehended, that it is god by whose goodnes and grace throughe Christe (who suffered death for vs, who rose againe, and ascended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and sitteth on the ryghte hande of God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) all creatures muste receyue saluacion, and also fele hys plentiful loue towardes vs, through the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gost, and that he, who beleueth in Christ, shal haue lyfe euerlastyng as he hym selfe is a witnes. But the contentes of the Popes articles bee all together con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thys geare, that is to say: that fayth in Christ
<pb facs="tcp:13756:100"/>
is not sufficent to saluacion, and that it is necessarye to beleue, that the Pope hath authoritie ouer all. And that we must beleue accordyng to the doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope, that neither the grace of Christ, nor the death of Christ is sufficient to saluacion, but that our merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious workes must also of necessitie be added, with confession deuised by the Pope, and hys absolutions, pardons, and prayer to Sayntes, and besydes all thys the fire of purgatory. And that the holy gost (as they saye) is not enoughe for the vnderstandynge of holy scripture, and to knowe the wyll and pleasure of God: but that the Pope muste expounde all thynges. No manne canne denye, but thys is a very settinge of him selfe aboue God.<note place="margin">Dani. xi.</note> Daniel wrote wonderfull lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly of hym: saying that he shall induce men nough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely and wickedly to breake their promises, that they haue made to God.

               <p>Suerly it shalbe a very easie thynge to obteyne what thyng soeuer is godly of youre maiesties sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes. For euen as after the transgression of Adam, god grafted a certayne terriblenes of countenaunce in manne wherby he shoulde make beastes affrayed with lokyng vpon manne, lest they shoulde hurt hym. So hath he indued subiectes with a certayne natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall feare towardes their leage lordes, that they may reuerently obey them. Wherfore yf a Prynce or Kyng intende a thynge, and then declare thesame to be hys mynde, and pleasure with a certaine effectualnes, and authoritie: by and by they all obey, namelye when he offereth matters vnto them, that be iuste and godlye, but as for the trueth of the doctrine of the gospell, is
<pb facs="tcp:13756:107"/>
of it selfe most effectual, &amp; therfore we doubt not but it wil come to passe that it shall gladly be receyued of al menne, especially, when it shalbe offered vnto them of the maiestie of a kynge, and he shall confirme the same with vprightnes of lif. Neither is it to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the gospell should breed any tumulte in these dominions, or cause any sedicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or losenes of libertie, for Christe dothe approue, and confirme chiefelye the power and authoritie of princes, and magistrates, and causeth menne to thynke humbly, and lowely of them selues, &amp; to loue peace and quietnes, and therfore as thoughe they were gentle lambes, it shalbe an easie thyng, &amp; no great payne to rule them.</p>

               <p>We know ryght well that a sicke body, which is ful of corrupt humors, can not be purged, and clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with out some commocion, and stirryng of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and membres: and euen so is it of our kingdomes. And we also knowe that the gospell is a moste swete and pleasant medecine to the chosen of god, although it turne the stomake of suche, as be reiected. And euen as he shoulde not bee a good father, who hauinge a so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne sicke, that he could make whole again with some medicine: and yet durst not minister thesame vnto him for feare of stirryng of hys body, &amp; so suffer hys sonne to perish with the greatnes of the disease: So should not we bee a good kynge, yf, when we shall see oure people sicke of a spirituall disease (as in dede we doe) shoulde suffer them to perishe eternally for feare of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mocion, &amp; should not minister vnto them the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some medecine of the gospell, wherby to restore them agayne to health. Wherfore we be in a full readynes to aduenture not onely our honor, but also our lyfe it selfe for the wealth of our people, and for the glory of

God. There be not a fewe, that wyll goe about to stey vs from thys noble enterpryse. They saye that the Greekes, and other nacions of the East partes of the worlde were punished of God by the tyrannye of the Turke, bycause they refused to obey the Pope. As thoughe the Popes tyranny were not a great deale greater and crueller then is the tyranny of the Turke. Or as thoughe Affryke, and Asia had in tymes paste bene subiect to the Pope. Neither minde we to rente or louse the seemeles coate of Christ, as some perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture wyll thynke, who hathe cut it into so manye smale peces, that it canne be deuided nomore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But we mynde to cutte and teare asunder the veale of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crysie that their vice and wickednes maye be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all menne. Thys thing is without question: as ofte as euer the Turke hathe fought with the Christian menne, for the most parte he hath had the ouer hand, whiche God suffered so to be, not onely to punishe vs for that in stead of Christe, we haue wurshypped An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist: but also bycause he minded by litle &amp; litle to withdrawe vs, and deliuer vs from the wicked ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Antichrist. And it is not to be doubted, but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> euen as the Iewes be punished chiefly for the sinnes of their priestes, bycause they were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> causers of the deathe of Christe: so be the Christian men punyshed thys daye for the sinnes of Antichrist, and his priestes who haue crucified Christ agayne muche more in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite of God, then the Iewes dyd in tymes paste. Wherefore yf we wyll preuayle agaynst the Turke, firste lette vs thrust thys wicked manne out of the churche of God, whiche is a home dwellyng Turke, for whose sinnes God beinge offended with vs vseth that whippe for the punishemente of the Christians,
<pb facs="tcp:13756:108"/>
and when god is once pleased, and contented agayne with vs, we shall easelye by goddes helpe giue hym the ouerthrowe. Therefore let vs dryue all heresie, idolatrye, supersticion, &amp; wickednes, out of the church of god, and then shall we not onely triumphe ouer the turkes: but also they will bee conuerted to Christe, when they shall see the beames of the light of the gospel, and the holy life of the Christians sprede ouer al. This arrant these of Rome hath robbed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde vnder the pretence of religion, and battayle agaynste the turkes, and to deliuer the Christians, whiche bee amongest the turkes in seruitude and bondage. Let hym nowe dryue hym selfe out of the churche of god, if he mynde to delyuer vs out of bondage, whiche is muche more cruell and tyrannical then the other. Let hym dryue Sathan out of hym selfe and out of his wicked Babilon and then beinge conuerted and armed with spirituall vertues, and with the sworde of goddes worde, folowing thexample of Christ, and hys apostles, let hym fyght agaynste gods enemies. And if it so be that he canne not be amended, but wil continue on still in hys wicked and cruell tyrannye, so that he will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pell force to be made, let it be made, agaynste hym, for he onely noyeth more the church of Christe, then all the enemies of god ioyned together. We hate not the popes parson, but hys abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whome all menne ought of deutie to abhorre.</p>

               <p>Euen as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of the gospell excelleth all other kindes of learninge in purenes, gentlenes, pleasauntnes, propfytablenes, excellencie, and wonderfulnes? So if it bee infected once with neuer so litle an heresy, it is more pestilent and perniciouse
<pb facs="tcp:13756:109"/>
then anye other. Wherfore lette vs doe all oure inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure that it being pourged from all false and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticious imaginacions, and mannes traditions maye bee ministred to the people, pure, simple, and syncere, as it is of it selfe. And as concernynge the articles of the faythe, the worde of God ought to be sufficient, except we wyll seeme wiser then God hym selfe. And as touchynge woorkes, the lawe that God hym selfe hathe made, whiche is most pure and holye shal be sufficiente. Whose preceptes be without spot, sounde, and cherefull to the mynde. Whereunto Christes interpretacion muste bee annexed. And as for prayer and inuocacion, what shall wee rather alowe then the Lordes prayer, whiche the sonne of God hymselfe taught vs. Whiche teacheth vs playnely and fullye what we ought to aske of God. And it also teacheth howe we ought to aske all gyftes of God, throughe Christe oure mediatoure,</p>
               <p>Forsothe it is a wicked thynge to desyer to bee more wyse then was Christe hymselfe: who dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vs that prayer as a perfecte forme of prayer, wherefore it canne not bee well to adde any thynge thereunto. Trulye all doctrine that is necessarye for saluacyon is playne and cleare yf we darken it not with the darkenes of mannes inuentions.</p>
               <p>We wyll therefore dooe oure dylygence, fyrste to put a waye all suche thynges as maye bee a hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraunce to the goinge forwarde of the Gospell, and hauynge allwayes goddes honour before oure eyes, &amp; the helthe of soules, we will pray that he wyll graunt vnto vs that purenes and earnestnes of spirit,

that we maye sette forth hys glory, and serue hym in holines, and that we may through Iesus Christ oure redemer gyue all prayse, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and honor to God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euerlastynge. Amen.</p>
