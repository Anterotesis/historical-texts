            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Shall give you an Account from hence, as I received it from a faithful Hand, of the loss of the <hi>Gloucester</hi>-Frigot, which was thus:</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Iohn Berry</hi> Commander of the <hi>Gloucester</hi>-Frigot, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received on Board the said Ship His Royal Highness in <hi>Margaret</hi> Road, in order to his Voyage for <hi>Scotland,</hi> set Sail from thence with a fair Wind, the Weather continuing very Fair, attended by the <hi>Ruby, Happy Return,</hi> the <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> and <hi>Pearl</hi> Frigots, with several Yatches, and several Persons of great Quality, both of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> attending His Royal Highness on the Seventh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant: At Night they came about 16 Leagues off the Mouth of the <hi>Humber,</hi> about which place lies a Sand called the <hi>Lemon-Oar,</hi> and whether by the unskilfulness, or wretched neglect of the Pilot, God knows, the aforesaid Ship in which His Royal Highness was, and many other Persons of Quality, run on Ground upon the said Sands, about Ten of the Clock at Night; but it pleasing God that the Weather proving Fair and not Stormy, that the Ship did not presently Burst, nor did not immediately Sink, but lay some hours e're She Sank; so that the Duke, and some others, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as the Long-Boat could hold, had time to escape the Danger and ventur'd to Sea, and got safe aboard on one of the Yatches, but for the rest remaining on board, the Ship foundring before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Boats could come to their Assistance, all perished, among
<pb facs="tcp:60945:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whom was the Lord <hi>Roxborow,</hi> the Lord <hi>O Bryan,</hi> the Lord <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> Lord <hi>Hume,</hi> Lord <hi>Dowglass,</hi> Sir <hi>Christopher Musgrave,</hi> Sir <hi>Iames Hyde,</hi> Mr. <hi>Clifton,</hi> and an <hi>English</hi> Lady, whose name we cannot as yet learn; all the Dukes Cooks but one, all his Footmen, and all the rest of his Servants, Sir <hi>Charles Scarborow</hi> was miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously saved (as we suppose) on some piece of the Ship. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Sir <hi>Iohn Berry,</hi> was also lost with his Brother, Captain <hi>Berry,</hi> and several others who accompanied him: There was in all to the number of three hundred and three Persons, and odd, of which but sixty were saved. The Duke is since safely here to the Joy of his Dutchess, and others who have been to Congratulate his Escape from so great Danger: His Royal Highness is very sensible, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly troubled at the loss of so many Noble Persons, and others, and of so gallant a Ship. The Pilot is secured in <hi>Edinborow.</hi> This is all at present, our late Insurrection being fully quieted.</p>

               </signed>
            </closer>
            <postscript>
               <head>In such a Loss and, so much Distraction it is impossible at first to give an exact Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Misfortune, therefore since the last Letter which we Printed we have another account given us from <hi>Scotland,</hi> somthing more fully and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, which take as follows.</head>
               <p>THat on <hi>Friday</hi> last was Sevennight a Consult was held on Board the said Ship, in which His R. Highness was for the Steering her thorow the difficult places near <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and it was His R. Highnesses Opinion, that they stood too near the Shoar; but one Mr. <hi>Aires</hi> a Pilot, whom His R. H. had chosen and advanced, being on Board, undertook the Carrying of her safe, and laid down his Course, which was opposed by several in the Ship; but 'tis wrote, that he pawned his Life (which is like now to be forfeited) that he was in the right; and believing that he had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that dangerous Sand, called the <hi>Lemon-Oar,</hi> on which some hundreds of Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels have unfortunately been cast away; he made a Tack, and in a very short time she struck on the aforesaid Sand, which put all on Board into a Conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, it being about Five of the Clock in the Morning, His R. Highness being then in Bed, who immediately arose, and had not time to put on any thing but his Breeches and Night-Gown: The Men endeavouring to have got her off, but they found Six foot Water in her hold, by which they perceived her past recovery. Sir <hi>Iohn Berry,</hi> with his Sword drawn in his hand, desired His R. Highness to enter the the Long-Boat, which after much persuasion he did, taking with him only one small Trunk of great value, leaving behind him all his Money, Plate, Goods, and other things of great value: Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> suffer'd none to go into the Boat with him, but those His R. Highness called for, which were about Forty persons; and which was observable, one or two in mean Habit, and unknown; and they were no sooner cleared off the Ship, and at Sea, but she burst to pieces, and sunk to the bottom. But some do affirm, that though the Sea-men saw present Death before them when His R. Higness put off in the Long-Boat, that they gave him an <hi>Huzza,</hi> and immediately drank his Health in Salt-water. Sir <hi>Iohn Berry</hi> committed himself to the mercy of the Waves, and was afterwards taken up, and they likewise say, that several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to save their Lives, took hold of the Long-Boat, and those therein were forced to knock their hands off the Boat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for fear of their sinking her, and so let them drown to preserve themselves. Sir <hi>Charles Scarborough,</hi> one of His Majesties Physicians, who Attended His Royal Highness, was taken up almost dead, floating on a Plank, yet 'tis feared he will hardly recover.</p>
               <p>The loss of the Sea-Men and Passengers are great, being as 'tis supposed above a third part that perished, among whom are missing the Lords <hi>Roxborow, O Bryan,</hi> and <hi>Hopton,</hi> Sir <hi>Iames Duglas,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iames Hide,</hi> Brother to the Lord <hi>Hide,</hi> who was Lieutenant of the said Ship, one Mr. <hi>Haly</hi> a Querry, Sir <hi>Patrick Hume,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Skelton</hi> the Kings Page, with divers others, whose names are not yet come to hand; but there are above 240 missing, with the Dukes and the Noblemens Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, His Physicians, Cooks, and Footmen. 'Tis judged that in Money, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther valuable things, which all perished in the Sea, will amount to above 30000 <hi>l.</hi> besides the Ship her self, with her Guns and furniture, being a third Rare Ship, new fitted and mounted with 58 Pieces of Ordinance, a great loss to his Majesty.</p>
               <p>His Royal Highness, and those with him, safely arrived at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> on the <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> following, where is great lamentation made for the loss of so many persons. They say that <hi>Ayres</hi> the Pilot was saved, and is committed to Prison at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to be tried for this miscarriage, who says for himself, that the late great Storms had removed the Sands far distant from the place in which they were before, which thing sometimes happens.</p>
