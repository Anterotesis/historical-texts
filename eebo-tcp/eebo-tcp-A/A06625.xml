            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

cease complaints, &amp; craue counsell. And loe, behold Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billa

added great promises, I either desirous to make trial of

vp my handful of sand, consenting to his suite, if I might
liue as many yeares as there were graines. <hi>Phoebus,</hi> (for

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time &amp; fortune could not weare out, what Gods
and nature had wrought vppe: not once imagining that
white and read should returne to black and yellow, the

that in a face without blemish, there should come wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles
without number. I did as you do, go with my glasse,
rauished with the pride of mine own bewtie, &amp; you shall
do as I doe, loath to see a glasse disdaining deformitie.
There was none that heard of my fault, but shunned my
fauour, insomuch as I stooped for age before I tasted of
youth, sure to be long liued, vncerteine to bee beloued.
Gentlemen that vsde to sigh from their heartes for my
sweete loue, began to point with their fingers at my wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
face, &amp; laughed to see the eies, out of which fire
seemed to sparkle, to be suckered being old with specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
This causeth me to withdraw my selfe to a solitary
caue, where I must leade sixe hundred yeeres in no lesse
pensiuenesse of crabbed age, then grief of remembred
youth. Only this comfort, that being ceased to be faire,
I study to be wise, wishing to be thought a graue matro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

to build thy nest in the Sunne? Doth Sapho bewitch
thee, whome all the Ladies in <hi>Sicily</hi> coulde not wooe:
Yea, poore Phao, the greatnesse of thy mind is far aboue
the bewtie of thy face, and the hardnesse of thy fortune
beyonde the bitternesse of thy words. Die Phao, Phao
die: for there is no hope if thou bee wise, nor safetie, if
thou be fortunate. Ah Phao, the more thou seekest to
suppresse those mounting affections, they soare the lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,
&amp; the more thou wrastlest with them the stronger
they waxe, not vnlike vnto a ball, which the harder it is
throwne against the earth, the higher it boundeth into
the ayre: or our Sycilyan stone, which groweth hardest
by hammeringe. O diuine loue, and therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine,
because loue, whose deitie no conceite canne

as miraculous in working as mightie, &amp; no more to bee

God, whome thou hast cause to blaspheme. O Sapho,
faire Sapho; peace miserable wretch, enioy thy care in
couert, we are willow in thy hatte, and baies in thy hart.
Leade a Lamb in thy hand, &amp; a Fox in thy head, a doue

bottome, not at the tongues brimme. Things vntold,
are vndone, there can be no greater comforte, then to

But ah thy bewty Sapho, thy bewty. Beginnest thou to

                  <p>Loue, faire child, is to be gouerned by arte, as thy

<pb facs="tcp:27855:13"/>
(and I pray thee let them perswade) I woulde wish thee
first to be diligent: for that womenne desire nothing
more then to haue their seruants officious. Be alwaies in
sight, but neuer slothful. Flatter I meane, lie, litle things
catch light mindes, and fancy is a worme, that feedeth
first vpon fenell. Imagine with thy selfe all are to bee
won, otherwise mine aduise were as vnnecessary as thy
labour. It is vnpossible for the brittle mettall of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to withstand the flattering attemptes of men: only this,
let them be asked, their sex requireth no lesse, their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desties
are to be allowed so much. Be prodigall in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and promises, bewtie must haue a trumpet, &amp; pride
a gifte. Peacocks neuer spread their feathers, but when
they are flattered, &amp; Gods are seldome pleased, if they
be not bribed. There is none so foule, that thinketh not
her selfe faire. In commending thou canst loose no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor.
for of euery one thou shalt be beleeued. O simple
women, that are brought rather to beleeue what their
eares heare of flattering men, then what their eies see in
true glasses.</p>

                  <speaker>Sybilla</speaker>
                  <p>Then to the purpose. Chuse such times to break
thy suite, as thy Lady is pleasant. The wooden horse en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<hi>Troy,</hi> when the soldiers were quaffyng, and <hi>Penelope</hi>
forsooth, whome fables make so coy, among the pottes
wrong her wooers by the fists, when she lowred on their
faces. Grapes are minde glasses. <hi>Venus</hi> worketh in <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
presse, &amp; bloweth fire vpon his lycour. When thon
talkest with her, let thy speach be pleasant, but not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.
Chuse such words as may (as many may) melt
her minde. Honney ranckleth, when it is eaten for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and faire words wound, when they are hearde for
loue. Write, and persist in writing, they read more then
is written to them, &amp; write lesse then they thinke. In co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite
studie to be pleasaunt in attire braue, but not too
<pb facs="tcp:27855:13"/>
curious, when she smileth laugh outright, if rise, stande
vp, if sit, lye downe. Loose al thy time to keepe time with
her. Can you sing, shew your cunning, can you daunce,
vse your legges, can you play vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any instrument, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
your fingers to please her fancy, seeke out qualy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
If she seeme at the first cruell, be not discouraged. I
tell the a straung thing, womenne striue, because they
would be ouercome, force they call it: but such a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
force they account it, that continually, they study
to be enforced. To faire words ioyne sweet kisses, which
if they gently receiue, I say no more, they wil gently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.
But be not pinned alwaies on her sleeues, straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
haue greene rushes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> daily guests are not worth
a rushe. Looke pale, and learne to be leane, that who so
seeth thee, may say, the Gentleman is in loue. Vse no
forcerie to hasten thy successe, wit is a witch, <hi>Vlysses</hi> was
not faire, but wise, not cunning in charmes, but sweete
in speach, whose filed to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue made those inamoured that
sought to haue him inchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. Be not coy, beare, sooth,
sweare, die to please thy Lady, these are rules for poore
louers, to others I am no mistresse. He hath wit ynough,
that can giue ynough. Dumbe men are eloquent, if they
be liberall. Beleeue me great gifts are little Gods. When
thy mistresse doth bend her brow, do not thou bend thy
fiste. Camokes must be bowed with sleight, not stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth,
water to be trained with pipes, not stopped with sluses,
fire to be quenched with dust, not with swordes. If thou
haue a ryuall, be pacient, arte muste winde him out not
malice: time, not might, her chaunge, and thy constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
Whatsoeuer she weareth: sweare it becomes her. In
thy louce be secrete. <hi>Venus</hi> cofers, though they bee hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
neuer sound, &amp; when they seeme emptiest, they are
fullest. Old foole that I am, to doe thee good, I beginne
to doate, &amp; counsell that, which I woulde haue concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
Thus Phao haue I giuen thee certeine regardes, no
rules, only to set thee in the way, not to bring thee ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e.</p>

thee, I my selfe will be the Queene of loue. I will direct
these arrowes with better aime, and conquer mine own
affections, with greater modesty. Venus heart shal flame,
and her loue be as common as her crafte. O Mileta, time
hath disclosed that, which my temperance hath kept in:
but sith I am rid of the disease, I will not be ashamed to
confesse the cause. I loued Phao Mileta, a thing vnfit for
my degree, but forced by my desire.</p>

well, I say no more. But as for the new Mistresse of loue,
or Lady, I cry you mercie, I think you would be called a
Goddesse, you shall know what it is to vsurpe the name
of Venus. I will pull those plumes, and cause you to cast
your eyes on your feete, not your feathers: your softe
