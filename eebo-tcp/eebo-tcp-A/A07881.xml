            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE MY VERIE GOOD LORD, THE L. Robert Dudlie Earle of Leicester Baron of Denbigh, knight of the most noble order of the garter and S. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaëll, master of hir maiesties horses, and one of hir highnesse most honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble priuie counsell.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT honorable and my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good Lord, as the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, which enforced me to offer hir maiestie the first frutes of my publik writing, were exceding great, so those reasons, which induce me now to present to your honor, this my second labor, be not verie small. Hir maiestie representeth the personage of the hole land, and therefor clameth a prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue in dewtie, both for the excellencie of hir place, wherewith she is honored, as our prince, and for the greatnesse of hir care, wherewith she
<pb facs="tcp:13245:3"/>
is charged, as our parent. If honor be the end of that, which is don, hir place is to clame, if the common good, then hir charge is to chalenge. VVhich both clame in honor, and chalenge in charge, did concur in one aspect, when I offered hir my book. For mine own purpos was to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor hir place, with the first of my labor, and my book pretended to benefit hir charge with som generall profit. Again being desirous both to procure my book passage, thorough hir maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties dominions, &amp; to laie som ground for mine own credit, at the verie fountain, how could I haue obtained either the first, without hir suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or the last, but with hir countenance? VVhose considerate iudgement if my book did not please, my credit were in danger, whose gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious permission if it were denyed, my successe were in despare. So that both my dewtie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hir maiestie, as my souerain prince, and my desire of furtherance by hir maiestie, as my surest protection, compelled me of force to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with hir highnesse, by satisfying of my dew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to com in hope of my desire, if the matter, which I offred should deserue liking, as the course, which I took shewed desire to please. Now my dewtie in that behalf towards hir ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie being so discharged, whom the presenting
<pb facs="tcp:13245:3"/>
of my book makes priuie to my purpos, doth not the verie stream of dewtie, &amp; the force of de sert carie me streight fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hir highnesse vnto your honor, whether I haue in eie your general good nesse towards all them, which be learned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, or your particular fauor towards my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, which teach others to learn? For in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon iudgement is not he to take place next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the prince in the honor of learning, which all waie by the prince most preferreth learning? wherein I do not se, that there is anie one about hir maiestie (without offence be it spoken, either to your honor, if you desire not to hear it, or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other person, which deserues well that waie) which either iustlie can, or vniustlie will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare with your honor, either for the encouraging of students to the attainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of learning, or for hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the learned to aduancement of liuing. VVhich two points, I take to be most euident proufs of generall patronage to all learning, to nurish it being grene, to cherish it being grown. Of which your honors both first nurishing, and last cherishing of ech kinde of learning, there is no one corner in all our cuntrie but it feleth the frute, and thriues by the effect. For how manie singular men haue bene worthilie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, how manie nedefull places haue bene sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularlie
<pb facs="tcp:13245:4"/>
appointed by your either onelie or most honorable means? with this generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration whereby all men ar bound to your honor in dewtie, who either like of learning, or liue by learning, mine own particular doth ioyn it self, with all officiousnesse, and desire to do honor, where it hath found fauor. For I do find my self excedinglie indetted vnto your honor for your speciall goodnesse, and most fauora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble countenance these manie years. VVhereby I am bound to declare the vow of my seruice vnto your honor not by the offering of a petie boke alone, such as this is, but by tendring what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer a thankfull minde can deuise in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of power for so excellent a patron. And tho I begin the shew of my deuotion with a verie mean sacrifice, for so great a saint, (as what a simple present is a part of an Elementarie, or an English ortografie to so great a person, and so good a patron?) yet am I in verie good hope, that your honor will accept it, and measur my good will, not by the valew of the present, but by the wont of your goodnesse. For dewtie will break out, and an ishew it will find, which tho it stream not great, where it springeth first, yet is it as pure, as where it spredeth most. Mo offerings, hereafter of the like sort, maie giue it greater
<pb facs="tcp:13245:4"/>
shew, but none of anie sort can shew more good will. And so I desire your honor to take it, in waie of euidence to the world, that your desert hath bound me: in waie of witnesse to your self, that I would return dewtie. Mine own good will I know my self, of your good liking I nothing dout, whose honorable and ordinarie dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, to take things well, which taste of goodwill. I offred to hir maiestie the prime of my pen, I offer to your honor the prime of right penning, not handled thus before, as I can perceiue by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of my cuntrie, tho I se diuerse, that haue bene tampering about it. And as the difference of state betwene hir maiestie, &amp; your honor made me of mere force to begin with hir, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to you: so the matter of that book, which I presented vnto hir, is the occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this, which I offer vnto you. In that book among other things, which the discourse enforced, as it enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced manie, (bycause it doth medle with all the nedefull accidents, which belong to teaching.) I did promis an Elementarie, that is, the hole matter, which childern ar to learn, and the hole maner how masters ar to teach them, from their first beginning to go to anie school, vntill theie passe to grammer, in both the best if my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion proue best. This point is of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:13245:5"/>
in my iudgement, both for young learners to be entred with the best, and for the old lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be sound from the first. This Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie am I now to perform. VVhose particular bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches being manie in number, &amp; the book there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by growing to som bulk, I thought it good to de uide it into parts, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sundrie causes, but chefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie for the printer, whose sale will be quik if the book be not big. Of those seuerall parts, this is the first, wherein I entreat (tho that be but litle) of certain generall considerations, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the hole Elementarie, but I handle speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie in it the right writing of our English tung, a verie necessarie point, and of force to be handled, ear the child be taught to read, which reading is the first principle of the hole Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie. For can reading be right before writing be righted, seing we read nothing else, but what we se writen? or can writing seme right, being cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged for wrong, before it be cleared? I account the print as a statarie writing, and therefor inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the same term. I haue trauelled in this point of our English writing, somwhat more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ordinarie. VVherein what my iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is, your honor maie perceiue euen by this my thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which is as the common, tho more certain then the common, as my precepts will shew: by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="tcp:13245:5"/>
I write nothing without cause why, and most certain grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. For I haue sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the thing by the depth of our tung, and planted my rules vpon our ordinarie custom, the more my frind, bycause it is followed, nowhere my fo, bycause nowhere forced. VVhereby I do perceiue, why we ought to write thus, as the common currant is, without the alteration of either custom, or charact, tho with som correction of certain wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and generall direction for the hole pen. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to teach this low, bycause I wold not leap, but rise by degrées entending to mount higher, as my argument growes higher. Now this book being parcell of the Elementarie, seuered vpon this cause, presenteth it self first, as a leader to the residew, vnto your honor, making publik shew of my priuat dewtie, and pretending an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment verie pertinent to my profession, tho se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming not so proper to your estate. And yet I take it not alltogither vnproper, considering your honor both handle the pen your self ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedinglie well, and far aboue the common of most nobilitie not onelie with vs, but also els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and besides that you can iudge of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie best penning, with as great skill, as your self can vse the pen excedinglie well, which two sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular properties do argew in mine opinion no
<pb facs="tcp:13245:6"/>
great improprietie in the offring such a present to such a personage, so rarelie qualifyed, tho of meruellous height aboue, either the matter, which is offred, or the partie which offereth. And therefor I am in hope that your honor will take this simple treatis concerning the right writing of your cuntrie speche, with a verie goodwill, as your dailie trauell is to work your cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries good, with your hole endeuor. Further, I do not take it to be anie disparageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to your honorable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit to seme to fauor so mean a thing, as an orto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafie is, considering verie great states and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to, in the places, where theie liued, did not think meanlie of it, but were dealers therein, and writers themselues, as M. MESSALA the graue counsellor, M. CICERO the great ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, C. CAESAR the famous conquerer, who delt this waie in the Latin tung, and thereby did win, both credit to themselues, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to their cuntrie. I will vse no mo exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, where there is no more nede, neither prouf of other tungs, where the Latin is enough. The profitablenesse of the thing maie moue your honor to fauor it, as a furniture to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the honorablenesse of such personages maie persuade you to further it, as a brood of nobilitie. As it cannot but yeild most hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb facs="tcp:13245:6"/>
matter for historie to work on to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting memorie, that hir most excellent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie amongst other hir affaires, vouchsafed to consider of the state of learning in hir time, that it went in right course, for the right maintaining of a peaceable gouernment, which peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is the end of all gouernment, as learning is the mean: so it cannot but withall sound to your perpetuall honor, if it shall please you to moue hir maiestie to so honorable a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that all learning maie testify to posteritie, that such a prince did it, such a counsellor moued it. Perfitnesse in learning which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth in right educatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of chosen wits, in right method of best matter, in full time both to learn &amp; digest, when it coms to deal abrode, is the instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, considerate in publishing hir own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, with warrant for truth, with warinesse for peace: the contrarie corrupts, where it cannot gide: it worketh dissension, when it is not resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and in imperfection, vttereth the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued heat, which sufficiencie in time, and digestion in studie, wold either not haue vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or haue otherwise qualifyed. And tho after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it reclame it self, vpon better aduise, it cannot staie the quiksiluer, which at the first push it hath poord in peples heads, an enemie
<pb facs="tcp:13245:7"/>
to concorde, which learning pretendeth, as the Art of peace, from the highest diuine to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est infant. The most mightie, and most mercifull God preserue hir most excellent maiestie with long and happie life, to work this and manie such effects, to his honor, hir own renoun, and hir peples good, and the same good God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue your honor, as a counseller of most trust, to a prince of most wisedom, to beawtify nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to auance knowledge, to assist your cuntrie, in both trew religion, and politik rule: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other things, not of least honor, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our schools: that euen the young infant tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough this hole realm, maie learn to know, how much he is bound to your honorable furthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for his good bringing vp in the Elementarie principles of all learning, before he do remoue to anie vniuersitie: as all those students, which ar of the vniuersities, do both praise and praie for your honorable prosperitie, for that great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, which theie receiue by you, both while theie studie there, and when theie serue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode in publik functions of the common weal.</p>

            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>Cap. I. Why I begin at the elementarie, and wherein it consisteth.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here be two causes, which moue me to the penning of this Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, whereof the one is mine own promis, the òther is the argument it self. The argument it self persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des me to the penning thereof, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is so fit for the training vp of childern, as nothing can be fitter: and the stream of discourse in my former book, which I name Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, did carie me on to promis it, and binds me to perform it. But for the better linkking of this book to that, seing this is nothing else, but the performing of one pece, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in that, I must nedes shortlie run ouer the main bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of that, ear I enter into this. The matter of that book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth <note place="margin">A short repeating of the for mer book en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> chefelie in two generall points, the one proper, the other proceding. I call that argument proper, which is the naturall subiect of that same book, &amp; being once handled there desires no further speche in any other treatis. I call that proceding which being but named there as a thing most necessarie to som further end, requireth more handling, then it hath there, to be better fitted for so profitable an end. Of the first sort, which is the proper inhabitant of that same book, and to be enquired <note place="margin">The proper argument of the Positions.</note> for there, all those discourses be, which concern the teacher,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:13245:10"/>
or the learners person, which concern the place to teach or learn in, which concern the time, both when to begin, &amp; how long to continew, and such other circumstances, which being once entreated of, discharge my pen from dealing with them further, tho theie do not discharge the magistrates of my countrie, from heding of them better. Bycause theie be verie full of profit, tho somwhat hard of performance, thorough those naturall difficulties, which professe enimitie to all good things, and would shoulder them out, for taking anie place, either at their first planting, when theie ar to be receiued, or vpon default, when theie ar to be redressed. Good things <note place="margin">The cause why good things ar hardlie plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the first</note> grow on verie hardlie at their first planting, bycause that profit, which theie promis at their entrie, hath not yet bene proued, and therefor wanteth the commendation of triall, which is the verie best mean to enforce persuasion: and their pretence to be profitable, vpon som probabilitie in sequele, is a great inducement in dede, but to those peple, which can forese ear theie fele, but of small importance to them, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>notse till theie fele. Good things finde hard footing, when <note place="margin">VVhy refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is hard lie won.</note> theie ar to be reformed after a corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in vse, bycause of that enormitie which is in possession, and vsurpeth on their place, which hauing strengthened it self by all circumstances, that can moue retaining, and with all difficulties, that can dissuade alteration, fighteth sore for it self, and hard against redresse, thorough the generall assiste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of a preiudicate opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in those mens heds, which might further the redresse. Which preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice in opinion being grounded vpon contentment with the acquainted euill, &amp; loth to enter danger for a change of som truble, so bewitcheth the reason of the parties seduced, as drink doth that fellow, which will rather ly in a ditch all night &amp; call for more clothes when he feleth more cold, and bid put out the candle, when he seith the moon shine, then he will ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be persuaded, that he is drunk at all, or else be entreated to get vp &amp; go home: Tho yet at the last som of his wise frinds forseing the danger of som sicknesse like to follow, if he ly there long, get him home perforce. Such a strength is error of being bakt with long ease, which brings ignorance a slepe: and with securitie in persuasion, which neuer bredes but ill.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:13245:10"/>
Howbeit for that book, and those persuasions, I must praie my good cuntrimen, to think vpon them well, euen for their own sakes. It is the generall good that hath enforced me to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular wish. Neither do I repent my self for the wishing therof, tho the speding be far of: as I am also most redie with all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience to digest all such difficulties, all such thwartings, all such tungstings, as that kinde of wish, being frutelesse for the time, vseth to bring with it, to chek and choke a writer. For I fear not in the end, but that the extremitie of som euill, tho <note place="margin">That refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation come once tho most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what late.</note> not the excellencie of som good will enforce a reformation by them, which haue power and autoritie to redresse. At which time my labour shall find frute, tho my self be not found: and my wish shall take effect, tho my self be no partaker. The old man planteth with the one foot in his graue, whose honest labour, tho it yield himself no frute, sauing the bare hope to profit his posteritie, yet God doth so prosper, as the effect fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, tho he be not to vse it. And the natur of euills, not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turallie euill, which will neuer be better, but euill by abuse, which right vse will better, is so loth to be ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, and so long ear it harken to the voice of redresse, as at the first attempt to haue som redresse, the partie attempter is more wondred at for the wish, then estemed of as wise. <hi>Homer</hi> the great Greke poët deuiseth a monster, which he nameth Até, and giueth her for <note place="margin">10. Iiiad.</note> surname the Ladie of harm, with whom he ioyns in fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship thre other staied matrones, which he calleth Litae, and the Ladies of redresse, after harms be receiued. This Até, saith he, is so swift of wing, so stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of bodie, so stirring to do il, as she flyes far before, &amp; harmeth where she lighteth. But the thre good Ladies, being halt &amp; lame, old and crooked, not a step with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a staf, cannot foot it so fast, as their fellow can fly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it falleth out, that harms be soon caught, but healed at leisur, when the old creping Ladies come to present a pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, as theie will com at last, tho it be verie long first. This hope haue we wishers, tho we waite long for it. And that good God who made all these things, which we so mar, as he promiseth a renewing, so is he able to perform it, whose pacience in our <note place="margin">The cause of this book grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the former.</note> misses we must follow in our mends. Thus much concerning those arguments, which ar proper to my book, that I name
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13245:11"/>
Positions. The other kinde of matter, which is begon in that book, tho not ended there, is such as laieth open, what things ar to be followed in the course of learning, and what I my self do promis to do for the auancement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Those things, which concern the course and training vp to learning, laie their first ground work in the young infants. For whom it is there considered both how to frame their tender wits for the matter of their learning, and how to train their weak bodies for the maintenance of their health. For the preseruing of their helth, there be thre speciall things noted there, as most necessarie thereunto, small diet, thin appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, <note place="margin">1. health. diet. apparell. exercise.</note> much exercise. Of the which thre I recommend two, their apparell, and their diet, to the parents care, as most proper to their charge, bycause theie concern home most: the third, which is exercise, I handle there at full, both bycause it is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall branch from the matter of learning; and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a seuerall treatise: and also because I would haue that book to haue somwhat worth the seking, euen for present necessitie, besides those discourses of the generall accidents, that belong to learning, which is the verie subiect of those Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions. <note place="margin">2.

As for behauiour the precept and teaching thereof is reserued to <note place="margin">Behauiour.</note> the master, whose profession smels of iudgement, and giues abilitie to direct: but the chefe performance &amp; practising there of is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto parents, as of nearest care &amp; most certain autoritie ouer their own children. For the moning childe hath verie manie waies to shift from his teacher, vpon verie many small and verie light occasions, God he knoweth: but he hath no mean at all to shake of his parents, without losse of his liuing. Wherfor as often change doth weaken autoritie in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters at will, so necessarie obedience doth strengthen autoritie in parents perforce, and thereby chargeth them with their childerns maners. And yet euen that tiklish obedience, which masters haue, which is roming still, and neuer but remouing dischargeth not them, so far furth, as their commandment will reach. As for knowledge, whereby to encrease the childes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,

                  <note place="margin">Knowledge.</note> that is assigned to the teacher alone, as proper to his office without participation of anie parent, tho a wise and a learned parent be the verie best part of the verie best teacher.

Whatsoeuer else besides these is required in that age, either to streng hen their bodies, or to quiken their wits, that is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incident to exercise for helth, then to Elementarie for knowledge.

               <head>Cap. II. That this fiuebranched Elementarie is warranted by generall autoritie of all the grauest writers, and all the best common weals.</head>
               <p>IN persuading &amp; admitting euen the verie best things, there be two other points, besides the pretended goodnesse in the thing, which theie haue still in eie, that ar to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded. Whereof the one is, what cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he carieth, which is the persuader, and what mean he vseth to work his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion. For both the thing, which is in question, must make shew of some good, ear it will be receiued: and the partie that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13245:12"/>
persuadeth, must be of good credit, if he think to be beleued: and the mean whereby his persuasion must take place, must be stronglie appointed with the best kinde of proufs, both for autoritie in persons, and probabilitie in things. For who will allow, but where there is a why? or who will hear him, which is, he knoweth not who? or what force can that haue to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it self place, which neither wise man praiseth, nor wise reason proueth? That this fiue branched Elementarie, which <note place="margin">The goodnesse of the thing.</note> I seke to persuade, is verie profitable and good, there be manie priuat presumptions in our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon experience, besides the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall proufs, which shall follow hereafter. First, bycause the most of these principles be in vse with vs alreadie, tho not with all persons, yet sure in all places, where the liking of these things, and the abilitie to bear charge do concur in parents. Secondly, bycause euen those which haue them not, yet do wish theie had them, when theie fall in thinking of them, vpon som either pleasant or profitable obiect, which theie finde wrought by them: tho vpon som priuat respect either to spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or to precise, some kinde of people either care not for get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them at first, or for wishing them at last, least theie might seme to condemn their own selues, if theie did wish for that, which theie wold not once, as contemning that of passion, which theie allow of in iudgement. Besides these two, there be <note place="margin">The autoritie of the persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> a number mo, which our dailie experience doth bring furth, whereby the goodnesse of this argument, is euidentlie confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And maie it not seme likelie to anie resonable censur, that I my self wold not so force them on publiklie, if theie were not in dede excedinglie well warranted, with more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mine own autoritie? For who am I to persuade the liking of so full an Elementarie, not allowed of the most, neither tried of the best? A simple teacher. And yet that teaching name is not plane nothing, in a matter of school. A mean companion. That is a great somthing, where the persuaders countenance, is to carie awaie the thing. Nay a newfangle. That is very odious, where the old currant will not lightlie be changed, and the opinion of right hath both the countenance of the best, and contentment of the most, wherevpon to make staie. To me it maie be replied, you medle in this matter alone, you do but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13245:12"/>
truble your self: you can not turn the course, which is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie &amp; old, and therefore verie strong for you to striue against: this thing which you commendis not euerie mans ware: it will not be compased: do you let it alone: if you will nedes write, turn your pen to other matters, which the state will better like of: which this time will soon allow: which you maie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade with credit, if theie be new, and sutable: or confirm with prase, if theie be old, and nede the file. If these and such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections were not allwaie ordinarie euen to euerie one, in all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of turning, either from the ill to good, or from the good to better, I wold answer them with care, but now I nede not, bycause to win a resolute good, he that wisheth to haue it must think to wrastle for it, both with words and writing, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst corruption of time, against the alonenesse of attempt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the preiudice of parties, against the difficulties of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, &amp; whatsoeuer else. Neither must he be discouraged with anie ordinarie thwarting, which is a thing well known to well trauelled students, and of least account where it is best known, how fearfull a thing soeuer it seme to weak fantsies, by crossing of corruption to striue against the stream. For both the stream will turn, when a stronger tide returns, and if there be no tide, yet an vntired trauell will still on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, vntill he be aboue it. And more honorable it were for som one or som few to hasard their own credit and estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the time in fauour of such a thing, as theie know to be of credit, tho not in account, then by to timorous a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, to sore afraid of a popular opinion, not alwaie the soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, tho most of most swinge, to leaue excellent arguments ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther destitute of defence, if theie be pleaded against, or defeated of deliuerie, if theie fortun to be cald for. For maie it not fall out, that such a thing, as this is, maie be cald for hereafter, tho presentlie not cared for thorough som other occasion, which hath the rudder in hand? I had therefor rather that it were redie then, to help when it were wisht for, then for fear of misliking at the first setting furth, to defraud the posteritie of a thing so passing good. And what if the want of conuenient books, appropriate to persons, applied to things, apt for ech purpos, both hath bene, and be the hinderer of such helps,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13245:13"/>
which would be ventered on, if men had such volums? And in good sooth, I know not anie book in this Elementarie kinde so thoroughlie fitted for such a purpos, as I hope this shall pròue. What there be in other kindes I will then shew mine opinion, when I com to their placing. But for this present, bycause there maie be such counterbufs, as I haue said before, against my countenaunce in this persuasion, notwithstanding the good, which is more then half confessed to be in the thing, I haue therefor by waie of mean to work persuasion, fenced my hole <note place="margin">The mean to work persuasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </note> choice in all these principles, with the best autoritie of most al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed writers, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the vse of them in one hole traine, and with the greatest weight of most apparent reasons, which maie persuade vs thoroughlie to entertain them so, as their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert is worthie, and as their worthinesse deserues. Which two proufs, I thinke maie verie well persuade anie reasonable man, both to beleue me, and to embrace them. But will ye hear the writers them selues speak? theie shall not nede to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bycause the testimonie of a few is sufficient enough, where the truth of a thing is called in question, and those few in that kinde be held for most trew, the kinde it selfe being such as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth not religion, but onelie common policie, tho the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie be but simple, where the religion is but small. Besides this all such writers as saie the same with them after their time, be but quils of that cundit, whereof theie ar the head: or if theie were before them, theie are so confirmed by them, as the second co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For when theie liued, there were so great broods of most learned men, as would not haue let them go vncontrolled, if theie had missed the cussion. Therefore I must nedes think, that theie did not misse, and so much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bycause theie name all the principles, which argeweth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise: &amp; shew, for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theie fit, which proueth a good forecast.

A thing not gathered in him by me in natur of anie consequence, but vttered by himself, in the waie of his discourse. In the same place freing poetrie from fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and vnsemelie arguments, and pictur from wanton &amp; lasciuious resemblances, which two be the generall branches of naturall imitation, where he fineth both he refuseth neither: but as by clensing poëtrie he proueth grammer to be but an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementarie</hi> principle, so by clearing pictur, he proues drawing to be another.

not but allow the one, admitting the other, as <hi>Plato</hi> did before him not refusing where he fined. I will rest content with the assured credit of these thre onelie, as principall among all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther philosofers, or other, whereof there is none, but he doth allow of those principles, which these thre appoint, and I haue chosen. Neither is there anie other of either valew or account, which handleth this argument of childrens foretrain, whether in Greke or Latin, whether of purpos or by passage, whether Christian or prophane writer, but he ioyneth with them and me herein, tho in som after learning, and fear of som misuse, theie somtime dissent, and wish rather that the principles were wanting then the perills should take place, which vnwise peple seme to be subiect vnto, by dealing to far with them, a false slander to good principles, tho a iust reproche to ill peple. The best appointed common wealls also, in the best &amp; most florish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times for all kinde of learning embraced the same train, a thing as easie to be proued, by all the best writers, in most plane terms, if I thought it nedefull, as it is roundlie said in these few words. For it is not my resolution to vse manie names, tho I know the men, saue in those cases, where I must haue som com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of known note, to satisfie som humors, or else seme my self to be of either none, or but of verie small account. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it anie discredit for a Christian writer in cases of learning and education, such as these be, where Christianism maie fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the matter, tho prophanism yeild the form, to follow the president of prophane common wealls, &amp; to cite the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of old philosophers, from whence we fet the most part of our learning. Neither can anie Christian state, or anie relligious consideration tho neuer so precise, but think verie well of these Elementarie principles, which the panims do, allow if theie be aduisedlie considered, and not he dilie renounced, by either raptnesse in conceit, or rashnesse in iudgement, before theie be well weied. For the same principles of learning, &amp; the same fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties being learned, did arm the Christians to ouerthrow, which armd the infidels to assail, as the learned diuines know to be most trew, by both the old greke writers, as <hi>Iustine</hi> the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir <hi>Eusebius</hi> the storier, and who not of that race? &amp; by the old latin autors to, as <hi>Lactantius</hi> and <hi>Austen,</hi> and who but of that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13245:14"/>
crew? whose names I wold not spare, if that were best for spede. And why not <hi>Agar</hi> beloued in obedience to hir mistresse, as banished for hir stomak? seing it pleased <hi>Philo</hi> to make fre <hi>Sara</hi> the type of right religion, &amp; bond <hi>Agar</hi> the type of other leaning. For the ills which ar pretended to come by them which be the chefe, naie the onelie causes why som honest but to credulous naturs do mislike som of them: the common wealls which shall admit them &amp; the parties which will learn them for their profit sake, must take hede therevnto, least a more perillous harm do chance to crepe in vnder the colour of profit: seing the falts wherewith theie ar charged procede not from the things as naturallie euill, but from the persons, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall abusers, euen of what so is best. Which point in waie of their iustification shalbe laid verie plane in the particular dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of euerie principle. Well then, thus do all writers, thus do al estates, thus do all relligions esteme of these principles for the number, &amp; goodnesse thereof, for where allowance of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is, the allowance of their good is granted before hand.</p>

               <head>Cap. III. The opinion of the best writers concerning the choice of wits fit for learning.</head>
               <p>I Said before that the best writers did not onelie agre vpon the number of principles, but also did appoint for what kinde of wits it were most agreable to be trained vp in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Of the principles I haue spoken sufficientlie: now let vs se, what their opinion is concerning the choice of wits. Which choice is a <note place="margin">The necessitie of choice at this time.</note> thing to be verie much thought on at all times, &amp; in all places, but in these our daies, and this our cuntrie vpon speciall causes to be narrowlie looked vnto, as I haue said more then once, &amp; that in places mo then one. For the consideration is weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier to whom ye commit learning, when ye haue found what to learn, then to find what to learn, before ye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit it. Bycause the best instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wold all waie be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled by the fittest person, &amp; not by euerie one, that hath a fantsie to handle it. The wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of this choice while priuat liking, &amp; not publik order giues lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hir student; doth cause more mischefe, then the ground
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13245:15"/>
whereof is yet not found, tho the smart thereof be felt. And to saie the truth why is it a question, what wits be fittest to be set to learning, if there be no choice made, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided. The old writers declare the necessitie of this choice to be exceding great, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that theie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues be so curious care full to finde out such wits, as ar to be trained that waie. Which their carefullnesse doth seme as it were to saie, what can anie thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, be it neuer so good auaill the estate, for the which it should serue, if it be not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto such perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as be fit to execute? Which commission taking hir beginning in the young childe, for matters of learning, ought not good choice to go before, where such an effect is to follow? In ane vniust man doth not the commission for iustice wrong a number of people? In a rash captain doth not the charge ouer soldiers bring a number to their end? And to Philosophie (which is a generall name to all learning among the old writers) can there possiblie be anie greater dishonor saith <hi>Plato,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to bastard wits, and not of hir own kinde? Naie can there be anie greater plage to anie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weall, then to haue that mean, which is naturallie hir best and of most profit, if the person, which shall vse it, be well appointed, to proue to be her worst, and hir greatest hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, by either the no choice, or else the verie ill choice of that same person? Wherefor in the choice of wits allyed naturallie to <note place="margin">The end wherefor choice is made.</note> learning, theie first consider the end, wherefor theie ar to serue, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theie ar once learned, &amp; then their qualities, whereby theie ar proued to be fit for learning. In the end theie consider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, that is learned do liue priuatlie to him self, or publiklie for others. For as those, which serue in publik function do turn their learning to publik vse, which is the naturall vse of all <note place="margin">The priuat end of studie.</note> learning: so such as liue to themselues either for pleasur in their studie, or to auoid foren truble do turn their learning to a priuate ease, which is the priuat abuse of a publik good. For the common weall is the measur of euerie mans being, which if anie one respect not, he is not to liue in it. If he be able to serue and do not, his choice condemns him: if infirmitie let his choice his infirmitie is his pardon: if he studie tho priuatlie to a publik end, his end is his warrant, tho his mean be mistaken. Wherein <hi>Tullies</hi> opinion semeth to be sounder then <hi>Platoes</hi> for the not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13245:15"/>
leauing of philosophers to their priuat studie, if theie were fit to serue in anie publik roum. But I do take it that <hi>Plato</hi> ment the higher publik seruices, such as the chefe magistrates &amp; hed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers be, which places he still reserueth to his chefe philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, and in the Monarchie he saueth euen the verie croun and principaltie for them. Which so great a charge in anie estate the philosofers did seke allwaie to auoid, as being either to trublesom, or to much subiect to the peples furie, chefelie in a popular gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, such as that of Athens was, where the most philosofers were. In the choice of these wits for this priuat end, bycause theie could not gesse aforehand, what their end wold be, theie vsed the same mean for their first train, and fitting of their wit, which theie did vse for the best, and the most publik end. In those which learn to that end, that theie maie be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in publik, and proue so in the end, theie chefelie consider <note place="margin">The publik end of studie.</note> the <hi>principall</hi> and <hi>subaltern</hi> magistrates. I call those magistates <hi>principall,</hi> which ar not subiect to account of their gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by anie common order, tho in conscience and religion both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and men theie be euerie one subiect, as stewards <note place="margin">Magistrates principall and subaltern.</note> by commission, whether theie be Emperours, Kings, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer prince of absolut soueraintie, not vassall to anie higher. I call those <hi>subaltern</hi> which ruling other yet ar subiect to other, as in a Monarchie all the mean and inferiour magistrates, and generallie as in anie estate those officers be, which be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tant for their doings. These magistrates be theie, whom all their precepts tend vnto, as the principall springs of most good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill in anie estate. Bycause theie be the life &amp; soul of their lawes for reward and punishment: the onelie president in all doings, to the common subiect, whether themselues be in principall roum, or but in subaltern. The principall magistrate is a great president as most profitable in good, so most perillous in ill: by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his vertew, is the generall allurement, to resemble the like by, as his vice is the generall couert, for impunitie to offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The <hi>subaltern</hi> magistrates make a sta<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e verie lothsom by euill execution, as theie make it verie lightsom, by the contrarie dealing. Their own obedience towards their superiors is more then a lure to reclame the peple, bycause their obsequiousnesse to those that ar aboue them enforceth their vnder ones offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie

And therefor in the choice of their chefe, where the chefe is of choice, theie be meruellous vigilant, and chuse most what for time, and not for perpetuitie, for fear of ill successe in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good choice, where assura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of time bredes securitie in time, and securitie no good. Likewise in these <hi>subaltern</hi> magistrates theie be no lesse carefull, bycause their places and functions concern euerie particular sinew, euerie particular vein, euerie particular arterie, naie euerie small filet, and finest string or strip in the hole bodie of anie common weall. Here lieth their choice of their learned wits, bycause theie take learning to be a leading qualitie, and therefor beseming the place, if it be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in person. These theie will haue fed and cherished with best matter, from the first time that theie be able to take anie pains either for bodilie exercise, or for trauell in learning, vntill theie be able to serue that publik turn, wherevnto theie at destinate, &amp; wherefor theie were so trained by publik foresight. In these theie consider the maintenance of the state, &amp; therefor in their choice their chefe regard is, what wit is most fit in euerie kinde of state, bycause the like as it loueth the like best, so bycause of that loue it preferreth it most. Thus much concerning the <note place="margin">The qualities of the bodie and the minde which lead this choice.</note> end wherefor the choice is made. In the qualities which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraie fitnesse for learning, theie haue regard to both the bodie and the minde. In the bodie theie require, that it be able for strength, and health to abide exercise the preseruer of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both: that it be of good proportion and correspondent to the minde for trauell in studie, &amp; if it maie be, to haue it personable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, <note place="margin">The choice in bodie.</note> bycause personablenesse is an allurement to obedience, a gracious deliuerer of anie inward vertew, &amp; somtime was este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a thing most worthie of the principall seat.

In the minde theie consider first <note place="margin">The choice in minde.</note> the means to conceiue well, and to kepe fast, and then those
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13245:16"/>
qualities, which be fittest for performance, when the habit is had. In conceiuing well, first theie require a sharpnesse of wit to <note place="margin">A quik con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing.</note> perceiue soon, without taint of dulnesse or difficultie by hard learning: bycause wits shrink and recoill sooner, at a thing hard to learn thorough their own dulnesse, then theie do at anie la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor in the greatest exercise. For in learning the burden is the mindes alone, in exercise the bodie bears part with the minde. Secondlie theie seke for an inuincible &amp; laborious courage to go thorough with al paines. For without such a courage &amp; that naturallie had, what wit could awaie with so much trauell of bodie, so much toill of minde, so much tiring of both in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; studie? Theie regard also a desire to be asking, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of others, which be better learned, and a delite to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the best, &amp; therefor to be praised: neuer to be idle, but euer well occupied, tho it be in plaie, so it be worthie praise. In the retaining of that, which theie haue conceiued theie require <note place="margin">A fast retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> a fast memorie to kepe well, and a good foresight to continew it well, and by the same means, whereby theie first learned, with all those exercises which confirm memorie, &amp; make waie to further knowledge. In both these qualities, to conceiue soon, &amp; to kepe fast, theie vse to consider certain other signes which be ordinarie companions to anie toward wit, as to be natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie well giuen, to be curteous in behauiour, &amp; such of that sort, as <hi>Quintilian</hi> bids giue him that boy, which wilbe quikned with praise, which wilbe aloft with honor, which will wepe at a foill. This boy saith he must be fed with braueries, him cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will encourage, in him I fear no loytering. In stede of that weping at a foil <hi>Xenopho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> in the person of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he deuiseth <note place="margin">Cyrus in Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon.</note> so perfit, as the best boy for a patern to bring vp, &amp; the best price for a preside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to princes, semeth rather to like of laughing himself at himself, thereby neither to take laughter in the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers on for anie kinde of mok: neither to lease anie courage, but furthwith to amend the thing, wherein he missed. Whereas we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping might bewraie a pusillanimitie, and a faint of stomak. But <hi>Quintilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

after their foill at <hi>Caudium,</hi> where the gallous was their gate, tho theie we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnder it like gese, was no argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of corage vanquished &amp; oppressed by so shamefull a despite, but of a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed choler &amp; a boiling grefe, which lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged for occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to work reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, &amp; was thoroughlie ashamed, till theie had cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shame with their enemie for honor, &amp; had died their swords in the deceiuers blood, their foill co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming not thorough their own defalt, but by folie of their leaders. As for <hi>Quintilianes</hi> cokking boy stil perching, still aspiring: such a pert co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit maie be good for his oratour, bycause he limits him no place, but it is hard for a subiect, whose humilitie is his honor. For the aspiring wit, which wilbe still a mounting, giues som euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t suspition of a restlesse head, in anie kinde of state, least fit for a Monarchie, &amp; lesse profitable to it self. Bycause desiring stil to be the best, if he misse, he moills other, if he hit, he harms himself, by insolence of thought, not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with a mediocritie, as to far beneath him, nether able to get much, as not fit for his humor, where the state is to distribut, as it thinks of the person, and not the person to receiue as he thinks of himself. In the generall learner I like <note place="margin">Pamphilus in Terence.</note> that disposition best, which <hi>Terence</hi> doth attribut to young <hi>Pamphilus</hi> in his comedie called <hi>Andria:</hi> in whom I obserue two seuerall properties, the one for learning, the other for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauior. For his learning he was neither to excellent to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyed, neither to mean to be contemned, but as not aboue all in anie thing, so not beneath all in anie: that much allowed mediocritie being the rule of his learning. In behauior to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards other he had acquainted himself to bear with all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies in most varietie of behauior, to yeild himself to them in honestie of delite, contrarying none, contemning none, neuer bragging of his birth, neuer vanting of his welth. For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in wits this moderate kinde is most contrarie to the worst. If anie one be to singular od, he is fit either for valew aboue all to be sent vp to heauen, as to good for the earth; or for vice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath all to be wisht somwhere else, as the earth to good for him, as <hi>Plato</hi> dalieth with the like speche in the like case. But those mens chefe consideration in their chusing of wits is, what affection to learning the childe hath by natur. Bycause it is hard to haill against the stream, as it is wonderous easie to row
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13245:17"/>
down with it. Finallie theie knit vp all their choice with this no fantsie, tho a fable of <hi>Platoes</hi> Protagoras, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> sent <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie</hi> down into the world, to distribut learning and vertew amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g those of the world. In which his distributio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he gaue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to peple, according as theie were inclined by natur: but he gaue them vertew, which he deuided into a remorse to do ill, and a desire to do right, according to necessitie, which was to haue few men learned, and as theie were inclined, but to haue all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vertewous, as theie ought to be inclined. Bycause one learned man, as one physician, will help a great number: but it is necessarie for all men to be ashamed to do ill, and to be redie to do good. And with all, there saith <hi>Iupiter</hi> to <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie</hi> make this proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoroughout the hole world, that theie furth with kil him, as a disease in a state, who so euer is not capable of shame to do wrong, and will to do right. Whereby theie do mean, that there wold not be to manie brought vp vnto learning, where both natur restrains being not fit in most, and our vse doth not nede them, where some few will serue all. Which two considerations natur in most, &amp; nede in all, be the chefe grounds of this choice for learning. But vertew &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse be required in all, as necessarie for all in this our generall nede, &amp; corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of natur, whereby most be euill, whereas all should be good. But I haue said much allredie concerning this choice in diuerse places of my former book, which I call Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and speciallie in that title, which handleth the stripping of, of too manie bookmen. In the qualities that declare a wit <note place="margin">The qualities in choice for performance.</note> verie likelie to perform well afterward, when learning is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, theie commonlie consider the honest disposition, and the parties zeall towards morall vertew, and ciuill societie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for honesties sake without hope of anie profit. Then theie mark next the forsight of conceit, which must be neither easie to be deceiued, nor soon to be remoued from a right opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by either passion in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, or persuasion of others. And general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie whatsoeuer vertew is like to bewraie both a good man, and a good subiect, that theie call to councell in making of their choice, to haue their learner make shew, both of capabilitie, &amp; <note place="margin">Libertie and abilitie two great respects in choice.</note> keping, in matters of learning, and of towardnesse and constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, in matters of liuing. In all these wits theie still respect li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:13245:18"/>
and not bondage, abilitie and not pouertie, to haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning liberall, where learners be no slaues, and the execution vncorrupt, where nede is not to festur. Yet theie do not exclude nede in excellent naturall wits, but theie prouide for their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, that theie be not subiect to nede. And tho slaues be som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times learned; yet learning is not slauish: neither when the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties demeanor doth procure his fredom, is learning manumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, which was neuer bond. Which two reasons, for libertie, and nede, the old wisdom, whereof I intreat now, must nedes confesse, if ye look but to <hi>Aesop</hi> among slaues; &amp; <hi>Plato</hi> among writers: whereof <hi>Aesop</hi> fought still for fredom against seruilitie, &amp; <hi>Plato</hi> for natur against mutable fortun, measuring not euen princes by their place, but by their propertie, by naturall power, and not by casuall euent. The cause why theie think so much of abilitie is the respect of the peple, which will obeie best, where theie be ouer topt most: as the cause why theie think so much of fredom is, for that slaues haue no voice nor part in the state, being held but for catle, tho reasonable withall: whereas learning hath best voice in anie estate, and therefor requireth the help of such an vtterer, as is part of the state, and capable of best state. Thus much for both the number of the Elementarie principles, and the choice of wits most fit for learning, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the iudgement of the eldest, and best writers.</p>

               <p>AS for the reasons, which confirm the choice of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie principles, I find them to be both manie, and well appointed, &amp; such, as moue me to think, both that these fiue, and that not fewer then these fiue, neither anie other then these fiue do make a perfit Elementarie, and that a perfit Elementarie is a most excellent thing, and so most excellent, as without the which, if it be not either anie at all, or not such as this is, there will great defects ensew in yeares, which might be preuented in youth. For as the wise <hi>Cato</hi> being demanded <note place="margin">Cic. 2. de Off.</note> what was the chefe point, that did belong to husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drie, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

And why not I in that, which methink I know being a long teacher? That <hi>Cato</hi> answered wiselie, what better reason can you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, then the effect thereof in the catle themselues, and the catlelike creaturs, which being the husbandmans charge, and staruing without stouer, defeat the ill feader of his conceiued stok. That <hi>Demosthenes</hi> his action was the soull of his orations, and assured the truth of his iudiciall answer, who is better wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse then euen <hi>Aeschines</hi> his enemie? Who being banished his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntrie, by the onelie mean of <hi>Demosthenes</hi> his tung, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse in his exile, that he was sorer wounded with the force of his action, which gaue life to his words, then with the strength of his words, that fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d work for his action. That this my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> concerning the infinite commoditie of a good and perfect E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementarie, is as trew in the train to learning, as either <hi>Catoes</hi> was in husbandrie, or <hi>Demosthenes</hi> his in oratorie, there be six speciall and principall causes, which by the greatnesse of their own good effects, do vnfalliblie conclude, the excellent bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit therof, euen by cause ech of the principles is so excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t good. All which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curring, &amp; meting in the generall end of the hole Elementarie, must nedes import a meruellous treasur, to be in the hole, where euerie particular, which maketh vp that hole, doth proue to be so profitable.

If the Elementarie do season the grene vessell with the swetest liquor, and the vntrained minde with the holsommest humor, is the goodnesse thereof doutfull, where the substance is so precious? If it make the childe most capable of most commendable qualities, which without it he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:13245:19"/>
could not aspire vnto, deserueth it not embracing, which makes so plane a waie to so excellent a thing? If it resemble natur in the multitude of hir abilities, and procede so in teaching, as she <note place="margin">3</note> doth in towarding, can the currant be but good, which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth such a gide? If in place of hardnesse, it plant facilitie, doth it <note place="margin">4</note> not help students to saill with a forewind, without fear of ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrak, where all roks be remoued, that theie nede not to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or so laid in sight, as theie maie easilie be auoided? If where there is now verie great misliking of manie good things, by <note place="margin">5</note> mean of ignorance, which cannot conceiue them, it do cause allowa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by the mean of knowledge, which of iudgement will allow them, is not learning much bound to it, for clearing hir fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> blemish? Naie, if within the Elementarie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pas it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <note place="margin">6</note> also the entrie to language, and the grammer trauell, which is the keie to all cunning, maie it not then well be said to be perfect in all points, which belong to ane Elementarie? seing in course of studie, where language doth end, there learning doth begin? and all that goeth before that, as in order it is a principle, so in natur it is Elementarie? Now that it is of such ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie, for seasoning with the best, for conceiuing of the most, for resembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of natur, for exile to hardnesse, for maim to misli king, for entrie to speche, it shalbe proued verie planelie, and withall so; as no other Elementarie ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> possiblie compare with it. For as I am thoroughlie persuaded, that the first Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, being well perfited is the onelie furtherer to all kindes of learning: so am I likewise resolued, that this Elementarie, not deuised by me, tho reuiued by me, is the perfection of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie, and so consequentlie the chefe promoter of the after learning, which the effect will shew in prouf, as the reasons will in prouing.

OF those six reasons, whereby I take the great vse of this Elementarie to be vnfalliblie confirmed, the first is, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it doth season the tender, &amp; vntrained minde with the best &amp; swetest liquor. Which that it doth, who will deny, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he shal euidentlie se, nothing to be propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded therein, but that, which is most pure &amp; picked? <hi>Plato Aristotle</hi> &amp; <hi>Quintilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> tho not theie alone, in those places of their fortrain, where theie <note place="margin">Plato. 2. 3. Pol Arist. 7. 8. Pol.

And our own relligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which best knoweth of what importance it is, to haue youth embrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the best at the first, is meruellous carefull, both to win them to it by precept, and to work it in them by practis. For the necessitie of beginning at the best, in euerie argument, which hath a beginning, and is to procede by order, I shall not nede to saie much either for the good which it bringeth, or for the ill which it blemisheth. One <hi>Theodorus</hi> a plaier of Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, belike such a one, as <hi>Roscius</hi> was at Rome both excellent men in that kinde of action, wold neuer let anie mean or vnskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full actor enter the stage before him, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> reporteth, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he himself wold work the first delite, euen with the verie best, for that he knew the force of the first impressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid with pleasur in the beholders minde wold cause them procede on with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in like pleasur, wheras so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnswete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse at the first might cause harshnes thoroughout. Wherein I note also (tho the first planting of best sciences be our gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning here) that by his so doing, he either enforced his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiers to be like to him, &amp; so partakers of the praise: or else he alone bare awaie all the praise, as deseruing it alone. Could one <hi>Theodorus</hi> a Tragedie plaier espy that in the stage, which was somtime allowed as tolerable, outlawed somtime, as vnlawfull, &amp; maie not a scholer spy the like in the course of learnig, which is still vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the stage, as most profitable still?

In the mean time till the grammer princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do com to light, that <hi>Reading</hi> shalbe so relligious, <hi>Writing</hi> so warie, <hi>Drawing</hi> so dangerlesse, <hi>Singing</hi> so semelie, <hi>plaing</hi> so praise worthie, the euent shall giue euidence, and the relice it <note place="margin">The parents charge at home.</note> self shall set surth the seasoning. But by the waie, as the Eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie professeth it self in the course of learning, and in trade of school to be the first &amp; best seasoner of the vntrained minde: so ought pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, also for their ówn part both before &amp; during all the Elementarie time, to prouide so at home, as there be no ill liquor inconsideratlie powred into the grene cask, which maie so corrupt it, as it will either quite refuse the good Elementarie humor, or vnwillinglie receiue it, and not to such a good, as it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13245:20"/>
vseth for to work, where the cask is not corrupt. For if the you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g eies be acquainted at home with vnsemelie sights: if the tender ears be more then half trained to vncomlie hearings, if the pliable minde be vnwiselie writhen to a disfigured shape, if the hole conceit be vnaduisedlie stained with a contrarie dy, how can that countenance be liked on in school, whose contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fauor is most honored at home? Those pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts therefor which will look for the best liquor in schools, must not in anie case vse corrupt humor at home. For that is most trew, which is vttered by manie, but most oraclelike by <hi>Plato,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the strength of that iuyce, which the young wits at first seasoned withall.

Now those means be in vs either natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie ingenerate, or artificiallie emplanted, and that so, as theie shew themselues, both in our bodies, and mindes. Concerning <note place="margin">Naturall helps to further ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie. The minde.</note> the naturall helps, which by the verie inclination be wraie a minde made naturallie fit, either to conceiue, or to retain, or to execute anie learned qualitie well and therefor the better, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the more naturallie, I haue spoken enough in the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of choice, where I wish by the autoritie of the best writers, that such wits onelie were set to learning, as naturallie bear som fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor that waie. Concerning such naturall properties, as will <note place="margin">The bodie.</note> discry a bodie fit for anie exercise, either to kepe the bodie it self in helth in one, that is no student: or to assist the minde in all hir executions, in one that is a student, I haue said enough in my book of Positions, where I handle exercise. Neither is the question at this time of anie naturall inclination, but of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall helps, and those not for the bodie, which point is for Gymnastik and exercise of the bodie, but onelie for the minde, tho wrought by the bodie, which is for these principles, and the Elementarie learning: I saie therefor that these fiue principles, <hi>reading, writing, drawing, singing,</hi> and <hi>playing,</hi> which make this <note place="margin">Artificiall helps to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther capacitie.</note> hole Elementarie, besides exercise, which is Elementarie to, tho handled elswhere, be the onelie artificiall means to make a minde capable of all the best qualities, which ar to be engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed in the minde, tho to be executed by the bodie: which best qualities be two, vertew for behauior, and knowledge for cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Vnder the name of behauior I comprise all those quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <note place="margin">The best qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the minde. Vertew.</note> whose honor is in action, as vnder the name of knowledge I imply all those, whose soueraintie is in skill, tho either of them both both know ear theie do, &amp; do as theie know. For vertew and the planting thereof, it hath no cause to complain of this Elementarie, which giueth precepts vnto children how to learn
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:13245:21"/>
to do well, and so preserueth vertew, as much as direction can. What furtherance else is to be had there vnto by practising that in dede, which is commanded in word, that is reserued also, &amp; most earnestlie recommended euen by this Elementarie to all parents and teachers, according vnto the distinction of that autoritie, which theie haue ouer childern. Doth not this Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie then make childern most capable of vertew in elder years, for whose growing it is so carefull in their tender age, both by precept and performance? As for <hi>knowledge</hi> which ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note place="margin">Knowledge.</note> directlie vnto cunning these fiue principles serue directlie therevnto. For by them the minde is prepared and made fit to receiue and vnderstand all things, which either natur doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath vs, or labor prouides for vs: By <hi>reading</hi> we receiue what antiquitie hath left vs, by writing we deliuer what poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie craues of vs: by both we find great ease in euerie occasion of our dailie vse: By resembling with pencill what a spectable thing is there, and subiect to the eie, either brought furth by natur, or set furth by art, whose knowledge and vse we attain not vnto? By the principle of musik besides the purchace of a noble science, so certainlie platted by Arithmeticall precept, as no one better, so necessarie a step to further knowledge, as no one more, such a glasse wherein to behold both the beawtie of concord, and the blots of dissension euen in a politik bodie, as no one surer: how manie helps and how great ease receiueth our naturall infirmitie either in care for comfort, or in hope for courage. Not here to tuch the skilfull handling of the rude voice, nor the fine nimbling of the raw fingers, things not to be refused where theie maie be well had, and naturallie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, where imperfection is to be perfited by them. Againe doth not all our learning conceiued by the eie, and vttered by the tung confesse the great benefit which it receiueth by <hi>reading?</hi> Doth not all our deliuerie brought furth by the minde, and set furth by the pen acknowledge a dewtie to the principle of <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?</hi> Doth not all our descriptions, which figur in the thought, and pictur to the sense both preach &amp; praise the pencill, which causeth them be sene? Doth not all our delite in times not bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied (as all our labour is for rest, all our trauell for ease, all our care to auoide care) protest in plane termes, that it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13245:22"/>
endetted to either part of Musik, both by instrument and voice? the naturall sweter of our sour life in anie mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is not to sour? Now what learned qualitie is there of anie commendation, but it falleth within this number, and is furthered by these principles, whether it be chefe profession of greater note, or meaner facultie of lesse account, or necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie trade of vnforbearable vse? And not to leaue exercise quite <note place="margin">Exercise the cause of capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie in the bodie.</note> vntuched, seing it is mere Elementarie, &amp; alwaie to ioyn with ech ascent in learning, as the bodie growing in strength or in years requireth more or lesse stirring: by the artificiall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thereof the fete excell in swiftnesse, if natur be according, the arms in strength, the hole bodie in ech part, for all gifts in ech part, which either concern helth or cause actiuitie. And as so manie principles appointed for the minde being cunninglie applied thereunto, do make it most able both to conceiue with the soonest, and to deliuer with the fairest: euen so the one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of exercise being skilfullie applied according to right cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunstance maketh the bodie most actiue in all parts, to execute all functions both of necessitie and praise with a meruellous nimblenesse. All qualities therefor whether belonging to the bodie, bycause their excutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is by it, or partaining to the minde, bycause their seat is in it, must nedes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse themselues to be so auanced by this Elementarie, as in dede theie were nothing, if it were not. Take exercise awaie, what then is the bodie, but an vnweildie lump? what vse of it hath either cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie in defence, or it self in delite? Remoue precept and practis, and where then is vertew, which neither knoweth, what to do, if it be not direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, neither doth when it knoweth, if it faill of practis? Set these fiue principles apart, what can the vnlearned eie iudge of? the vntrained hand deall with? the vnframed voice please with? If all the principles want, then all the qualities faill, if som cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, then so manie faill, as procede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them that wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. If all the principles be had, then all the qualities will follow. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for I conclude, that if all commendable qualities do fall within this compas, if these principles auance them all, if want in the one cause defect in the other, that then this Elementarie must nedes cause the childe being so well trained, to be most capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of most commendable qualities, and that the defect in these
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:13245:22"/>
must of mere necessitie cause defect in those. Whereof theie can best iudge, which when theie grow in years, then perceiue their own lak, which commeth for want of such a foretraine. At which time one of these things streight waie enseweth. Either theie condemn that, which theie know not, thorough ignorance: or theie contemn that, which theie dispare of, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough insolence: or theie mone that, which theie misse of, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough negligence, most comonlie offrinds, which regarding litle else, but the waie to welth, desire rather a compendious path to compas that, then a longer circuit to com by a better, tho in the end theie perceiue, that at the first theie might well haue obtained both, with verie small ado. Wherefor the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementarie being so absolut, and yeilding so great a capable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to further qualities, it were to great an ouersight in those parents, which haue oportunitie at will, to neglect it in their childern, &amp; in stede of knowledge in all, to leaue them ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in som, and cause them in years to mislike, where theie cannot iudge, contemn where theie cannot compas, bewaill where theie fele want, chefelie considering, that as it will make chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern capable of the most, so it self is compassable, well nigh by the meanest.</p>

               <head>Cap. VII. That this Elementarie resembleth natur, both in number of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities and in maner of proceding.</head>
               <p>THe third prouf of a good Elementarie was to resemble natur in multitude of abilities, and to procede so in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, as she doth in towarding. For as she is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frindlie, wheresoeuer she is forced, so is she the best gide, that anie man can follow, wheresoeuer she fauoreth. Wherefor if natur make a childe most fit to excell in manie singularities, so theie be furthered and auanced by Elementarie train in the younger yeares, is not that education much to be blamed, by whom the falt coms, and the infant is defeated of that same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, which natur voweth, and negligence voideth?</p>
               <p>Again, when there is nothing ment vs by natur, but train will help it forward, is not train it self to be thought most perfit, and the mean of the train to be held most absolut, which spre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13245:23"/>
with natur, where she splaieth most, as manifold in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as she is in profering.</p>
               <p>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I vse the name of natur, I mean that power, which God <note place="margin">VVhat is ment by the name of natur.</note> hath emplanted in these his creaturs both to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinew their own kinde, that it do not decaie, &amp; to answer that end, wherefor these were made. The continewance of their kinde is the prouf of their being, but the answering of their end, is the frute of their being. This latter part is that point, where vnto education hath a speciall eie (tho it contemn not the other) that the young fry maie be brought vp so, as theie maie proue good in the end, and serue well in that place, wherevnto theie shalbe loted, for the benefit of their countrie, when theie com to years, and full state of prouf. For the performance whereof that theie maie proue such in dede, I take it, that this Eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tarie in his kinde is most sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as being the best mean to perfit all those abilities, which natur endoweth our kinde withall, by those same princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which art and consideration appointeth it withall: and by vsing such pollicie in the waie &amp; passage to artificiall perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as natur hir self doth vse in hir ascending to hir naturall height. Bycause the end of education, and train is to help natur vnto hir perfection, which is, when all hir abilities be perfited in their habit, wherevnto right Elements be right great helps.</p>
               <p>This is that resemblance of natur, which I do mean, not to counterfeat hir in som other work, as fondlie comparing, or <note place="margin">VVhat it is to resemble na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in train.</note> frowardlie bragging with the effects of natur, like som <hi>Apelles</hi> in purtrait, or som <hi>Archimedes</hi> in motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but when consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wiselie marking, whereunto natur is either euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie giuen, or secretlie affectionat, doth frame an education con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant therevnto, to bring all those things to perfection by art, which natur wisheth perfit, by franknesse of hir offer. If natur do offer a towardnesse to write, and no impediment let, but it maie be well applied, is not consideration vntoward, if that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie want forwarding? If with som small help a childes voice maie be made swete, tunable and cunning, is not education lame, if it continew harsh, vnpleasant, and rude? If by benefit of natur, we be made fit for mo qualities, then ordinarie edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doth help vs vnto, do we not blame them, who hauing gouernment ouer vs, leaue vs ignorant in that, which in ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13245:23"/>
of years we want in our selues, and wonder at in others? whose train being better then ours, tho perhaps neither wit quikker, nor bodie nimbler, doth serue for a prouf, that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous natur is oftimes verie frank, where vnkinde fortun shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth verie small frindship: naie that either negligence or folie inconsideratlie cutteth of, that naturall abilitie, most liberallie bestowed. Whereupon I ground my argument that this must nedes be a verie good Elementarie, bycause it preferreth all things which natur offereth to a commendable end, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it self as considerat a teacher, as natur doth hir self an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent towarder.</p>
               <p>But for the better vnderstanding of my conclusion, and this <note place="margin">The generall diuision of this title for naturall abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</note> great concordance, which I note to be betwene natur in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and art in training, both for number of abilities, and for maner of proceding, I will first examin the naturall abilities, which ar to be perfited, &amp; how natur hirself doth forward the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I will shew, how those principles, which art hath deuised for the furtherance of natur, do answer vnto those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of natur, both for sufficiencie in number, and fitnesse to perfection. For where there be verie manie effects, which ar to be wrought, there must nedes be manie, means, to bring the effect about. Where natur hir self offereth verie good hold, there art must be at hand and redie to take it: where natur is frutefull, and plaieth the good mòther, there art must be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and proue a good nurse. For it is most trew, that most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gifts, and endowments of natur, be verie oftimes spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the onelie mean of negligent nurtur.</p>
               <p>I call those naturall abilities, which natur planteth in our mindes and bodies, prepared by hir self for vs to vse, but to be <note place="margin">VVhat natv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall abilities ar.</note> perfited by our selues, to our own best vse, whereunto that power of our minde, or that part of our bodie doth speciallie serue, in which that abilitie is naturallie placed: As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, natur planteth in the hand an abilitie to catch and hold, which that it maie do to the best effect, and to that vse for the which we haue our hand, our own pollicie and practis must be our best mean. Natur pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth in our minde an abilitie to forese such things, as be to com, which that it maie do to our greatest profit, our own wisdom, &amp; our own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration, must be our
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:13245:24"/>
best mean. Whereby it will fall out, that we our own selues do cause our own want, if we do not our endeuor, to further those helps, which the goodnesse of natur, naie, which the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God, the Lord and prince of natur, of his own mere gift doth so bestow vpon vs, as we maie frelie haue them, if we list to apply them. If the case were such, as we our selues were willing to vse them, if we had them, and had them not, the complaint might tuch natur, for not answering our will, but now that we haue them, if we do not vse them, the blame will tuch our selues, for not answering hir goodnesse.</p>
               <p>I call those Artificiall principles, which mans wisdom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">VVhat artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples be.</note> considered the entendment of natur doth deuise for himself, so manie in number, and so fit in qualitie, as these maie take sure hold of all naturall inclinations and abilities, &amp; bring them to perfection by the like mean, and the like as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, in training them to that end, which pollicie doth shout at, as natur sheweth hir self to be verie well willing to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the hand of anie such a trainer, by such a mean as is deuised, to such an end, as she desireth: As in the former examples of the hand to hold fure, &amp; the minde to forese, which be naturall abilities, artificiall principle is to vse such exercises, and so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate experiments, and with such precisenesse in the vse of them both, as the hand maie hold best, and surest with all the minde forese most, and furthest withall. Where natur grounded onelie bare holding, and simple foresight, direction entended the best in them both, as natur did not seme to be verie frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard in either, whose perfection lyes in both.</p>
               <p>By these discriptions it appeareth, that of these naturall qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities som concern the bodie and som the soull, and that both <note place="margin">The generall diuision of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, by the soull and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, by our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onelie and our being well</note> theie help either to our mere being onelie, or to our well being withall: and also that the mean both to work our being in the one kinde best, and our welbeing in the other kinde as well, must be so applied, as natur hir self shall seme to be most pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, which pliablenesse of natur will shew it self, both by ease in the working, and by vse in the work.</p>
               <p>But forsomuch as the handling of all these qualities, first of the bodie, and then of the minde, next of our being, and then of our well being, whether imperfit in nature, or perfit in

train, wilbe somwhat tedious to deal withall seuerallie, and the things the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues maie be wel enough vnderstood being ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled together, seing in all our executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s both the bodie &amp; minde do alwaie concur, tho either more or lesse, as the thing that is don, procedeth in proportion from either of their parts: I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for handle them ioyntlie in one treatis, as theie themselues do ioyn allwaie in one practis, &amp; that chefelie in respect of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, first mere, and then well. Whereof the first, which concern our mere being, be altogether naturall, tho principles to the last, by mean of education the latter which concern our well being, be mere artificiall but bilding vpon natur by waie of fundation, and proue so much the finer, where theie haue hir fauor, as either nothing at all, or but of small account, where she semeth to froun.</p>
               <p>Those abilities therefore belong to mens being, without the <note place="margin">VVhich be the abilities of our being, and which of our well being.</note> which theie could not once so much as liue, or bear the name of men in the naturall sense of their first humanitie: Those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to their well being, without the which tho theie maie liue and continew men, yet ar there extreme rude, and in dede no bodie, in the principall se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se of their best humanitie. Without the abilitie to receiue sustenance, &amp; to haue it tendered, when natur doth command it, a man cannot liue. Wherefor that abilitie &amp; such other like, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cern his mere being, tho by his so being he be but half a beast, which fedes, as wel as he doth, tho not with like change. Whithout the abilitie to conceiue and vnderstand, what is most semelie in everie circumstance, and to haue it fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to the most ciuill vse, a man maie liue tho exceding rude, and therefor that abilitie, and such other like concern his well being, whereby he is likest him, of whom he hath his being, and most sociable with them, among whom his being is.</p>
               <p>Now as I finde in natur both by the effects, which these a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities work, and by the places, wherein their ar bestowed, that she means vs verie much, and verie manifold good: so for the <note place="margin">That this Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth euerie particular abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in natur.</note> auancing of euerie of them to the same effects, which natur entendeth, I find also in this Elementarie, that it hath seuerall branches, wherewith to supply their seuerall turns, as it shalbe proued first in the abilities of our mere being, and then in those, which concern our best being. Whereby it shall also appear,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:13245:25"/>
that neither natur, nor we haue anie cause to complain: Natur, that she is but sklenderlie furthered, where she meaneth great matters: we, as missing of that by insufficiencie of train, which natur ment vs by varietie of gifts. And that therefor this Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie being so well appointed by so wise men, as the first deuisers thereof were, deserueth the embracing, which so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth naturs liberalitie in endoument, by sufficient varietie in artificiall principle.</p>
               <p>For the being of man, to maintain and encrease his bodie in euerie part and parcell thereof, and so afterward to sprede the <note place="margin">The first and primitiue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall powers in our bodie.</note> like to it self, in euerie kinde thoroughout, natur hath planted in our bodies, which is hir first subiect, a <hi>liuer,</hi> the first and formost part of hir frame, and our main, which <hi>liuer</hi> receiuing an eager humor from the <hi>milt,</hi> wherewith our appetite to meat is stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, fetcheth the same meat down from the mouth thorough the throte into the stomak, wherein it retaineth it, vntill tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough heat and humor, it be well digested, and perfitlie distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted by the veins thoroughout the hole bodie, the superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof being expelled, and the purest being reserued, to fede the bodie for fainting, to enlarge it for encrease: to make matter for succession and continuance of the kinde.</p>
               <p>Again besides the preseruing of our bodies by that norish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mean we haue also a perceiuing by outward sense to fele, <note place="margin">2</note> to hear, to se, to smell, to tast all sensible things, which qualities of the outward, being receiued in by the <hi>common sense,</hi> and examined by <hi>fantsie,</hi> ar deliuered to <hi>remembrance</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proue our great and onelie grounds vnto further know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Moreouer we haue also a certaine force to moue and stir either by commandment of passion, or by enticement of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, either by the waie of prosecuting for the vse of life, by pulse and breathing, or by waie of proceding to do somwhat else, by going, running, leaping and such like actions. To serue the turn of these two both <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>motion,</hi> natur hath plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our bodie a <hi>braine</hi> the prince of all our parts, which by spreding sinewes of all sorts, thoroughout all our parts, doth work all those effects, which either <hi>sense</hi> is sene in, or <hi>mouing</hi> perceiued by.</p>
               <p>Furthermore our soull hath in it a desire to obtain that, which <note place="margin">3</note>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:13245:25"/>
it holdeth for good, &amp; to auoid that, which it estemeth for euill: which desire worketh, either by quiet alluring, or by insole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming, and when the first motion thereof is once set on foot, either by calm persuasion, or by vehement heat, it hath a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stirring to attain vnto that in effect, which it conceiueth in desire. To satisfy this vse, natur hath placed in our bodie, as a liuer to tikle desire, so an hart to kindle heat: and as the sense is moued by the qualitie of his obiect, &amp; that motion serued by mean of sinewes: so appetite being stirred by his good or ill ob iect, hath both his prosecuting &amp; refusing supplied by sinewes.</p>
               <p>Last of all our soull hath in it an imperiall prerogatiue of vnderstanding beyond sense, of iudging by reason, of directing <note place="margin">4</note> by both, for deutie towards God for societie towards men, for conquest in affection, for purchace in knowledge, and such other things, whereby it furnisheth out all maner of vses in this our mortall life, and bewraieth in it self a more excellent being, then to continew still in this roming pilgrimage. To serue this so honorable a turn of vnderstanding, and reason, natur tho she haue no place worthie enough within this our base and simple bodie, wherein to bestow so great &amp; so statelie gests with their hole retinew, yet she doth what she ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; being her binger hirself assigneth them for lodging hir principall chamber, the verie closet of the brain, wherein she bestoweth euerie one of reasons vnderstanding friends, seuerallie ech one according vnto their seuerall degrees, and singular dignities. All those abilities in their first naturall kinde concern but the being of a rude man, but when there ar fashioned to their best by good education, theie procure the being of a perfit and an excellent man. For, to liue, to fede, to multiplie, to haue sense, to desire, to haue the vse of naturall and vnrefined reason. <note place="margin">The perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of these quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for our best being.</note> What great thing is it, tho it be somwhat more then brute beasts haue, if the other diuine qualities, which bild vpon these be not diligentlie followed? Which as theie rise out of these at the first, so theie honor them in the end, as much as the best frute can honor his first blossom, or as the cunningest work can grace the first ground, whereupon it is wrought.</p>
               <p>Besides that, theie shew themselues to be those most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ends, which natur ment first, tho she hirself made but a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:13245:26"/>
weak shew, and yet verie pliable for mans industrie to work on for his own commoditie. He that liueth not at all, cannot liue well, he that fedeth not at all, cannot fede moderatelie, he that multiplieth not, cannot multiply continentlie, he that hath no sense, cannot vse it soberlie: he that desireth not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not desire consideratlie: he that vseth no reason cannot vse it aduisedlie. But he that liueth, fedeth, multiplieth, hath sense, hath desire, hath reason, he hath withall, all those abilities, which natur can afford him, to vse them all well, food with moderation, encrease with continence, sense with sobernesse, desire with consideration, reason with aduise, and so will he vse them, if iudgement maie rule the last, to haue them well, as necessitie will the first, simplie to haue them. For as the first abilities work their naturall feats by commandment of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, so the latter abilities work their laudable feats by direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of reason, which reason as it is our difference in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with beasts, tho we vse it but meanlie: so is it our excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in comparison with men, if we vse it to the best.</p>
               <p>The abilities therefor of that reasonable and vnderstanding <note place="margin">How educatio and train work in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar abilities.</note> part in man being handled workmanlike, and applyed to their best by such deuises and means, as ar thought fittest to work such an effect, do order and direct the diet for food, &amp; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite for encrease, to the health of those parts which ar appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for them, and the help of the hole bodie, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of those parts. Theie fine the senses, and the instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts thereof to their best perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; their longest endura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Theie restrain desire to the rule of reason, and the aduise of foresight Theie so enrich the minde and the soull it self, as theie laie vp in the treasurre of remembrance, all arts, all forecast, all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, all wisedom, all vnderstanding, whereby either God is to be honored, or the world to be serued in honest &amp; wise sort, which so heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie a benefit is bego<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by education, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by vse, perfited with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinewance, which crouneth the hole work.</p>
               <p>Now all these abilities, whether of the first, and in most of most naturall sort for our being onelie, or of the second and <note place="margin">The applying of the artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all principles to the naturall abilities.</note> in most of most iudiciall sort, for our being well, I thinke to be perfitlie furthered by this same Elementarie, in the natur of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to further encrease: and that for euerie abilitie in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:13245:26"/>
natur to haue vs to be such, there is som principle in this Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie to make vs to be such.</p>
               <p>For those points, which most concern the bodie, &amp; the helth thereof, whether motiuelie in managing it: or morallie in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nering it, what is ouerlept either in exercise, for practis: or in precept, for behauior? Whereby whatsouer abilitie there is in the bodie, it is stirred and quikned to the verie best vse.</p>
               <p>As for the minde and the abilities thereof, which ar after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to be brought to som perfection of habit, there is none so blind, but he planelie seith the ground to be laid to all professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; all matters of iudgement, all the parts and powers of the soull to be made most fit for most exquisit perfection, when those principles be obtained, which this Elementarie doth set down, the things themselues tending to the auancement of cunning, and the matter of cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning to the furtherance of vertew.</p>
               <p>But who shall iudge of this, that this Elementarie laieth hold vpon all those naturall abilities? he shall be able to saie exceding much to it, which being but brought vp well in the ordinarie train shall but consider this book aduisedlie in euerie branch thereof. But he shall iudge best of it, who hath bene brought vp by it, and by his own sufficiencie shall both be able to pronounce himself, and to cause others pronounce, by seing him so sufficient, that there is no point for either actiuitie in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, or capacitie in minde, whereto natur makes him toward, but that nurtur sets him foreward.</p>
               <p>Is the bodie made by natur nimble to run, to ride, to swim, to fense, to do anie thing else, which beareth praise in that kinde for either profit or pleasur? And doth not the Elementarie help them all forward by precept and train? The hand, the ear, the eie be the greatest instruments, whereby the receiuing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerie of our learning, is chefelie executed. And doth not this Elementarie instruct the hand, to write, to draw, to plaie? The eie to read by letters, to discern by line, to iudge by both. The ear to call for voice, &amp; sound with proporcion for pleasur, with reason for wit? and generallie whatsoeuer gift natur hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon the bodie, to be brought furth or bettered by the mean of train, for anie profitable vse in our hole life, doth not this Elementarie both find it, and forese it? As for the qualities
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:13245:27"/>
of the minde, whether theie tuch vertewousnesse in liuing, or skilfulnesse in learning, as arts, sciences, professions, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer else, by whatsoeuer term or title else, do theie not euerie one most apparentlie procede from reading and writing, as from their naturall principles, the one for deliuerie, the other for receit? whether theie trauell in language for it self, wherein <hi>grammer, rhetorik logik,</hi> and their deriuatiues clame interest, or shew knowledge by language in anie other facultie. Where vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be contained in generall terms, all the parts of <hi>philosophie</hi> both morall and naturall, the thre professions <hi>diuinitie, law, physik,</hi> all the branches of them all, all the ofsprings of ech, whose instrument speche is. If the mathematiks be the end, or anie particular else, which clameth kinred of them, whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall end is to direct manuarie science, tho their translate vse be to whet a learned minde, can theie lak anie footing, where number, figur, motion and sound be practised in principle? where the mathematiks &amp; their frinds be thus induced, whose necessarie reason doth force their own place, can anie other facultie, whose but probable appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce doth entreat for a roum, but find how to enter? Whatsoeuer else concerneth either delite to comfort our weakenesse, or delitefull vse to serue our neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, with cunning of praise, or handling of art, all that is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sene either by drawing for the eie, or by musik for the ear. So that in my opinion, the fathers and founders of this Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, whereof I am but collector, tho as fauourable a collector, as so good a thing deserueth, haue vsed great foresight to laie such foundations therein, as maie both nusle vp all naturall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, while theie ar sprooting in train, and perfit them at full, when theie ar ripe for the reaping.</p>
               <p>For the multitude &amp; varietie of those principles, which I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point <note place="margin">Themultitude of principles.</note> the young scholers to deall with, that is confirmed euen by natur hirself, which making hir own abilities to be so manie, requireth as manie principles to bring them to perfection, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one helping forward his cosen and frind. And those wise me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also, which did both deuise them, and execute them in such a number, and of such varietie, bycaus theie wold not haue you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g wits to be ouerburdened with multitude vnwisely applyed, did help them in train thorough distinction in time: as the learned
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:13245:27"/>
                  <hi>Quintilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> doth shew in a particular discourse, where he exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this question, whether young childern be to learn diuerse things at one time or no. Where he concludeth that theie maie, as a thing of no truble, if it be well deuided, bycause the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the wits be, the better theie be fed with varietie: &amp; if theie be trubled somtime, or fail in somthing, yet it is with their mindes, as it is with their bodies, soon down and soon vp again, &amp; light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie without harm, if their nurses and trainers be redie at their hand. For the childern, which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theie be from their ouerseers must deall of themselues, ar by litle and litle to be committed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to learn to do that betimes, which theie must deall with euer after, yet while theie ar you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, &amp; hollie vnder charge, their falts com rather by negligence of such, as haue charge ouer them, then of their own selues, which cannot rule them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
               <p>If natur in som childern be not so pregna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as theie maie take the full benefit of this hole train, yet by applying it wiselie, there maie be som good don, euen in the heauiest wits, &amp; most vnapt bodies, tho nothing so much as in the verie quikkest. If anie pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t again finding the naturall defect in his childe do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear his pains, &amp; spare his purse, where he hopes for smal profit, he hath natur to warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him, which semeth eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it were direct lie to warn him, not to lose his labor, where she list not to fauor.</p>
               <p>Again if anie one wanting oportunitie cannot compas all, or hauing oportunitie will not medle withall, which education &amp; natur seme ioyntlie to promis, he hath no cause to blame either of them, whereof the one offered that, which he wold not vse, the other that, which he wold not take. But to knot vp this argument, me think it is plane, that seing natur offreth varietie of gifts, industrie ought to vse both hir ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds to take that, which is offered. Which diligence in taking seing this Eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tarie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, as it letteth nothing fall, which natur holdeth vp: so I take it therefor to be most absolut, in that it doth answer so frind lie a mother as natur is, and ioyns with hir in working.</p>

THe fourth prouf of a good Elementarie was, in place of hardnesse to plant facilitie, and to lighten the course of studie by making of it plane. For what thing is it but hardnesse alone which most appalleth young mens courages, and abateth their diligence, in a maner fraing them to go anie <note place="margin">That hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is a chefe hindrer of learning.</note> further, when theie are verie well minded, towards the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of sound, and substanciall knowledge? And what but hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is the chefe and originall cause, why so manie rest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with simple and superficiall skill, being vnwilling to toill themselues with the difficulties of studie, and that ear theie com to fele, that small learning will serue well enough to com by a great liuing? which might haue bene alledged for a verie great impediment to greater learning, if it had gone before the feling of hardnesse: but the course is this. Young men desire to get learning to liue by, and while theie are in place of learning, as in vniuersities, by cause there theie se learning in best credit, theie ar in dede desirous to be noted for learning, which when theie cannot com by, being chekt thorough hardnesse, in the matter of studie, as theie think, but in dede thorough weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in their first train, as I know, then theie deuise, how to turn that litle, which theie haue, to the best commoditie that theie can, and so in seking of preferment, theie ioyn great prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises with som simple learning, as their best mean to obtain greater liuing. Whereas in verie dede if difficultie had not cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them, theie wold haue ioyned worthinesse in themselues, with admiration in others, and so haue bene called by others, and not haue craued themselues. This hardnesse certainlie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by cause such students haue not bene brought vp in the knowledge of these Elements, which being well laid while children ar yet vnder the rod, and learn as it were more by rote then by reason, without feeling themselues, either much pains or anie profit, will cause an easie and a pleasant course in the further learning, when theie can iudge what theie do, tho theie did it not in doing.</p>
               <p>For childern as theie be still in doing, so theie know not <note place="margin">In what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and how this Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie expelleth ignorance.</note> what theie do, much lesse wherefor theie do, till reason do grow vnto som ripenesse in them. And therefor the matter of their train is such, as theie profit more by practis, then by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13245:28"/>
why, till theie fele the vse of reason, which teacheth them to know considerations and causes. The foresight for their well doing in the mean time remains in their parents, teachers, and frinds, who prouide so for them in youth, as theie maie praise them again, and praie for them in age. But when theie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues do grow to iudgement, hauing bene so brought vp, then theie do find what a great deall of good theie haue all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redie don, and how beneficiall their frinds haue bene vnto them, for helping them so much. Then theie se, where other not so trained do proue stark blind. Then make theie no bones, where euerie litle let, is a verie great log to anie of the other: then march theie one at pleasur, like soldiers of courage, whose waie is made plane by pioners sent before, where the other, which ar not so well prouided for, will rather cast awaie their armor, then wrastle with the difficulties of vnknown and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie passages.</p>
               <p>I cannot compare the foredeall by which childern ar at, their first education to anie thing better, then to the pictur of <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians victo ries applied vnto childern.</note> son to <hi>Conon</hi> the Athenian captaine, and his victories, as som his ill willers did cause them, and him to be painted out, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth. For theie made <hi>Timotheus</hi> himself lying fast a slepe, and fortun bringing cuntries, towns, and victories vnto him in a net, meaning thereby; that he became such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror; more by hap then by cunning, more by his enemies wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, then by his own wit. Childern which be well trained in their youth be like to sleping <hi>Timotheus,</hi> preferred by their frinds, ear themselues can perceiue it: and their frinds like to fortun, which furnish them so well, ear themselues can discern, what good is don vnto them. But when theie com to years, and ar once awaked, then with open eies theie behold, their frinds care, their own conquest, and fortun fishing for them, naie Gods prouidence verie carefull for them, by the ministerie of parents, masters, and frinds, while theie were fast a slepe, and could not themselues, either help themselues, or iudge right of their helpers. If this Elementarie then be the great benefit of foreseing frinds, the great conquest of frindlie fortun, naie the great munificence of a louing God, who wold haue his litle ones go thorough stitch where ignorance makes hirs stik, is the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13245:29"/>
thing of small regard, which hath so great patrons? is it of small importance, which foileth such a fo, as ignorance is?</p>
               <p>But to go more particuiarlie, is the compassing of tungs hard? sure so it is, to one of no foretrain, that neuer learned grammer, that neuer red writer, that neuer proued his stile, that neuer vsed the tung. Be the mathematiks hard? sure so there be to one not prepared, that neuer did number, that neuer drew line, that neuer knew note, that neuer markt motion. Be the abilities of the bodie laborious and hard? sure that theie be, where no exercise goeth before, where the ioynts be stif, where it is painfull to proue, what the bodie can do, being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer put to it. But where foretrain is, there case will follow, where the bodie is prepared, the purgation worketh: where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise leadeth, actiuitie will follow, both in those and the rest. Theie that haue these helps well grounded in their youth, as I said before, maie go forward with ease, and stand verie fast, where other must nedes stumble, which haue no such help. Which stumblers, tho by their own exceding great, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for exceding commendable trauell, theie oftimes in the end excell those, which were better brought vp then theie were, yet the train was well appointed, whatsoeuer negligence dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed the effect in those, which hauing wings to fly vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed scant to flutter: and the blame resteth in them, which might haue don well and wold not, the praise in them, which did so well, tho theie wrastled sore for it.</p>
               <p>Therefor the tender minde of the young infant being first embrewed with these principles as the best, for the first liquor: and then furnished with their store, as the most, for all helps, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie must nedes follow in all that doth succede.</p>

So sharp an eie hath he to se further, whose sight is made steddie by such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiue. He that in his Elementarie train can read and write well, he that handling the pen or pencill can vse them both wel by nunber, and with line: and dealing with musik can iudge well of sounds, &amp; handle instruments right, what can he think hard in his after studie, if studie be his choice? Naie what shall he find hard, tho handicraft be his end? for he maie well haue all these principles, yea and the <hi>mathematiks</hi> to, and yet aspire no higher, then the plane workman: bycause those helps be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to such peple, tho for som quiknesse to wit, and constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in prouf, theie be vsed for book learning. Now if he be entred into language, so far as grammer goeth, which is the tip of the Elementarie, will there be question of difficultie? Then all hardnesse being remoued in the Elementarie, before the learner can discern, what a foredeall he is at, and facilitie being won, where the student might haue stumbled, if his waie had not bene planed, what a pleasant feild hath studie to ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge in, where nothing can hinder, if loytring do no harm? Which loytring and negligence is allwaie excepted, as a thing that thwarteth euen the best deuises, &amp; commonlie cuts of all good successe, in euen the fairest attempts, tho it fre the thing from blame, whose furtherance it stoppeth, and cast the falt on him, whose hinderance it helpeth. For the thing remaineth one, tho the partie haue it not, the partie is the worse, bycause he hath not the thing, and so much the worse, bycause he is worse then him self, thorough his own negligence, which might haue passed himself, thorough his own diligence. <note place="margin">VVhat a toill good students ar driuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to for want of their first train</note>

And tho theie do learn them, yet that their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is nothing so sound, as vnder a teacher, bycause no one mans labor, in anie argument whatsoeuer, much lesse in these Elementarie principles, is comparable to the help that coms by a teacher, or a cunning reader. For is it not an incredible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, to haue the verie flour and pith of another mans studie, naie of all the best writers, concerning that matter wherein your trauell lyeth, to be vttered vnto you in order, by one that hath digested it in time, beside his painfulnesse in studie, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it from the best, and most allowed writers? I will dwell no longer vpon this point, bycause I haue handled it in my book of Positions, where I shew what benefit an vniuersitie receiueth by excellent readers. To my present purpose therefor. While either tediousnesse by the waie doth terrifie good students, or vnskilfulnesse in the end giueth idlenesse a fair color, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temn where it knoweth not, the most of our best learning which we ought to haue (tho som fresh heads do think themselues to know enough and enough, when theie can saie more then enough, how small enough so euer theie haue) is either suppressed by difficultie or oppressed by ignorance. I do not here tuch the want of reward, as being a foren tho a forcible let, to the furtherance of learning, but onelie such stops, as be within the parties, &amp; students themselues, which were in good waie to proue excellentlie sufficient, if such lets were remoued, and themselues in loue with learning euen for learnings sake, tho theie lookt for no dowrie. Now difficultie is a fair pretence to diuert one from knowledge, whom either much trauell will toill sore, or verie litle will soon tire: and ignorance wilbe bold to set light by such things, as it doth not se, bycause it is stark blind.</p>
               <p>Wherefor I must nedes commend this Elementarie, as most profitable for redinesse without difficultie in the rest of our stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, &amp; the onelie mean to make a pleasant passage, where such students, as be not acquainted therewith, ar either miserablie tormented ear that theie can passe at all, or quite discomfited

The other sort is such, as haue bene brought vp either in none of these, or not in all, or but verie vnperfitlie in whatsoeuer, and be them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues verie willing to learn: Of whom I ask whether theie find not themselues either quite discouraged in their honest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, if theie haue had no train at all or not more then half lame, iftheie haue had it but by halues: or not both lame and discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to, being vnperfitlie, and therefor ill trained: and whether theie do not striue miserablie against the stream, when theie seke to go forward without these helps.</p>

               <p>THe fist praise of this Eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tarie was, bycause it is the best mean to auoid generall ignorance, the mother to misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and to com by generall knowledge, which is the cause of allowance. A circumstance of great mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of learning, as it is generallie also in all other dealings. For that which is misliked, is still vnder foot, and that which is allowed is allwaie aloft. Now all misliking commeth either <note place="margin">Misliking ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth either vp on desert, or vpon opinion miscaried.</note> vpon desert, when the thing is such, as for verie naughtinesse it is to be misliked, or vpon opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when error in the partie misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that thing, which is of it self well worthie the liking.</p>
               <p>Opinion falls in error either thorough mere ignorance, when he that misliketh, knoweth not what the thing is, which he doth mislike, or else thorough preiudice, when he that misliketh doth know the thing well, but is so wedded vnto, naie rather so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched with his own fantsie, which it self is seduced by som foren allurement, as he will rather mislike against knowledge, then withstand against fantsie. <note place="margin">That the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of learning is not to be misliked vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on desert.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As for the matter of learning, wherein our studie consisteth, and whereunto these principles make a redie entrance, our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie vse both bred it at the first, and contineweth it still, in verie good credit. And what man is so simple, but he knoweth it to be such, as deserueth good liking: both for the seruice that it doth vs, which is the naturall end of it, and for the proprietie in handling, which is an artificiall mean to it? Wherefore if with out cause it be otherwise charged by anie color of blame either
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13245:32"/>
in all or in part, opinion is the charger, which opinion in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is either blinded by ignorance, or corrupted by fantsie, the verie worst branch of anie kinde of error, not minding to ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and still waxing worse, as both the two be verie great enemies to all right iudgement. If anie kinde of writer for vaunt, not for want of wit, or vpon som particular cause else, do practis his pen or whet his tung against the good in learning, as <hi>Lucian</hi> doth in most places of hole works, as <hi>Agrippa</hi> doth in his vane book of vanities in science, theie cannot wound learning, tho theie strike at the wants, which be in som professors. Bycause tho the two qualities, one of good note, and to be well vsed, as learning and knowledge, the other of ill note, and neuer but naught, as vice and misdemeanor, be in one &amp; the same partie, yet as the good qualitie cannot transubstantiate the euill, so can not the euill change the others substance, tho it foullie disfigur the form thereof, which is so much the worse, bycause of such a companion, whom the qualified partie, as subiect vnto both hath matched so togither, being in natur most different, thov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited in the person, as a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon harbour to two great enemies, whereof the one seketh the subuersion of the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Syphax</hi> the king of Barbarie, as <hi>Liuie</hi> reporteth, lodged both <hi>Scipio</hi> &amp; <hi>Hasdrubal</hi> in one palace, being two mortall enemies, and euen at that time in most cruell war, <hi>Scipio</hi> for Rome, <hi>Has<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal</hi> for Carthage. But what came of it? the king being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded by <hi>Scipioes</hi> presence, &amp; his graue speche, began to falter in his amitie with his old frinds, the peple of Carthage, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding so forward in that his mutabilitie, at the last chused the worst. For being the first mouer to haue the Romanes armie passe ouer into <hi>Asrik,</hi> he wrought the ouerthrow to Carthage &amp; reuolting again from the Romanes frindship to the peple of Carthage he ouerthrew himself, &amp; lost kingdom &amp; all. Such a thing it is to harbor two enemies, &amp; to geue ear to both, where the infirmitie of our natur, either cannot well iudge of them, or if it can, yet is lightlie conquered by the worst of the two, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it promis the more honorable gest, to ioyn with the better. If learning and vice do lodge in one room, the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vice will lightlie preuaill against the allegation of learning, and enforce the learned to do against his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13245:33"/>
&amp; yet learning is still good, tho the professor go awrie, and tho cauilling wits do translate crimes from the offender to the innocent. But such fellowes bewraie their own folie, euen in ieast to turn their heles against their own helps, and by their fond doing to stir som fond heads, to mislike that in earnest, which theie ment but in ieast. This doing of both <hi>Lucian</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and anie such else, which ieast so with good things, to the shaking of their credit, so much as lyeth in them, maie be iustlie comprised vnder error in opinion not erroniouslie but wantonlie seduced. But what if that wanton seduction be the worst of all other, and worthie to be punished? whereas of the other two, the one is moned in ignorance, the other but bla med in error.</p>
               <p>But to return to my former argument, what greater enemies <note place="margin">Ignorance &amp; preiudice the greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likers of sound learning.</note> hath learning euen in natur, then preiudice &amp; ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? whence is there more ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shew of implacable hostilitie to knowledge, then from preiudice and ignorance? Ignorance knoweth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and therefore is no friend to ane vnknown good: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice knoweth and will not, and therefor is a great fo to a not fauored good. Ignorance yet in part deserueth som excuse for all hir disfrindship, bycause infirmitie is hir falt, not bolste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ill will, and the worst is hir own, ane ordinarie case, where euen enimitie pityeth. But preiudice is a poison to anie common weall, so far as it stretcheth, which being at the first infected with the incurable disease of a cankred and a corrupt opinion gathered by confluence of sundrie ill humors will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it self yeild to a right iudgement, nor will suffer anie other, where hir persuasion can take place. For by yeilding hir self she feareth the emparing of hir misconceiued estimation, and by suffring other to yeild, she feareth the encrease of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges frinds; whereby hir self shall com in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger to be oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, both with truth of matter, and number of patrons. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for she opposeth hir self, she bendeth all hir eloquence, she mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp all passages, so much as she maie, both by persuasion and entreatie, that none shall iudge right, which will hear hir speak, &amp; regard hir autoritie, but shall take that musik to sound the swetest, which commeth from hir, tho she be but a mear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, which by offring of delite endeuoreth to destroie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:13245:33"/>
Ignorance is violent and like vnto a lion, when it encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth <note place="margin">Ignorance &amp; hir grounds.</note> with knowledge, still in furie without feling, in rage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reason, and riseth of two causes, either infirmitie in natur, or neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in labor. Whereof the one could not, the other wold <note place="margin">Negligence.</note> not conceiue at the first, when knowledge was in dealing. Both enemies to knowledge, but neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the greater, which either fearing disdain for hir first refusall, or enuying him which lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth where she left, will not seme to fauor, where she once for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook, and stomaketh him, which embraceth hir leauings, awra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hir malice in shew vpon knowledge, in dede vpon folie. Which folie being lodged within hir own breast, beside that negligent ignorance, vseth to call in a dangerous opinion, the contempt of that good, which she ought to commend, rather then she will by change of opinion and altring hir hew bewraie hir own error, which all men se sauing she that should: being at defiance with knowledge, not by simplicitie of natur, which offered, but by naughtinesse of choice, which refused the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof. <note place="margin">Infirmitie.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now naturall infirmitie the other and more gentle mean of ignorance wold perhaps, naie wold in dede change hir blind opinion, if she could once change hir ingenerate heauinesse: she wold reuerence learning, if she might se hir beawtie, where with to be rauished, being enemie vnto hir, not of malice but of weaknesse.</p>
               <p>That which I speake of infirmitie in natur, and negligence in choice is to be entended by such of both sorts, as continew in their worst without remorse of euill, or recourse to good. For if anie man whether naturallie dull or negligentlie rude in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per years vpon better aduise do change his currant: the naturall weak to loue that in others, which he hath not himself: the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentlie rude to wish that in himself, which he seith to be in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he then becoms frind to iudgement, and will rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinew in suspense, then pronounce rashlie, till he be thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie enformed. <note place="margin">Preiudice &amp; hir grounds.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But that same peruerse preiudice is a sutle fo to knowledge like a manieheaded <hi>hydra,</hi> and as the venim of his autoritie is gathered of diuerse grounds, so the sting of his poison infecteth diuerse waies. The person himself which is thus caried awaie
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13245:34"/>
by a peuish opinion is commonlie no heauie head, but either superficiallie learned, and yet loth to seme so: or enuiouslie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and still carping at his better: or ambitiouslie giuen and presumeth vpon countenance: or he measureth knowledge by gain, and setteth naught by ante more, that himself shall nede, to compas that he coueteth, where a litle cunning will compas much more then reason thinks enough in corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mindes. All which four causes mean learning glad to make great shew, enuious affection glancing at good things: vane presumption plaing the peicok: couetous desire carelesse of great cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning, as theie corrupt the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, so theie maintain preiudice, while the partie so corrupted will seeke by all means to continew his credit: so much the more a deadlie enemie to knowledge, bycause preiudice must giue place, if knowledge com in place, and therefor that it maie not com, he emploieth all his forces, by all cunning, and all well colored shifts to shoulder it out: a professed so, and so much the shrewder, bycause he supplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth knowledge vnder the opinion of knowledge.</p>
               <p>Now considering these so firie and so furious enemies to knowledge, ignorance and preiudice with their hole families <note place="margin">How this Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> be the causes why, that the best things &amp; matters of most cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be oftimes misliked, where theie be vnknown; either sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie or shrewdlie, doth not this Elementarie a great pleasure to knowledge, by planting skill in all, to auoid misliking in anie? that euerie part of knowledge maie be so estemed of, as it iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stlie deserues? and ech of these mislikers maie be so entreated, as o becom frinds of foes?</p>
               <p>Misliking was said to com either of deseruing ill, whereof learning is cleare, bycause it deserues well, or else by error, from which kinde of misliking anie sound knowledge will verie hard lie scape. For ignorance supported by infirmitie in natur, and negligence in labor, and preiudice maintained by four craftie companions, superficiall learning, enuious affection, vainglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conceit, and couetous desire will still haue a fling at hir. How be it if naturall infirmitie be helpt by diligent education, it will either proue a frind or no bitter fo, for that good which it hath goten. If negligence it self be so entreated in the training, as it will be content to take pains to learn, it will fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour

at the last, tho it frown at the first. If preiudice in generall maie compas and kepe that credit, with sound and substantiall knowlege, which it aspireth vnto by superficiall shew and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister means, were not he worse then mad, that wold hang vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the shadow, where he might haue the bodie, being still in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger to haue his vnskilfulnesse discouered at euerie encounter with a learneder man? at euerie dealing with anie such matter, as will bewraie a smatterer? By help of this Elementarie will this substance be goten, that the shew shall not nede. For this kinde of training vp in youth doth crepe on to knowlege, ear the feling of labor can take anie place, and encrocheth so sore vpon blind ignorance, as it cannot be painfull, no not to negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent heads, being so well set forward, to passe quite thorough without either difficultie or danger, if he set no man to work but good will alone. Which being don will not misliking be ba nished, and liking be cald home? will not ignorance stowp when knowlege is in state? when the end is well wrought, and by right means, which was sought for before by a verie wrong waie? I shall not nede to repeat here again, to what kinde of knowlege euerie principle helpeth. For in that theie expell ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance euerie where, that serues for this purpos, as, that theie help knowlege euerie where, it is a thing proued all redie.

               <p>And (not to medle here at this time with anie fore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one or the other part of gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer) doth it not I praie you, <note place="margin">That gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer pleasureth vs euen for the fining of our own spech alone.</note> shew vs Englishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a verie great pleasur, if it help to the fining of our own English tung, &amp; thereby to make it to be of such ac count, as other tungs be, which be therefor of best account, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause theie be so fined? whereby we our selues also shall seme not to be barbarous, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by mean of our tung, seing fair speche is som parcell of praise, and a great argument of a well ciuilled peple. But it pleasureth vs a great deall more, as the course of our studie now lyeth, for helping of vs to foren language, by such good helps, as it ioyneth to it self, bysides the bare Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of a plane rule. For a mere grammarian is but a poor mean to do anie thing well, euen where he professeth most: as <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian</hi> saw verie well, which for the latin tung, and the gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian therein said, that it is was one thing to speak like a gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian, and another thing to speak like a latinist, as if grammer latin were but latin by dispensation: &amp; he onelie hit the right in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:13245:35"/>
euerie tung, which could both waie the rules, and pease the force of speche according to that grace, which euerie tung hath. But forasmuch as grammer is vsed for one degre in help to fore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> language, it furthereth vs verie much that waie, bycause all our learning being fet from the foren, as regestred in their tungs, if we want the knowledge of the one, we want the hope of the other.</p>
               <p>When learning, and knowlege came first to light, those men, which were the autors thereof, vttered their mindes in that same speche, which theie then vsed, when theie bred the things. And as theie neded no foren tung for the matter bred at home, so had theie no other vse of anie grammer, but onelie that, which endeuoured to fine their naturall speche at home. But after that the same their deuises, being first set out in their own tungs, were afterward sought for by foren students, to encrease their learning, and to enrich their cuntrie with foren wares, the foren students were then driuen to vse the assistence of gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in the second kinde, bycause theie could not vnderstand those things, which were writen in a foren tung, without the knowlege of the tung it self.</p>
               <p>In the primitiue grammer children being framed so, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire now; went straight waie from the Elementarie to matter of learning, and the mathematicall sciences, which ar so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, bycause in dede the whole scholers learning (which scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in greke ar called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) consisted in them, as in the first degree of right studie. For whatsoeuer goeth before them in right studie, is nothing else at all, but mere Elementatie: and whatsoeuer goeth before them in wrong studie, as it is wrested in natur, so it worketh no great wonder. But in the second vse of grammer, we are enforced of necessitie, after the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie howsoeuer hudled vp, and how simple soeuer, to deall with the tungs, ear we passe to anie matter, which help of tungs, tho it be most necessarie for the thing, as our studie is now platted, yet it hindreth vs in time a thing of great price, naie it hindreth vs in knowlege a thing of more price. For by the lingring about language, we are remoued and kept bak one degre further from sound knowlege, which is so great a degre, being in our best learning time, while we be vnder masters and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:13245:36"/>
readers, of whom we maie learn far better, then of our selues, if that regard be had to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in choice, which elswhere I haue wish ed were caresullie had. But I will not deall anie further with gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer in this place, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering that hole argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t will follow this Elementaric, and hath so manie branches, as we deall with tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs: neither yet will I procede with this discourse, which offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it self here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the let of studie, by the studie of tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs, which tungs seme to be the onelie mean to all our studie, as we vse it at this daie, bycause I haue handled that argument alreadie in the preface to my learned and curteous reader, besides that I haue tuched it in my book of Positions. For this time this maie suffise, that this our Elementarie is verie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall vnto vs, by the mean of grammer also, which is the honor and perfection of the Elementarie in both hir naturs, but chefelie in the course of our learning now, whereby we ar entred into language, and withall into knowledge, while our own tung remaineth but poor, and is kept verie low thorough som reasonable superstition, not to haue learning in it.</p>
               <p>But here to conclude the generall vse of this present Eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, which hath bene thus far my particular argument, I must nedes continew my first opinion, which was and is this, that in the matter of learning, a good Elementarie is more then the half, bycause it is the first: &amp; that in the first it is mere the best, bycause the wisest men, the greatest reasons, the best gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned common wealls did so pronounce of it, the one by their pen, the other by their practis.</p>

               <p>I Will set down the purtrait of the hole Elementarie, and how I purpos to deall therein, before I medle with anie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular principle, that my reader seing my hole plat in so small a form, and no parcell thereof but within his compas, maie the sooner perceiue the drift of my labor, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie frame his hope of the thing, and the good like to com by it, &amp; staie his memorie the better, by the method &amp; order which I promis to kepe in it. I deuide the consideration of the hole E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementarie
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:13245:36"/>
into two parts, whereof the first concerneth the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and substance thereof, and how I entend to deall therein: the second concerneth the maner and form of teaching it, and how I wish that euerie circumstance were handled, that both the teacher maie deliuer planelie with order, and the learner receiue quiklie with profit. Wherefor the first part of this my <note place="margin">The matter of the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie and the maner of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching it.</note> generall plat shall shew the matter of the Elementarie, and the handling thereof: the second shall shew the maner of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and the circumstances therein.</p>
               <p>The matter of the hole Elementarie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisting in fiue points: <hi>reading, writing, drawing, singing,</hi> &amp; <hi>plaing,</hi> I will so handle them <note place="margin">The matter of the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie.</note> in rew, as, I marshall them in order, and begin first at <hi>reading.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by cause I take vpon me in this Elementarie, besides som frindship to secretaries for the pen, and to correctors for the print, to direct such peple, as teach childern to read and write English, and the <hi>reading</hi> must nedes be such, as the writing leads vnto, thererfor, befor I medle with anie particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, to direct the Reader, I will thoroughlie rip vp the hole <note place="margin">The plat and method of the English orto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafie.</note> certaintie of our English writing, so far furth and with such as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance, as probabilitie can make me, bycause it is a thing both proper to my argument, and profitable to my cuntrie. For our naturall tung being as beneficiall vnto vs for our nedesull deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie, as anie other is to the peple which vse it: &amp; hauing as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and as fair obseruations in it, as anie other hath: and being as readie to yeild to anie rule of Art, as anie other is: why should I not take som pains, to find out the right writing of ours, as other cuntrimen haue don, to find the like in theirs? &amp; so much the rather, bycause it is pretended, that the writing thereof is meruellous vncertain, and scant to be recouered from extreme confusion, without som change of as great extremitie? I mean therefor so to deall in it, as I maie wipe awaie that opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vncertaintie for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusion, or impossibilitie for directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that both the naturall English maie haue wherein to rest, &amp; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous stanger maie haue whereby to learn. For the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce whereof, and mine own better direction, I will first examin those means, whereby other tungs of most sacred antiquitie haue bene brought to Art and form of discipline for their right writing, to the end that by following their waie, I maie hit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

their right, and at the least by their president deuise the like to theirs, where the vse of our tung, &amp; the propertie of our dialect will not yeild flat to theirs. That don I will set all the varietie of our now writing, &amp; the vncertaine force of all our letters in as much certaintie, as anie writing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be, by these seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> precepts, <hi>Ge nerall rule,</hi> which concerneth the propertie and vse of ech letter: <note place="margin">1.</note>

In all these seuen I will so examin the particularities of our tung, as either nothing shall seme strange at all, or if anie thing do seme, yet it shall not seme so strange, but that either the self same, or the verie like vnto it, or the more strange then it is shal appear to be in those things, which ar more familiar vnto vs for extraordinarie learning, then required of vs for our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie vse. And forasmuch as the eie will help manie to write right by a sene president, which either cannot vnderstand, or cannot entend to vnderstand the reason of a rule, therefor in the end of this treatis for right writing, I purpos to set down a generall table of most English words, by waie of president, to help such plane peple, as cannot entend the vnderstanding of a rule, which requireth both time and conceit in perceiuing; but can easilie run to a generall table, which is readier to their hand. By the which table I shall also confirm the right of my rules, that theie hold thoroughout, &amp; by multitude of exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples help som maim in precepts. Thus much for the right writing of our English tung, which maie seme for a preface to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>Reading,</hi> as the matter of the one is the maker of the <note place="margin">The plat and method of the principle of reading.</note> other.</p>
               <p>In <hi>reading</hi> I will kepe this order, bycause the treatis of right
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13245:37"/>
writing doth pretend som help to the right in <hi>reading,</hi> I will first giue certain rules, to be obserued in <hi>reading</hi> and spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, according to those precepts, which I gaue in writing. And forsomuch as the goodnesse and vertew of matter is most fit for the young childe in the first seasoning of his tender minde: and the matter it self is spred into two branches, consonant vnto the main distinction of the ten commandements, either for religion towards God, and right opinion in faith: or for ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie towards men, and right iudgement in behauior: I will therefor cast the matter of <hi>reading</hi> so, as it shall answer at full both to religion in faith, and to ciuilitie in frindship. Wherefor to laie the first ground of learning, which is to learn to read, in religion towards God, and in religion it self to obserue the law and ordinances of my cuntrie, I will after the A b c, set down the ordinarie catechism set furth by my prince, and the state of my cuntrie, with all such appendants for graces, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther praiers, as shall se me most pertinent to the Elementarie traning of a christian child. Therevnto I will ioyn som other pretie short treatis concerning the same religious argument being of good importance for those years to vnderstand: and as warilie appointed, as God shall appoint me. Then will I set down som other well pikt discourse, which shall concern mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall behauior, and right opinions that waie. In all which I will haue both a speciall, &amp; a continuall regard to these four points in the childe, his <hi>memorie,</hi> his <hi>delite,</hi> his <hi>capacitie,</hi> and his <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For his <hi>memorie</hi> I will forese, that as he must practis it euen <note place="margin">1.</note> from the first, so he maie also practis it euen vpon the best, both for pleasur in learning, and for profit after learning.</p>
               <p>For his <hi>delite,</hi> which is no mean allurement to his learning <note place="margin">2.</note> well, I will be as carefull that the matter which he shall read, maie be so fit for his years, &amp; so plane to his wit, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is at schooll, he maie desire to go forward in so comfortable an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and when he commeth home, he maie take great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur to be telling of his parents, what pretie petie things he doth find in his book, and that the parents also maie haue no lesse delite to hear their litle one speak: In so much as either of them shall rather seke to preuent the other, the childe to be telling
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:13245:38"/>
somwhat, and the parent to be asking somwhat, then to be so slow, as to tarie for the mouing.</p>
               <p>For his <hi>capacitie</hi> I will so prouide, that the matter which he shall learn, maie be so easie to vnderstand, and the phrase which <note place="margin">3.</note> I will vse, so euident to perceiue, as both the one and the other shall cause nothing but courage.</p>
               <p>For his <hi>forwarding</hi> I mean to be somwhat curious, that there be such consideration and choice for syllabs words and senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <note place="margin">4.</note> and for all their accidentarie notes, as there shall want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which maie seme worth the wishing, for the full help of either spelling trew, or reading sure: that what childe soeuer can read them well, maie read anie thing else well, if the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding master will kepe that order in his teaching, which I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to giue him in my precept, and do his infant no harm by hasting him on to fast, &amp; by measuring his forwardnesse not by his own knowlege, but by fantsie of his frinds. If oportunitie serue me &amp; cause require that labor, I will pen the same things in the latin tung also, to satisfie som peple, which wilbe best pleased so, as in verie dede sauing for the ortografie, which is proper to our tung, there is nothing in the Elementarie, but it maie well be communicated with anie foren nation, which must likewise prouide for their peculiar ortografie, as I do for ours, if theie mean to vse the like Elementarie to this.</p>
               <p>The treatis of <hi>reading</hi> being thus ended, then will I on to the <note place="margin">The plat and method of the principle for writing.</note> principle of <hi>writing,</hi> wherein I shall nede neither tobe curious, ne yet long, by cause the hole ortografie, which concerneth the right writing of our tung, will both help the writing master, &amp; ease my labor in that behalf. Howbeit whatsoeuer shal be nede full to that end besides the rules, which ar giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ortografie (as there be manie pretie notes, for the writers profession, both to frame the childes hand right, to form &amp; ioyn letters well, &amp; to fit those instruments, which he must nedes vse in the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thereof) all that I will set furth most planelie, and as short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, for both the English and the latin letter. I ioyn the latin letter with the English, by cause the time to learn the latin tung is next in order after the Elementarie, and the childes hand is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be acquainted with the latin charact, which is nothing so combersom as the English charact is, if it be not far more easie.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:13245:38"/>
And tho we vse to learn som other tungs afterward, as well as latin, which haue their peculiar characts, as the <hi>greke</hi> and <hi>hebrew,</hi> yet he that can write English and latin well, will learn those hands both soon, and of himself. So that the Elementarie writing shall not nede to truble it self anie further in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie time of learning, then with those two tungs, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> and the <hi>latin.</hi> If other ordinarie trades do require mo hands, as for the vse of som court, and such other like, the writing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster maie help him self, with the particular form of the had, that is sought for, as I will help him with rules in anie writing at all, of whatsoeuer form, tho I make choice but of two onelie. But here methink I find honest mens diligence verie sore mismat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, with an intricate waie and most wearisom to themselues. For theie spend their hole time about setting of copies, whereas fewer copies, and more loking to his hand wold help the childe more, as the number of copies occupying the hole time, is mere enemie to amendment, and direction of the hand. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for, bycause I like that best, set down two tables of the <hi>English</hi> &amp; the <hi>latin</hi> tung, with the letters ioynings, &amp; what so else shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be necessarie for one perpetuall copie. The argument whereof shalbe such for choice, as it shall deserue the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring, which the oft writing will easilie procure, &amp; the warinesse shalbe such for certaintie of letter, for varietie of form, for all kindes of ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as he, that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> write &amp; resemble those two copies well, shal think nothing strange, that doth concern writing. Somuch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence shalbe vsed in the choice of a few lines, which must pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t an habit. Further because it shalbe good for the writing master, to haue tables in store, tho he occupie them not allwaie, I will set him down two other tables, of the like choice for the <hi>greke</hi> and <hi>hebrew.</hi> And if I shall think it conuenient to translate my English reading arguments into latin, I will also help the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie latin master, with all such notes, as maie teach to read latin, that in great ignorance of the tung, yet he shall not light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie fail, either in tuning or timing euen of vnknown words. Why I do like these tables better, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the multitude of copies, I will shew more at large in the particular handling of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting principle, bycause in that point I am somwhat contrarie to manie of those, which teach children to write, whose commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13245:39"/>
I hinder not, tho I help their scholers more, whose labor I lessen not, tho I releace it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> copies. This don I must teach <note place="margin">The plat, and method for the principle of drawing.</note> how to <hi>draw.</hi> Which <hi>drawing</hi> bycauseit is not so euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, nor so generallie receiued, as <hi>writing</hi> &amp; <hi>reading</hi> be, I will therefor proue in a pretie short discourse both how profitable it is, &amp; how it deserueth the learning, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for profit sake, besides manie petie plesurs. Then bycause <hi>drawing</hi> vseth both nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber &amp; figur, wherewithall to work, I will cull out so much nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of <hi>Arithmetik</hi> the mistresse of nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, &amp; so much figuring out of <hi>Geometrie</hi> the ladie of figurs, as shall serue fit for an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie principle to the childes drawing, without either hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to fraie him, or le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth to tire him.

The training vp in <hi>musik</hi> as in all other faculties, hath a speciall eie to these thre points: The childe himself, that is to learn: the matter it self, which he is to learn: and the instument it self, whereon he is to learn. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I will deall so for the first and last, that is for the childe and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13245:39"/>
the instrument, as neither of them shall lak, whatsoeuer is nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; either for framing of the childes voice, or for the righting of his finger, or for the prikking of his lessons, or for the the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For in the voice there is a right pitch, that it be neither ouer nor vnder strained, but delicatelie brought to hir best ground, both to kepe out long &amp; to rise or fall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in dew compas, and so to becom tunable, with regard to helth, and pleasant to hear. And in the fingring also, there is a regard to be had, both that the childe strike so, as he do not shufle, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther spoill anie sound, and that his finger run so both sure and sightiie, as it cumber not it self with enta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gled deliuerie. Where of the first commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie falleth out by to much hast, in the young learner, who is euer longing vntill be a leauing: the second falt coms of the master himself, who doth not consider the naturall dexteritie, and sequele in the ioynts, which being vsed right, &amp; in a naturall consequence, procureth the finger a nimblenesse with ease, and helpeth the deliuerie to readinesse without pain, as the vntoward fingring must nedes bring in corruption, tho corrupt vse do not vse to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plain. For the matter of <hi>musik,</hi> which the childe is to learn, I will set it down how, and by what degres &amp; in what lessons, a boy that is to be brought vp to sing, maie &amp; ought to procede by ordinarie asce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, from the first term of Art, &amp; the first note in sound, vntill he shalbe able without anie ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or anie great missing, to sing his part in prikso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, either himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, which is his first in rudenesse, or with som co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie, which is his best in practis. For I take so much to be enough for an Eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tarie institution, which saluteth but the facultie, tho it perfit the princple, &amp; I refer the residew for setting &amp; disca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to enciease of cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning, which dailie will grow on, &amp; to further years, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hole bodie of <hi>musik</hi> wil com, &amp; craue place. And yet bycause the childe must still mount somwhat that waie, I will set him down so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rules of setting &amp; disca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which will make him better able to iudge of singing being a setter himself, as in the tung, he that v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to write, shal best iudge of a writer. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the <hi>virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls</hi> &amp; the <hi>lute,</hi> which two instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, I haue therfor chosen, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the full <hi>musik</hi> which is vttered by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the varietie of <note place="margin">The virginals and lute.</note> fingring, which is shewed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I will also set down so manie chosen lessons for either of them, as shall bring the young lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13245:40"/>
to plaie reasonable well on them both, tho not at the first sight, whether by the ear, or by the book, allwaie prouided that priksong go before plaing. All which lessons both for instume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; voice, I will not onelie name, and set the learner ouer to get them, where he can, in the writen song books set furth by <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sik</hi> masters, but I will cause them all to be prikt and printed in the same principle of <hi>musik,</hi> that both the reader maie iudge of them, and the scholer learn by them. Which thing as well as all the rest, that I haue vndertaken to perform in this Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, I hope by Gods help to bring to such effect thorough co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the best practicioners in our time, and the counsell of the best learned writers in anie time, in euerie of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, besides mine own trauell, and som not negligent experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as I shall discharge my promis, and content my good cuntrimen. What thing soeuer else besides this that I haue named, shall seme to be nedefull for the better opening of anie particular point, I will se to it there, tho I saie nothing of it here. This is the so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of my Eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tarie platform for the matter thereof.</p>
               <p>For the maner of teaching and consideration of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in executing thereof, which was the second part of my <note place="margin">The plat, and method for the maner of teaching and training, accor ding to this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementarie.</note> generall plat in my first diuision, &amp; hath the same place, if not a greater in the particular performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of anie executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (for what auaileth precept, if it be not performed? or what performance is it, that procedeth not in order?) I entend to do thus. Bycause all these things tho neuer so good of themselues, tho neuer so commended by writers, tho neuer so well liked of parents, yet maie miscarie in the handling, if theie be not well followed with all dew circumstances, I will therefor set down a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar direction for euerie principle, when to begin, and in what degre of ripenesse to ioyn with another, and that so as neither to soon mar, nor to much confound: how to handle the young wit: how to ioyn exercise of the bodie with these principles for the mind: what method in teaching them maie seme to be best: what pretie deuises must be vsed to cause the childe of himself shew what he can do, and what metle there is in him, with all such considerations as be naturallie incident to such an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the young learner maie both thank me for his helth, and think well of me for his learning, as a willing instrument
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13245:40"/>
to do him som good, if it shall please God, the giuer of good, to blesse mine endeuor. Thus much for my generall plat. In the performance whereof, tho I do somtimes enterlace dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, that be not for children, either to conceiue or cun, yet theie be not impertinent to the matter, neither improper to me, somtime to open some further point necessarie to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos: somtime to enstruct the masters, which might either mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiue me, or misorder the teaching: somtimes euen to se how our English tung will plaie with these arguments, which ar thought so vncouth, and not expressible in our tung. But what so euer shal be necessarie for the childes trauell alone, I will so appoint that, as it shall stand alone, and maie be printed alone, the larger discourses seruing for more years, and such as will vse them. For that I take to be the best method in penning anie thing, wherof the student is to commit part to memorie, &amp; to studie the other part, to make the remembring part, pithie, short, and apart, and in the other to handle the rest at large, &amp; yet no more then nedefull. Which two points of largenesse, without to much for more years, &amp; shortnesse without to litle for lesse years, ar in this Elementarie to be speciallie conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Bycause the Eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tarie master is not commonlie the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningest, and the Elementarie scholer is vnder twelue years. For a childe thus trained, shall learn the tung sooner, and do more betwene twelue and sixtene, then from seuen to seuentene if he begin without this traine. But the ortografie calls for me.</p>

               <head>CAP. XII. The method which the learned tungs vsed in the finding out of their own right writing.</head>
               <p>I Begin the Elementarie at the argument of right writing, <note place="margin">VVhie I do begin at the right writing of English.</note> because reading, which is the first Elementarie principle, must be directed both in precept and practis, thereafter as the thing, which is to be red, is writen or printed. And consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the right writing of our tung is yet in question: som, but those to forward, esteming it quite vnproper: som, but those to bakward, thinking it perfit enough: som, &amp; those the soundest iudging it to be in most well appointed, tho in particulars to be
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13245:41"/>
helpt: is it not a verie necessarie labor to set the writing certain, that the reading maie be sure? Now in examining the right of our writing, I begin at that method, which the learned tungs v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <note place="margin">VVhy in orto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafie I begin at this method</note> to find out the like right in their own writing, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was in like question, that ours now is, for these two reasons. First by following their president, and marking that course, which was <note place="margin">1</note> vsed in them, I shall both haue good warrant against anie such, as shall mislike of my currant, and dream of new deuises: and withall, I shall be abler to work the like in English, by vsing the like precept, in the like obseruation. For all tungs kepe one, and the same rule for their main, tho euerie one haue his propertie in part, which particular propertie, as it is noted in the best tungs, (which ar so termed, bycause they are so este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, for the prerogatiue of that vse, which we find to be in them) so it is warranted in ours, euen by president fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. So that hereby I shall not seme, I hope, to anie aduised reader, but to haue vsed a verie good mean, for the finding out of that, which is to be decided in the right of our writing: and if anie other, either of peuishnesse, or of ignorance, shall mislike my proceding, the honor of my president, being rightlie followed, (which I hope to perform) will both defend me, and condemn them, if it cannot content them. The second cause, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me to begin at this method, is, thereby to answere all those <note place="margin">2</note> obiections, which charge our writing with either insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or confusion: and also to examin by it, as by a sure tuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, all the other supplements, which haue bene deuised heretofore, to help our writing, by either altering of the old characts, or deuising of som new, or encreasing of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. For if the other so estemed tungs, when theie were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to, and charged with these same supposed wants, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with our writing is now burdened, did deliuer them selues by other means, then either by altering, or by innouating, or by encreasing their characts, and made the stuf of their own cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, to be stear of their direction, as this method will shew, why should we desire to seke foren means, and impertinent to our tung, by deuise of new forge, hauing such a pattern to perfit our writing, by a so well warranted president? That the <note place="margin">That the first tungs were once rude.</note> finest tung, was once in filth, the verie course of natur pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:13245:41"/>
from weaknesse, to strength from imperfection to perfitnesse, from a mean degré, to a main dignitie, doth giue vs to behold, yea tho neither <hi>Marcus Uarro,</hi> nor yet <hi>Quintilian,</hi> nor anie such as <hi>Priscian</hi> did shew the like in the Latin, and by example in that one, confirmed the like in all: which I will not rip vp, as a thing of more vaunt for reading, then of help to writing, where one generall reason, proued by one particular, of perpetuall sequele, like a geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall demonstration, will serue well enough.</p>
               <p>Well then, what meanes did those languages vse, which haue won the opinion, that theie be right writen, tó com <note place="margin">The originall &amp; secondarie fining of tungs</note> by that right, which wrought that opinion? There be two considerations in speche, concerning the waie, which hath bene vsed in the fining thereof. For if we look into the first degré of fining, before which, no tung at all had anie beaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the pen, we ar to consider, how the verie first tung did procede from hir first rudenesse, to hir best perfection: Again if we look into the next degré, wherein the like fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse ensewed in other tungs, by following the like course to that which the first refiners took, then we ar to consider, how other secondarie languages haue proined and pikt them selues, by following that method, which the primitiue did vse.</p>
               <p>But by cause I desire to be warranted by them both, that is, both following the first finers, &amp; the second presidentiaries, in this my course, (which no man hath yet kept in this argument, as I can perceice, tho diuerse write ortografies,) and my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is, that it best besemes a scholer, to procede by Art in anie recouerie, from the clawes of ignorance: Therefor I will rip vp, euen from the verie root, how and by what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées, the verie first tung, doth seme to com by that her perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in writing, &amp; what order was taken to continew that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, euer sence the time that anie tung is perfited. Allwaies reseruing so much to his consideration, which entendeth the fining of anie speche, as concerneth the propertie of anie particular tung, which particularitie will not be compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vnder generall precept with anie other tung, but must be directed by priuat obseruation, and particular exception
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:13245:42"/>
against the common rule. And yet euen this so particular a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance is not omitted in the generall method of the first fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and thereby it is commended vnto vs by waie of transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which com in the third degré, and fine after the first, by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of the midle. Now in this long waie from the first soilth of extreme rudenesse, to the last neatnesse of most cunning, I <note place="margin">The 3. seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ouer writing.</note> will apoint thre rests, euerie one naturallie succeding the other, where the readers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit maie light &amp; go on foot, if it be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with riding, I do not saie with reading. The first is, while <note place="margin">1.</note> the sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d alone bare the swaie in writing. The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is, while co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <note place="margin">2.</note> in vse did transport the autoritie, from sound alone, to <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, custom,</hi> and <hi>sound</hi> ioyntlie. The third, which presentlie rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneth, is, while that <hi>reason</hi> &amp; <hi>custom,</hi> do assure their own ioynt <note place="margin">3</note> gouernment with <hi>sound,</hi> by the mean of Art. For <hi>sound</hi> like a restrained not banished <hi>Tarquinius</hi> desiring to be restored to his first and sole monarchie, and finding som, but no more then sounding fauorers, did seke to make a tumult in the scriueners prouince, euer after that, <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>custom</hi> were ioynd with him in comission.</p>
               <p>I will therefor first deal with that regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in writing, which <note place="margin">The gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of right writing vnder the autoritie of found alone</note> was vnder sound, when euerie thing was writen according to the sound, tho that kind of gouernment be long ago worn out.</p>
               <p>I should begin to high in seking out the ground of right writing, (as he that fetcht the batle of <hi>Troie</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Ledaes</hi> two egs, or as she that was angrie with felling the first tre, bycause she took vnkindnesse with him that came by ship, to that place where she did dwell) If I should make enquirie either who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised <note place="margin">That it is an idle enquirie to seke either who wrote first, or who deuised letters first.</note> letters first, or who wrote first, a thing as vncertain to be known, as fruteles if it were known. For <hi>Herodotus</hi> in his <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Diodorus,</hi> in his librarie, <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his preparatiue, <hi>Plinie</hi> in his historie, <hi>Flauius Iosephus</hi> in his antiquities of <hi>Iurie, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius Halicarnasseus</hi> in his antiquities of <hi>Rome, Coelius Rhodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> in his antiquitie of reading, <hi>Polydorus Uirgilius</hi> in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentors of things, and manie seuerall writers mo, in as manie seuerall places mo, seking to learn out either the first fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of the generall charact, or the first deuisor of the particular, for par ticular nations, ar as new to seke, when they haue sought all, as theie were at first, before theie sought anie. For what certaintie
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:13245:42"/>
can there be had of so old a thing? or what profit can rise by som one mans name, if one were the founder, as it cannot be. Who tho he be honored for the frute of his inuention, yet doth his autoritie small good, wher the matter in question is to be confirmed, not by the inuentors credit, who dwells we know not where, but by the vsers profit, which euerie one feles. And therefor as theie, whosoeuer deuised the thing first (for it was no one mans inuention, nor of anie one age) did a maruellous good turn to all their posteritie: so we, which be their posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ar to think well of the inuentors, and to iudge thus of their inuentions: that verie necessitie was the foundresse of letters, and of all writing, as it hath bene onelie the generall breder of all such things, as our life is better by, when nede and want en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced mens wits, to seke for such helps. For the tung conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing speche no further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to those, which were within hearing, and the necessitie of conueiance oftimes falling out betwene som persons that were further of: a deuice was made to serue the eie a far of, by the mean of letters, as natur did satisfie the ear at hand by benefit of speche. For the deliuerie of learning by the pen to posteritie, was not the first cause that found out letters, but an excellent vse perceiued to be in them to serue for perpetuitie, a great while after theie had bene found by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie. The letters being thus found out, to serue a nedefull turn took the force of expressing euerie distinct <hi>sound</hi> in voice, <note place="margin">The sound &amp; force of letters by natur vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunntarie.</note> not by them selues or anie vertew in their form (for what like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or what affinitie hath the form of anie letter in his own natur, to answer the force or sound in mans voice?) but onelie by consent of those men, which first inuented them, and the pretie vse therof perceaued by those, which first did receiue them. Whereby the peple that vsed them first, agréed with those, that found them first, that such a sound in the voice should be resembled by such a signe to the eie: and that such a signe in the eie should be so returned to the ear, as the aspecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble figur of such an audible <hi>sound:</hi> whereunto these subscribed their names, and set to their seals the daie and year, when their consent past.</p>
               <p>Herevpon in the first writing, the <hi>sound</hi> alone did lead the <note place="margin">VVhy the sound led the pen at first.</note> pen, and euerie word was writen with those letters, which the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13245:43"/>
                  <hi>sound</hi> did commaund, bycause the letters were inuented, to expresse sounds. Then for the right in writing, who was soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain and iudge, but <hi>sound</hi> alone? who gaue sentence of pen, ink, and paper, but <hi>sound</hi> alone? then what was sound in the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down, but that which was awarded by <hi>sound</hi> alone? Then <note place="margin">Sounds height</note> euerie one of the peple, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euerie one tho most vnskilfull, was partaker in autoritie, &amp; <hi>sound</hi> fellowes in that sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And good reason why, that <hi>sound</hi> should rule alone, &amp; all those haue a stroke, in the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of <hi>found,</hi> whosoeuer were able but euen to make a sound. You deuised all this to expresse me, why should not I then iudge, when I were expressed, seing, you your self told me, that such a litle note in sight, was to resemble such a thing in <hi>sound?</hi> In those daies, all those arguments, which cleaue so sore vnto the prerogatiue of <hi>sound,</hi> &amp; plead so for his interest, in setting down of letters, were most estémed of, as most agreable to the time, &amp; most officious to the state. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward when <hi>sound</hi> vpon great cause, was deposed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, as no fit person to rule the pen alone, and had others ioyned with him in the same commission, of as good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as he, tho not to deall without him, then their credit was nothing so absolut, tho reasonable good still, as anie of <hi>sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds</hi> ad uised fauorers, maie both well perceiue, and be well content with, if he will but mark the restraint of <hi>sounds</hi> autoritie, &amp; the causes why, &amp; withall consider, that all opinions which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cern his sole autoritie, &amp; tend to that end, as theie were of most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, while he was in that ruf, ar now but verie weak, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is in the wain, &amp; ar to be qualified, according to that state, where <hi>sound</hi> is now ranged.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:13245:43"/>
ripe deliberation theie presented them selues before <hi>sound,</hi> vsing these, rather persuasions, then compulsions, to qualify his humor.</p>
               <p>That it wold please him, to take their speche in good part, <note place="margin">The reasons and grounds why sound was displaced of his sole go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.</note> considering it tuched not their priuat, but the generall good of the hole prouince of writing. That he wold call those reasons to his remembrance, which moued them at the first, to giue him alone the autoritie ouer the pen, as one whom theie then thought, to be most fit for such a gouernment, naie onelie most fit to gouern alone. That theie now perceiued, not anie defect in him, who vsed that like a prince, which was his peculiar, by their own commission: but an ouersight in them selues, who vnaduisedlie ouercharged him, with such an estate, as he could not weild alone, without his great dishonor, whereof theie were as tender, as of their own soules. That their request there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for vnto him, was; to praie &amp; beseche him, not to esteme more of his own priuat honor, then of the hole prouinces good. That theie might with his good leaue, amend their own error, which tho it concerned his person, yet should it not tuch his credit, the falt being theirs in their first choice.</p>
               <p>Theie paused a litle while, before theie vttered the verie main cause of this their motion, for that theie spyed <hi>sound</hi> to begin to change colors, and half readie to swond. For the fellow is passionat, in autoritie tyrannous, in aw timorous.</p>
               <p>Howbeit seing the common good did vrge them to speche, theie went on, &amp; told him in plane terms, that he must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to refer himself to order, and so much the rather, bycause their meaning was not to seke either his depriuation, or his resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation, but that it wold please him to qualify his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and to vse the assistence of a further councell, which theie ment to ioyn with him, a thing of great frute, &amp; of good example in manie such cases, where euen great potentates, acd considerat princes, for the generall weall of their naturall states, (his being but voluntarie, and of their election) were verie well content, vpon humble sute made to them, to admit such a councell, and to vse them in affaires. That the reasons which moued them to make this sute, and might also moue him, to admit the same were of great importance: That bycause letters were first

found onelie to expresse him, therefor theie had giuen him one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and alone, the whole gouernment therein, and were well contented therewith, vntill such time, as theie had espied, not his misgouernment, but their own mischoice: that the bare &amp; primitiue inuentions, being but rude, and accordinglie ruled, and experience now in time, growing to more finesse, why should theie not yeild to that in finesse, vpon better cause, wherevnto theie did yeild in rudenesse vpon mere nede? That no man hauing anie sense in the right of writing, which expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience had commended, wold yeild the direction to sound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, which altereth still, and is neuer like to it self, as either the partie pronouncer is of ignorance or knowledg: or the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that pronounce, be of clear or stop deliuerie: or as the ear it self is of iudgement to discern. That considering these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which praie for reformance, and the letter it self, which desireth som assurance of her own vse, it might stand with his good pleasur, to admit to his counsell, two graue and great personages, which theie had long thought on, thorough whose assistence he might the better gouern the pen prouince.</p>
               <p>Bycause theie praised the parties so much, he desired their names. Theie answered <hi>Reason,</hi> to consider what wilbe most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréable vpon cause, and <hi>Custom</hi> to confirm that by experience and prouf, which reason should like best, and yet neither to do anie thing, without conference with sound.</p>
               <p>The personages pleased him for their own worthinesse, but the self same thing, which recommended them to him for their own valur, did fraie him to like them, for his own dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. For is not either <hi>reason</hi> or <hi>custom,</hi> if it please them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire, more like to rule the pen, then sound, said he to him self? Howbeit after that theie had charged his conscience, with all those reasons in one throng, which theie had vsed particularlie before, that it were no dishonor to yeild a litle vnto them, which had giuen him his hole rule: that it were no reason, but theie might haue leaue, to amend their own error, in ouerchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him, being their falt and his ease: That tho theie semed to empare his estate, yet theie did not seke to defraud him of his own: That the wrongs don to writing, which theie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented vnto him were matters worth redresse: That the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:13245:44"/>
which theie appointed were honorable, and honest: that the common benefit of the hole writing prouince did ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestlie sew for it, wherevnto theie were verie well assured, that so good a father, as he was, to that poor estate, wold neuer be vnwilling but rather voluntarilie condiscend, without anie request, as being half dishonored, in that he taried the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, but that he knew not of the greiues. After that theie had pressed him so near, tho he were verie loth, being once a sole monarch, to becom half priuate by admitting of controullers, as he thought, rather then counsellers, as theie ment, yet percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that their power was such, as theie might enforce him to that, which theie praied him to graunt, if he should stand in terms with them, he was content to yeild, tho with som shew ofmiscontentment in his verie countenance, and to allow of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Custom</hi> as his fellow gouerners in the right of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p>For in verie dede concerning the autoritie of these mouers, wise and learned peple, what so euer theie lend ignorance to plaie with for a time, theie reserue to themselues both iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and autoritie, wherewith to controull, when theie se want of skill plaie the fooll to much, as in this same quarel for the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of sounds to presumptuous rule, theie had verie great reason. For as in faces, tho euerie man naturallie haue two eies, two ears, one nose, one mouth, and so furth, yet there is all waie such diuersitie in countenances, as anie two men maie easilie be discerned, tho theie be as like as the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> princes, and brethern were, of whom <hi>Tullie</hi> speaketh: so likewise in the voice, tho in euerie one it passe thorough, by one mouth, one throte, one tung, one fense of tethe, and so furth, yet is it as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in euerie one, euen for giuing the sound, by reason of som diuersitie in the vocall instruments, as the faces be different in resembling like form, by som euident distinction, in the naturall purtrait. Which diuersitie tho it hinder not the deliuerie of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie mans minde, yet is it to vncertain to rule euerie mans pen in setting down of letters.</p>
               <p>And again, what reason had it to follow euerie mans ear, as a master scriuener, and to leaue euerie mans pen to his own sound, where such difference was, as theie could not agré, when
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:13245:45"/>
where the right was, euerie one laing clame to it? &amp; why not my ear best? Again why should ignorance in anie respect be taken for a gide in a case of knowledge? bycause of their voices? that were to popular, where the argument is singular. Bycause of their wills? that were to willfull, where wisdom should war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. And therefor if anie multitude, tho of neuer so few, deserue to be followed, theie onelie were, which could both speak best, and giue best reason why. But that kinde of peple were to few at the first, to find anie place against a popular gouernment, where the ear led the ear, and why shall <hi>sound</hi> giue ouer his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, seing letters were deuised to expresse sound in euerie one of vs, and not the conceit of these, and those few goodlie wise fellowes? And yet when corn was once in prouf, acorns grew out of place, tho a iollie mastie meat in a hoggish world. For naturallie the first serues the turn, till the finer and better do com in presence. And as somthing gat place worthilie of no thing, so must that somthing again, giue place to his better: As <hi>sound</hi> did somthing to expell rudenesse, tho it maie not bend it self, to kepe out finesse.</p>
               <p>Hereupon wise men wold stand no longer to that diuersitie in writing, which necessarilie did follow, when euerie one did spell so, as the instruments of his voice did fashion his sound, or as his cunning gaue him, or as his ear could discern. All which means be full of varietie, and neuer one in all, as it doth appear by hole nations, which cannot sound som letters, that som other can, as the <hi>Ephramite</hi> in scriptur, which could not sound the first letter in <hi>Shibboleth</hi> being in hebrew the same chract with the first in <hi>Sibboleth:</hi> or as the witnesse in <hi>Tullie,</hi> which by propertie of his cuntrie, could not sound the first let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in <hi>Fundanius,</hi> against whom he cam.</p>
               <p>Vpon these miscontentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and by consent of those, which could iudge, and vtter best, theie grew to a certain, and a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable <hi>custom,</hi> or else to saie truth, to a customarie <hi>reason,</hi> which theie held for a law, not vnaduisedle hit on, by error and time, but aduisedlie resolued on, by iudgement and skill. Neither yet, (which had ben contrarie to their promis) depriued theie <hi>sound</hi> of all his rialtie, which was dictatorlike, before, but theie ioyned <hi>reason</hi> with him, &amp; <hi>custom</hi> to, to begin then in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:13245:45"/>
right, and not in corruption after, as a <hi>Caesar</hi> and a <hi>Pompeie,</hi> to be his colleges in a triumuirate. From that time forward <hi>sound</hi> could do much, but nothing so much, as he could do before, being verie manie times, verie iustlie ouerruled by his conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat companions, and fellowes in office. Thus ended the monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of <hi>sound</hi> alone.</p>
               <p>We ar now com to that regiment in writing, which was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">The gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of right writing vnder the autoritie of, sound, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and custo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> 
                  <hi>sound, reason</hi> and <hi>custom</hi> ioyntlie togither, and proceded in this sort. <hi>Reason</hi> as he is in reason the principall director, of all best doings, and not writing alone, so he began to plaie the master, but wiselie withall, and with great modestie. For consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the disposition of his two companions, first of <hi>sound,</hi> which the letters were to expresse of dewtie, as therfor deuised: then of <hi>custom,</hi> which was to confirm, and make the waie to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall allowa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he established this for a generall law in the pro uince of writing. That as the first founders, and deuisers of the letters, vsed their own libertie, in the assigning of such a charact in the eie, to such a sound in the voice, which assignation was mere voluntarie, &amp; of the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders choice: so it should be lawful for the said founders, and their posteritie, according as the neces sitie of their vse, &amp; the dispatch in their pen did seme to require it, either to encrease the number of letters, if the insufficiencie in them did seme not to answer the varietie in <hi>sound,</hi> or to apply one and the same letter to diuerse vses, if it might be don with som pretie distinction, to auoid multitude of characts, as we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply words which be within nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, to things which be without: &amp; generallie like naturall and chefe lords in a tenancie at mere will, to make their own nede the leuell of all letters, of all wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, of all speaking, to chop, to change, to alter, to transport, to enlarge, to lessen, to make, to mar, to begin, to end, to giue autoritie to this, to take it from that, as themselues should think good. This decre being penned by <hi>reason,</hi> both <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>custom</hi> did presentlie allow: <hi>sound</hi> bycause there was no remedie, tho his hart longed still for his former Monarchie, which was now inth'Eclipse: <hi>Custom,</hi> bycause that did serue his turn best. For if necessarie vse, and dispatch in the pen, might haue autoritie, which was giuen them in law, by consent of those men, which were successors to them, who
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:13245:46"/>
first founded the letter, which men were of the learneddest and wisest sort, then were <hi>Custom</hi> in dede, hauing <hi>reason</hi> to frind, &amp; <hi>sound</hi> no fo, a verie great prince in the hole prouince of both writing and speaking. And good reason why. For <hi>Custom</hi> is not that which men do or speak commonlie or most, vpon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer <note place="margin">VVhat custom is naturallie.</note> occasion, but onelie that, which is grounded at the first, vpon the best and fittest reason, and is therefor to be vsed, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the fittest. Which if it take place according to the first appointment, then is <hi>custom</hi> in his right, if not, then abuse in dede doth seme to vsurp vpon <hi>custom</hi> in name. For in Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships and maners is that custom, which the tenants do vse vpon their own surmise, or but that onelie, which the first Lord gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, vpon som speciall cause, and his posteritie confirms, vpon the like respect, either to their auncetor or to the thing? So that I take <hi>custom</hi> to bild vpon the cause, and not to make the cause.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>reason</hi> had brought both sound to this order, and <hi>custom</hi> to this autoritie, then was there nothing admitted in writing, but that onelie, which was subsigned by all their threé hands. If the <hi>sound</hi> alone did serue, yet <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>custom</hi> must nedes confirm <hi>sound:</hi> if <hi>reason</hi> must take place, both <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>custom</hi> must nedes approue <hi>reason:</hi> if <hi>custom</hi> wold be credited, he might not passe, onelesse both <hi>sound</hi> did sooth him, &amp; <hi>reason</hi> did ratifie him.</p>
               <p>For the better continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this wise triumuirate, ech of the <note place="margin">The retinew belonging to the triumui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in their gouernment of the pen.

Who still had an eie to sound, and set down that letter, which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thereunto, onelesse reason and custom had put in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueat, that in such a case the commission must be altered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> again took into his seruice, <hi>obseruation</hi> and <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison:</hi>

                  <hi>Obseruation</hi> to mark what were fairest in sense, what were readiest in pen, what where currantest in vse: <hi>Comparison</hi> to confer that, which he allowed in one, with that proportion,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:13245:46"/>
which he found in another, that the hole might be sutable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Custom</hi> besides that he made verie much of both <hi>sound</hi> and <note place="margin">Customs reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new.</note> 
                  <hi>reasons</hi> retinew, as his verie good frinds, whereby he was come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to generall practis, of himself &amp; for himself, he entertained <hi>warinesse,</hi> to be still like himself, and tho he altered vpon cause, as <hi>reason</hi> should enform him, yet to behaue himself so, as he might easilie be discerned from corruption in vse, which was his naturall enemie, and was alwaie bakt by the ignorant mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as <hi>custom</hi> it self was by those, that were of skill, both at his first planting, and thoroughout his performance. So had right <hi>sound,</hi> missounding to fo, so had right reason, a slight shew of apparence to aduersarie, which still caried the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker branes, but could neuer moue, either iudgement or cunning.</p>
               <p>During this compound gouernment of these thre, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">The effect of this triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uirat.</note> of all our precepts, that belong to writing, did first grow to strength, then were rules grounded, then were exceptions laid, when <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>custom</hi> perceiued cause why. But none of all these were yet commended to Art, and set down in writing, but fleting in the memorie, and obseruation of writers, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing sufficient matter to furnish an institution, and the bodie of an Art, tho not yet in method, which cam next in place, &amp; ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it self with the other thre vpon this occasion:</p>
               <p>All this time, while <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>custom</hi> gouerned the pen, as <note place="margin">The occasion why Art was called to aide.</note> well as <hi>sound, sounds</hi> malcontented frinds did neuer rest, but all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie sought means to supplant the two other, euer bussing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ignorant ears that of <hi>sounds</hi> autoritie, and his right to his own deliuerie: and the same errors, which troubled the pen, while <hi>sound</hi> alone was the setter down, began to crepe in again, and cause a new truble, in so much as all the ignoranter sort were clear of opinion that the verie sternesse of <hi>sound</hi> was onelie to be accepted without all exception, tho those of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and wisdom, which had both first set vp <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>custom,</hi> as companions to <hi>sound,</hi> and still continewed in the same minde, could verie well discern vsurpation from enheritance, and right from wrong.</p>
               <p>Wherefor <hi>reason</hi> finding by this creping error both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be iniuried by senslesse time, and his good <hi>custom</hi> to be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:13245:47"/>
sore assailed by counterfeat corruption, perceiued the falt to be for want of a good notarie, and a strong obligation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to set that in euerlasting autoritie, by right rule and trew writing, which he and <hi>custom</hi> both, by the consent of <hi>sound,</hi> had continewed in vse, tho not put down in writing, which wold euer be in danger of continuall reuolt, from the best to the worst, by the vncertaintie of time, and the eluishnesse of error, oneless it were set in writing, and the conditions subscribed by all their consents, for a perpetuall euidence against the repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. For that is the difference, betwene a reasonable <hi>custom</hi> and an artificiall method, that the first doth the thing for the second to assure, and the second assureth, by obseruing of the first.</p>
               <p>While nothing was set down in writing, <hi>sound</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices were in hope of som recouerie, which hope was cut of, when the writings were made, and the conditions set certain. The notarie to cut of all these controuersies, and to brede a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall quietnesse in writing, was Art, which gathering al those roming rules, that <hi>custom</hi> had beaten out, into one bodie, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed them so in writing, as euerie one knew his own limits, <hi>reason</hi> his, <hi>custom</hi> his, <hi>sound</hi> his. Now when <hi>reason, custom</hi> and <hi>sound</hi> were brought into order, and driuen to certaintie by the mean of Art, and artificiall method, then began the third the last and the best assurance in writing.</p>
               <p>Art being hirself in place perceiued the direction of anie hole tung to be verie infinite and hard, naie to be scant possible in <note place="margin">The gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of right writing vnder Art.</note> generall, considering the diuerse properties that the thre ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, <hi>reason, custom,</hi> and <hi>sound</hi> haue, which alter still with time. For what peple can be sure of his own tung anie long while? doth not speche alter somtime to the finer, if the state where it is vsed, continew it self, and grow to better countenance, for either great learning, or other dealing, which vse to proin a tung? And doth it not somtime change to the more corrupt, if the state where it is vsed, do chance to be ouerthrown, and a master tung comming in as conqueror, command both the peple, and the peples speche to? Vpon this considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what an infinit thing it were to chuse out such a subiect, as is so vncertain, Art took hirself to som one period in the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:13245:47"/>
tung, of most and best account, and therefor fittest to be made a pattern for others to follow, and pleasantest for hir self to trauell and toill in. Vpon which period she did bestow all those notes, which she did perceiue by obseruation (which is secretarie to <hi>reason)</hi> to be in the common vse of speche, and pen, either clear with <hi>sound,</hi> or sutable to <hi>reason,</hi> or liked in <hi>custom,</hi> but still bakt by them all.</p>
               <p>Such a period in the Greke tung was that time, when <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes</hi> liued, and that learned race of the father philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers: such a period in the Latin tung, was that time, when <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi> liued, and those of that age: Such a period in the English tung I take this to be in our daies, for both the pen and the speche.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Art</hi> chusing such a period in the primatiue tung, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all the stuf gathered into notes, wherewith to set vp hir hole frame, and bilding of method, distributed them so, as there was not anie one thing necessarie for right writing, but she had it in writing, sauing som particulars, which will be still vnrulie, and make fresh matter for an other period in speche: tho that, which is now made so artificiall and sure, com neuer in danger of anie alteration, but be still held for a president to others, as most perfit in it self. For a tung once enrolled by the benefit of Art, and grown to good credit, is thereby first setled it self in such assurance, as the right thereof can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, the contrarie to right wold be soon espied, howsoeuer it wrangle: then is it made a common example to other languages, which haue stuf for such a method, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be fined, whereby to fine them.</p>
               <p>This course kept the first tung that euer was fined, from the first inuention of anie letter, which was least in act, but greatest in power, vntill corruption slilie goten in, but wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie perceiued did cause a reformation. Which reformation grew again to corruption in natur of a relapse, bycause tho it were soundlie made, yet was it not well armed with sufficient suretie against the festuring euill of error &amp; corruption. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for when it felt the want of such an assurance, it praied aid of Art, which like a beaten lawyer, handled the matter so, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13245:48"/>
with such a forecast in the penning of his books, as euerie of them, which had anie interest were taught to know what was their own. Other tungs beside the first refined, marking this currant applied the same to their own seuerall writing, and were verie glad with great thanks, to vse the benefit of those mens labor, which wrastled with the difficulties, of <hi>sound, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, corruption,</hi> and the residew of that ill humored peple.</p>
               <p>This originall president in the first, and translated patern in the rest, I mean to follow in the finding out of our right En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish writing, which whether it will proue to be fashioned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinglie, and framed like the patern, it shall then appear whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the thing it self, shall com furth in hir own naturall hew, tho in artificiall habit.</p>
               <p>I haue not vsed anie autors name in this discourse either to confirm, or to confute by credit of autoritie. For anie man all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of anie mean learning, maie quiklie espy, that these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <note place="margin">VVhy I vse no autoritie to proue this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</note> ar not without autors. For can <hi>reason, custo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, art, sound, error, corruption,</hi> and such other qualities, as plaie their parts in this so ordinate a plat, lak testimonie of writers being so much writen of? But I did onelie seke to satisfie nede and to polish no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To conclude and knit vp the argument, this method and this order vsed the first tung, that euer was brought to anie right in writing, by the help whereof vnder the direction of Art, all those tungs which we now call learned, ar com to that certaintie, which we se them now in, thorough precept and rule. The same help will I vse in my particular method.</p>
               <p>Which before I deall with, I must examin two principall points in our tung whereof one is, whether our tung haue <note place="margin">Of the artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall stuf in our tung. Of the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections laid vnto our tung.</note> stuf in it for art to bild on, bycause I said, that Art delt where she found matter, sufficient for hir trauell: The other is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our writing be iustlie chalenged for those infirmities wherewith it is charged in this our time, bycause I said that this period in our time, semeth to be the perfitest period in our English tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, &amp; that our custom hath alredie beaten out his own rules redie for the method, &amp; frame of Art. Which two points ar necessarilie to be considered. For if there be either no matter for Art in extreme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusion: or if our custo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be not yet ripe to be reduced vnto rule, then that perfit period in our tung is not yet
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:13245:48"/>
com, &amp; I haue set vpon this argument, while it is yet to grene. Howbeit, I hope it will not proue to timelie, and therefor I will first shew, that there is in our tung, great and sufficient stuf for Art: then that there is no such infirmitie in our writing, as is pretended, but that our custom is grown fit to receaue this artificiall frame, and that by this method, which I haue laid down, without anie foren help, and with those rules onelie, which ar, and maie be gathered out of our own ordinarie wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>

               <p>For som considering the great difficultie, which theie found to be in the writing thereof, euerie letter almost being deputed to manie, and seuerall, naie to manie and wellnigh contrarie sounds and vses, euerie word almost either wanting let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for his necessarie sound, or hauing some more then neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie <note place="margin">1 Despare.</note> requireth, began to despare in the midst of such a confusio, euer to find out anie sure direction, whereon to ground Art, and to set it certain. And what if either theie did not seke, or did not know how to seke, in right form of Art, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pòsing method? But whether difficultie in the thing, or infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie in the searchers, gaue cause thereunto, the parties them selues gaue ouer the thing, as in a desperat case, and by not medling thorough despare, theie helped not the right. <note place="margin">2 Hope.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Again som others bearing a good affection to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall tung, and resolued to burst thorough the midst of all these difficulties, which offered such resiste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as theie misliked
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:13245:49"/>
the confusion, wherewith the other were afraid, so theie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised a new mean, wherein theie laid their hope, to bring the thing about. Wherevpon som of them being of great place and good learning, set furth in print particular treatises of that argument, with these their new conceaued means, how we ought to write, and so to write right. But their good hope by reason of their strange mean, had the same euent, that the others despare had, by their either misconceauing the thing at first, or their diffidence at the last. Wherein the parties them selues no dout deserue some praise, and thanks to, of vs and our cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie in both these extremities of hope and despare, tho theie helped not the thing, which theie went about, but in common apparence, did som what hinder it rather. For both he, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spared in the end, took great pains, before diffidence caused him giue ouer to despare: and he that did hope by his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise to supply the generall wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, was not verie idle both in brain, to deuise, and in hand to deliuer the thing, which he deuised. Which their trauell in the thing, and desire to do good, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue great thanks, tho that waie which theie took, did not take effect.</p>
               <p>The causes why theie took not effect, and thereby in part <note place="margin">The causes why som deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed ortogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies toke no place.</note> did hinder the thing, by making of manie think the case more desperat then it was in dede, bycause such fellowes did so faill, were these. Their despare, which thought, that the tung was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of anie direction, came of a wrong cause, the falt rising in dede not of the thing, which theie did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demn, as altogether rude and vnrulie, but of the parties them selues, who mistook their waie. For the thing it self will soon be ordered (our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom is grown so orderable) tho it require som diligence, and good consideration, in him that must find it out. But when a writer taketh a wrong principle, quite contrarie to common practis, where triall must be tuch, and practis must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the mean, which he conceaueth, is it anie maruell if the vse of a tung ouerthwart such a mean, which is not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable vnto it? Herevpon proceded the despare to hit right, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause theie missed of their minde, whereas in dede theie should haue changed their minde, to haue hit vpon that right, which as it is in the thing, so will it soon be found out, if it be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:13245:49"/>
sought for.</p>
               <p>Again the others hope deceiued them to as much. For theie considered not, that whereas common reason, and common custom haue bene long dealers in seking out of their own cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, themselues wilbe councellers and will neuer yeild to anie priuat conceit, which shall seme euidentlie either to force them or to crosse them, as theie themselues do, neuer giuing anie precept, how to write right, till theie haue rated at custom, as a most pernicious enemie to truth and right, euen in that thing, where custom hath most right, if it haue right in anie. Wherefor when theie proceded on in a customarie argument, with the enemitie of him, which is Lord of the soill, was it anie wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der if theie failed of their purpos, &amp; hindered the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of our right writing, which must nedes be compased by customs consent, and reasons frindship? So in the mean time, while despare deceiues the one, and hope begiles the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the one missing his waie, the other making a fo, and both going astraie, theie both lease their labor, and let the finding out of our right in writing, by their ill led, and worse laid labor, bycause the artificiall course, in finding out such a thing, hath another currant, as I haue shewed before in the last title.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding all this, it is verie manifest, that the tung it self hath matter enough in it self, to furnish out an art, &amp; that <note place="margin">That our tung hath in it self matter enough for Art.</note> the same mean, which hath bene vsed in the reducing of other tungs to their right, will serue this of ours, both for generalitie of precept, and certaintie of ground, as maie be easile proued by these four arguments, the antiquitie of our tung, the peples wit, their learning, and their experience. For how can it be, but that a tung, which hath continewed manie hundred years, not onelie a tung, but one of good account, both in speche, and pen, hath growen in all that time to som finesse, and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it self, by so long and so generall an vse, tho it be not as yet sounded, the peple that haue vsed it, being none of the dullest, and trauelling continuallie in all exercises that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern learning, in all practises that procure experience, either in peace or war, either in publike, or priuat, either at home or abrode?</p>
               <p>As for the antiquitie of our speche, whether it be measured
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:13245:50"/>
by the ancient <hi>Almane,</hi> whence it cummeth originallie, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <note place="margin">The a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiquitie of the English tung.</note> but by the latest terms which it boroweth daielie from fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren tungs, either of pure necessitie in new matters, or of mere brauerie, to garnish it self withall, it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be young. Onelesse the <hi>Germane</hi> himself be you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, which claimeth a prerogatiue for the age of his speche, of an infinit prescription: Onelesse the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greke</hi> be young, whose words we enfranchise to our own vse, tho not allwaie immediatlie from them selues, but mostwhat thorough the <hi>Italian, French,</hi> and <hi>Spanish:</hi> Onelesse other tungs, which be neither <hi>Greke</hi> nor <hi>Latin,</hi> nor anie of the forenamed, from whom we haue somwhat, as theie haue from ours, will for companie sake be content to be young, that ours maie not be old. But I am well assured, that euerie one of these, will striue for antiquitie, and rather grant it to vs, then forgo it themselues. So that if the verie newest words, which we vse do sauor of great antiquitie, and the ground of our speche be most ancient, it must nedes then folow, that our hole tung was weined long ago, as hauing all her tethe.</p>
               <p>For the account of our tung, both in pen and speche, no man will dout thereof, who is able to iudge what those thinges be, <note place="margin">The account of the English tung.</note> which make anie tung to be of account, which things I take to be thré, the autoritie of the peple which speak it, the matter &amp; argument, wherein the speche dealeth, the manifold vse, for which the speche serueth. For all which thré, our tung nedeth not to giue place, to anie of her peres.</p>
               <p>First to saie somwhat for the peple, that vse the tung, the <hi>English</hi> nation hath allwaie bene of good credit, and great esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <note place="margin">The English peple.</note> euer since credit and estimation by historie came on this side the <hi>Alps,</hi> which appeareth to be trew, euen by foren cronicles (not to vse our own in a case of our own) which would neuer haue said so much of the peple, if it had bene ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, and not for an historie, or not but well worthie of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall historie.</p>
               <p>Next, for the argument, wherein it dealeth, whether priuat <note place="margin">The matter of our speche.</note> or publik, it maie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare with som other, that think verie well of their own selues. For not to tuch ordinarie affairs in comon life, will matters of learning in anie kind of argument, make a tung of account? Our nation then, I think, will hardlie be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:13245:50"/>
to haue bene vnlearned at anie time, in anie kinde of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <note place="margin">The English learning.</note> not to vse anie bigger speche. Wherefor hauing learning by confession of all men, &amp; vttering that learning in their own tung, for their own vse, of verie pure necessitie (bycause we learn to vse, and the vse is in our own) theie could not but enrich the tung, and purchace it account.</p>
               <p>Will matters of war, whether ciuill or foren, make a tung <note place="margin">The English chiualrie.</note> of account? Our neighbor nations will not deny our peple to be verie warrious, and our own cuntrie will confesse it, tho loth to fele it, both by remembring the smart, &amp; comparing with som other, neither to vaunt our selues, nor to gall our frinds, with anie mo words.</p>
               <p>Now in offring matter to speche, war is such a bréder, as <note place="margin">VVhat a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitur to speche war is.</note> tho it be opposit to learning, bycause it is enemie to the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, yet it dare compare with anie point in learning, for mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of discourses, tho not commonlie so certain, ne yet of so good vse, as learned arguments be. For war (besides all graue and sad considerations about it, which be manie and wise) as somtime it sendeth vs trew reports, either priuatelie in proiects and deuises, that be entended, or publikelie in euents, which be blased abrode, bycause theie be don, so mostwhat it giueth out infinit and extreme, I dare not saie lies, but verie incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble newes, bycause it maie hatch them at will, being in no danger of controllment, and comonlie in such practises and places, as haue not manie witnesses, while euerie man seketh as well to saue him self, as to harm his enemie, besides som cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous entertainment, which a deuising refere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>darie hath euen by telling that, which is not trew, to such as loue to hear, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like or will like. All which occasions, and infinit mo, about stratagemes &amp; engins, giue matter to speche, and cause of new words, and by making it so redie, do make it of renoun.</p>
               <p>Will all kindes of trade, and all sorts of traffik, make a tung of account? If the spreading sea, and the spacious land could <note place="margin">The English traffik.</note> vse anie speche, theie would both shew you, where, and in how manie strange places, theie haue sene our peple, and also giue you to wit, that theie deall in as much, and as great varietie of matters, as anie other peple do, whether at home or abrode. Which is the reason why our tung doth serue to so manie vses,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:13245:51"/>
bycause it is conuersant with so manie peple, and so well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with so manie matters, in so sundrie kindes of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Now all this varietie of matter, and diuersitie of trade, make both matter for our speche, &amp; mean to enlarge it. For he that is so practised, will vtter that, which he practiseth in his naturall tung, and if the strangenesse of the matter do so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, he that is to vtter, rather then he will stik in his vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, will vse the foren term, by waie of premunition, that the cuntrie peple do call it so, and by that mean make a foren word, an English denison.</p>
               <p>All which reasons concerning but the tung, and the account thereof, being put together, as of themselues, theie proue the nations exercise in learning, and their practis in other dealings: so theie seme to infer no base witted peple, not to amplify it with more, bycause it is not for foulls to be so well learned, to be so warrious, to be so well practised. I shall not nede to proue anie of these my positions, either by foren or home hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie: seing my reader stranger, will not striue with me for them, and mine own nation, will not gainsaie me in them, I think, which knoweth them to be trew, and maie vse them for their honor.</p>
               <p>Wherefor I maie well conclude my first position: that if <hi>vse</hi> and <hi>custom</hi> hauing the help of so long time, and continuance, wherein to fine our tung: of so great learning and experience, which furnish matter for the fining: offo good wits and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dgements, which can tell how to fine, haue griped at nothing in all that time with all that cunning, by all those wits, which theie will not let go, but hold for most certaine, in the right of our writing: that then our tung hath no certaintie to trust to, but writeth all at randon. But the antecedent in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is alltogether vnpossible, wherefor the consequent, is a great deall more then probable, which is, that our tung hath in hir own possession, and writing verie good euidence to proue hir own right writing: Which tho no man as yet, by anie publik writing of his, semeth to haue sene, yet the tung it self is redie to shew them, to anie whosoeuer, which is able to read them, and withall to iudge, what euidence is right in the right of writing. Wherefor seing I haue proued suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:13245:51"/>
in mine own opinion, that there is great cause, why our tung should haue som good right, in her own writing, and take my self to haue had the sight of that euidence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that same right appeareth most iustifiable, and am not alltogither ignorant, how to giue sentence thereof, I will do my best, according to that course, which I said was kept in the first, and generall fining of anie speche, which also hath bene translated to euerie secondarie, and particular tung, to set furth som certaintie for the English writing, by those notes, which I haue obserued in the tung it self, the pure best and finest therein, offering mean by comparison with them selues, both to correct, and to direct the worse and more grosse, without either innouating anie thing, as theie do, which set furth new deuises, or by mistaking my waie, as theie do, which despare, that our tung can be brought to anie certaintie, without som maruellous foren help. Thus much for the artificiall stuf in our tung, now to the obiections which charge it with infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>

               <p>THis title tho it seme by the inscription to pretend som offence, yet is it nothing moodie at all, bycause it enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no defense, as against an enemie, but a conference, as with a frind.

Theie haue as good shew of iust enemitie to error, and corruption, as I haue assurance of right direction. And therefor I will rather endeuor my self to perswade them as frinds, then to confute them as foes, rather to ioyn with them in som points, then to defy them in all. <note place="margin">The matter of this title, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst &amp; for custom, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of letters sound, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouation.</note>

               <p>In the hole matter of this conference with them, theie ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blame certain errors, which theie pretend to be in our writing: or else theie will seme to seke the reforming there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. In the blame of errors, theie rate at <hi>custom</hi> as a vile cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupter,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:13245:52"/>
and complain of our letters, as to miserable few. In their desire ofredresse, theie appeall to <hi>sound,</hi> as the onelie so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerain, and surest leader in the gouernment of writing: &amp; fly to <hi>innouation,</hi> as the onelie mean, to reform all errors, that be in our writing. Which their particular branching, I will follow in my reply, and yet in no reply, but excuse, for the innocencie of our pen, where it is without falt, tho it be not without blame and in my plaine confession of som manifest error, where there is cause why.</p>
               <p>In their quarell to <hi>custom</hi> theie seke first to bring it into ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <note place="margin">The assailing of custom.</note> hatred, as a common corrupter of all good things, and that naturallie, without anie exception, and therefor no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell if it abuse speche, which as it passeth thorough euerie mans mouth, and is resembled by euerie mans pen, so must it nedes gather much corruption by the waie, bycause manie and ill be all one in dede, tho deuided in term, as good and few, tho different in name, yet be the same in pith: And common corruption, which theie terme <hi>Custom,</hi> is an ill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector to find out a right. Herevpon theie conclude, that as it semeth most probable, so it is most trew, that the chefe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, which ar crept into our pen, do take their beginning at the onelie infection of a naughtie <hi>custom.</hi> Which bycause it is naught, therefor ought it not so much as once to be named, in the direction to a right, in either pen or speche, being so manifest a falsarie, notwithstanding whatsoeuer anie either old or new writers can pretend to the contrarie, for either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense or excuse thereof. Then theie descend two particularities, wherein theie proue that customarilie, we do somtime bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den our words to much, with to manie letters, somtimes we pinch them to near with to few, somtimes we misshape them with wrong sounding, somtime we misorder them, with wrong placing. And be not these maruellous great causes of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment with <hi>Custom,</hi> which is the breder of them? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all these which ar but points of penning onelie, to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauate the discredit wherewith theie charge <hi>custom,</hi> theie seke to make it odious, as an enemie to vertew, euen abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing what is best. And will there anie that fauoreth vertew, protect <hi>Custom,</hi> being such a venim to all vertewes, and such
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13245:52"/>
a poison to all vertewous effects? Or can there anie that frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his cuntrie conceiue well of that, which corrupteth hir pen, and poisoneth hir speche? Sure not I. For neither wold I haue vertew to hold mefor hir enemie, by defending of hir fo, nor yet my cuntrie to froun at me for fauoring hir cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters. Certainlie that <hi>custom</hi> is most vile, which doth but speak ill of good things: but to seke their corruption is a most villanous part. And to abuse speche in anie hir deliuerie whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by tung or pen, the good benefit whereof, doth serue most of our nedes, as vertew doth the best, is extreme beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. And therefor assuredlie, as those my good cuntrimen, haue most iust cause to be angrie with these corruptions: so might theie as iustlie turn their anger vpon me, if I should anie waie but so much as seme to excuse or but to extenuate so pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a fact. Neither can anie writer, new or old, but hasard his own credit, if he do but seme to shew anie incling of fauor that waie.</p>
               <p>And yet if good writers seme to fauor <hi>custom,</hi> then the case <note place="margin">For custom.</note> is not so clear, as you take it to be, that there is nothing in <hi>custo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> but an hell of most vile, and filthie corruptions: that it alone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth all good things: that it alone corrupteth right writing. For if it were in dede and onelie so, theie wold not warrant it, as (now I remember my self) theie praise it verie often, and giue it great credit. Is there then not som error in the name, &amp; maie not <hi>custom</hi> be misconstrewed? for sure the writers, when theie speak of <hi>custom,</hi> theie mean that rule in doing, and vertewous life, wherein good men agré and their consent is that, which these men term <hi>custom</hi> therein: as theie call that rule in speaking and writing the <hi>custom</hi> thereof, wherein the skilfull and best learned do agré. And is it likelie that either the honest in dede will mislead vertew in liuing, or the learned in dede will mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like right in writing? And again, those honest men, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of <hi>custom</hi> in matters of life, complain verie much of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in manners, and naughtie behauior: and the learned men, which allow of <hi>custom</hi> in matters of speche and pen, do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain verie much of error in writing, and corruption in speche: and both the two, accuse the most peple as the leaders to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and the common abuse, as the frute of a multitude. And
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13245:53"/>
therefor it cannot otherwise be, but that the duble name is that, which deceiues. For theie, which accuse <hi>custo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> do mean false er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, which counterfeateth <hi>custom,</hi> and is a great captain among the impudent for naughtinesse, and the ignorant for rashnesse, and yet directeth all the most. And theie that praise <hi>custom</hi> do mean plain truth, which cannot dissemble, which is companion with the honest in vertew, and with the learned in cunning, and directeth all the best. And will ye se? This mistermed <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi> in the pen, is that counterfeat abuse, which was the onelie cause, why <hi>sounds</hi> monarchie, whereof I spake before, was so dissolued, and was it self condemned, by those wise peple, which ioyned <hi>reason</hi> with <hi>sound:</hi> and the right <hi>custom</hi> which writers commend so, is that companion of <hi>reason,</hi> which succeded in place, when the counterfeat was cast out. Now ye se the error. So neither writers do allow of such a corruption, neither is <hi>custom</hi> your contrarie, but both writers, and <hi>custom,</hi> both you, and I will scratch out the eies of common error, for misusing of good things, and belying of <hi>custom.</hi> If good things be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it is by ill peple, whose misnamed <hi>custom</hi> is right named error, and well blamed lewdnesse. If words be ouercharged with number of letters, that coms either by couetousnesse in such, as sell them by lines, or by ignorance in such, as besides the pestering them with to manie, do both weaken them with to few, and wrong them with the change, both of force and place, whose error as I mone, so I will'seke to amend it, and while I amend it, I will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute by correcting, and heall by com paring, that euerie one beholding the redresse, where he finds the falt, maie be able to iudge both of right, and wrong, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of contraries. Thus I take it my good cuntrimen, that you be deceiued in the name, and blame one for another. For <hi>custom</hi> certainlie in a matter of speche, is a great and a naturall gouernour, tho in other things it maie somtimes seme to be a sore vsurper. And yet good autors will hardlie graunt that, which still frè <hi>custom</hi> from all offensiue note, both in words and dedes, bycause theie ground <hi>custom</hi> not vpon error in deprauation at the last: but vpon iudgement, in direction from the first. And theie which entreat <hi>custom</hi> so hardlie, entertain it so, vnder an vnproper name, as vnworthie to be heard speak

in the right of writing, seing it semes to be the onelie occasion of all corruption therein, as theie surmise, taking <hi>custom</hi> to be grounded vpon the common confusion in practis of the most, and least iudiciall peple, which is mother to all wrong opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, concerning anie iudgement of right. Wherein theie nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mark that the ignorant multitude is not held for mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse, of that right and reasonable <hi>custom,</hi> which is the naturall <hi>custom,</hi> and which theie of the contrarie side do follow, as the best gide in right writing: neither yet consider theie, that their aduersaries, whom theie oppugn so, do confesse som errors in the ordinarie penning, proceding of that corruption, which theie wrongfullie term <hi>custom,</hi> which errors theie also seke to haue cut of, as the idle clogging of words with nedelesse letters, and such other ordinarie errors, which rise most of to much, by not knowing, what is right. Which errors I will handle there, where I amend them streight, as I will tuch <hi>custom</hi> somwhat more, when I com to that place, where theie appeal vnto <hi>sound</hi> from both <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>custom.</hi>

               <p>When theie haue delt thus with <hi>custom,</hi> and their contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <note place="margin">Against the in sufficiencie of our letters both for vse &amp; for nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber.</note> (which theie make contraries, by mistaking, being their frinds in dede) without marking their reasons, or by whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie <hi>custom</hi> is established, which theie so impugn by sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion of a counterfeat, then theie begin to complain sore of the insufficiencie, and pouertie of our letters, which letters tho theie be as manie in number, as other tungs haue, yet theie suffise not, saie theie, for the full and right expressing of our sounds, tho theie expresse them after a sort, but enforce vs to vse a number of them like the <hi>Delphik</hi> sword, where of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> speaketh, to manie sounds and seruices contrarie to the natur of such an instrument, which was made at the first, this letter for that sound. Whereby it commeth to passe, that we both write vnproperlie, not answering the sound of that, which we saie, and ar neuer like our selues, in anie our writing, but still varie according vnto the writers humor, without anie certain direction. Whereupon forenners and strangers do wonder at vs, both for the vncertaintie in our writing, and the inconstancie in our letters. And is it not a great shame that so cunning a nation as the English
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13245:54"/>
is, being of verie good note so manie yeares, either should espy, or wold not amend in all this time, the pouertie of their pen, and the confusion in their letter? but both to let their writing run thus still at riot, and them selues to be mokt at of foren peple?</p>
               <p>If foren peple do maruell at vs, we maie requite them with <note place="margin">For the suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie of our letters.</note> as much, and return their wonder home, considering theie themselues be subiect to the verie same difficulties, which theie wonder at in vs, and haue no mo letters then we haue, and yet both write still, and be vnderstood still, in the midst and in the spite of all these insufficiencies: as we also both write and be vnderstood, in this our insufficiencie, euen by their confession, which will nedes be offended, bycause of insufficiencie. But the common vse of writing among those strangers, which agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth so with ours in our most vncertaintie, giues me to think, that this complaining of insufficiencie is not generall to all neither wth them nor with vs, but proper to som few, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular among both, who misliking that theie know not, and not marking that theie ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not, therefor blame that theie should not. For if their blaming vpon cause, and marking vpon iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did concur with their number, tho not so great, I should be afraid least theie had the better, bycause the fewer: but both the fewer and the weaker to, carie no great force, to condemn in iudgement. As other folks also, which se somwhat to, as well as theie, do not quite mislike of all their misliking, but desire som redresse, where there is cause in dede, tho theie agré not in the mean, how to perform the redresse, nor yet in the qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie, that the error is so great, as these insufficienciaries pretend it to be. For we do confesse that this multiplicitie, &amp; manifold vse in the force and seruice of our letters, wold haue som distinction, whereby to be known, if generall acquaintance with our own writing be not sufficient enough, to perceiue that in vse, which we put down by vse: but withall we defend and maintain the multiplicitie it self, as a thing much vsed euen in the best tungs, and therefor not vnlawfull, tho there were no distinction.</p>
               <p>And again, we do not think, that euerie our <hi>custom</hi> is a plaine corruption, wherein generall vse, euen of those same persons, which cannot be suspected, but to write with good iudgement,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:13245:54"/>
laie the ground to precept, as the leader to som art, &amp; assura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the pen. And we rest content with the number of our letters. Which number, while som kinde of peple do studie to encrease, theie do but cumber our tung, both with strange characts, &amp; with nedelesse dipthongs, enforcing vs from that, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rule hath won, and resteth content with, in all the world. And why not but these letters? or why not to manie vses? This <note place="margin">VVhy mo let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?</note> paucitie and pouertie of letters, hath contented and discharged the best, &amp; brauest tungs, that either be, haue bene, shalbe, or ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be, &amp; hath deliuered by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both in speche &amp; pen, as great varie tie, and as much difficultie in all arguments, and as well percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all posteritie thorough their means, as possiblie can, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be deliuered, or be vnderstood, by the English tung, or yet be deuised by anie English wit. The peple that now vse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; theie that haue vsed them, haue naturallie the same instruments of voice, and the same deliuerie in <hi>sound,</hi> for all their speaking, that we English men haue, by cause theie be men, as we En glish folk be: and theie sent the vse of the pen to vs, and not we to them. And finding in their own vse this necessitie, which you do note, theie fled to that help which you think naught, and were bold with their letters, to make them serue diuerse turns, somtime with none, somtime with som pretie small note of euident distinction. Which kinde of distinguishing theie know to be verie trew, whosoeuer be acquainted with the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren letters, and with those writers which entreat of them, as I my self will shew, when I both mark, and amend at once, tho I deall no further in this place, to auoid repetition, both here &amp; there. Neither is there anie difficultie, which theie ar not subiect vnto, either in the same, or in the verie like things, as wel as we: as I will proue elswhere, euen by comparing the particulars, so far and so manie, as nede shall require. And will strangers won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at vs? or do not our own peple that be learned perceiue these things? For in the ignorant I require no such discretion. Surelie I think that all peple hauing the same naturall instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to speak by, tho vpon priuat vse som harp more of som sounds then others, and som lean more vpon som one instrument of speche, then other do, as som the throte, som the tethe, and so furth, which varietie is popular euen to hole
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:13245:55"/>
nations, that yet naturallie all be made able, to sound all spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and all letters, if theie be accustomed vnto them, in that age and with those means, when and whereby theie be best to be learned: And that it is onelie education, and <hi>custom</hi> which maketh the difference, and therefor ruleth either all or most in speche, wherein if there be anie <hi>reason,</hi> it is not naturall and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as in things, but artificiall &amp; compound as in speche, vpon such and such a cause in <hi>custom</hi> and consent. And tho the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> grammarians onelie, do deuide their letters, according to that vocall instrument whereupon theie lean most, as som vpon the throte, som vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rouf of the mouth, som vpon the tung, som vpon the lips, som vpon the tethe: yet the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> alone haue not that distinction in natur, but euerie peple also which haue throte, tethe, rouf, tung, lips, and with those instruments vse the vtterance of sounds. Which is an argument to me, both that vse is the mistresse herein, and that he, which soundeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anie one by cuntrie vse, maie be smoothed to som other by the contrarie vse, and that therefor the same letters will serue all peple, if theie list to frame themselues accordinglie. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise why do we persuade our peple to sound <hi>Latin</hi> thus, <hi>Greke</hi> thus, <hi>Hebrew</hi> thus, <hi>Italian</hi> thus, if it be not a thing to be made of acquaintance, by customarie vse? And being so, and in all nations so, what nede we mo letters to vtter our minde? se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vttering instruments be all one, and nothing can be vttered either for varietie more diuerse, or for difficultie more hard, then theie haue vttered, from whom we haue those let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which we haue? neither is it anie discredit to our peple to rest content with those letters, and with that number, which antiquitie hath allowed, and held for sufficient. Is natur therefor baren in vs, which was frutefull in them, bycause we maie not inuent, and put somwhat to theirs? No forsoth. But all mankinde is but one, without anie respect of either this age, or that age, both to natur hir self, and to the God &amp; Lord of natur, and therefor what is giuen to one man, or deliuered in one age of common seruice, that is ment to all men, &amp; to all ages of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without further regard to whom, or for whom, but still to their benefit: neither is either God himself or natur his minister tyed to anie time, for deliuerie of their gifts, but when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13245:55"/>
mans necessitie compells him to seke, then theie help him to find. Whereupon we vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that as no one age brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth furth euerie thing, so no one age can but confesse, that it hath som one or other particular inuention, tho not the self same, bycause it is enough to haue receiued it once to vse euer after. As in this case of letters, which perfited once, is neuer to be shaken, onelesse a better mean be found to vtter our speche, which I shall not se, neither can I forese by anie secret prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. In these inuentions, tho the first receiuer haue the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue in taking, yet the hole posteritie hath the benefit in vsing, and generallie with greater perfection, bycause time and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinewance do encrease and proin, which when it is full, it is a falt to seke further, as I take it to be in the course of penning. Neither is the restraint, for either innouating, altering, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to things allredie perfited, anie discourtisie in reason, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie discountenance in natur, but a bare deliuerie of a perfit thing to our elder brethern, to be conueied vnto vs: as we in like case, as the transporters to our posteritie, of such things as it pleaseth God to continew by our means, whether receiued of our elders, or deuised by our selues.</p>
               <p>But why maie we not vse all our four and twentie letters, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <note place="margin">VVhy not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie letter to manie vses?</note> to four and twentie vses euerie of them, if occasion serue, seing the characts being known be more familiar, and easier to be discerned, then anie new deuise, yea tho the old resemble mo, and the new do note but one? It hath bene sufficientlie declared allreadie, that those men, which first deuised letters, reserued the authoritie ouer them and their vse to them selues for life, and their successors, for euer, so to qualify and to vse them, as it should please them best vpon consent among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and cause to content nede. And why not so, where both the inuention is their own, and the right vse thereof, as theie shall vse it, which made it for their vse? This generall reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is enrold allredie in all reason and antiquitie, and the particular consent for this writing of ours is proined al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lredie, by our generall vse, and wilbe regestred also in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good record, I hope, and that shortelie. And will you make that souerain, which is but subaltern? or will you take that, as not remoueable, like a steddie rok, which is roming by
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:13245:56"/>
natur, and to serue the finder? There is no such assurance in <hi>sound</hi> for the stablishing of a right, as you do conceiue, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such necessitie in letters, to be constant in one vse, as you seke to enforce.</p>
               <p>The <hi>philosopher</hi> saith, that natur makes one thing to one vse, <note place="margin">1.</note> and that euerie vse hath his particular instrument naturallie, but that our own inuentions, naie that euen the most naturall means in our application do, and maie serue to sundrie ends &amp; vses. And will letters stand so vpon their reputation, as not to seme to stand to our applying of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for our own purposes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both our creaturs, &amp; by creation our bondme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? both to <hi>sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> and serue, as we shall think it good, and so manie waies, as we shall will them to serue? No surelie, theie do not think so, but theie ar most redie to serue at our appointment, both by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; by couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The letters yeild redilie, but som letters seke to hinder that their dewtifull obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, threaping still vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that their substance is diamantish, and not born to yeild so.</p>
               <p>With the same pen we make letters, and with the same we mar them: with the same we direct, and with the same we dash: <note place="margin">3.</note> which be contrarie vses, tho to compas one right, and will let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters seme to serue but for one vse, being pewnies to the pen, naie being but elues and brats of the pens breding?

               <p>The number of things, whereof we write and speak is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, <note place="margin">2.</note> the words wherewith we write and speak, be definite and within number. Whereupon we ar driuen to vse one, and the same word in verie manie, naie somtime in verie contrarie sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and that in all the verie best la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guages, as well as in English, where a number of our words be of verie sundrie powers, as, letters, wherewith we write, &amp; letters which hinder: A bird fli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth light, wheresoeuer she doth light: and to manie to stand on here. And will letters kepe a countenance and stand so alouf, as to sound still but one, and to serue still but one, where their great grandfathers euen the words themselues, ar forced to be
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:13245:56"/>
manifold? naie ar verie well content so to be, bycause of their founders statute? which is to be pliable, and at voluntarie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, of wisdom and learning? letters stand not alouf, but allow of the seruice, whereunto you allot the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be it neuer so manifold, seing without either co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or darknesse, customarie acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce will work the distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in them, &amp; their manifold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: as a beaten disputer will sift out the difference of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold words, that the varietie of their sense, make no quarell in the question.</p>
               <p>If we write not allwaie one, thorough want of skill, &amp; mere ignorance, then knowledge is the helper, and he that will vse right, must haue desire to learn right.</p>
               <p>If there want distinction, then accent must be mean to auoid confusion, or som such deuise, which maie distinguish with praise, and not pester the writing, with anie to od strangenesse. For it is most certain, that we maie vse our letters so, as we maie all other things else, whose end is in vse, and man is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur. Neither is it anie abuse, when theie which vse, can giue a reason why, sufficient to the wise, and not contrarie to good custom. And tho som reply, as not so perswaded, yet when the act is past by diuision of the house, it is law by parlement. Then the repliers must relent, and follow, tho theie fauor not. Then must theie make the best of that, which theie thought worst, when as lawfull autoritie hath restrained their will. A thing fré before order being once limited by order hath cast of that fré<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and must then kepe that currant, wherevnto it is limited, by orderlie mean, it self being such, as is subiect vnto man, and to be his at vse.</p>
               <p>Our letters be limited, their vsage is certain in their most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie, and therefor I take it, that we maie rest content both with their number and their vse. Thus much concerning that complaint of our pouertie in letters, and confusion in their powers, which I wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der not at, bycause I se it so in all tungs, &amp; euer: &amp; I se no cause why, but it maie be so in our own inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; deuises, where we are to take knowledge of nothing else, but of our own consent, both by best iudgemets of the wisest men, and the right resemblance of least corrupt natur. <note place="margin">For the auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of sound</note>

For we came but latelie to vse letters, in comparison of the old peple in other nations of the main continent, &amp; felt not our want at the first wearing: but now that we fele it, why maie we not help our selues, with the deuise of som new let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as other peple did in the like cases by som <hi>Esdras,</hi> som <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamedes,</hi> som <hi>Cadmus,</hi> som <hi>Euander,</hi> som <hi>Carmenta,</hi> and such other? <hi>Custom</hi> is condemned allredie, as a false corrupter, and sound semes to be the surest, and the best gide euen by naturall direction, and the primitiue letter.

For as the ouercharging of our words with to manie letters cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by vsing those to much, which we haue allredie: so the difficultie thereof by vsing them so diuerslie procedeth of mere want, not hauing wherewith to answer ech particular.</p>
               <p>Then theie change the form of our letters, and bring vs in new faces, of verie strange lineaments, how well fauored to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I am sure I know: how vnredie for a penma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherewith to run, methink I forese. Which redinesse in the charact, that it follow the hand roundlie, is a speciall seruice belonging to the pen. Neither do I my self in these obseruations, so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, what the print will stamp well, which will expresse anie thing well, whose form is reseblable, as what the pen will write well, and that with good dispatch, bycause printing is but a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, and a benefit impropriate: writing is our generall, and in euerie mans finger. A form that is fair to the eie in print, &amp; cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersom to the hand in penning, is not to passe in writing. For what but that causeth our English pen to vse z. so seldom, which we hear fo often? Bussing, hussie, dissie, go roundlie to the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:13245:58"/>
pen with the duble ss, but verie vnredilie with the duble z, Buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, huzzie, dizzie. Vse hath won ss. &amp; the pens redinesse, is the prouf to perswade it. To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, this saie theie is the onelie help to amend all misses: for defect, to enlarge: for old &amp; corrupt, to bring in new &amp; correct: nede enforceth redresse, &amp; dewtie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>Sure a good care, and a cuntriemanlike affection, but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> which was ouerséer, allowes not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. <note place="margin">That this their mean is not the best.</note> For what? must we then alter all our writings a new? or from what daie is this act of reformation to take full place? It is a strange point of physik, when the remedie it self is more dangerous then the disease. Besides that: I take this alteration in this sort, to be neither necessarie, where no such insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie is, neither yet commodious, where such inconueniences fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. For speche being an instrument, and a mean to vtter that, which the minde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiueth, if by the deliuerie of the mouth, the minde be vnderstood, the speche is sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which so fullie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth so nedefull a purpos. If writing, where vnder I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend both the print &amp; pen, do so fullie expresse the pith of the voice, as the reader maie, &amp; doth vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the writers meaning at full thereby, I maie not perswade him, that the letters which he readeth be not sufficient to expresse the writers meaning, which he is redie to confute by present triall, that both he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth them, and withall most sufficientlie.</p>
               <p>But these insufficienciaries will saie, that this vnderstanding cums not by the right of the writing, but by the intelligent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds that right, by the so vsuall, tho so corrupt writing, which is vnperfitlie, and vnproperlie writen: and that the proprietie in penning is ill refused, which maie be had easilie with verie small straning.</p>
               <p>I like the reason well, as I consesse som imperfection. But neither is the imperfection so great, as theie conceiue of it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is their reason so nere to redresse, as theie think it is. As for the imperfection, how it cummeth, and which waie to help it, my hole labor will proue that in euent. For their reason I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sé that, which theie call a small straning bycause theie alter quite, or at the least, theie change the surface quite, which in this case, where the proprietie in writing is the possession of <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi> being so grounded as I haue allredie declared, is to great a
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:13245:59"/>
straning, chefelie, where <hi>custom</hi> being so sure and sound, will not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to be ouerruled in his own: or that anie reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter clame, where he is proprietarie, howsoeuer priuat mens conceits, vpon neuer so probable apparences, framed in their own opinion, shall offer assistence to the contrarie side.</p>
               <p>The vse &amp; <hi>custom</hi> of our cuntrie, hath allredie chosen a kinde of penning, wherein she hath set down hir relligion, hir lawes, hir priuat and publik dealings: Euerie priuat man according to the allowance of his cuntrie in generall, hath so drawn his priuat writings, his euidence, his letters, as the thing sémeth vnpossible to be remoued by anie so strange an alteration, tho it be most willing to receiue som reasonable proining, so that the substance maie remain, and the change take place in such points onelie, as maie please without noueltie, and profit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out forcing For were it not in good sooth, to violent a force, to offer to ouerthrow a <hi>custom,</hi> so generallie receiued, so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larlie setled, naie grounded so soundlie, and sure, as it shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear shortlie, with altering either all, or most of our letters? Were it not an argument of a verie simple orator, to think that he could perswade <hi>custom,</hi> by so strange an innouation, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorse himself from so long, and so lawfull a match? Naie were it not a wonderfull wish, euen but to wish that all our English scriptur &amp; diuinitie, all our lawes and pollicie, all our euidence &amp; writings, were pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d anew, bycause we haue not that set down in writing, which our elders did wish vs, but either more, which theie ment not, or lesse, which we wold not, or not so as both theie me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; we wold? all this cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the insufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of our writing, which is not able, to set that faithfullie &amp; fullie down, which the minde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiueth, but either w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the more, or the lesse, or disagréing in the maner? But theie willsaie that theie mean not anie so main a cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge. But theie must nedes mean it, bycause it must either presentlie follow vpon the admitting of this new alteration, which is to main in sense, or within som years, which is to main in thought. For a new writing cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in vnder ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; the old charact growing outof knowledge, all that euidence in whatsoeuer English kind, must nedes either com ouer to the new fashion, or be subiect to the fru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p, &amp; remain wormeate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like an old relik, &amp; so to be red, as the Romain religion, write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder <hi>Numa Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pilius</hi> was by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Tullies</hi> time, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euerie word was

But am I not in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with a nédlesse trauell, not allowing that, which I nede not fear, bycause there is no da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger in it, the verie vse of our cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie refusing it allredie? I grant I am. But yet I must saie somwhat, not to seme to contemn: as if I saie nothing, the contrarie then maie seme to haue said som thing. But sure I take the thing to be to to combersom, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient, tho it were like to be profitable, but where no like liehood of anie profit at all doth appear in sight, &amp; the change it self semeth, neither necessarie as to the better, neither volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, as to the readier, which be two principall respects in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, I allow not the mean, tho I mislike not the men, which deserue great thanks for their great good will, tho their works take no place. For their labor is verie profitable to help som re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse forward, tho themselues hit it not. For while diuerse men attempt to laie the thing in certain, som one or other will hit it at the last, whereas to the contrarie, the case were desperat, if it were neuer delt in. But this amendment of theirs is to far fet, and without the help thereof we vnderstand our print and pen, our euidence and other writing, in what kinde soeuer. And tho we grant som imperfection, as in a tung not yet rakt from hir trubled lées, yet we do not confesse, that it is to be perfited either by altering the form, or by e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>creasing the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted letters, but onelie by obseruing, where the tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of her self, &amp; hir ordinarie <hi>custom</hi> doth yeild to the fining, as the old, &amp; therefor the best method doth lead vs. For it is no argument, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falts be found, to saie this is the help &amp; onelie this, bycause none other is in sight. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>soeuer the right is fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie séking, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is trew, that it was not thoroughlie sought, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was denied to be.

And whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer insufficiencie sémeth to be in the writing thereof, it will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse it self, and laie the hole falt vpon the insufficient obseruer, for not séking the right in it, by a right waie, which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be trew, when it shalbe sene, that by sufficient obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation it maie be set clear, and pure, without anie foren help, of either altering the form, or encreasing the number of our ordinarie letters, but onelie by bare notes of hir own bréding, which being allredie in vse desire nothing else, but som di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection by Art, which I am in good hope to perform, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the plat of the best refiners, in the most refined tungs, with such consideration, as either brédeth anie generall rules, or else must bear with particular exceptions. I will mark what our customarie writing will yield vnto vs by waie of note, without dreaming of change, which change is a thing not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to passe against so violent a fall, as custom runs with, tho that violence it self offer no kinde of wrong to anie other thing, being altogether full of hir own stream. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for do my best to confirm our <hi>custom</hi> in his own right, which will be easilie obtained, where men be acquainted with the matter allredie, and wold be verie glad to se wherein the right of their writing standeth, and a great deall more glad to find it so near, when theie sought it, and thought it to be further of. Thus haue I run thorough these pretended infirmities in our tung, whose physiking I like not this waie, and therefor I will ioyn close with mine own obseruation, to sé if that will help.</p>

BY cause I pretend the finding out of a right in writing, and withall confesse that that right must bild vpon consent, I will therefor shew first, what a thing that is, which we call right both in speche and pen: then what force consent is of, to establish anie thing, where manie voices ar nedefull. <hi>Theodor Gaza,</hi> a great learned <hi>Grecia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For speche being our instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at will, for our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon dealings, why should not that be the right therein, which is of commonest note, and best vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood? which kinde of common notice, who so euer he be, that shall follow in the right of his writing, besides the truth of the thing, confirmed by custom, and the autoritie of custom confirmed by consent, he maketh for him self a great partie, &amp; by writing as the generalitie doth, he gaineth the generalitie to be of his side, which is redie to allow of their own choice, &amp; vsuallie loue, where theie find them felues liked, hauing autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to establish both their own assurance, and the writers dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Opposition to the common vpon fauor to the priuat, as <note place="margin">The force of common vse</note> preferring priuat fantfie before generall vse, or as if you alone had espyed, where all else be deceiued, assureth you of two things, the one, to be generallie misliked for our particular choice, where the generalitie is chefe: the other, neuer to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for bewraing such a fantsie, which is alredie and altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of grace with the common. For why? when the custom of your cuntrie alloweth this as best, and therefor fittest for hir perpetuall seruice, doth she not then tell you, by seuering hir own generall, that she saw your speciall? For how could choice haue taken place, if both the extremities had not bene in sight? Therefor he calleth his own credit into som question, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie to be blind, where both the matter of hir choice, and the maner of hir speche declaring hir choice most euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie shew, that she séith what she saith.</p>
               <p>I know som men which haue contraried all our latin gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rules, as not so generallie trew that waie, which theie ar vsed, but euen as trew of the contrarie side, by cause theie haue

som examples in the tung, repugnant as theie think to the rules, which be giuen. Whose error is in that theie do not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, that our <hi>commonlie so,</hi> and not their <hi>allwaie so,</hi> is right in such cases: and that such wise men, as gathered the rules, when theie pikt the finenest did laie out a drosse, and that he which resteth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the most and best, by comparison confesseth a lesse and a worse. Such peple dream that other men se not when them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues be aslepe, &amp; by not comparing themselues with other, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwene their own abilities. But vpon this right most <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie so,</hi> where choice hath found reason to ioyn withall in companie, must both speche be grounded, and their interest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, which will ouerrule speche by their to much priuat reason.

                  <note place="margin">VVhat it is to write English right.</note> is, a certain reasonable course, to direct the pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by such rules, as ar most conformable, to the proprietie of <hi>sound,</hi> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>reason,</hi> &amp; the smoothing of <hi>custom</hi> ioyntlie, speciallie in those points of our writing where there is som difficultie &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agrement both in opinion of the writers, &amp; in natur of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, concerning to much, to litle, or to diuerse. <hi>To much,</hi> as the <note place="margin">To much.</note> dubling of consona<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in the end of a word, as putt, grubb, ledd, for put, grub, led, and a thowsand such ignorant superfluities. Whereas the rule is, that no consonant must be dubled in anie word at all, or in anie place of the word at all, but onelie where either consona<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t belongeth to seuerall syllabs, as in syl-lab. wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, sauing ss, and ll, in the end vpon great occasions, which shalbe noted hereafter. <hi>To litle,</hi> as fech, scrach, herafter, singlie for fetch, scratch, hereafter, singlelie: where for the first two the <note place="margin">To litle.</note> rule is, that, t, is to be writen before ch, in such deriuatiues, as haue t, in the primitiue, as set, scrat, which is so much vsed as it maketh a rule of it self allmost, and causeth t, be commonlie writen, euen where either there is no primitiue at all with t, or not anie in such a sense, as the deriuatiue semes to be of. For the last, the rule is, that our English compounds ar lightlie made of the hole simples, without leasing one letter: and that if anie be left out, it is figuratiuelie by either contraction, as single for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glelie,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:13245:63"/>
or for redinesse in writing without further reason, which is most sene in the silent e, whereof I will speak hereafter.

And yet all this great confusion is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to be certained, without anie more ado, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mere follow ing of <hi>reason, custom,</hi> and <hi>sound,</hi> in our own tung, as shalbe plainelie proued. And if there nede anie difference, or distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the eie, for directing either the English infant, which must learn, or the infantish stranger, which desires to learn, som litle note of distinction, or som known accent ouer the lesse v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall will auoid that confusion, which is so much pretended, and confirm it self by following the first tungs, in that kinde of distinguishing. The two points of <hi>to much</hi> &amp; <hi>to litle</hi> wilbe soon redressed, as most what proceding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ignorant writer, which will reform himself, when he shall se cause why, and a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted president, the which he maie follow. The last for <hi>diuersitie</hi> is a matter of mere cumber, and yet shalbe so handled, as I do not fear, but to win both consent and allowance. For the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of these vnrulie fellowes, and the certaining of our pen, I do follow these seuen precepts, <hi>Generall Rule, Proportion, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, Deriuation, Enfranchisment, distinction,</hi> and <hi>Prerogatiue.</hi> The causes why I haue reduced all the obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of our right writing, to these seuen heads be these. The first thing, that is considered in anie compound matter, is the simples whereon the compound is made, which in this argument is the natur of ech letter. Whose generall examining, and ascertaining I haue recommended to the first of my seuen precepts, which I call <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Rule.</note> 
                  <hi>rule.</hi> The next thing that is considered in a compound is the vse and handling of the simples, which make the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, being put to their prouf in the thing compounded. Which prouf in this argument consisteth in words, bycause let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do serue for the deliuerie of words. Now all words be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mere English, or in corporate strangers, which either fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low one sutable <hi>sound</hi> in speche, and the like resemblance in pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or agreing in the one, disagrè in the other. For the certaining of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:13245:63"/>
this vncertaintie, I appoint two precepts of the seuen, <hi>Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Proportion.</note> and <hi>Enfranchisement.</hi>

               <p>Again, all words whether naturall or denisons, be either sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or compound, either primatiues or deriuatiues.

               </p>
               <p>Again, bycause the time and quantitie of syllabs, and the <note place="margin">6. Distinction.</note> tune and qualitie thereof do cause somtime much controuersie &amp; difference in the right vse of writing, I haue therefor ioyned the rule of <hi>distinction</hi> vnto these fiue. Wherein I handle the vse of all those characts, which the eie doth behold, either in pen or print besides the letters: bycause those characts, do help and qualify the expressing, and vtterance of words and sentences, as the letters alone do expresse and vtter them.</p>
               <p>Again, bycause both <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>custom</hi> will shew som one trik of their priuat autoritie, in the most pride of Art, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth altogither of <hi>reason,</hi> I haue therefor knit vp all the seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the rule of <hi>prerogatiue,</hi> where the generall direction of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the other is somtime thwarted by natur of exception, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned <note place="margin">7. Prerogatiue.</note> somtime by the <hi>sound,</hi> somtime by <hi>custom,</hi> both being desirous to shew their own efficacie. All which my rules I refer to the writing, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the print. For in the print the difficul tie is not so soon spyed, as it is in writing: bycause the printing charact being once cast in metle, what difficultie is there after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? In the pen which is still to stamp, and to make new cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racts euerie foot, tho of the same form, the commoditie of the <note place="margin">That these rules ar to the pen rather then to the print.</note> hand is most to be considered, that the charact be fair to the eie, commodious to the ioynt, and swift to dispatch. And therefor he that will iudge of my opinion in this argument, wherein my speciall regard is, to the facilitie and right in writing, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in printing tho the one help the other, when it is wel setled, must not mark what the print setteth down in the generall sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, where the printers, setters, and correcters ouersight som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times plaieth a part, and letteth manie errors abide in their work: but what I my self do bind my self vnto by mine own precept. For that I will warrant, the other I cannot, tho I do what I can. The writing is my chefe care, which will be my chefe credit herein, if it proue to be currant, and actiue.</p>

               <p>I Call the first of those means, whereby the right writing of our English tung is to be assured, according to that certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which our common vse doth seme to haue chosen <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rule,</hi> whose peculiar dewtie is, to ascertain our right writing, either by main grounds, reaching thoroughout the hole tung, <note place="margin">VVhat gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rule is, and how it is deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> or by limiting the force of euerie particular charact, whether it be distinction to help our pronouncing, or else letter, whereby we pronounce. By this discription it appeareth, that the rules which belong to right writing in this kinde, be either generall to the tung, or particular to the charact. The former sort of the two do bak the latter, like the generall notio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in <hi>Geometrie.</hi> The latter ground the generall truth of their main <hi>reason,</hi> vpon the former, &amp; the particular credit of their own argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

and sharp sound in the word, calleth still for the qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing e, in the end, as the flat and short nedeth it not. It qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifyeth no ending vowell, bycause it followeth none in the <note place="margin">2</note> end, sauing i. as in daie, maie, saie, trewlie, safetie, where it maketh i, either not to be heard, or verie gentlie to be heard, which otherwise wold sound loud and sharp, and must be expressed by y. as, deny, aby, ally. Which kinde of writing shalbe noted hereafter.

Fourthlie after l, in combination with anie consonant, as whistle, gristle, wrestle, wrangle, fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sle, <note place="margin">4</note> britle, trikle. sauing where v, the consonant cummeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore l, in the same proportion of sound like to these, where the e, is passant (whereof I will saie somwhat straight waie) and therefor is writen before the l. tho it shew the verie like fore, to the mere silent, e, after the l, as. diuel, riuel, rauel, shouel. In which words, both the ending l, is single, as not bearing the fall of e. like to well, knell, swell: and the proportion is like to rifle, wifle, snafle, snufle, shuffle. The consonant before l, is not to be dubled, for making two sillabs of one, bycause the e, sounds not, which it should do of necessitie, if it made a syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lab. But why maie not these also be writen, riule, driule, diule &amp;c. letting the consonant v, answer hir cosin f. in wifle, trifle, rifle, the kinred betwene them being still so great, as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in wife, wiuè, thrift, thriuè, drift, driuè, and a number such.

For thereby we deliuer our peple, which know no foren learning, from seking of enfranchisments &amp; yet we leaue the learned, which know them, to the libertie of that, which theie know.

But why do som vse to put an u, after the strong g, in som places, as in guise, guide, guest, beguile, and not write them all without the u, and with the g onelie, as, girde, girth, girdle, getting? And why maie not these words be writen, gise gest, gide, begile, as well as begin, beget, seing both our g, is strong before these vowells, and the difference noted, and g, with the u after is of another propertie in vse, as <hi>language, guise, Guichiardine, Guin, guerdon?</hi> I se no cause why, but that the u,

maie well enough be left out.</p>
                  <p>H, is an aspiration, whose force before all vowells and diph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thougs <note place="margin">H.</note> is easie to be perceiued, as, <hi>Henrie, hunter, haue, him, home, hauthorn, how, hew, holdaie.</hi> Somtime it is writen, without anie force in vtterance, as in manie enfranchised words, as, <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, humble, hoste, hostice.</hi> Where the vowell after h, is heard, as if there went no aspiration before. What force the h, is of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter consonants in combination, I will shew streight waie.</p>
                  <p>K, serueth for the strong c, before e, and i, as in <hi>Kent, kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin,</hi>

K followeth s, where c, wold be weak, as in <hi>skirmish, skirt, skrap,</hi> otherwise c, as <hi>scape, scope, scour, sculler.</hi> Where the same force is dubled, the former also must be k, if the simple end in k, <hi>quikker, thikker, thwakker, of, quik, thik, thwak,</hi> otherwise c, maie serue and supply the room.</p>
                  <p>L, is still of one force in it self, as <hi>laudable, willing.</hi> Howbeit in respect of a, and o, going before it, and sounding like diph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thongs <note place="margin">L.</note> it is dubled in the end of such words, as <hi>small, call, brall, boll, roll, troll.</hi> But when anie other consonant followeth l, the a, and o sound still like diphthongs, and yet the l, is but single, as in <hi>false, salt, malt, halt, cold, old, colt, dolt, rolf, bold, bolt.</hi> Hereupon, <hi>all,</hi> in composition before a naturall consonant, hath but a single l, as <hi>albeit, also, almost,</hi> otherwise a duble, as in <hi>allwaie, allhail, allone.</hi> Where it maie be dowted whether the president of these two, <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>oll,</hi> maie not induce the dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of all other terminations in l, as <hi>well, bell, shrill, still, full, scull,</hi> which dubling of the last ll, semeth most agreable both to reason and vse, where the vowells sound hard vpon the l, as it doth in these.

It is the swiftnesse of the pen sure, which
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:13245:71"/>
can hardlie staie vpon the single ending l, that causeth this dubling.</p>
                  <p>M, and n, of themselues continew in the same force still, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit som negligence in writing giueth occasion of this note. <note place="margin">M, n, p.</note> That whereas both m, and n, be somtime signified by a title, that title<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> answereth the m, &amp; n, onelie, which endeth the syllab, and not the other, which beginneth, as in <hi>begin-ni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, benu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-med, so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-mo-ni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g.</hi> And therefor that title, which will represent m, or n, aforegoing is mere false, &amp; ill abused. P, is euer one, ph, shalbe streight spoken of.</p>
                  <p>Q. serueth onelie in the natur of k, or the strong c, to go before the single or duble w, both cosonantlike in force, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different <note place="margin">Q.</note> in place, as <hi>quill, quail, acquaint, quince, squint, squall squat, squese,</hi> or with the duble w, <hi>qwail acqwaint, qwik, qwince,</hi> saue where the enfranchisment requireth the single u, as in <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, quantitie, require, quintessence.</hi>

The polysyllab therefor for the chefe girk of his sound riseth vpon the third syllab from the end, as the bissyllab doth of the second. And bycause the large doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie comprise the lesse within it, therefor the rules of the first &amp; second syllabs, hold in the polysyllabs, where the companie of <note place="margin">1.</note> mo syllabs causeth anie one to be the lest noted: onelesse som speciall occasion for difference sake make the verie last, or the last saue one to be thought on and noted, as in <hi>concordance, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting, grassehopper</hi> and such, the second syllab short is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of our tung contrarie to the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rule of time, tho not

Generallie here is to be noted, that there is no figur lakking in our words, which is receiued in the learned tungs, and ar by them called <hi>metaplasms,</hi> or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the words form and fauor. Bycause the finer English peple vse to pronounce their words with a delicacie euen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the gallant speches, which delicacie being set down in writing, sheweth the vse of those <hi>metaplasms,</hi> to be no lesse in ours, then it was in theirs.</p>
               <p>Secondlie we ar oftimes enforced to break our words in the <note place="margin">2.</note> latter end of out lines, and to write out that in the beginning of the next line, which we left vnwriten in the former. For tho it be said of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> that he vsed to write the remnant of his word in the end, vnder the same line with a croked stroke about it, yet it is handsomer to write it in the next line, bycause we vse not <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> for an example in learning tho we do it in gouernment. Wherefor it is good to know not onelie how manie letters go to a syllab in euerie simple and vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound word, but also which be the full partes of euerie <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,</hi> that the hole words in <hi>composition</hi> maie be deuided to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, as all the letters of one syllab ar to go togither, as in <hi>cramp-ring,</hi> not <hi>cram-pring,</hi> in <hi>dis-honest,</hi> not <hi>dish-onest,</hi> like <hi>dish-clout,</hi> in <hi>as-well,</hi> not <hi>a-swell,</hi> in <hi>as-much,</hi> not <hi>a-smuch,</hi> Which consideration tucheth not onelie such as write, but also such as spell out of writing, bycause those letters ar to be spelled togither which ar to be writen togither.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie the knowledge of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>position is good to discern the <note place="margin">3.</note> difference of meaning, which is to be expressed in writing. For when the same words be so placed, as theie maie be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strewed simply or ioyntly theie brede the fallax, which is called the error by deuiding those words, which ar to be vnited, or by vniting those which ar to be deuided, as <hi>a-wry, a-waie, be-long, begin,</hi> &amp; such other, haue great diuersitie in their force being <hi>compound</hi> from that which theie haue when theie be single.

               <p>Fiftlie <hi>composition</hi> must be well considered for two other speciall points, both in writing and spelling, besides these, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">5.</note> it shaketh two generall rules in spelling and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlie in breaking of the syllabs. Whereof the first is, that if a <note place="margin">1</note> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sonant com betwene two vowells, it is to be spelled with the latter, as in <hi>me-mo-rie, se-di-ti-ous.</hi> The second is, that those <note place="margin">2.</note> consonants must be spelled togither, which maie begin a word in the same combination, as <hi>be-smear,</hi> bycause we saie <hi>smart, smatch.</hi> Now <hi>composition,</hi> breaketh both these rules, for against the first it will saie, <hi>red-olent, ab-olish.</hi> And against the second it will saie. <hi>Trans-pose,</hi> not <hi>tran-spose,</hi> tho we saie <hi>spent, spoun,</hi> by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in distribution, which spelling doth imply, euerie parcell must haue his own letter.</p>
               <p>Now as the knowledge of composition, is verie necessarie for the right writing of our tung, vpon these and such other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, so it is no hard thing to com by, bycause neither the naturall English compounds, nor yet the enfranchised stranger do offer anie difficultie in their knowing. For the general table which followeth conteining all our simple words either there named, or by their proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be easilie reclamed to the same cadence, whensoeuer two or mo of those simples go into one, it will saie itself, that this word is a compound, which maie easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie be proued by comparing the compound with the simples, if anie be so simple, that he cannot discern a compound which bringeth all his simples with their own letters, without the help of a table. <hi>Farewell, warfare, waiward, toward,</hi> be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds, whose simples be, <hi>fare, war, well, waie,</hi> or <hi>awaie, ward, to,</hi> and ar to be found in the table.</p>

the first syllab long and the latter short, or rather pirrichies ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing both short, <hi>perfit, peuish, trauĕll, record,</hi> which differeth much fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>recōrding,</hi> and <hi>recōrder,</hi> of <hi>recōrde,</hi> the spondè. Again <note place="margin">2.</note> those primitiues which end in a quik diphthong do shorten the same dipthong in their deriuatiues as <hi>fĕllow, follow, hăllow, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, follower, hallowed,</hi> whereas <hi>allow, endow, delaie, enioy,</hi> bring furth, <hi>endewed, allowance, anoyance.</hi> Again if the primitiue <note place="margin">3.</note> simple word haue the qualifying, e, in the end, as the vowell before it is sharp and long, so is it in the deriuatiue, as <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, prescribing, endure enduring.</hi> If the primitiue or simple word haue not, e, in the end, the vowell before the last conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is short &amp; quik in both the primitiue &amp; the deriuatiue, as <hi>perfit, perfiting, fortun, fortŭnat, natur, natŭrall,</hi> onelesse the primitiues single ending consonant be dubled in the deriua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, as <hi>concur, concurring.</hi> In which case either of dubling the same consonant, or of position by diuerse, the syllab is somtime lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, as <hi>forbid, forbidding, transport, transpōrting,</hi> somtime short, as <hi>gospell, gospĕller, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forting.</hi> This shortnesse or le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of time in the deriuatiues is a great leader, where to write or not to write the qualifying, e, in the end of simple words. For who will write, <hi>natur, perfit, measur, treasur,</hi> with an, e, in the end knowing their deriuatiues to be short, <hi>natŭrall, perfitlie, measŭred, treasŭ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer?</hi> &amp; who will not write, <hi>procure, endure, allure, endite, requite,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. e.</note> with an, e, finding their deriuatiues, <hi>procūrer, endūrance, allūre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, endīting, requītall,</hi> to haue the last saue one long? whereby the vse of the qualifying, e, is more then most euident. Whence also this generall rule for the writing thereof is to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that if ye desire to know whether the qualifying, e, be to be writen in the end of anie word or no, ye must vse the help of som deriuatiue, whether of two or of mo syllabs, whereby the time and tune of the deriuatiue, the, e, or not, e, in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall is perceiued. For if the deriuatiue be long and shrill, the primitue hath, e, as <hi>presuppose, conclude, remoue, prepare</hi> must be writen with, e, bycause the last syllab saue one in <hi>presuppōsing conclūding, remōuing, prepāred,</hi> is long. And again, <hi>fortun profit, comfort,</hi> must haue no, e, bycause <hi>fortŭnat, profiting, comforter,</hi> haue the last saue one short.

will serue for time, that where the last saue one in the deriua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue is short, the last in the primitiue is also short, as <hi>comforting, ransăking, comfort, ransăk,</hi> and the contraries long. The other syllabs besides these for both time and time in natur, follow the direction of the last syllab, as theie do also for the force of euerie vowell, diphthong, consonant or combination. Thus much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning time at this time. The <hi>sharp accent</hi> is a streight line ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing toward the right hand, which sheweth that the vowell or <note place="margin">Accents, sharp.</note> diphthong, ouer which it is, must be sounded sharp and high, as <hi>ráge, crépe, mine, hóme, púre.</hi>

But after that the desire of learning enflamed studie, the longing for gain brought in great traffik, the delight to range, did cause men trauell, new oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions brought furth new words, as either more cunning made waie to more terms, or as strange deuises did seke strange deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueries. For when the minde is fraught with matter to deliuer, it is still in pain vntill it haue deliuered, and therefor to haue the deliuerie such, as maie discharge the thing well, and content all parties, both by whom and to whom the matter is deliuered, it seketh both home helps, where theie be sufficient, and signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, and where the own home yeildeth nothing at all, or not pithie enough, it craueth help of that tung, from whence it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the matter of deliuerie. Hence commeth it that we haue our tung commonlie both stored and enlarged with our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours speches, and the old learned tungs. A thing not proper to vs alone, but commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all those, which vse anie speche in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters more then ordinarie, naie in matters aboue the brutish. The necessitie of these foren words must nedes be verie great bycause the number of them is so verie manie, as it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear most plainlie by the generall table, where hole ranks of <hi>enfranchised</hi> terms do match togither in one front. To whom we ar much beholden, for that theie vouchsafe to be com English to serue our nede, as their peple ar to thank our tung, for returning the like help, in cases of like nede, tho their occasions to vse ours be nothing so often, as ours to vse theirs.</p>

to the vse of those that be learned, least if theie will not, theie misse as foullie in the writing of them, as theie vse them mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, in mistaking their meaning. And again the learned in their <hi>enfranchising</hi> them must nedes haue their eie, vpon our <hi>proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

To proue anie of these things by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, which be euerie where so commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it shall not nede. In this verie chapter of <hi>enfranchisment,</hi> tho I do not affect anie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie forenism, yet how manie foreners am I constra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to vse? <hi>Uerie, chapter, enfranchisment, affect, extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, foren, forenism, constrained, vse,</hi> in this last sentence do easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie proue, that it were to foren from the matter, to seke exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples offoren words. Wherefor to knit vp this note of <hi>enfranchis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in few words, the English rule for writing, must be the right thereof, tho it kepe still manie signes of a stranger, tho yet incorporat with vs, which rule the <hi>Italia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

If ye will nedelie kepe the clear foren, it were good to vse the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie premunition, (that it is so writen in the primitiue tung.) And whereas the learnedder sort, as <hi>Tullie</hi> him self, allow not the enterlacing of <hi>Greke</hi> words in <hi>Latin,</hi> the meaning of that their saing tendeth to this my conclusion. For if we haue of our own, as significant and as proper, what nede a rich man to be a thefe? If we haue either none or not so toward, why in our own nede, shall we not <hi>enfranchis</hi> forenners? If we mean to vse them but for a time, or to som end the premunition will be our warrant. If we mean to make them ours, then let them take an othe to be trew to our tung, and the ordinances thereof. If this point be not agrëid on, great inconueniences will follow, and all the rules, which be kept in our tung, must take exception against the foren, or the foren against them, when theie com to the writing.</p>
               <p>Wherefor it will proue best for all parts, that our tung, &amp; the rules of hir right writing be made the generall right. For the naturall words, the propertie is hir own, for the foren the vse
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:13245:88"/>
is hirs, and therefor the handling of them to hir own best.</p>
               <p>Neither must anie learned man think it strange to write fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Englished terms after an English ear, tho it be contrarie to his acquaintance, seing it is not contrarie to the custom of his cuntrie. Neither is it anie embasing to learning, to lend the common man the vse of his learning, tho he kepe the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: neither yet both to se, and suffer the learneddest terms that he hath, to com vnder an English hand, seing there is no dishonor ment them, where there be made peres to our own. Thus much at this time concerning the right writing of foren words, when theie becom ours to vse, and attire themselues to the English complexion, which we ourselues think reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable well of, and I as well as anie, what account soeuer my thinking maie be of, in such an argument, as I haue thought thus much of.</p>

               <p>I Said before, that those men, which will giue anie certain direction for the writing of anie tung, or for anie thing else, which concerneth anie tung, must take som period in the tung, or else their rules will proue vnrulie. For euerie tung hath a certain ascent from the meanest to the height, and a discent again from the height to the meanest, the one in the remouing kinde, as the other was in mounting. And as in the ascent it is not yet com to the assurance of note, bycause it is not thorouglie artificiall, so in the discent it growes not worth the noting, bycause it becoms rude again, and in a maner withered. Hence commeth it, that <hi>Demosthenes</hi> his age is the prince of <hi>Grece, Tullies</hi> age the flour of <hi>Rome,</hi> whose tungs if learned writing had not commended to the tuition of books, theie had ben of small worth, naie of no remembrance, long before this daie: as the spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tungs of the same soils beginning in their daies to change, be now quite altered, or at the least nothing like that, where the carnation grew, tho full of good flowers in an other kinde.

after those mens ages, and by comparing them with these, ye shall se the ods that I speak of, and the one to rude to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the other departing from their rule, and yeilding to a change. This period of mine, and these risings to mount, as the dismounting again, till decaie ensew, do giue vs to wit, that as all things else, which belong to man be subiect to change, so the tung also is, which changeth with the most, and yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neweth with the best. Whereupon it must nedes be that there is som sóulish substance in euerie spoken tung, which fedeth this change, euen with perceptible means, that pretend altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For if anie tung be absolute, and fré from motion, is is shri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp in books; and not ordinarie in vse, but made immortall by the register of memorie.</p>
               <p>This secret misterie, or rather quikning spirit in euerie spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <note place="margin">VVhat prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue is.</note> tung, and therefor in ours, call I <hi>prerogatiue,</hi> bycause when <hi>sound</hi> hath don his best, when <hi>reason</hi> hath said his best, when <hi>custom</hi> hath effected, what is best in both, this <hi>prerogatiue</hi> will except against anie of them all, and all their rules, be theie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so generall, be theie neuer so certain. Whereby it maketh a waie to a new change that will follow in som degré of the tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, if the writers period be chosen at the best. I cannot compare this customarie <hi>prerogatiue</hi> in speche to anie thing better, then vnto those, which deuise new garments, and by law ar left to the libertie of deuise. Hence cummeth it in apparell, that we be not like ourselues anie long time, tho the best &amp; most semelie (like an artificial rule) do best please the wisest peple. But by the waie is it not a maruell, that the period of a tung, being so quik an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, shall continew lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, then the fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of apparell, being a thing so thought on, &amp; sadlie misformd?

quintessence the leader to change in a thing that is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie changeable, and yet not blamed for the change, som not verie well aduised peple, esteme as an error, and a priuat misuse contrarie to <hi>custom,</hi> bycause it semes to be a verie imperious controller, but theie ar deceiued. For in dede this <hi>prerogatiue,</hi> tho it chek generall conclusions, thorough priuat oppositions, yet that opposition came not of priuat men, but it is a priuat thing it self, and the verie life blood, which preserueth tungs in their naturall best from the first time that theie grew to accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, till theie com to decaie, &amp; a new period growen, different from the old, tho excellent in the altered kinde, and yet it self to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and make roum for another, when the circular turn shall haue ripened alteration.</p>
               <p>I take this present period of our English tung to be the verie height thereof, bycause I find it so excellentlie well fined, both for the bodie of the tung it self, and for the customarie writing thereof, as either foren workmanship can giue it glosse, or as homewrought hanling can giue it grace. When the age of our peple, which now vse the tung so well, is dead and departed there will another succede, and with the peple the tung will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and change. Which change in the full haruest thereof maie proue comparable to this, but sure for this which we now vse, it semeth euen now to be at the best for substance, and the brauest for circumstance, and whatsoeuer shall becom of the English state, the English tung ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not proue fairer, then it is at this daie, if it maie please our learned sort to esteme so of it, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow their trauell vpon such a subiect, so capable of ornament, so proper to themselues, and the more to be honored, bycause it is their own. The force of <hi>prerogatiue</hi> is such as maie not be disobeied tho it seme to disorder som well ordered rule, and cause som peple wonder which weie not the cause.</p>
               <p>Wherefor when anie note shall com in place quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the common not <hi>custom,</hi> but precept, then must we nedes think of <hi>prerogatiues</hi> power, a great princesse in proces, and a parent to corruption, but withall intending to rase another <hi>Phenix</hi> from the formet ashes. Which <hi>prerogatiue,</hi> who soeuer he be, that will not graunt to anie tung, denyeth it to haue life, onelesse his meaning be, by registriug som period in it of most

excellent note to restraine <hi>prerogatiue,</hi> and to preserue the tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, which he enrolleth by writing from the peples prophaning, by making of it learned, and exempting it from corruption, as our book la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guages be, whose rule is so certain, as theie dream of no change. This <hi>prerogatiue</hi> and libertie, which the peple hath to vse both speche and pen at will, is the cause, and yet not bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med therefor, why the English writers be now finer, then theie were som hundreth yeares ago, tho som antiquarie, will take the old writing to be finer. But the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is wherein finenesse standeth. So was <hi>Salust</hi> deceiued among the <hi>Romans,</hi> liuing with eloquent <hi>Tullie,</hi> and writing like ancient <hi>Cato.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in one generall word to tuch both this <hi>prerogatiue,</hi> and <note place="margin">That the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neddest tungs agre with vs in this kinde of precept.</note> my other six rules, with the verie generall method, where with I haue traced the right of our writing, I do take them all to be verie well grounded, neither is there anie thing at all, set down by me in waie of obseruation concerning the tung, be it neuer so strange, or rather seme it neuer so strange, but it is as artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, and of as sure note, as the best language is. Which I shall not nede in this so petie a principle to proue by particulars, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to raise vp again a sort of horieheded writers, both gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians and greater in the verie best speches, from out of their graues to subscribe to my rules. It is enough for me that the learned find this trew in their own trauell, and that the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned be content to beleue the learned, that I vtter a truth, tho I bring not in a <hi>Priscian,</hi> or anie <hi>Priscianlike</hi> ortografer or anie of the twelue old grammarians likned to the nine muses and the thre graces in the <hi>Latin</hi> tung. Which tung I rest still on, as commonlie best known to our bookish peple. That my cuntrie <hi>custom</hi> doth fight stoutlie for me, that euen <hi>sound</hi> it self is sound of my side, and that the best <hi>reason,</hi> is my greatest frind, naie my verie good Ladie, no man I hope will deny me, being so redie to content him, but more redie to procede, and perform mine enterprise.</p>
               <p>In this writing <hi>prerogatiue,</hi> the verie pen it self is a great doer <note place="margin">That the pen will haue a stroke in both fashoning &amp; vsing the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> and of maruellous autoritie, which bycause it is the secretarie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and executeth all, that the wit ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deliuer, presumeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for much, &amp; will venter as far, as anie counseller else, of what soeuer calling, tho neuer against <hi>reason,</hi> whose instrument it is

to satisfie the sight, as the tung doth the ear. <hi>Custom,</hi> (whose charge <hi>prerogatiue</hi> is, as the pen is his conueier) fauoreth the pen excedinglie much, and will not stik to stand to it, that a dash with a pen maie hold for a warrant, where both dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch for spede, and grace for fair letter bid the pen be bold. Hence cummeth it that so manie zeds in our tung ar herd, &amp; so few sene, for dexteritie and spede in the currantnesse of writing And as the pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can do this, so I do take it that our verie tung vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>But it maie be said that all our exceptions of most reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>prerogatiue,</hi> maie be well reduced to the generall form, as why not <hi>whome, moste, whear, thear, hear,</hi> and a number such, as well as, <hi>home, coste, fear,</hi> and such, which I contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie not at all, tho I se som difficultie in altering that, which our <hi>custom</hi> hath so grasped. And it were to much almost to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that of anie wise and learned man, so to arrest exceptions, chefelie in such a thing, as will not proue a standard, tho he that wisheth this, seme to conceiue such a thing, which tho it were granted, yet wold it break out again furth with som other waie, and cause a greater gap. Bycause no banks can kepe it in so strait, bycause no strength can withstand such a stream, bycause no vessell can hold such a liquor, but onelie those banks which in flowing ar content to be somtimes ouerrun, onelie those staies which in furie of water will bend like a bulrush, onelie that vessell which in holding of the humor, will receiue som it self, as allowing of the relice. If anie ignorant pen, either ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantlie, or vpon ignorant ground, tho pretending knowlege and good resolution, do offend against <hi>reason,</hi> and intrude vpon <hi>prerogatiue,</hi> that is no right quill, neither auowed by me, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that currant is to be called <hi>custom,</hi> which holdeth by vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, neither that cause to be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted <hi>reason,</hi> which hath other beginning, then right knowlege, or other ending, then the natur of that thing, wil seme to admit, for whom that <hi>reason</hi> speaketh.

               <p>These be the notes which I promised to giue for the ordering of our tung, &amp; the right writing thereof, wherein if I haue hit right, the right will be my warrant, yea tho it seme not right to som, wherein I comfort my selfe tho I content not all. <hi>Aristides</hi> once made an oration to the peple of <hi>Athens,</hi> and was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie well liked, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with som clapping of hands, or som popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar shout, which generall liking he so misliked, as he asked som frind, who stood next vnto him, what ill he had spoken, bycause it was so liked, as if it were not possible for anie good thing to win general liking, tho the right be rightlie honored of hir own children, as our greatest &amp; best orator in scriptur speaketh. But as it shall please God, so shall my trauell take place if it please, I will be glad, if it please not I will not fear, so the displeased partie be no principall best. I wold neither be an <hi>Herod</hi> to be eaten with lice for the puf of great allowance, neither yet a <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> to shrink in <hi>Miloes</hi> right, for either crashing of armor, or craking of speche, my argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t being such, as wil bear it self out, &amp; my pacience such, as can abide time till either other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> se me &amp; allow if I deserue, or my self se my self, and amend mine own misse. It is an easie thing to find falt, &amp; therefor much vsed, it is hard to iudge right, and therefor not ordinarie. If learned secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries will hede their pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; skillfull correctors be charie of their print, neither will these things seme strange, neither <hi>prerogatiue</hi> be pointed at, but euerie right in writing be mesured by right in iudgement. And in verie dede as I said before, all my notes do more concern the pen, and the dispatch there, then the print and his statarie form. Now will I set down the generall table, which will supply all that by particular words, whatsoeuer is wanting in my generall precept.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="24" type="chapter">

AS I promised before, so now I will knit vp this argument of right writing with a generall table, wherein I haue gathered the most of those words, which we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie <note place="margin">Six causes to proue the vse of the table.</note> vse <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> our hole speche. Which table I take to be verie proper to this purpos, and vpon sundrie causes. First for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of my rules, with multitude of examples, which I proued <note place="margin">1. Multitude of examples.</note> with som few naie oft with som one, when I set them first down: a thing both plane, to enstruct a reader, &amp; also pithie, to enforce a rule by vertew of number.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, for the perfiting of <hi>proportion,</hi> a great officer in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting <note place="margin">2. Perfiting of proportion.</note> the pen, as being chefe marshall to set words in araie, according to their sounds. Which sounds bewraing themselues best in the last syllabs, as being therefor best hard, bycause theie ar last said, recomme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d themselues therein to the rule of <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> tho not without both nede, and hope of further help, for the first and midle syllabs, to haue their <hi>proportion</hi> thereby full and sutable in all. Which help this table promiseth, as precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie examining the beginning of words by order of the letter, as <hi>proportion</hi> sought out the ending thereof, by likenesse in sound. Which two syllabs, the first and last being certainlie known, if there be no mo, then all be known. But if there be mo, where the extremities be certain, the midle maie be sene.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie the <hi>enfranchised</hi> words, which we borow of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, being a great parcell of our ordinarie speche, bycause we <note place="margin">3. A catalog for enfranchisme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</note> deal so much with such matters, as enforce vs thereunto, while we vtter that which we learn, as theie do of whom we learn, not hauing of our selues to expresse that in speche, which we haue but of others to execute in dede: such a generall table is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient gide to deliuer them to our eies. Wherewith to cloie the rule of <hi>enfranchisment,</hi> where som few maie serue by waie of example, were either to duble them, if theie be in both, or to lame the table if theie be but in the rule: both great ouersights. Wherefor contenting the rule with sufficient number, to make it plane, I haue vsed the table for a common treasurie where to laie vp all.</p>
               <p>Fourthlie the affinitie betwene the rule, which examineth the <note place="margin">4. A supply to manie wants.</note> generall direction by particular proufs &amp; the particular poufs, which range themselues in order, by generall directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is so near
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:13245:91"/>
&amp; so great, as it cannot otherwise be, but that manie things will fall out in examining the table, which proues by particular, whereby the rules shalbe helpt: besides their confirming in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur of example: as the rules themselues, which direct in generall do offer that assurance, whereby the table shalbe staied, besides the sorting of particular words, into proportionat ranks.</p>
               <p>Fiftlie and last, the generall table is a mean to help ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and a waie to ease cunning. For the ignorant man, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">5. An help for ignorance and an ease for knowledge.</note> iudge of sounds by finenesse of his ear, will soon discern forms by sharpnesse of his eie, &amp; quicklie finde out the vse of a table, tho he seldom fele the sense of a rule. And the skilfull ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also, which can iudge of a rule, if he haue time to read it, in want of leisure to read, maie haue recourse to his table, and so satisfy the sudain, till conuenient time will giue him leaue to studie. The table therefor being a thing of such commoditie, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm rules, to perfit <hi>proportion,</hi> to discouer <hi>enfranchisments,</hi> to supply all wants, to help ignorance, and to ease knowledge: I haue so framed it, I hope, both for store of words, and choice of notes, as it shall perform all this, whereunto it is said to be so profitable.</p>
               <p>For the words, which concern the substance thereof: I haue gathered togither so manie of them both enfranchised and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, <note place="margin">Of words in the table.</note> as maie easilie direct our generall writing, either by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause theie be the verie most of those words which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie vse, or bycause all other, whether not here expressed or not yet inuented, will conform themselues, to the presidencie of these. If my leisur wold haue serued, I wold haue sought out mo, but these maie seme enough, which both serue the thing, &amp; discharge me. Who entending at the first to deal no lower, then the entrie to speche, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue bene forced further to deuise an Elementarie, a thing as different from my first pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos, as it is verie pertinent to the common profit.</p>
               <p>For the notes, besides the beginning letter, which I haue cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouslie <note place="margin">Of notes in the table.</note> obserued, both to find out most words by that kinde of method, and withall to perform that, which is required in a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to direct him that sekes by order of the letter, I haue had speciall regard to mine own rules, that both table &amp; rule agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one, my labour thereby maie sooner win allowance.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:13245:92"/>
Therefor when soeuer anie great cause of note doth offer it self, either in accent for <hi>distinction,</hi> or in change for <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or in strangenesse for <hi>deriuation,</hi> or in writing for <hi>enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisment,</hi> or in propertie for <hi>custom,</hi> either in penning or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing, bycause it reigneth in both: the accents ar set o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the consonants or vowells, which require <hi>distinction:</hi> the changing of <hi>proportion,</hi> the strangenesse of <hi>deriuation,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of <hi>custom</hi> is presentlie noted: and the <hi>enfranchised</hi> words be first set down in their naked and naturall colors, and after writen so as our cuntrie doth clothe them, and our <hi>custom</hi> doth allow them.</p>
               <p>This haue I don, and thus, which whether it be the right waie, <note place="margin">That this is the right waie to certain the trew writing of our English tung.</note> to direct our writing or no: that I leaue to other mens iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, contenting my self with these two reasons. First bycause I se those writers, which haue trauelled in other tungs, for the right writing thereof, whose labor also hath taken good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and euen at this daie doth gide all our studies, bycause <note place="margin">1. The president of best writers.</note> their successe proueth the rightnesse of their waie, to haue cut this same course, and by examining ech syllab to haue certained all, not by rasing new characts, but by ruling old <hi>custom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Second, bycause he which quite altereth the natur of such <note place="margin">2. The amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought not to alter substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce quite.</note> a thing, as is said to be corrupted, doth not amend the old falt but tendereth vs a new substance, as subiect to blame, as the former was, naie oftimes more, the deformitie thereof appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the face, and the infirmitie thereof not able to bear age, as the other did, in whose roum it cummeth. Whereas in dede in such a case, where the substance maie remain, tho som er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror be stript, a good director will first sift the certain right from the supposed wrong, and in ruling them both call <hi>custom</hi> to counsell, from whom the right came, as all men know, and by whom the wrong must be helpt, as theie that mark, maie se.</p>
               <p>But not to tary long in a matter so plane, and so examined before, this is most trew, that long and waking <hi>custom,</hi> in the matter of speche, wherein she commandeth without vsurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein she hath propertie without intrusion, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in she deals not without consideration, of force must haue hir
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:13245:92"/>
imperiall voyce, when the question is, what currant were best, for directing of the pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For that is no correction which wasteth the substance, but that washeth the accidents, and that in such sort, as the cuntrie <hi>custom</hi> will best admit, vpon former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</p>
               <p>Thus much haue I don for the right writing of our English tung, desiring my cuntriemen to think well of my labor, and themselues to trauell in furnishing out the rest, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deal with, if theie like of that which I haue hitherto don: if not, I wold be glad to be directed my self by som president of another, which shall taste of iudgement.</p>
               <p>Mine own course doth carie me quite another waie, from medling with such things, as this argument is: &amp; yet not altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so, but that where good cause shall offer occasion, and fit circumstance shalbe answerable to such cause, I wilbe verie redie to pleasur mine own cuntrie, to the vtmost of my power, yea euen in the middest of anie foren learning: Tho my drift be such, as I maie sooner minister occasion of much matter to such as will dwell vpon particular discourse, then my self digresse from that plat, which is alredie laied, being more then enough, to occupy anie one.</p>
               <p>It were a thing verie praiseworthie in my opinion, and <note place="margin">A perfit En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish dictiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie wished for.</note> no lesse profitable then praise worthie, if som one well lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and as laborious a man, wold gather all the words which we vse in our English tung, whether naturall or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate, out of all professions, as well learned as not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one dictionarie, and besides the right writing, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to the Alphabete, wold open vnto vs therein, both their naturall force, and their proper vse: that by his honest trauell we might be as able to iudge of our own tung, which we haue by rote, as we ar of others, which we learn by rule. The want whereof, is the onelie cause why, that verie manie men, being excellentlie well learned in foren speche, can hardlie discern what theie haue at home, still shooting fair, but oft missing far, hard censors ouer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ill executors themselues. For easie obtaining is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie to iudgement, not onlie in words, and naturall speche, but in greater matters, and verie important. Aduised &amp;

considerat cumming by, as it proues by those tungs, which we learn by Art, where time and trauell be the compassing means, emplanteth in wits, both certaintie to rest on, &amp; assurance to rise by. Our naturall tung cummeth on vs by hudle, and therefor hedelesse, foren language is labored, and therefor learned, the one still in vse and neuer will known, the other well known and verie seldom vsed. And yet contine wall vse should enfer know ledge, in a thing of such vse, as the naturall deliuerie of our minde and meaning is. And to saie the truth what reason is it, to be acquainted abrode, and a stranger at home? to know fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren tungs by rule, and our own but by rote? If all other men had ben so affected, to make much of the foren, and set light by their own, as we seme to do, we had neuer had these things, which we like of so much, we should neuer by comparing haue discerned the better. Theie proined their own speche, both to please themselues, and to set vs on edge: and why maie not we by following of their presidents be partakers of their praise? co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering the thing which we ar to deal in, of it self is so good, &amp; the presidents, which to follow, to be so manie &amp; so plane: as we can neither alledge anie want for direction, ne yet basenesse of argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to diliuer vs from trauell. For the matter of speche <note place="margin">That the mat ter of speche is worth the handling. The pen and voyce.</note> is a thing well thought of, whether ye waie the words and the forces which theie haue, or the vttering thereof by pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; voyce. Naturall nede vpon mere vse, commendeth the voyce, delite in mere vse commendeth fair speaking.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth fair writing. Which both ar so well estemed of, as there be particular Arts, verie cunninglie deuised to beautify them both. We nede not toproue by <hi>Platoes Cratylus,</hi> or <hi>Aristotles</hi> proposition as by best autorities, (tho men be sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to proue <note place="margin">The propertie of words.</note> their own inuentions) that words be voluntarie, and appointed vpon cause, seing we haue better warrant. For euen God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who brought the creatures, which he had made, vnto that first man, whom he had also made, that he might name them, according to their properties, doth planelie declare by his so doing, what a cunning thing it is to giue right names, and how necessarie it is, to know their forces, which be allredie giuen, bycause the word being knowen, which implyeth the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:13245:93"/>
the thing is half known, whose propertie is emplyed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of words, speche, &amp; pen being so necessarie, &amp; the trauelling in them being no lesse comendable, he that will deal in that which I haue said, shall both help nede in others, &amp; heap praise to himself, &amp; yet do nothing without manifold preside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

The <hi>Italian,</hi> the <hi>Frenche,</hi> the <hi>Spanish,</hi> at this daie vse the like naie theie go further, and make particular dictionaries euen to particular books, as <hi>Iohn Boccace</hi> alone hath a dictionarie for himself in the Italian tung. Now if such like English wits, in whom both learning and labor do concur, wold do so much for our tung, as these and the like haue don for theirs, naie as euen learners haue don, for those same tungs, which theie haue gained by labor, as <hi>Stephanus, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot, Calepine,</hi> for the latin and others for other: we should then know what we both write and speak: we should then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the depth of their conceits, which either coined our own words, or incorporated the foren. Whereas at this daie: we be skillfull abode and ignorant at home, wondring at others not waing our own.

               <head>CAP XXVI. The conclusion of this treatis concerning the right writing of our English tung.</head>
               <p>THis is that, which I had to saie concerning the right wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our English tung, both for the rules, which I haue obserued in dailie experience, and for the table, which I haue collected to confirm that experience. As for the right of my rules, I maie not take vpon me anie more certaintie, then the naturall force of such probable directions doth ordinarilie infer, which is to hold commonlie trew, and euer most likelie, from which probabilitie I wander not far, if my self maie be iudge. As for the table I sought in it, to write all the words ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generallie <note place="margin">That I do but enter and passe leauing the perfiting to who will.</note> after an English ear, neuer yeilding much to anie foren letter sauing onelie where som pretie occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vnto me, the duble writing of both the naturall English &amp; the the incorporate stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger. And yet I haue dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlie examined the originall grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of our <hi>enfranchised</hi> terms, which be one third part of our hole speche, tho I hold altogeather with our own writing, &amp; follow not their primitiue. For if the word it self be englishin dede, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it best in the natural hew, if it be a stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, &amp; incorporate among vs, let it wear our colors, sith it wil be one of vs. In both the rules &amp; table, I haue rather sought, by such an inductio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to stir vp som other to perform the enterprise, then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped my self to leaue it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plet. For it maie so fall out, that I haue hit vpon som truth, tho not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, &amp; again it maie so be, that I haue missed quite, &amp; cut a wrong course, &amp; yet by so doing, that I haue opened a waie vnto som other, by giuing such a light, either to amend my course if it like in part, or to shape a better by it, if it hollie mislike. Further, in both I haue bene verie care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full neuer to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>custom</hi> of my cuntrie, bycause I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire either to please with liking, or to mislike without displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. For where ane ordinarie <hi>custom</hi> doth seme of long time to haue made hir own choice, and that vpon good shew, she will either like him that cleaues to hir allowance, or not be displeased, where hir self is not misliked. And if there be anie hope to procure liking in such a thing as <hi>custom</hi> is to rule, it must nedes com by following, and not by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.

Enforcing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, or altering to far is almost desperate, if not altogither, bycause it hath alwaie mist, with losse of labor where it offered seruice.

               <head>CAP XXVII. Of the natur of an Elementarie institution.</head>
               <p>AS in dealing with the ortografie of our English tung, I haue dwelt verie long, bycause the argument is new, tho the handling be old, so in all the rest, I purpose to be short, bycause the arguments be old, tho the handling be new. Wherein I will kepe that same course whereunto I am led by the natur of an institution, which is, to enter the learner so far, as he maie cumpas with ease all that which followeth in the same kinde, if his institution be perfited. Hence cummeth it that so manie books in the latin tung bear the name of institutions bycause theie enter the young and vntrauelled student into that profession whereunto theie belong. Now in the framing of a good and proper institution, which must be both naturall to the profession wherevnto it entreth, and appropriate to the learner, which it must enter: there be two considerations chefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to be had, the one is of what <hi>cumpas</hi> the profession maie be, whom the institution leadeth, the other of what <hi>kinde.</hi> In the <hi>cumpas,</hi> we consider the vse thereof to direct our life, whether it stretch far, or but som small waie. In the <hi>kinde</hi> we consider
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:13245:121"/>
whether it be more in action, and lesse in contemplation, or contrarie wise. For according to these two considerations the institution must be fashioned. Bycause the professions of <hi>diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, law</hi> and <hi>physik,</hi> be of themselues verie large, for varietie of matter, and in vse verie nedefull, for their generall seruice, their institutions therefor ar commonlie great, as a fair gate doth best beseme a sumptuous pallace. The other faculties and Arts, as of argument vnder these, so of consequence lesse then these, nede but short institutions, as a litle dore doth best fit a pretie small bilding. Again, where the end of anie art, is hollie in doing, the institution wold be short, for hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of that end, by holding the learner toto long in musing vpon rules, as in our <hi>grammer,</hi> which is the institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to speche, there wold be no such length as is commonlie vsed, bycause the end thereof is to write and speak, which when we do most, we learn our grammer best, being applyed to matter, and not clogd with rules. As for the vnderstanding of writers: that cums by years and ripenesse of wit, not by rule of gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, anie otherwise then that grammer helpeth to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of tungs, whereby we vnderstand the arguments hid in them. But I will then handle these things, when I deal with grammer, next after mine elementarie. In the mean while that rule of <hi>Aristotle</hi> must be preciselie kept, whereby we ar taught, that the best waie to learn anie thing well, which must after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be don, when it is learned, is still to be a doing, while we be a learning. In this last kinde, whose rule is, to be short in precept, and much in practis, is this hole Elementarie, and therefor, I am to deliuer som pretie and few rules, pikt out of the verie substance of ech principle, which to kepe in practis, and then to set down, som well chosen presidents, whereupon to practis, neither laing on to much, to passe an institution, neither leauing out to much, to com to short of it, neither v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing but the best, to work the best effect. For an institution ought to be in lineament like the hole, as the infant to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, tho not so full grown, in working forcible as a strong renet in ech part pithie to sprede full in all, without anie defect, when it is to perform, least it proue it selflame, for not preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that, where the lamenesse appeareth: which wold not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

if either the institution it self had bene perfit, or the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of it full. For the failing that waie is oft in the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being not perfitlie made, but either swelling to much, or pent in to small, or not properlie cast: but it is more oft in the trainer himself, which cannot perform that, that is perfitlie set down. But least I proue long while I promis shortnesse, I will streight waie in hand with my first principle, which is that of <hi>Reading,</hi> wherein I will first appoint certain notes to direct the reader, and after som presidents, which seme fittest to be red. This treatis concerning the right writing of our English tung, tucheth the teacher and grown men more, out of the which I will still collect by waie of precept, and a short epitomé so much as shalbe necessarie for the young reader, to help his spelling, or the young writer to direct his hand right, ear I deal with the two principles.</p>

If I feared not that inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uience which commonlie enseweth, where two speak in an vnknown tung, and the third standing by thinks himself despised, bycause he vnderstands not, I wold haue sollicited my request in the latin tung, bycause the kinde of people, which I reuerence most, and whose frindlie opinion I do couet most, both desireth and deliteth to be dealt with in that tung, as being learned themselues.

               <hi>of his</hi> iustice <hi>in ciuill doings,) was likewise enforced by swaie of meditation to enter in thought of the hole course of learning, and to consider how euerie particular thing did arise in degre, one after another. For without that consideration, how could</hi>

               <hi>I haue discerned where to begin, how to procedè, and where to end, in anie one thinge, which dependeth vpon a sequele, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth from a principle, seing the matter which I deal with, is a matter of ascent, wherein euerie particular, that goeth before hath contine wall respect to that, which cummeth after, if the hole plat be artificiallie cast? As in this course of mine, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementarie principles maie resemble the first groundwork: the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of tungs the second stories: the after learning the vpper bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. Now as in</hi> Architecture <hi>and artificiall bilding, he were no good workma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which wold not cast his frame so, as ech of the ascents might be conformable to other: so in the degrees of learning, it were no masterlie part not to obserue the like, which cannot be obserued, before the hole be thought on, and thoroughlie fashioned in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties minde, which pretendeth the work.</hi> Plato <hi>in his platform for the finding out of iustice hath two great vantages of me. For both himself was so learned, as he is left to wonder, and his plat is in form, not fashioned for practis: whereby both his own autoritie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth credit to his work, and his work kepes countenance, being not chekt by practis, which is able to ouerthrow euen the best medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, being vnfit for performance tho bewtifull to behold by waie of contemplation.

               <hi>enterprise of mine cannot procede in that order, tho I could perform it as well as</hi> Plato <hi>could his bycause it mounteth still vp by waie of progression from one pece to another &amp; multiplieth infinite bycause of varietie in parts, which kinde of attempts abideth no one form aspectable at once, as</hi> Aristotle <hi>reasoneth, bycause of first &amp; last, which fal not in view togither at one time.

               <hi>branches, tho the main be within compas? Wherefor as in depe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of meditation I drew like to</hi> Plato, <hi>tho in depth of iudgement but his fleting follower: So in order of deliuerie I depart from him and vtter my wares by retailing parcels, which he did ingrosse: when I had considered the generall ascending method of all learning, which while it is in getting, mounteth vp by degrees, but when it is gotten, doth sprede through out the state as sinews, veins, and arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do through a naeturall bodie, and withall maintains the state in full proportion of his best being, no lesse then the other do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the bodie, me thought I did perceiue some great blemish in the hole bodie of learning, as</hi> Plato <hi>no doubt, in the ripping vp, of right did find to be in gouernment. And as</hi> Plato <hi>himself by his own teaching did confirm his own precepts, whereby he brought forth a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of rare men, as euen the sharpe</hi> Aristotle, <hi>&amp; the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> Demosthenes, <hi>and by his singular plat of chosen gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tho not all waie pleasing our religion and practis, did direct the best conceits of the most studious people: So for my simple skill in the same course, I haue armed my self, what so euer I shall set down by waie of precept, for the furtherance of learning, and hir recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie from blemish, to practis it my self, with that successe in schooling which it shall please god to blesse in me and mine, for president to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who will follow the plat, and with that allowance in writing, which my gentle reader shall bestow vpon it. For the plat of mine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementarie, and what I haue vndertaken for the penning thereof, it is sullie declared in the eleuenth title of this same book: For the performance thereof in the bringing vp of children, I haue all the principles there named on foot, within mine own house, vnder ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent maisters. Wherein I do more then mine Elementarie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. For mine Elementarie course is to haue the principles perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, before the childe deal with grammer: Mine execution now is by finding out of times, without losse of learnĩg (which I maie easilie do hauing the hole train within mine own sight) to help those prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples forward in such children, as wanted them before, or had som vnperfit, &amp; ar willing to learn them by apointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and my prouision. Which doing maie serue me for two proues, first, that all the principles maie be well learned singlelie, in their naturall order, when by waie of prouision theie maie be well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pased iointlie with the tungs. Secondlie, that it is a great thing,</hi>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:13245:125"/>
               <hi>which maie be performed in the Element arie train, where, conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place continueth all the doings within the masters sight, and the not chaunging of schools for diuers things, doth assure the profit without losse of time, or lingring by the waie. But to leaue speaking of the Eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tarie execution and to return to the pen and the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this my writing course: vpon this consideration, which caried me thus on after I had conceiued both where the blemishes laie: which disfigured learning, &amp; how to redresse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by waie of aduise to others, but in effect &amp; dede for mine own charge, I cam down to particulars: And began to examin, euen from the verie first, what went before the tungs in their orderlie trade of bringing vp chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there first schooling: which thing alone was my first impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in conceit, ear I fell to further thoughts: and my last resolution to tho with more aduice, when I had thought vpon the most. This examining of the hole fore train I took vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me so much the rather bycause I perceiued a great vntowardnesse in the learning of tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs, thorough som infirmities in the Elementarie grounding, which we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t before them. As what a toil is it to a grammer maister when the young infant which is brought him to teach, hath no Elementarie principle so grounded in him, as it maie bear a bilding? Wherefor considring the learned tungs do require a fundation, and carefull teachers som help of foretrain, I vndertook to rip vp all those things which concern the Eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tarie, a degre in teaching before the gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer train, by mine own trauell to ease a multitude of masters.

Naie is our hole life here in this miserable world, anie other thing, then a toilsom course, to com to som rest? or is the life after this in gods blessed kingdom anie other thing, then an endlesse rest, after ending trauell to such peple as seke for it by the right means to com by it? And as in that rest the hole assemblie of the chosen faithfull is all at rest, as euerie particular: so in this trauelling course, the generall end of anie hole state is a blessed peace, the great benefit of a mightie protectour, as in the same state the particular end of euerie priuat person is a blessed contentment, the great benefit of a mercifull god.

Our cuntrie is small, the thing the more easie our liuings within compas, the thing the more ned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: the enormitie great, the lesse able we to beare it: our prince lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the liker to giue ear: our peple of vnderstanding, the better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to enform her. But neither doth the physician thriue so, by the preseruing part of physik, nor the lawyer grow rich so, by taking vp of contentions, nor the diuine prosper so in a heauen, where all is good, as he doth in earth where, all is euill, tho the best in ech kinde do honor them most: And therefore profit wilbe followed, tho it be with confusion, redresse will not stir, bycause it iudgeth the world, to be in som falt, which it is loth to confesse. Howbeit to procure som redresse and help this waie, at the Princes hand, it standeth all them in hand, which make profession of learning, if theie do but consider the reputation of learning in these our daies, whether by insufficient professours, or contemned professions.</hi>

               <hi>In the professours of learning, to whose solliciting this point is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended, there be two things chefelie required. First that theie</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1</note> 
               <hi>studie soundlie themselues vpon stuf worth the studie, in order of right ascent, with mindes giuen to peace. For sound learning will not so soon be shaken at euerie eager point of controuersie, as the fleter will. Orderlie ascent groweth strong verie soon, &amp; a pacifik conceit is a furtherer to that end, which is both priuatlie minded, and publiklie intended. The consent of the learned, and their quiet inclination is a great blessing to anie common weal, but chefelie to ours in this contentious time, where the ouerwhetted mindes work verie small good to sons worthie professions. The distrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mindes, into sects and sorts of</hi> philosophie, <hi>did a might ie great displeasur to the quietnesse of that people, where the destrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Grece</note> 
               <hi>fell as it did our religion more, which spreding in that cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, where those sorts were nurished, was neuer in quiet sence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The second point required in a learned student is not so much to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2</note> 
               <hi>seke his own auancement, as the things, which he professeth, which if it take place, himself coms forward, bycause he hath the things. If he seke his own auancement, and either forget the thing, if he haue it, or care not for it, if he haue it not, the want of the thing</hi>

               <hi>will weaken his credit, tho it encrease hir own, as where the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant is blamed, there knowledge is allowed, tho the allower be not learned. He that studieth soundlie recommendeth good letters, by his own example: he that solliciteth other, who haue autoritie to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, aduaunceth them by aduertisment, he that exerciseth his pen to help the best currant, confirmeth his desire by the doing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. In this last kinde mine own labor trauelleth to seke for vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, to strip awaie the nedelesse, to supply som defects, to do mine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuor to help euerie one in as quiet a course, as I can temper my stile vnto. And tho somtimes I do sprede vpon cause in length of discourse, yet for the matter it self, which I will commend to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I wilbe short and sound enough, and leaue more to practis, then I will laie in precept. Thus much for the generalitie of learning, and the learned, to whose considerations I commit the solliciting, as to the magistrates the amendment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The second question, which I said might be demanded of me, why</hi>

               <hi>I do not follow som learned president of those writers, which haue delt this waie with great admiration, maie be answered verie soon. I confesse the number of them, which haue writen of the training vp of children, to be so manie in number, as either priuat cuntrie or priuate cause might moue to deal in it. I confesse the excellencie of manie in that kinde, as</hi> Bembus, Sturmius, Erasmus, <hi>and diuerse other. But we differ in circumstance. Afré citie, a priuat frind, and an hole monarchie, haue diuersities in respect, tho theie agré in som generalls, wherein those writers dissent not from me. Neither do I but follow good writers, fetching my first patern from such writers, as taught all those to write so well, a thing alredie proued in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter of this book. I am seruant to my cuntrie. For hir sake I trauell, hir circumstances I must consider, and whatsoeuer I shall pen, I will se it executed by the grace of God, mine own self, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade other the better by a tried prouf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third question for my writing in English, and my so carefull, (I will not saie so curious writing,) concerneth me somwhat, bycause it</hi> 
               <note place="margin">3. Of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish tung &amp; the penning in English.</note> 
               <hi>beareth matter. For som be of opinion, that we should neither write of anie philosophicall argument, nor philosophicallie of anie slight argument in our English tung, bycause the vnlearned vnderstand it not, the learned esteme it not, as a thing of difficultie to the one, and no delite to the other. For both the penning in English generallie,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:13245:130"/>
               <hi>and mine own penning in this order, I haue this to saie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>No one tung is more fine then other naturallie, but by industrie of the speaker, which vpon occasion offered by the kinde of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherein he liueth, endeuoreth himself to garnish it with elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, &amp; to enrich it with learning. The vse of such a tung, so elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent for speche, and so learned for matter, while it kepeth it self within the naturall soil, it both serues the own turn with great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and kindleth in the foren, which com to knowledge of it, a great desire to resemble the like. Hence came it to passe, that the peple of</hi> Athens, <hi>both bewtified their speche by the vse of their pleading, &amp; enriched their tung with all kindes of knowledge, both bred within</hi> Grece, <hi>and borowed from without. Hence came it to passe, that peple of</hi> Rome <hi>hauing platted their gouernment, much what like the</hi> Athenian, <hi>for their common pleas, became enamored with their eloquence, whose vse theie stood in nede of, and transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their learning, where with theie were in loue. Howbeit there was nothing somuch learning in the latin tung, while the</hi> Romane <hi>florished, as at this daie is in it by the industrie of stude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all</hi> Europe, <hi>who vse the latin tung, as a common mean, of their generall deliuerie, both in things of their own deuise, and in works translated by them. The</hi> Romane <hi>autoritie first planted the latin among vs here, by force of their conquest, the vse thereof for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of learning, doth cause it continew, tho the conquest be expired. And therefor the learned tungs so termd of their store, maie thank their own people, both for their fining at home, and their fauor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode. Wherevpon it falleth out, that as we ar profited by the mean of those tungs, so we ar to honor them euen for profit sake, and yet not so but that we maie cherish our own, both in such cases, as the vse thereof is best: and in such places, as it maie be bettered, tho with imparing of them. For did not those tungs vse euen the same means to braue themselues ear theie proued so beawtifull? Did the peple strain curtesie to pen in their naturall, euen these same arguments which theie had fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the foren? If theie had don so, we had neuer had their works, whereat we wonder so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There be two speciall considerations, which kepe the</hi> Latin, <hi>&amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learned tungs, tho chefelie the</hi> Latin, <hi>in great countenance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, the one thereof is the knowledge, which is registred in them, the other is the conference, which the learned of</hi> Europe, <hi>do</hi>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:13245:131"/>
               <hi>commonlie vse by them, both in speaking and writing. Which two considerations being fullie answered, that we seke them from</hi> profit <hi>&amp; kepe them for that conference, whatsoeuer else maie be don in our tung, either to serue priuat vses, or the beawtifying of our speche, I do not se, but it maie well be admitted, euen tho in the end it displa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the</hi> Latin, <hi>as the</hi> Latin <hi>did others, &amp; furnished it self by the</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin <hi>learning. For is it not in dede a meruellous bondage, to becom seruants to one tung for learning sake, the most of our time, with losse of most time, whereas we maie haue the verie same treasur in our own tung, with the gain of most time? our own bearing the ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full title of our libertie and fredom, the</hi> Latin <hi>tung remembring vs, of our thraldom &amp; bondage? I loue</hi> Rome, <hi>but</hi> London <hi>better, I fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor</hi> Italie, <hi>but</hi> England <hi>more, I honor the</hi> Latin, <hi>but I worship the</hi> English. <hi>I wish all were in ours, which theie had from others, neither offer I them wrong, which did the like to others, and by their own president do let vs vnderstand, how boldlie we maie ventur, not withstanding the opinion of som such of our peple, as desire rather to please themselues with a foren tung, wherewith theie ar acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then to profit their cuntrie, in hir naturall language, where their acquaintance should be. It is no obiection to saie, well ye rob those tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs of their honor, which haue honored you? or which if theie had not bene to make you learned, you had not bene to strip them of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> learning? For I honor them still, &amp; that so much as who so doth most, euen in wishing mine own tung partaker of their honor. For if I had them not in great admiration, bycause I know their valew, I wold not think it to be anie honor for my cuntrie tung to resemble their grace. I confesse their furnitur and wish it were in ours, which was taken from other, to furnish out them. For the tungs which we studie, were not the first getters, tho by leerned trauell the proue good kepers, and yet readie to return and discharge their trust, when it shalbe demanded in such a sort, as it was committed for term of years, and not for inheritance. And therefor no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace where theie did receiue with condition to deliuer, if theie do deliuer, when theie ar desired. But a dishonor to that tung, which hath a deliuerie both deuised and tendered, and will not receiue it. From which dishonor I wold</hi> English <hi>were fré, and that learning receiued, which is redie to be deliuered. I confesse their good fortun, which had so great a forestart, before other tungs as theie be most</hi>

               <hi>is said somwhat hardlie to vnderstand, and so'after to the other, for the maner and word. Wherein I praie you doth that hardnesse consist, which is fathered vpon matter? Or rather doth not all hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse procede from the person, and none from the thing, not onelie in this case, but eueriewhere else? If that person which vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to teach, do not know the matter well, which he is to teach to laie it so open, as it maie well be vnderstood, seing the best and first mean to plane opening, is perfit vnderstanding, is the thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for hard, which is not thoroughlie had? Or if that person, which should vnderstand, either do not in dede thorough mere ignorance, or cannot in dede through small knowledge, or will not of a will tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough som corrupt affection, is the thing therefor hard, which is so</hi>

               <hi>strangelie crost by infirmitie in the partie? Sure there is not.

For what be those things, which we handle in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? Ar theie not of our own choice? Ar theie not our own inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Ar theie not the supplyes of our own nede? And was not the first inuentour, verie well able to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the thing, which he did inuent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did persuade it? Or did those men, which admitted the thing being inuented, make choice thereof before theie were instructed, wherefor it wold serue? Or could blunt ignorance haue won such a credit in a doutfull case, tho it prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded profit, to haue bene beleued, before it had perswaded by plane euidence? To haue the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ear it were perceiued, that it wold be profitable, not onelie for the present, but in time to com also, and that in euerie mans eie, which had anie foresight? If the first could do so both in finding and perswading, both in first admitting, and still continewing, his follower must do so, or be in falt himself, and deliuer the thing from opinion of hardnesse, which riseth of himself, being not well appointed for sufficient deliuerie. If the partie which readeth do not conceiue the thing well, bycause he is ignorant, he is to be pardoned, the disease proceding from mere infirmitie: But if he do not, bycause he will not, hauing abilitie to do, tho not with the most, he is punished enough by being peuish ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: if he can do with the best, &amp; will deal with the worst, blinded vnderstanding is the greatest darknesse, &amp; punisheth the ill humor with deprauing of reason, which should iudge right. If the partie deliuerer be himself weak, where mine own part coms in, being a deliuerer my self, he is either vnaduised, if he write ear that he know, or not well aduised if he me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not, where he misseth so he know wherein, and can tell how. Yet the readers curtesie is som couert against error, for him that writeth, as his pardon is protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for him, that readeth, if simple ignorance be their onelie falt, without further want or defect in good will. It fareth oftimes with readers in the iudging of books, as it doth with beholders in iudging of fauor, as it doth with tasters in iudging of relice. In the matter of fauor where louing is, all things be amiable, where lothing is, there nothing is liked, no not beawtie it self. But where affection is</hi>

               <hi>voided and reason in place, being able to iudge, there beawtie is beawtie, and deformitie is ill fauored, and euerie thing so weighed, as it is worth in dede. The like varietie is in matters of diet, a sik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish humor can relice nothing well, an ouergiuen delite likes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, but his own choice: an healthfull humor, and a right taste neither ouerlothes with siknesse, nor ouerloues with fant sie, but measureth what he t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

For if plane humors must still be pleased, and be delt withall, so daintilie, as theie be put to no pains, to learn and enquire, where theie find difficultie, thorough their own not knowing: If theie must be made a lure for learning to discend to, in euerie kinde, and rather to dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate hir self, then to desire them, to learn to look vp, what state standeth skill in?

Trauell is the coin, which is currant in heauen, for which and by which almightie God doth sell his best wares, tho of his great goodnesse, he do somtime more for som kinde of wits, in quiknesse and cunning, euen without great labor, tho not without anie, then anie labor can work in som other, to giue vs to wit, that his mercie is the mistresse, when our labor learns best.
