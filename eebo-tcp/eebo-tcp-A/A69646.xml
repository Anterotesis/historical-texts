         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Book which among other great and high points of reformation, contains as a principall part thereof, this treatise here presented, Supreme Court of Parlament, was by the famous Author <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> dedicated to <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt: whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable youth doubtless bad brought forth to the Church of England such a glorious manbood, bad his life reacht it, as would have left in the affairs of religion, nothing without an excellent pattern for us now to follow. But since the secret purpose of divine appointment hath reserv'd no lesse perhaps then the just half of such a sacred work to be accomplisht in this age, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, as we trust, by your succesful wisdom and authority, religious Lords and Commons, what wonder if I seek no other, to whose exactest judgement, and revieu I may commend these last and worthiest labours of this renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned teacher: whom living, all the pious nobility of those reforming times, your truest and best imitated ancestors, reverenc't and admir'd. Nor was be wanting to a recompence as great as was himself; when both at many times before, and especially among his last sighs and prayers testifying his dear and fatherly affection to the Church and Realm of England, he sincerely wisht in the hearing of many devout men, <hi>that what he had in this his last book <note place="margin">* Nicol. de obit Bri.</note>written to King</hi> Edward <hi>concerning discipline, might have place in  this Kingdom. His hope was then that no calamity, no confusion, or deformity would happen to the Common-wealth; but otherwise he fear'd, lest in the midst of all this ardency to know God, yet by the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of discipline, our good endeavours would not succeed.</hi> These re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable words of so godly and so eminent a man at his death, as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by a sufficient and well known witnes, who heard them and inserted by <hi>Thuanus</hi> into his grave and serious history, so ought they to be chiesly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd by that nation for whose sake they were utter'd, and more especially by that general Counsel which represents the body of that nation. If therfore the book, or this part therof, for necessary causes, be now reviv'd and recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the use of this undisciplin'd age, it hence appears that these reasons

have not err'd in the choyee of a fit patronage, for a discourse of such impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But why the whole tractat is not beer brought entire, but this matter of divorcement selected in particular, to prevent the full speed of some mis-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, I hasten to disclose. First, it will be soon manifest to them who know what wise men should know, that the constitution and reformation of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, if <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did not mis-reform, is, like a building, to begin ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Next, there being yet among many, such a strange iniquity and perversnes against all necessary divorce, while they will needs expound the words of our Saviour not duly by comparing other places, as they must doe in the resolving of a hunder'd other Scriptures, but by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting deafely in the abrupt and Papistical way<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Lastly, I find it cleer to be the authors intention that this point of divorcement should be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And therfore having reduc't his model of reformation to 14. heads, he bestows al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as much time about this one point of divorce, as about all the rest; which also was the judgement of his heirs and learned friends in Germany, best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his meaning; who first publishing this his book by <hi>Oporinus</hi> at <hi>Basil</hi> (a Citie for learning and constancie in the the true faith, honorable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the first) added a special note in the title, <hi>that there the reader should finde the doctrine of Divorce handl'd so solidly, and so fully, as scars the like in any Writer of that age:</hi> and with this particular commendation they doubted not to dedicate the book, as a most profitable &amp; exquisit discours, to <hi>Christian</hi> the <hi>3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>,</hi> a worthy &amp; pious King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> as the author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had done before to our <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt.

Nevertheless being farre otherwise dealt with by some, of whose profession and supposed knowledge I had better hope, and esteem'd the deviser of a new and pernicious paradox, I felt no difference within me from that peace &amp; firmnes of minde, which is of neerest kin to patience and contentment: both for that I knew I had divulg'd a truth linkt inseparably with the most fundamental rules of Christianity, to stand or fall together, and was not un-inform'd that divers ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and judicious men testify'd their d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yet at length it hath pleas'd God, who had already giv'n me satisfaction in my self, to afford me now a means wherby I may be fully justify'd also in the eyes of men. When the book had bin now the second time set forth wel-nigh three months, as I best remember, I then first came to hear that <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> had writt'n much concerning divorce: whom earnestly turning over, I soon p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If they dare, they must then set up an arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of their own against all those Churches and Saints who honour'd him without this exception: If they dare not, how can they now make that licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious doctrin in another, which was never blam'd, or confuted in <hi>Bucer,</hi> or in <hi>Fagius?</hi> The truth is, there will be due to them for this their unadvised rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the best donative that can be giv'n them, I mean, a round reproof; now that where they thought to be most Magisterial, they have display'd their own want, both of reading, and of judgement. First, to be so unacquainted in the writings of <hi>Bucer,</hi> which are so obvious and so usefull in their own faculty; next, to be so caught in a prejudicating weaknes, as to condemn that for lewd, which (whether they knew or not) these elect servants of Christ commended for lawfull; and for new, that which was taught by these almost the first and greatest authors of reformation, who were never taxt for so teaching; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated without scruple to a royall pair of the first reforming Kings in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom, and confest in the public confession of a most <hi>orthodoxall</hi> Church &amp; state in Germany. This is also another fault which I must tell them; that they have stood now almost this whole year clamouring a farre off, while the book hath bin twice printed, twice bought up, &amp; never once vouchs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Or if he be obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, their confutation would have render'd him without excuse, and reclam'd others of no mean parts who incline to his opinion. But now their work is more then doubl'd; and how they will hold up their heads against the sudden aspect of these two great and reverend S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Since wee have need of civil laws and the power of punishing, it will be wisest not to contemn those giv'n by <hi>Moses;</hi> but seriously rather to consider what the meaning of God was in them, what he cheifly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, and how much it might be to the good of every Nation, if they would borrow thence thir manner of governing the Common-wealth; yet freely all things and with the Spirit of Christ.

                  </gap>'d that the contract was not indissoluble, until the spouse were brought home, and the solemnities perform'd. They thought it a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of divine and human equitie, and the due consideration of mans infirmitie in deliberating and determining, when space is giv'n to renounce other contracts of much lesse moment, which are not yet confirm'd before the Magistrate, to deny that to the most waighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of marriage, which requires the greatest care and consultation. Yet left such a covenant should be brok'n for no just cause, and to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50364:11"/>
injury of that person to whom mariage was promis'd, they decreed a fine, that he who deni'd mariage to whom he had promis'd, and for some cause not approv'd by the Judges, should pay the double of that pledge which was giv'n at making sure, or as much as the Judge should pronounce might satisfie the dammage or the hinderance of either parsie. It beeing most certain that ofttimes after contract, just and honest causes of departing from promise, come to be known and found out, it cannot be other then the duty of pious Princes, to give men the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>me liberty of unpromising in these cases, as pious Emperours granted: especially where there is only a promise, and not carnal knowledge. And as there is no true mariage between them, who agree not in true consent of mind, so it will be the part of godly Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates to procure that no matrimony be among thir Subjects, but what is knit with love and consent. And though your Majesty be not bound to th imperial laws, yet it is the duty of a Christian King to embrace and follow what ever he knows to be any where piously and justly constituted, and to be honest, just and well-pleasing to his people. But why in Gods law and the examples of his Saints nothing heerof is read, no marvell, seeing his ancient people had power, yea a precept, that who so could not bend hismind to the true love of his wife, should give her a bill of divorce, and send her from him, though after carnal knowledge and long dwelling together.

In which thing the Roman Antichrists have knit many a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious entanglement to distrissed consuiences; for that they might heer also exalt themselvs above God, as if they would be wiser and chaster then God himself is, for no cause, honest, or necessary, will they permit final divorce, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oth in their times and afterward prevail'd, we shall perceave that neither these Fathers did ever cast out of the Church any one for marying after a divorce, approv'd by the Imperiall laws.</p>
               <p>Nor only the first Christian Emperours, but the lator also, ov'n to <hi>Justinian,</hi> and after him, did grant for certain causes approv'd by Judges, to make a true divorse; which made and confirm'd by law, it might be lawfull to marry again: which if it could not have bin done without disple sing Christ and his Church, surely it would not have been granted by Christian Emperours, nor had the Fathers then winkt at those doings in the Emperours. Hence ye may see that <hi>Jerom</hi> also, though zealous of single life more then anough, and such a condemner of second mariage though after the death of either party, yet forc't by plain equity, desended. <hi>Fabiola,</hi> a noble Matron of Rome, who having refus'd her husband for just causes, was married to another. For that the sending of a divorce to her husband was not blame-worthy, he affirms, because the man was hainously vitious, and that if an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wife may be discarded, an adulterous husband is not to be kept. But that she maried again, while yet her husband was alive, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends in that the Apostle hath said, <hi>It is better to mary then to burn,</hi> and that young widows should mary, for such was <hi>Fabiola,</hi> and could not remain in widowhood.</p>
               <p>But some one will object that <hi>Jerom</hi> there addes, <hi>Neither did she know the vigor of the Gospel, wherein all cause of marying i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And what can this mean? <hi>I will not praise her, unlesse I first absolv her.</hi> For
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50364:12"/>
how could he absolv her but by proving that <hi>Fabiola</hi> neither in reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting her vitious husband, nor in marying another, had committed such a sin, as could be justly condem'd. Nay, he proves both by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reason, and cleer testimonies of Scripture, that she avoided sin.</p>
               <p>This also is hence understood, that <hi>Jerom</hi> by the vigor of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, meant that height and perfection of our Saviours precept, which might be remitted to those that burn; for he addes, <hi>But if she be accus'd in that she remain'd not unmarried, I shall confesse the fault, so I may relate the necessity.</hi> If then he acknowledg'd a necessity, as he did, because she was young, and could not live in Widowhood, certainly he could not impute her second mariage to her much blame: but when he excuses her out of the word of God, does he not openly declare his thoughts, that the second mariage of <hi>Fabiola</hi> was permitted her by the holy Ghost himself for the necessity which she suffer'd, and to shun the danger of fornication, though she went somwhat aside from the vigor of the Gospel. But if any urge that <hi>Fabiola</hi> did public penance for her second mariage, which was not impos'd but for great faults. T'is answer'd, she was not enjoyn'd to this pennance. but did it of her own accord, <hi>and not till after her second husbands death.</hi> As in the time of <hi>Cyprian</hi> we read that many were wont to doe voluntary pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for small faults, which were not liable to excommunication.</p>

               <p>SOme will say perhaps, whersore all this concerning mariage after vow of single life, when as the question was of mariage after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorse? For this reason, that they whom it so much moves, because some of the Fathers thought mariage after any kind of divorce, to be condemn'd of our Saviour, may see that this conclusion follows not. The Fathers thought all mariage after divorce to be forbidd'n of our Saviour, therfore they thought such mariage was not to be tolerated in a Christian. For the same Fathers judg'd it forbidd'n to marry after vow; yet such mariages they neither dissolv'd nor excommunicated. For these words of our Saviour, and of the holy Ghost, stood in their way; <hi>All cannot receav this saying, but they to whom it is giv'n. Every one</hi>

               <p>So there are many Canons, and Laws extant, wherby Priests, if they maried, were remov'd from their office, yet is it not read that their mariage was dissolv'd, as the Papists now-a-dayes doe, or that they were excommunicated, nay expressly they might communicate as Lay men. If the consideration of human infirmitie, and those testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of divine Scripture which grant mariage to every one that wants it, persuaded those Fathers to bear themselvs so humanly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them who had maried with breach of vow to God, as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev'd, and with divorce of that mariage wherin they were in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner joyn'd to God; who doubts, but that the same Fathers held the like humanitie was to be afforded to those who after divorce &amp; faith broken with men, as they thought, enter'd into second mariage: for among suchare also found no lesse weak, and no lesse burning.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>LEt us consider the answers of the Lord giv'n by the Apostle seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. Concerning the first which is <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>Know yet not bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, for I speak to them that know the law,</hi> &amp;c. Ver. 2. <hi>The woman is bound</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:50364:15"/>
                  <hi>by the law to her husband so long as he liveth.</hi> Heer it is certain that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost had no purpose to determine ought of mariage, or divorce, but only to bring an example from the common and ordinary law of wedlock, to shew that as no covnant holds either party beeing dead, so now that wee are not bound to the law, but to Christ our Lord, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that through him wee are dead to sin, and to the law; and so joyn'd to Christ that wee may bring forth fruit in him from a willing godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and not by the compulsion of law, wherby our sins are more exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and become more violent. What therfore the holy Spirit heer speaks of matrimony, cannot be extended beyond the general rule.</p>
               <p>Besides it is manifest, that the Apostle did allege the law of wedlock, as it was deliver'd to the <hi>Jews;</hi> for, saith he, I speak to them that know the law. They knew no law of God but that by <hi>Moses,</hi> which plainly grants divorce for several reasons. It cannot therfore be said that the Apostle cited this generall example out of the law, to abolish the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral exceptions of that law, which God himself granted by giving autority to divorce.</p>
               <p>Next when the Apostle brings an example out of Gods law concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning man and wife, it must be necessary that wee understand such for man and wife, as are so indeed according to the same law of God; that is, who are so dispos'd as that they are both willing and able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the necessary duties of mariage; not those who under a false title of mariage, keep themselves mutually bound to injuries and disgraces; for such twain are nothing lesse then lawfull man and wife.</p>
               <p>The like answer is to be giv'n to all the other places both of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel and the Apostle, that what ever exception may be prov'd out of Gods law, be not excluded from those places. For the Spirit of God doth not condemn things formerly granted, and allow'd, where there is like cause and reason. Hence <hi>Ambrose</hi> upon that place, <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 7. 15. <hi>A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases;</hi> thus expounds; <hi>The reverence of mariage is not due to him who abhors the author of mariage; nor is that mariage ratify'd which is without devotion to God: he sins not therfore who is put away for Gods cause, though be joyn himself to another. For the dishonor of the Creator dissolves the right of matrimonl to him who is deserted, that he be not accus'd, though marrying to another. The faith of wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock is not to be kept with him who departs, that he might not hear the God of Christians to be the author of wedlock. For if</hi> Ezra <hi>caus'd the mis-beleeving wives and husbands to be divorc't, that God might be appeas'd, and not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, though they took others of thir own faith, how much more shall it be free, if the mis-beleever depart to marry one of our own Religion. For this is not to be counted matrimony which is against the law of God.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:50364:16"/>
Two things are heer to be observ'd toward the following dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, which truth it self, and the force of Gods word hath drawn from this holy man. For those words are very large, <hi>Matrimony is not ratify'd without devotion to God.</hi> And <hi>the dishonour of the Creator dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvs the right of matrimony.</hi> For devotion is farre off, and dishonor is done to God by all who persist in any wickednes and hainous crime.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That although it seem in the Gospel, as if our Saviour granted divorce only for adultery, yet in very deed he granted it for other causes also.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw is to be dealt with this question, Whether it be lawful to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce and marry again for other causes besides adultery, since our Saviour exprest that only. To this question, if we retain our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples already laid, and must acknowledge it to be a cursed blasphemy, if we say that the words of God doe contradict one another, of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity we must confesse that our Lord did grant divorce, and mariage af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that for other causes besides adultery, notwithstanding what he said in <hi>Matthew.</hi> For first, they who consider but only that place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. which treats of beleevers and misbeleevers matcht toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, must of force confesse, that our Lord granted just divorce, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond mariage in the cause of desertion, which is other then the cause of fornication. And if there be one other cause found lawfull, then is it most true that divorce was granted not only for fornication.</p>
               <p>Next, it cannot be doubted, as I shew'd before, by them to whom it is giv'n to know God and his judgements out of his own word, but that, what means of peace and safety God ever granted and ordain'd to his elected people, the same he grants and ordains to men of all ages who have equally need of the same remedies. And who, that is but a knowing man, dares say there be not husbands and wives now to be found in such a hardnesse of heart, that they will not perform either conjugal affection, or any requis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t duty therof, though it be most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd at thir hands.</p>
               <p>Neither can any one deferre to confesse, but that God whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty it is to judge the cause of them that suffer injury, hath provided for innocent and honest persons wedded, how they might free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs by lawfull means of divorce, from the bondage and iniquity of those who are falsly term'd thir husbands or thir wives. This is cleer out of Deut, 24. 1. Malach. 2. Matth. 19. 1 Cor. 7. and out of those

principles which the Scripture every where teaches, That God chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges not his minde, dissents not from himself, is no accepter of persons; but allows the same remedies to all men opprest with the same necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and infirmities; yea, requires that wee should use them. This he will easily perceave, who considers these things in the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Lastly, it is most certain, that the Lord hath commanded us to obey the civil laws every one of his own Common-wealth, if they be not against the laws of God.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IT is also manifest that the law of <hi>Theodosius</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> which begins <hi>Consensu, &amp;c.</hi> touching divorce, and many other decrees of pious Emperours agreeing heerwith, are not contrary to the word of God. And therfore may be recall'd into use by any Christian Prince or Common-wealth, nay ought to be with due respect had to every nation. For whatsoever is equall and just, that in every thing is to be sought and us'd by Christians.

               </argument>
               <p>NOw to the end it may be seen that this agrees with the divine law, the first institution of mariage is to be consider'd, and those texts in which God establisht the joyning of male and famale, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd the duties of them both. When God had determin'd to make woman, and give her as a wife to man, he spake thus, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 18. <hi>It is not good for man to be alone, I will make him a help meet for him. And A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam said,</hi> but in the Spirit of God, v. 23. 24. <hi>This is now bone of my bone, and slesh of my slesh.

               </p>
               <p>To this first institution did Christ recall his own; when answering the Pharises, he condemn'd the licence of unlawfull divorce. He taught therfore by his example, that we, according to this first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and what God hath spok'n therof, ought to determin what kind of covnant mariage is, how to be kept, and how farre; and lastly, for what cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s to be dislolv'd. To which decrees of God these also are to be joyn'd, which the holy Ghost hath taught by his Apostle, that neither the husband nor the wife <hi>hath power of their own body, but mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally each of eithers.</hi> That <hi>the husband shall love the wife as his own body, yea as Christ loves his Church, and that the wife ought to be subject to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, as the Church is to Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By these things the nature of holy wedlock is certainly known; whereof if only one be wanting in both or either party, and that either by obstinate malev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es of minde, or lastly, through incurable impotence of body, it cannot then be said that the covnant of matrimony holds good between such; if we mean that covnant which God instituted and call'd Mariage, and that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of only it must be understood that our Saviour said, <hi>Those whom God hath joyn'd, let no man separate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hence is concluded, that matrimonv requires continuall coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation and living together, unlesse the calling of God be otherwise evident; which union if the parties themselves dis-joyn either by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall consent, or one against the others will depart, the marriage is then brok'n. Wherein the Papists, as in other things oppose themselvs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God; while they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

words; <hi>I will make him a help meet for him; bone of his bones, and flesh of his slesh; for this cause shall he leav father and mother, and cleav to his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh.</hi> By which words who discerns not, that God requires of them both so to live together, and to be united not only in body but in mind also, with such an affection as none may be dearer and more ardent among all the relations of mankind, nor of more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy to the mutual offices of love, and loyalty. They must commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate and consent in all things both divine and human, which have any moment to well and happy living. The wife must honour and obey her husband, as the Church honours and obeys Christ her head. The husband must love and cherish his wife, as Christ his Church. Thus they must be to each other, if they will be true man and wife in the sight of God, whom certainly the Churches ought to follow in thir judgement. Now the proper and ultimate end of mariage is not copulation, or children, for then there was not true matrimony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of Christ, nor between many holy persons more; but the full and proper and main end of mariage, is the communicating of all duties, both divine and humane, each to other, with utmost benevolence and affection.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>BY which definition wee may know that God esteems and reckons upon these foure necessary properties to be in every true mariage. 1. That they should live together, unlesse the calling of God require otherwise for a time. 2. That they should love one another to the height of dearnes, and that in the Lord, and in the communion of true Religion. 3. That the husband beare himself as the head and preserver of his wife, instructing her to all godlines and integritie of life; that the wife also be to her husband a help, according to her place, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally furdering him in the true worship of God, and next in all the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of civil life.

               </argument>
               <p>NOw if a husband or wife be found guilty of any those crimes, which by the law <hi>consensu</hi> are made causes of divorce, tis manifest that such a man cannot be the head, and preserver of his wife, nor such a woman be a meet help to her husband, as the divine law in true wedlock requires; for these faults are punisht either by death, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, or extream infamy, which are directly opposite to the covnant of mariage. If they deserve death, as adultery and the like, doubtles God would not that any should live in wedlock with them whom he would not have to live at all. Or if it be not death, but the incurring of notorious infamy, certain it is neither just, nor expedient, nor meet, that an honest man should be coupl'd with an infamous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, nor an honest matron with an infamous man. The wise Roman Princes had so great regard to the equal honour of either wedded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that they counted those mariages of no force which were made between the one of good repute, and the other of evill note. How much more will all honest regard of Christian expedience and comlines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seem &amp; concern those who are set free and dignify'd in Christ, then it could the Roman Senate, or thir sons, for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that law was provided.</p>
               <p>And this all godly men will soon apprehend, that he who ought to be the head and preserver not only of his wife, but also of his children and family, as Christ is of his Church, had need be one of honest name: so likewise the wife which is to be the meet help of an honest and good man, the mother of an honest off-spring and family, the glory of the man, ev'n as the man is the glory of Christ, should not be tainted with ignominy; as neither of them can avoid to be, having bin justly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peacht of those forenamed crimes; and therfore cannot be worthy to hold thir place in a Christian family: yea they themselvs turn out themselvs and dissolv that holy covnant. And they who are true bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and sisters in the Lord, are no more in bondage to such violaters of mariage.</p>
               <p>But heer the Patrons of wickednes and dissolvers of Christian disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline will object, that it is the part of man and wife to bear one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers crosse, whether in calamit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50364:18"/>
public honesty before private interest; and had rather the remedies of wholsom punishment appointed by God should be in use, then that by remisness the licence of evil doing should encrease. For if they who by committing such offences, have made void the holy knott of mariage, be capable of repentance, they will be sooner mov'd when due punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is executed on them; then when it is remitted.</p>
               <p>Wee must ever beware, lest, in contriving what will be best for the souls health of delinquents, wee make our selvs wiser and discreeter then God. He that religiously waighs his oracles concerning mariage, cannot doubt that they who have committed the foresaid transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have lost the right of matrimony, and are unworthy to hold thir dignity in an honest and Christian family.</p>

               <p>From all these considerations, if they be thought on, as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, and out of his Word, any one may perceav, who desires to determine of these things by the Scripture, that those causes of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full divorce, which the most religious Emperours <hi>Tbeodosius</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi> set forth in the forecited place, are according to the law of God, and the prime institution of mariage. <hi>And were still more and more straitn'd, as the Church and State of the Empire still more and more corrupted and degenerated.</hi> Therfore pious Princes &amp; Common-wealths both may and ought establish them again, if they have a mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the honour, sanctitie, and religion of holy wedlock to thir peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and dis-intangle many consciences from a miserable and perilous condition, to a chaste and honest life.</p>

askt our Lord whether it were lawfull to put away such a wife, as was truly, and according to Gods law, to be counted a wife; that is, such a one as would dwell with her husband, and both would &amp; could perform the necessary duties of wedlock tolerably. But shee who will not dwell with her husband, is not put away by him, but goes of her self: and sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Neither certainly would the Pharises propound a question concerning such an unconjugall wife; <hi>for thir depravation of the law had brought them to that passe, as to think a man bad right to put away his wife for any cause, though never so slight.</hi> Since therfore it is manifest that Christ an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd the Pharises concerning a sit and meet wife according to the law of God, whom he forbid to divorce for any cause but fornication. Who sees not that it is a wickednes so to wrest and extend that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of his, as if it forbad to divorce her who hath already forsak'n, or hath lost the place and dignitie of a wife by deserved infamy, <hi>or hath undertak'n to be that which she hath not naturall ability to be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This truth is so powerfull that it hath mov'd the Papists to grant their kind of divorce for other causes besides adultery, as for ill usage, and the not performing of conjugal dutie; and to separate from b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d and board for these causes, which is as much divorce, as they grant for adultery.</p>
               <p>But some perhaps will object, that though it be yeilded, that our Lord granted divorce not only for adultery, yet it is not certain that he permitted mariage after divorce, unlesse for that only cause. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, first, that the sentence of divorce, and second mariage, is one and the same. So that when the right of divorce is evinc't to belong not only to the cause of fornication, the power of second mariage is also prov'd to be not limited to that cause only; and that most evidently, when as the holy Ghost, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. so frees the deserted party from bondage, as that he may not only send a just divorce in case of deserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but may seek another marriage.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Seeing God will not that any should live in danger of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication and utter ruine for the default of another, and hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the husband to send away with a bill of divorce her whom he could not love, it is impossible that the charge of adultery should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him who for lawfull causes divorces and marries, or to her who marries after she hath bin unjustly rejected, or to him who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceavs

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50364:21"/>
those Oracles of God, and in laying down those certain principles, which he who will know what the mind of God is in this matter, must ever think on, and remember. But if wee consider what mist and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuritie hath bin powrd out by Antichrist upon this question, and how deep this pernicious contempt of wedlock, and admiration of single life, ev'n in those who are not call'd therto, hath sunk into many mens persuasions, I fear lest all that hath bin said, be hardly anough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade such that they would cease at length to make themselvs wiser &amp; holier then God himself, in beeing so severe to grant lawfull mariage, and so easie to connive at all, not only whordoms, but deflowrings, and adulteries. When as among the people of God, no whordom was to be tolerated.</p>
               <p>Our Lord Jesus Christ, who came to destroy the works of Satan, send down his Spiritupon all Christians, and principally upon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Governours both in Church and Common-wealth (for of the cleer judgement of your royall Majesty I nothing doubt, revolving the Scripture so often as yee doe) that they may acknowledge how much they provoke the anger of God against us, when as all kind of uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity is tolerated, fornications and adulteries winkt at: But holy and honourable wedlock is oft withheld by the meer persuasion of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, from such as without this remedy, cannot preserve themselves from damnation! For none who hath but a spark of honesty will deny that Princes and States ought to use diligence toward the maintaining of pure and honest life among all men, without which all justice, all fear of God, and true religion decayes.</p>
               <p>And who knows not that chastity and purenes of life, can never be restor'd, or continu'd in the Common-wealth, unlesse it be first esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht in private houses, from whence the whole breed of men is to come forth. To effect this, no wise man can doubt that it is necessary for Princes and Magistrates first with severity to punish whordom and adultery; next to see that mariages be lawfully contracted, and in the Lord, then that they be faithfully kept; and lastly, when that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines urges, that they be lawfully dissolv'd, and other mariage gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, according as the law of God, and of nature, and the Constitutions of pious Princes have decreed; as I have shewn both by evident au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torities of Scripture, together with the writings of the ancient Fathers, and other testimonies. Only the Lord grant that we may learn to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre his ever just and saving Word, before the Comments of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, too deeply rooted in many, and the false and blasphemous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of our Saviours words.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus farre <hi>Martin Bucer;</hi> Whom where I might without injury to either part of the cause, I deny not to have <hi>epitomiz'd:</hi> in the rest observing a well-warranted rule, not to give an Inventory of so many words, but to weigh thir force. I could have added that eloquent and right Christian discours, writt'n by <hi>Erasmus</hi> on this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not disagreeing in effect from <hi>Bucer.</hi> But this, I hope, will be anough to excuse me with the meer <hi>Englishman,</hi> to be no forger of new and loose opinions. Others may read him in his own phrase on the first to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and ease me who never could delight in long citations, much lesse in whole traductions; Whether it be natural disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or education in me, or that my mother bore me a spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of what God made mine own, and not a translator. There be others also whom I could reck'n up, of no mean account in the Church (and <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> among the first) who are more then half our own in this controversy. But this is a providence not to be slighted, that as <hi>Bucer</hi> wrote this tractat of divorce in <hi>England</hi> and for <hi>England,</hi> so <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> professes he begun heer among us the same subject, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially out of compassion, for the need he saw this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had of some charitable redresse heerin; and seriously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts others to use thir best industry in the cleering of this point, wherin custom hath a greater sway then verity. That therfore which came into the minde of these two admired strangers to doe for <hi>England,</hi> and in a touch of highest pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which they took to be not yet recover'd from mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stic superstition, if I a native am found to have don for

mine own Country, altogether sutably and conformly to their so large and cleer understanding, yet without the lest help of theirs, I suppose that hence-forward among con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable and ju<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

And if these thir books, the one shall be printed often, with best allowance in most religious Cities, the other with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press autority of <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth a Pope, shall for the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating of truth be publisht and republisht, though against the receav'd opinion of that Church, and mine containing but the same thing, shall in a time of reformation, a time of free speaking, free writing, not find a permission to the Presse, I referre me to wisest men, whether truth be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to be truth, or liberty to be liberty now among us, and be not again in danger of new fetters and captivity af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all our hopes and labours lost: and whether learning be not (which our enemies too profetically fear'd) in the way to be trodd'n down again by ignorance. Wherof while time is, out of the faith owing to God and my Country, I bid this Kingdom beware: and doubt not but God, who hath dignify'd this Parlament already to so many glorious degrees, will also give them (which is a singular blessing) to inform themselvs rightly in the midst of an unprincipl'd age; and to prevent this working mystery of ignorance and ecclestastical thraldom, which under new shapes and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guises begins afresh to grow upon us.</p>
