            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

moroſely jealous of all that

            <p>HAving in my <hi>Epiſtle Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>
ſhewed at large the worth
and uſe of the enſuing book, I have the
leſs wherewith to trouble you, if that
it ſelf do not, before you read it. For
although you ſee the deſign was laid in
order to the private benefit and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the <hi>noble Lord,</hi> to whom
addreſsed: yet ſince it becomes thus
publick, I ſhall plainly tell you, that
the common neglect I diſcovered (and
is by the bookſellers themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed)
of the moſt <hi>excellent piece</hi>
that ever paſſed a <hi>Monarch's</hi> Pen,
was a principal incentive to me, to
put it again, thus trasformed, upon
the World. Alas! it may eaſily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
be judged <hi>what</hi> has brought
the <hi>Original,</hi> and with <hi>whom,</hi> into
diſrepute; the <hi>cry</hi> of <hi>blood</hi> is lowd,
<pb facs="tcp:115964:17"/>
and ſummons the leaſt guilt <hi>de pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundis,</hi>
from the depth of <hi>Conſcience,</hi>
though the very <hi>Centre,</hi> to a <hi>ſentence</hi>
upon it ſelf, and what an unſufferable
torture 'tis, either to look upon the
lively <hi>Pourtraicture</hi> of that <hi>King,</hi> or
hear him <hi>ſpeak,</hi> though but in his
<hi>papers,</hi> whom with <hi>axe,</hi> or <hi>pen,</hi> or
<hi>tongue,</hi> or wiſhfull <hi>thought,</hi> they
<hi>murder'd;</hi> or negatively in <hi>not</hi> dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,
<hi>not</hi> decrying, <hi>not</hi> invective-writing,
<hi>not</hi> preventive-acting, were
<hi>acceſſory</hi> in the leaſt degree, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
that committed the fault, and
feel the pain, can truly tell. This
courteſie I have therefore done them,
who would needs turn away from the
<hi>ſalve,</hi> becauſe it ſignifies they have a
<hi>ſore;</hi> they are hereby no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
as to what is <hi>paſt,</hi> than any
of the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a <hi>King.</hi> The <hi>Aphoriſmes</hi>
are general, and applicable to any
<hi>Kingdom;</hi> in many of which thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:115964:17"/>
               <hi>Subjects</hi> that mean to <hi>Act,</hi> may read
their <hi>duty,</hi> and they that do not, may
expect their <hi>doom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I at firſt had done as <hi>Simplicius</hi>

and the moſt <hi>motive,</hi> or ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
upon the minds of men; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
being ſo much affected, I thought
the book very well worth review, as
loth to leave ought behind that might
have the like efficacy by the ſenſe,
though not altogether the ſame acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the conceipt, nor elegance in the
language: by which <hi>gleaning,</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection,</hi>
I recover'd many as fair
and full eares as thoſe I had before
bound up in the ſheaf, many <hi>Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmes</hi>
no leſs conſiderable, no leſs
deſerving an intent regard. Some
others if you find coincident with thoſe
of the firſt rank, as ſome you will, I
<pb facs="tcp:115964:18"/>
pray know that the ſame paſſed me not
unobſerved, but having ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

none in <hi>ſenſe,</hi> they were ad led the
more to oblige you, and to effect that
<hi>prevalency</hi> upon you, which your haſt
from the former might not admit.
Such (if any ſuch there be) as may ſeem
<hi>flat</hi> and <hi>ordinary,</hi> they are to be ſet to

                  <p>47. A good <hi>King</hi> in <hi>civil affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>

                  <p>51. A freedom and power to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi>

52. For a <hi>King</hi> to truſt to their

                  </p>
                  <p>53. A <hi>Prudent King</hi> ſhould not

                  </p>

to put the reigns of both <hi>Reaſon</hi> and
<hi>Government,</hi> wholly out of his <hi>own,</hi>
into <hi>their</hi> hands, whoſe <hi>driving</hi> is

                  </p>
                  <p>5. Such <hi>moderate deſires</hi> of due

in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> as may ſtill
preſerve the foundation and eſſentials
of <hi>Government</hi> in both, not ſhake

without any regard to the <hi>Lawes</hi> in

practice of <hi>Chriſtian Churches,</hi>
the rights and priviledges of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

                  <p>6. Some <hi>conſiderable thing</hi> ſhould

                  </p>
                  <p>57. A <hi>King</hi> cannot be well coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell'd
by his <hi>Parliament,</hi> if in the

<hi>Learning, Reaſon, Religion,</hi> and

                  </p>

62. The blame of <hi>bloudy</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious</hi>
Proteſtants muſt needs he
greater than that of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> by how

                  </p>
                  <p>63. The goodneſs of mens <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>

contagion of their <hi>Examples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>64. The <hi>King's</hi> intereſt ties as

                  </p>
                  <p>65. Although a <hi>King</hi> can with

as to any guilt in a <hi>Commotion</hi>

them in his <hi>Tears,</hi> at the ſad appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
he ought to have, to ſee it

                  <p>66. <hi>Diſtractions</hi> and <hi>Jealouſies</hi>

to the relief of their fellow Subjects
<hi>abroad,</hi> though every day inhumanly

ſome men induſtriouſly ſcatter in
the Kingdom where they are.</p>
                  <p>67. They who themſelves have

are unwilling to part with their <hi>King</hi>
upon any hazardous expedition,
though to the ſuppreſſing that <hi>force</hi>
which oppoſeth <hi>their intereſt,</hi> being

As was that of <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſons, whom

moderate <hi>remedies</hi> are rather to be

He has no leiſure to make prolix

the malice of his enemies to deprive
him of that comfort, which his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in the generality of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
gives him.</p>
                  <p>88. What a <hi>King</hi> may bear
from foreign <hi>enemies,</hi> he cannot
ſo well from his own <hi>Subjects,</hi>
who next his children are dear unto

89. Nothing could give a <hi>King</hi>
more cauſe to ſuſpect and ſearch his

many who made great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
of ſingular <hi>piety</hi> forward to

                  <p>90. When many <hi>Profeſſours</hi> of
ſingular <hi>Piety</hi> engage with perſons
that take arms againſt their <hi>King,</hi> it
gives to vulgar minds ſo bad a refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
upon <hi>Him</hi> and his <hi>Cauſe,</hi> as if
it had been impoſſible to adhere to
<hi>Him,</hi> and not with all part from <hi>God,</hi>
to think or ſpeak well of <hi>Him,</hi> and
not to blaſpheme <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>91. Truly Learned and <hi>Religious</hi>
men will endeavour to be ſo well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of their injur'd
<hi>King's</hi> ſufferings, as that they may
choſe rather to <hi>ſuffer</hi> with <hi>Him,</hi> than
<hi>forſake</hi> Him.</p>
                  <p>92. When <hi>Popular Preachers</hi>
(though but in hypocriſie and falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood)
urge <hi>Religious</hi> pretenſions
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115964:115"/>
againſt their <hi>King,</hi> it is not ſtrange
that the ſame to many well-minded

oppoſe <hi>Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>93. When a King uſeth the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of <hi>Subjects</hi> of a different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion

ready to interpret it a ſighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Religion,</hi> who leaſt of all
men care whom they imploy, or
what they ſay and do, ſo they may
prevail.</p>
                  <p>94. So eager are ſome men in
giving their <hi>Soveraign</hi> better <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi>
than what they pretend he hath
before heark'ned to, that they will
not give <hi>Him</hi> leave to take it with
freedom, as a <hi>Man,</hi> nor honour, as a
<hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>95. No men ſhould be more
willing to <hi>complain,</hi> than the <hi>King</hi>
be to <hi>redreſs</hi> what he ſees in <hi>Reaſon</hi>
to have been either done, or advis'd

                  <p>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:115964:116"/>
96. They who of pretended <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers</hi>

the comfort and reward, whatſoever
they before expected.</p>
                  <p>97. The noiſe and oſtentation of
<hi>Liberty,</hi> is the deſign and artifice
ſome men uſe to withdraw the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
affections from their <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>98. A good <hi>King</hi> ſhould be ſo

which is all he ought deſire to enjoy

                  </p>
                  <p>99. <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen</hi> which

would not be ſo prodigal of their

none but ſuch as deſire to drive on

                  </p>
                  <p>3. A <hi>King</hi> who is well aſſured
that his <hi>Innocency</hi> is clear before <hi>God,</hi>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:115964:117"/>
in point of any calumnies <hi>rebellious

That his <hi>reputation</hi> ſhall like the <hi>Sun</hi>

a degree of ſpendour, as thoſe feral

                  <p>4. A <hi>King</hi> cannot ſo much ſuffer
in point of honour by rude and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
pamphlets, as thoſe men do,
who having <hi>power,</hi> and pretending
to ſo much <hi>piety,</hi> are ſo forgetfull of
their duty to God and him, as not

againſt thoſe who are honoured
with the name of <hi>Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. They will eaſily contemn ſuch

                  <p>7. I could never ſee any reaſon,

both inward and outward, which

                  </p>
                  <p>8. A ſerious ſenſe of that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
in the <hi>Church</hi> which una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
followes every mans ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
maner of officiating, no doubt,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115964:118"/>

thoſe miſchiefs by the uſe of <hi>conſtant
Liturgies</hi> of <hi>publick</hi> compoſure.</p>
                  <p>9. It was either the tumultuari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of <hi>People,</hi> or the factiouſneſs and
pride of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or the covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſome <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> that

mens wits to invent <hi>new models</hi> of
Church-government, and propoſed
them under the ſpecious titles of
<hi>Chriſts Government, Scepter</hi> and
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> the better to ſerve their

                  <p>10. As the full and conſtant Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of all <hi>Hiſtories</hi> may ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
convince <hi>unbiaſed</hi> men, That
the <hi>Primitive Churches</hi> were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
governed by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
and their immediate <hi>Succeſſours,</hi> the
firſt and beſt <hi>Biſhops:</hi> ſo it cannot
in reaſon or charity be ſuppoſed,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115964:119"/>
that all <hi>Churches</hi> in the world ſhould
either be ignorant of the <hi>rule</hi> by

from their divine and holy pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern.</p>
                  <p>11. Since the firſt Age, for 1500
years, not one <hi>Example</hi> can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
of any ſetled <hi>Church</hi> wherein
were many Miniſters and Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which had not ſome <hi>Biſhop</hi>
above them, under whoſe juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction

                  <p>12. <hi>Uſe</hi> is the great <hi>Arbitratour</hi>
of words, and <hi>Maſter</hi> of language.</p>
                  <p>13. Not only in <hi>Religion,</hi> but
alſo in right <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and the true
nature of <hi>Governments,</hi> it cannot be
thought that an orderly <hi>Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
among Presbyters, or Miniſters,
ſhould be any more againſt <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi>
than it is in all ſecular and

breeds <hi>Confuſion</hi> and <hi>Faction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. I can no more believe that
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115964:119"/>
ſuch <hi>order</hi> is inconſiſtent with true
<hi>Religion,</hi> than good features are
with beauty, or numbers with har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                  <p>15. It is not likely, that <hi>God</hi>
who appointed ſeveral <hi>orders,</hi> and a

ſhould abhor, or forbid them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<hi>Chriſtian Miniſters,</hi> who have
as much of the Principles of <hi>Schiſm</hi>
and <hi>Diviſion</hi> as other men.</p>
                  <p>16. I conceive it was not the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of <hi>Princes,</hi> or ambition of
<hi>Presbyters,</hi> but the wiſdom and piety
of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that firſt ſetled <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi>
in the <hi>Church;</hi> which <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
they conſtantly uſed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
in thoſe times which were

                  </p>
                  <p>17. <hi>Tyranny</hi> becomes no <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>18. The late <hi>Reformed Churches</hi>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:115964:120"/>
whoſe examples are obtruded for

of times and affairs rather excuſeth,
than commendeth for their incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to all <hi>Antiquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>19. I could never ſee any reaſon,
why <hi>Churches</hi> orderly reformed and
governed by <hi>Biſhops,</hi> ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to conform to thoſe few, rather
than to the Catholick example of all
<hi>Ancient Churches,</hi> which needed no
<hi>Reformation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>20. It is no point of wiſdom or
charity, where <hi>Chriſtians</hi> differ (as
many do in ſome points) there to
widen the differences, and at once
to give all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a handfull of ſome <hi>Proteſtants)</hi>
ſo great a <hi>ſcandal</hi> in point of <hi>Church-Government,</hi>
as to change it; whom
though you may convince of their
Errours in ſome points of Doctrine,
yet you ſhall never perſwade them,
that to compleat their <hi>Reformation,</hi>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:115964:120"/>
they muſt neceſſarily deſert, and
wholly caſt off, that <hi>Government,</hi>
which they, and all before them,

and <hi>Apoſtolical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. Never <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> nor <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi>

                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>44. Although a <hi>King</hi> may be

to advance true <hi>piety;</hi> yet <hi>He muſt</hi>
ſeek to continue what is neceſſary
in point of <hi>Order, Maintenance,</hi> and

eſpecially if <hi>He</hi> be perſwaded

                  <p>45. The <hi>King</hi> is very excuſable
both before <hi>God</hi> and all unpaſſionate
<hi>men,</hi> for the diſtance between <hi>Him</hi>
and <hi>Subjects</hi> in <hi>Arms</hi> againſt <hi>Him,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>46. If ſuch <hi>Treaties</hi> give occaſion
to any mans further reſtiveneſs, it
is imputable to their own depraved
tempers, not to any <hi>Conceſſions</hi> or
<hi>Negations</hi> of their <hi>King,</hi> who has

and they the <hi>regret</hi> and blame
for what they refuſed.</p>
                  <p>47. A <hi>King</hi> may preſage the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsfulneſs
of any <hi>Treaty</hi> with his
<hi>Subjects,</hi> among whom he finds an

                  </p>
                  <p>48. When God gives a <hi>King</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
over his <hi>Subjects</hi> in Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, it is to try <hi>Him,</hi> that

                     <hi>He</hi> may know how with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and thanks, to own and uſe his
power, who is the only true <hi>Lord</hi>
of <hi>Hoſts,</hi> able when he pleaſes, to
repreſs the confidence of thoſe who
fight againſt him, though with great
advantage for power and numbers.</p>
                  <p>49. A <hi>King,</hi> who for ſmall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
on his part at length is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
on by an <hi>Army,</hi> wherewith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>He</hi> may encounter his <hi>rebellious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi>
has this comfort, that <hi>He</hi> is
not wholly forſaken by his <hi>Peoples</hi>
love, or <hi>Gods</hi> Protection.</p>
                  <p>50. When <hi>God</hi> at any time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
the ſame <hi>King</hi> to be worſted
by his <hi>Enemies,</hi> it is to exerciſe his
patience, and teach <hi>Him</hi> not to truſt
in the <hi>arme</hi> of <hi>Fleſh,</hi> but in the living
<hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>51. They who fight againſt their
<hi>King,</hi> are forced to ſlie to the ſhifts
of ſome pretended <hi>Fears,</hi> and wild
<hi>fundamentals</hi> of <hi>State</hi> (as they uſe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115964:126"/>
to call them) which actually over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the preſent Fabrick both of
<hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>52. The imaginary Reaſons
which <hi>Rebels</hi> alledg for <hi>ſelf defence,</hi>
are commonly moſt impertinent,
and ſuch as will fit any <hi>Faction</hi>
that hath but power and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
enough to ſecond with the

                  </p>
                  <p>53. <hi>Lawes</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> can
never be ſuch as ſome ſide or other
will not find fault with, ſo as to
urge what they call a <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of them to a <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt
them.</p>
                  <p>54. They are <hi>Paraſitick Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
that dare call thoſe <hi>Martyrs,</hi> who
died fighting againſt their <hi>King,</hi> the

                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:115964:126"/>
55. Sober Chriſtians know, than
the glorious Title of <hi>Martyr</hi> can
with truth be applied only to thoſe
who ſeriouſly prefer <hi>God's Truth</hi>
and their duty, in all the foreſaid
particulars, before <hi>their lives,</hi> and
all that is dear to them in this
World.</p>
                  <p>56. The <hi>Wounds</hi> and temporal
<hi>Ruines</hi> of thoſe loyal <hi>Subjects</hi> who
are ſlain in <hi>Civil Wars,</hi> ſerve as a
gracious opportunity for their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Happineſs,</hi> while the
evident approach of <hi>death,</hi> through
<hi>God's</hi> grace, effectually diſpoſeth
their Hearts to ſuch <hi>Humility, Faith</hi>
and <hi>Repentance,</hi> which together
with the <hi>Rectitude</hi> of their <hi>engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
fully prepares them for a better
life than that which their enemies
brutiſh and diſloyal firceneſs can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive

hope to enjoy.</p>

                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:115964:127"/>
57. Thoſe <hi>Rebels</hi> who may have

ſide in the <hi>Field,</hi> will never have ſo
at the <hi>Bar</hi> of <hi>God's Tribunal,</hi> or their
own <hi>Conſciences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>58. The condition of loyal <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
(in a <hi>Civil War)</hi> though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
and dying for their <hi>King,</hi>
no queſtion is infinitely more to be
choſen by a ſober man (that duly
values his <hi>duty,</hi> his <hi>ſoul,</hi> and <hi>eternity,</hi>
beyond the enjoyments of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
life) than the moſt triumphant
glory, wherein their and their <hi>Kings
Enemies</hi> ſupervive, who can hardly
avoid to be daily tormented by that
horrid guilt, wherewith their ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
or convicted <hi>Conſciences</hi> do
purſue them.</p>
                  <p>59. In the ſafety and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a <hi>King</hi> and good <hi>Lawes</hi> eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
all honeſt men, cannot but
think the wellfare of their <hi>Country</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:115964:127"/>
60. Not any ſhews, or truth of
<hi>piety</hi> on their ſide who take <hi>armes</hi>
againſt their <hi>King,</hi> are ſufficient to
diſpenſe with, or expiate, the defects
of their <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Loyalty</hi> to <hi>Him,</hi>
which have ſo pregnant convictions
on mens <hi>Conſciences,</hi> that even pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faner
men are moved by the ſenſe
of them to venter their lives for
<hi>Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>61. When <hi>Providence</hi> gives a
good <hi>King,</hi> or denies <hi>Him Victory,</hi>
his deſire ſhould be neither to boaſt
of his power, nor to charge <hi>God</hi>
fooliſhly; but to believe that at laſt
he will make all things to work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for his good.</p>
                  <p>62. A <hi>King's</hi> often meſſages for
<hi>Peace</hi> with his <hi>Subjects,</hi> will ſhew
that he <hi>delighteth</hi> not in <hi>War;</hi> as his
gracious <hi>Conceſſions</hi> will ſufficiently
teſtifie, how willingly <hi>he</hi> would have
<hi>prevented</hi> it; and his total unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſs
for it, how little <hi>he intended</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:115964:128"/>
63. When <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> are
once engaged in a <hi>Civil War,</hi> it may
be too late to review the occaſions
thereof, but not to wiſh a happy
concluſion of ſo unhapy beginnings;
nor to believe that the inevitable
fate of their <hi>ſins</hi> was ſuch as would
no longer ſuffer the divine <hi>juſtice</hi> to
be quiet.</p>
                  <p>64. A <hi>King</hi> is not to deſire that
any man ſhould be further ſubject
to <hi>Him,</hi> than <hi>He</hi> and all his <hi>People</hi>
may be ſubject to <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>65. The <hi>Paſſions</hi> and <hi>Opinions</hi> of

                  </p>
                  <p>66. It is a ſad ſpectacle for all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

a pregnant light that ſhines in his

                  <p>72. A due <hi>Reformation</hi> will eaſily

though they dare not but ſmother
their fruſtrations and diſcontents.</p>
                  <p>73. The ſpecious and popular Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
of <hi>Chriſt's Government, Throne,
Scepter</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> alſo the noiſe

is not divided nor hath two faces, as
ſome <hi>Reforming</hi> parties have had at

                  <p>75. The breaking of <hi>Church</hi>-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
which <hi>Time</hi> had ſufficiently
defaced:</p>
                  <p>2. The putting down of <hi>Croſſes,</hi>
which were but <hi>Civil,</hi> not <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
marks:</p>
                  <p>3. The defacing of <hi>Monuments,</hi> and
<hi>Inſcriptions</hi> of the dead, which
ſerved but to put poſterity in
mind to thank <hi>God</hi> for that clearer
light wherein they live:</p>
                  <p>4. The leaving of <hi>Miniſters</hi> to their

the publick ſervice of <hi>God,</hi> where
no <hi>Chriſtian</hi> can tell to what he

and <hi>Confeſſions</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>
new-dreſt, importing as much as
if there had been no ſound or clear

before a long conſultation had

the firſt Principles of <hi>Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe, and the like, are the

deceitfull <hi>Reformations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>76. It were to be wiſhed, that
ſome moſt pretending <hi>Reformers</hi>
had made it their unanimous work,
to do <hi>God's</hi> work, and not their <hi>own;</hi>
they had not (as now they have)
left all things more <hi>deformed,</hi> than
when they began, in point of <hi>Piety,
Morality, Charity,</hi> and good <hi>Order.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>77. They who think that the
<hi>Government</hi> of a <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi>
fixed by many <hi>Lawes</hi> and long <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms,</hi>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:115964:131"/>
will not run into their new
molds, endeavour to melt it firſt in
the fire of a <hi>Civil War,</hi> by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of which they reſolve, if
they prevail, to make their <hi>King</hi>
and all his <hi>Subjects</hi> fall down and
worſhip the <hi>Images</hi> they ſhall form
and ſet up.</p>
                  <p>78. <hi>Chriſt's Government</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the <hi>King's,</hi> not overthrow it,
if as <hi>He</hi> owns his from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo
<hi>He</hi> deſires to rule for his glory, and
his <hi>Churches</hi> good.</p>
                  <p>79. Had ſome men truly intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Chriſt's Government,</hi> or known
what is meant in their hearts, they
could never have been ſo ill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their words and actions, both
againſt their <hi>King,</hi> and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>80. The freedom and ſecreſie of
a <hi>King's</hi> private <hi>letters,</hi> eſpecially
unto his <hi>Queen,</hi> commands a civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
from all men, nor is there any
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115964:131"/>
thing more inhumane, than to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them (if taken) to publick
view.</p>
                  <p>81. The <hi>King</hi> that ſtudies to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
his heart to <hi>God's</hi> omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
may be content (if <hi>Providence</hi>
will have it ſo) that even his private
<hi>letters,</hi> if taken by his <hi>Subjects</hi> in

to the <hi>World,</hi> though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

which ſome of them uſe in

                  </p>
                  <p>82. Unquiet <hi>Subjects,</hi> many times
take <hi>Armes</hi> againſt a juſt, prudent,
and innocent <hi>King,</hi> into whoſe moſt
retired thoughts, if they could by
any means have a clear ſight, they
might diſcover how they are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
between the love and care <hi>He</hi>
hath, not more to preſerve his own
<hi>Rights,</hi> than to procure their <hi>Peace</hi>
and <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and an extreme grief
to ſee them both <hi>deceived</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</hi>
                  </p>

83. No man can blame a <hi>King</hi>
that by all fair and juſt <hi>correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies</hi>
endeavours to avoid the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of his <hi>Enemies,</hi> though his
own <hi>Subjects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>84. Some mens deſign, like <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoloms,</hi>
is by enormous actions to
widen differences between a <hi>King</hi>
and his <hi>Subjects,</hi> and exaſperate all
ſides to ſuch diſtances, as may make
all <hi>Reconciliation</hi> deſperate.</p>
                  <p>85. A <hi>King</hi> under the misfortune
of having his <hi>letters</hi> taken by <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
in <hi>Armes</hi> againſt <hi>Him,</hi> hath
much quiet and ſatisfaction within
<hi>Himſelf,</hi> when the integrity of his
intentions is not jealous of any
injury his Expreſſions can do
them; For,</p>
                  <p>86. Although the confidence of
privacy may admit of greater free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in writing <hi>letters,</hi> which may
be liable to envious exceptions; yet
it is beſt for a <hi>King,</hi> when the <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:115964:132"/>
of his chief purpoſes, cannot
be ſo ſtained or miſinterpreted by
his <hi>Enemies,</hi> as not to let all men
ſee, That <hi>He</hi> wiſheth nothing more
than a happy compoſure of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
with <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> not
more to his <hi>own</hi> than his <hi>Peoples</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
who have any ſparks of <hi>love,</hi>
or <hi>loyalty,</hi> left in them.</p>
                  <p>87. It repaireth ſomewhat a
<hi>King's</hi> misfortune, that his private
<hi>letters</hi> being taken by his <hi>Subjects</hi> in
armes againſt <hi>Him,</hi> cannot gratifie
their malice, further than to let
them ſee his conſtancy to his <hi>Wife,</hi>
the <hi>Lawes,</hi> and <hi>right Religion</hi> he
profeſſeth; as likewiſe to convince
them, that <hi>He</hi> can both mind, and
act his own and his <hi>Kingdoms</hi> affairs,
ſo as becomes a <hi>Prince;</hi> eſpecially,
if his <hi>Enemies</hi> have before been very
loath it ſhould be believed of <hi>Him;</hi>
as if <hi>He</hi> were wholly confined to the
<hi>Dictates</hi> and <hi>Directions</hi> of others,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115964:133"/>
whom they pleaſe to brand with
the names of <hi>Evil Counſellours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>88. It is the policy of <hi>Rebels,</hi> to
ſeek by all means to ſmother and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
all ſparkes of <hi>Love, Reſpect</hi>
and <hi>Loyalty</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> to their
<hi>King,</hi> that they may never kindle
again ſo as to recover <hi>His,</hi> the <hi>Lawes,</hi>
and the <hi>Kingdoms Liberties,</hi> which
they ſeek to overthrow.</p>
                  <p>89. <hi>God's</hi> unerring and impartial
<hi>Juſtice</hi> can, and will over-rule the
moſt perverſe wills and deſigns of
<hi>men. He</hi> is able, and will turn even
the worſt of an innocent <hi>King's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies</hi>
thoughts, and actions to his
good.</p>
                  <p>90. <hi>Civility</hi> and <hi>Humanity</hi> moſt
become ſuch as pretend to <hi>Religion,</hi>
which they ought to pay to all men,
beſide that <hi>reſpect</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> they
owe to their <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>91. They who do but remember
how <hi>God</hi> bleſt the modeſt reſpect,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115964:133"/>
and filial tenderneſs, which <hi>Noah's
ſons</hi> bare to their <hi>Father,</hi> can never
expect the divine approbation of
any their undecent actions toward
their <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>92. Their malicious intentions
can never be either excuſable, or
proſperous, who think by any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome
means to expoſe their
<hi>King</hi> to the higheſt reproach and
contempt of his <hi>People,</hi> forgetting
that duty of modeſt concealment;
which they owe to the <hi>Father</hi> of
their <hi>Countrey,</hi> in caſe they ſhould
diſcover any real uncomelineſs.</p>
                  <p>93. They who by publiſhing
their <hi>King's</hi> private <hi>letters</hi> think to
render <hi>Him</hi> as a <hi>vile Perſon,</hi> not fit
to be truſted, or conſidered under
any Notion of <hi>Majeſty,</hi> will ſee
themſelves miſtaken, when <hi>God</hi>
makes <hi>him,</hi> as he did <hi>David,</hi> more
reſpected in the hearts of many, who
become better ſatisfied by knowing
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115964:134"/>
what <hi>He</hi> writ, than by learning
what they maliciouſly interpret and
report.</p>
                  <p>94. Although <hi>God</hi> gives <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi>
yet ſometimes his <hi>Providence</hi>
permits that the <hi>King</hi> hath not any
place left in them, where he may
with ſafety and honour reſt his head:
Shewing him, that <hi>Himſelf</hi> is the
ſafeſt <hi>Refuge,</hi> and the ſtrongeſt <hi>Tower</hi>
of defence, in which he may put his
<hi>Truſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>95. A <hi>King</hi> in extremities ſhould
look not to man ſo much as to <hi>God,</hi>
who will have it ſo, that <hi>he</hi> may
wholly caſt himſelf and his diſtreſſed
affairs upon <hi>God's</hi> mercy, who hath
both <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>hands</hi> of all men in
his diſpoſe.</p>
                  <p>96. <hi>Neceſſity</hi> may ſometimes
command a <hi>King</hi> to withdraw from
his chiefeſt ſtrength, and adventure
upon their <hi>Loyalty,</hi> who firſt began
his Troubles, whom <hi>God</hi> happily
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115964:134"/>
may make a means honourably to
compoſe them</p>
                  <p>97. When <hi>Neceſſity</hi> conſtrains a
<hi>King</hi> to caſt Himſelf upon them, who
though they beſiege <hi>Him</hi> in his <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,</hi>
and encounter <hi>Him</hi> in the
<hi>field,</hi> yet profeſs, <hi>They fight not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Him, but for Him; He</hi> puts
<hi>Himſelf</hi> to reſolve the <hi>riddle</hi> of their
<hi>Loyalty,</hi> and gives them opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to let the World ſee, they mean
not what they <hi>do,</hi> but what they
<hi>ſay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>98. <hi>God</hi> ſees it ſometimes not
enough to deſert a <hi>King</hi> of all <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi>
power to defend himſelf, but to
put him upon uſing their power,
who ſeem to <hi>fight</hi> againſt <hi>him,</hi> yet
ought in duty to <hi>defend</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>99. When a <hi>King</hi> finds it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to leave thoſe that have adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to <hi>Him, He</hi> may hope ſuch a
method of <hi>Peace</hi> may be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous
than that of <hi>War,</hi> both to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115964:135"/>
ſtop the effuſion of <hi>blood,</hi> and the
<hi>wounds</hi> that were made before.</p>
                  <p>100. A <hi>King</hi> ſhould never truſt
any nation of his <hi>Subjects</hi> further
than to <hi>men,</hi> that if they <hi>betray Him,
He</hi> may juſtifie to all the <hi>World</hi> they
have not <hi>deceiv'd Him:</hi> and if they
<hi>ſell Him</hi> at any dear rate, <hi>He</hi> ſhould
be only ſorry that <hi>his</hi> price ſhould be

                  <p>1. <hi>GOD</hi> ſometimes ſees tis fit to

that <hi>He</hi> may be wholy <hi>his,</hi> who

                  </p>
                  <p>2. A <hi>King</hi> ſhould never permit

                  </p>
                  <p>3. A <hi>King's</hi> denial of unjuſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
made by <hi>Subjects</hi> in armes

4. It is evident ſometimes, that
<hi>Subjects,</hi> who pretend to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>evil Counſellours</hi> with their
<hi>King,,</hi> fight indeed againſt a good
Conſcience <hi>within Him:</hi> And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever

not to bring <hi>Him</hi> to his <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
till they have brought <hi>his mind</hi>
to their <hi>obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. After-times may ſee what the
blindneſs of that Age will not,
wherein is both practis'd and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
<hi>Subjects fighting againſt
their Soveraign,</hi> whom, if they have
a good <hi>King,</hi> God may at length
ſhew, that he chuſeth rather to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<hi>for</hi> them, than <hi>with</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>6. When <hi>Providence</hi> is pleaſed
to deprive a <hi>King</hi> of all other civil
comforts, and ſecular attendants, the
abſence of them all may beſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by the attendance of ſuch
his <hi>Chaplains,</hi> whom for their
<hi>functions He</hi> reverenceth, and for

their <hi>fidelity</hi> may have cauſe to

                  <p>7. As a <hi>King</hi> never <hi>needs,</hi> ſo <hi>He</hi>
ſhould never <hi>deſire</hi> more the ſervice

                  <p>8. A diſtreſſed <hi>King</hi> cannot think

which may be in them, proper to be

meet and moſt comfortable, whoſe
golden rule, and bond of perfection,
conſiſts in that of mutual <hi>Love</hi> and
<hi>Charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. The <hi>King,</hi> who is much a
friend to all <hi>Church-men,</hi> that have
any thing in them beſeeming that
ſacred function, will, if there be
cauſe, hazard his own intereſt upon
<hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Conſtancy</hi> to maintain
their <hi>Rights.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. Such <hi>Clergy-men</hi> who ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſomely
requite their <hi>King,</hi> as
to deſert <hi>Him</hi> in his calamity, when
their <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Conſtancy</hi> is moſt
required, may live to repent no leſs
for his <hi>ſufferings,</hi> than their own
ungratefull <hi>errours,</hi> and that inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
contempt and meanneſs which
they bring upon their calling and
perſons.</p>
                  <p>12. An afflicted <hi>King,</hi> though
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:115964:137"/>
he pities all Clergy-men that deſert
<hi>Him,</hi> and deſpiſeth none of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
opinion from his, yet ſure
He may take leave to make choiſe
of ſome for his ſpecial Attendants,
who are beſt approved in his <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and moſt ſutable to his <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. A <hi>King</hi> impriſoned by his
<hi>Subjects,</hi> to whom they will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the attendance of his <hi>Chaplains,</hi>
can make no more charitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of their denial, than that
they eſteem <hi>Him</hi> ſufficient <hi>Himſelf</hi>
to diſcharge his duty to <hi>God</hi> as a
<hi>Prieſt,</hi> though not to Men as a
<hi>Prince.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. I think both Offices, <hi>Regal</hi>
and <hi>Sacerdotal,</hi> might well become
the <hi>ſame Perſon,</hi> as anciently they
were under one name, and the united
rights of primogeniture.</p>
                  <p>15. A King cannot follow bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
preſidents, if He be able, than
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:115964:138"/>
thoſe two eminent <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
not more famous for their
Scepter and Crowns, than one was
for devout <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Prayers;</hi> the
other for his divine <hi>Parables</hi> and
<hi>Preaching;</hi> whence the one merited
and aſſumed the name of a <hi>Prophet,</hi>
the other a <hi>Preacher,</hi> Titles of
greater honour, where rightly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
than any of thoſe the <hi>Roman
Emperours</hi> affected from the <hi>Nations</hi>
they ſubdued. But,</p>
                  <p>16. Since the order of <hi>God's</hi>
Wiſdome and Providence, hath
for the moſt part alwayes diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
the gifts and offices of
<hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Prieſts;</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> and
<hi>Preachers,</hi> both in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and
<hi>Chriſtian Churches,</hi> an impriſoned
<hi>King</hi> may be ſorry to find <hi>Himſelf</hi>
reduced to the neceſſity of being
<hi>both,</hi> or injoying <hi>neither.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="237" facs="tcp:115964:138"/>
17. As a Soveraign owes his
<hi>Clergy</hi> the protection of a Chriſtian
<hi>King;</hi> ſo <hi>He</hi> ſhould deſire to enjoy
from them the benefit of their gifts
and prayers.</p>
                  <p>18. However, as the ſpiritual
Government, by which the devout
<hi>Soul</hi> is ſubject to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and through
his merits daily offers it ſelf and its
ſervices to <hi>God,</hi> every private be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
is a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Prieſt,</hi> inveſted
with the honour of a Royal <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi>
yet he is not thereby conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
<hi>Prieſt</hi> or <hi>Preacher,</hi> as to the
outward polity of the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>19. A <hi>King's</hi> conſciouſneſs to his
ſpiritual defects, may make him
more prize and deſire thoſe pious
aſſiſtances which, eſpecially in any
his exigencies, holy and good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
either <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
may afford him.</p>
                  <p>20. The <hi>King</hi> is reduced to great
extremities, to whom by <hi>God's</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115964:139"/>
and permiſſion to his <hi>Subjects,</hi>
nothing is left but his life for them
to take from <hi>Him;</hi> and nothing
more to deſire of them, which
might little ſeem to provoke their
jealouſies and offence to deny <hi>Him,</hi>
(as ſome have done) than this of
having ſome means afforded <hi>Him,</hi>
for his ſouls comfort and ſupport.</p>
                  <p>21. When a <hi>King,</hi> reduced to
extremity by his <hi>Subjects,</hi> makes
choice of <hi>Chaplains</hi> to aſſiſt <hi>Him,</hi>
that are men no way ſcandalous, and
every way eminent for their <hi>learning</hi>
and <hi>piety,</hi> no leſs than for their <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,</hi>
no exceptions imaginable can
be made againſt them, but only this,
<hi>That they may ſeem too able, and too
well affected toward him and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>22. A <hi>King</hi> ſhould count his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
the greater by far, when
they light alſo upon the young
<hi>Prince</hi> his <hi>ſon,</hi> and any others whom
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115964:139"/>
he may have cauſe to love ſo well as
<hi>Himſelf:</hi> and of whoſe unmerited
ſufferings <hi>He</hi> ſhould have a greater
ſenſe than of his own.</p>
                  <p>23. The different education of
<hi>Princes,</hi> hath different ſucceſs when
they come to exerciſe their <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
the evidence of which Holy
Writ affords us in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Rehoboam:</hi> The
one prepared by many afflictions for
a flouriſhing <hi>Kingdom;</hi> The other
ſoftned by the unparallel'd proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Solomon's</hi> Court, and ſo by
flatteries corrupted to the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution
both of <hi>Peace, Honour,</hi> and
<hi>Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. A diſtreſſed <hi>King</hi> may truſt,
that <hi>God</hi> will graciouſly direct all the
black lines of <hi>Affliction,</hi> which he
pleaſeth to draw on <hi>him</hi> to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of true happineſs, if by them <hi>he</hi>
be drawn neerer of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:115964:140"/>
25. When a yong <hi>Prince</hi> ſhall
attain the <hi>Crown</hi> whereof his <hi>Father</hi>
was injuriouſly deveſted; He ought
firſt to do juſtice to <hi>God,</hi> his own
<hi>Soul,</hi> and his <hi>Church,</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
and proſecution both of <hi>truth</hi>
and <hi>unity</hi> in <hi>Religion;</hi> the next main
hinge on which his proſperity will
depend and move being that of <hi>Civil
Juſtice, He</hi> is to adminiſter to his
<hi>People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>26. When a good <hi>King</hi> is perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
by his own <hi>Subjects</hi> for the
preſervation of a <hi>right Religion</hi> and
<hi>juſt Lawes</hi> eſtabliſhed, he may (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vanity) turn the reproach of his
<hi>Sufferings,</hi> as to the World's cenſure,
into the honour of a kind of <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
as to the teſtimony of his
own <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>27. Since a diſtreſſed <hi>King</hi>
knowes not how <hi>God</hi> will deal with
<hi>Him,</hi> as to a removal of the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
and indignities which his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115964:140"/>
even by the very <hi>unjuſt</hi> hands
of ſome of his own <hi>Subjects</hi> may
have been pleaſed to lay upon <hi>Him,
He</hi> ſhould not be much ſolicitous,
what wrong <hi>He</hi> ſuffers from <hi>man,</hi>
while <hi>He</hi> retains in his ſoul what <hi>He</hi>
believes is right before <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>28. In civil diſſentions between
<hi>King</hi> and <hi>Subjects,</hi> though He offer
all for <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>ſafely</hi> that
in <hi>Reaſon, Honour</hi> and <hi>Conſcience
He</hi> can; yet he muſt reſerve what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<hi>He</hi> cannot conſent unto, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an irreparable injury to his own
<hi>Soul,</hi> the <hi>Chruch,</hi> and his <hi>People,</hi>
and the next undoubted <hi>Heir</hi> of his
<hi>Kingdoms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>29. No <hi>difficulties</hi> are inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to divine <hi>Providence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>30. When a yong <hi>Prince,</hi> after
his <hi>Fathers</hi> deceaſe, comes to the
government of <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> which <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults</hi>
and <hi>Civil Wars</hi> had put into
diſorder, <hi>He</hi> ought ſeriouſly to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:115964:141"/>
conſider the former real or objected
<hi>miſcariages</hi> which might occaſion
<hi>his</hi> troubles, that ſo <hi>he</hi> may avoid
<hi>his own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>31. By the Sun-ſhine of <hi>God's</hi>
mercy, and the ſplendour of a <hi>Princes</hi>
virtues, whole mountains of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed
factions may be thawed and
diſſipated.</p>
                  <p>32. Acts of <hi>Indempnity</hi> and <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion</hi>
ſhould by an indulgent <hi>King</hi> be
offered to ſo great a latitude, as may
include all that can but ſuſpect
themſelves to be any way obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the <hi>Lawes,</hi> and which may
ſerve to exclude all future <hi>jealouſies</hi>
and <hi>inſecurities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>33. If <hi>God</hi> ſee fit to reſtore an
injur'd <hi>King</hi> to the enjoyment of his
<hi>Kingdoms,</hi> He ought then to let
the <hi>Prince</hi> his <hi>ſon</hi> fully underſtand
the things that belong to <hi>God's glory,</hi>
his own <hi>honour,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdoms
peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:115964:141"/>
34. A charitable <hi>King,</hi> though
injur'd by his <hi>Subjects,</hi> for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
peace of his <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> ſhould
encourage the <hi>Prince</hi> his <hi>Succeſſour</hi>
to be as confident as <hi>Himſelf,</hi> That
the moſt part of all ſides, who have
done amiſs, have done ſo not out
of <hi>malice,</hi> but <hi>miſinformation</hi> or <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſion</hi>
of things.</p>
                  <p>35. Whatſoever good the <hi>Royal
Father</hi> intended to <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>State,</hi>
in times uncapable of it, ſhould be
performed by the <hi>Prince</hi> his <hi>Son,</hi>
when poſſeſſed of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> and
<hi>Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>36. It is a <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>benediction</hi>
worthy of an afflicted <hi>King</hi> That
<hi>God</hi> would after his deceaſe ſo bleſs
the <hi>Prince</hi> his <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Succeſſour,</hi> as
to eſtabliſh his <hi>Kingdoms</hi> in <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi>
his <hi>Soul</hi> in <hi>true Religion,</hi> and
his <hi>Honour</hi> in the love of <hi>God</hi> and his
<hi>People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>37. Though <hi>God</hi> permit <hi>Diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:115964:142"/>
to be perfected by the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a <hi>King;</hi> yet <hi>He</hi> may make
his memory and name live ever in
his <hi>Son,</hi> as of his <hi>Father</hi> that lov'd
<hi>Him,</hi> and a <hi>King</hi> under whom his
<hi>Kingdoms</hi> flouriſhed for a time.</p>
                  <p>38. A <hi>King</hi> in affliction ſhould
believe <hi>God's power,</hi> and have hope
of his <hi>will</hi> to reſtore <hi>Him</hi> to his
<hi>Rights,</hi> deſpairing neither of his
<hi>mercy,</hi> nor of his peoples <hi>love</hi> and
<hi>pity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>39. Although a <hi>King's</hi> dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
<hi>Enemies</hi> uſe all the the poyſon
of falſity, and violence of hoſtility
to deſtroy firſt the love and <hi>Loyalty</hi>
which is in his <hi>Subjects;</hi> and then
all that content of life in him, which
from theſe He chiefly enjoyed; yet
they may fail of their end, and after
the many deaths the <hi>King</hi> ſuffers for
the good will of his <hi>People, He</hi> may
not be wholly dead, till their further
malice and cruelty take that little
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:115964:142"/>
of life too, the <hi>husk</hi> and <hi>ſhell</hi> (as it
were) which they had only left
<hi>Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>40. Although that a <hi>King</hi> muſt
die as a <hi>man,</hi> is certain; That <hi>He</hi>
may die a <hi>King</hi> by the hands of his
own <hi>Subjects,</hi> a violent, ſodain, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
death, in the ſtrength of his
years, in the midſt of his <hi>Kingdoms,</hi>
his friends and loving <hi>Subjects</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
helpleſs <hi>Spectatours;</hi> his <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
inſolent <hi>Revilers</hi> and <hi>Triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
over <hi>Him,</hi> living, dying, and
dead; may ſometimes be probable
in humane reaſon, nought elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be hoped for, as to <hi>mans cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty;</hi>
yet <hi>He</hi> is not to deſpair of <hi>God's</hi>
infinite <hi>mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>41. It is not eaſie for a depreſſed
<hi>King</hi> to contend with thoſe many
horrours of <hi>Death,</hi> wherewith <hi>God</hi>
may ſuffer Him to be tempted;
which may be equally horrid, either
in the ſuddenneſs of a barbarous
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:115964:143"/>
                     <hi>Aſſaſination,</hi> or in the ſolemn cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
of an unjuſt <hi>ſentence,</hi> and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<hi>execution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>42. A <hi>King</hi> under ſuch a ſad ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,
muſt humbly deſire to
depend upon <hi>God,</hi> and to ſubmit to
his will both in life and death, in
what order ſoever he is pleaſed to lay
them out to him.</p>
                  <p>43. All <hi>Soveraigns</hi> are obliged to
own <hi>God</hi> as <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> not
only for the eminency of his <hi>power</hi>
and Majeſty above them, but alſo
for that ſingular care and <hi>protection</hi>
which he hath over them, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dangers they are expos'd unto.</p>
                  <p>44. <hi>God</hi> many times ſo pleads
the cauſe of that <hi>King</hi> which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
to be in the power of diſloyal
and bloudy-minded <hi>Subjects,</hi> that
he ſhewes him the ſad confuſions
following his deſtruction preſaged
and confirmed to <hi>Him,</hi> by thoſe
he lives to ſee in his troubles; and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115964:143"/>
                     <hi>God</hi> gives his <hi>Enemies</hi> cauſe to fear,
that he will both further divide, and
by mutual vengeance afterward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
them.</p>
                  <p>45. It may be the <hi>King's</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
who is wronged, and dethroned
by his <hi>Subjects,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> gives him
not only the honour to imitate
<hi>Chriſt's</hi> example in ſuffering for
<hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> ſake, though obſcured
by the fouleſt charges of <hi>Tyranny</hi> and
<hi>Injuſtice,</hi> but the charity both to
forgive them, and pray for them,
that <hi>God</hi> would not impute his <hi>bloud</hi>
to them, further than to convince
them what need they have of <hi>Chriſt's</hi>
bloud to waſh their ſouls from the
guilt of ſhedding <hi>his.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>46. The unfortunate <hi>King</hi> that
ſees himſelf deſtin'd to be murther'd
by his cruel <hi>Subjects,</hi> may bleſs <hi>God,</hi>
if he has the heart to pray, not ſo
much that the bitter cup of a violent
death may paſs from <hi>Him,</hi> as that
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115964:144"/>
of his wrath may paſs from all thoſe
whoſe hands by deſerting him are
<hi>ſprinkled,</hi> or by acting and conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his death are <hi>embrued</hi> with his
bloud.</p>
                  <p>47. Rebellious <hi>Subjects</hi> cannot
deprive a <hi>King</hi> of more than <hi>He</hi>
may be content to loſe, when <hi>God</hi>
ſees fit by their hands, to take it
from <hi>Him,</hi> whoſe mercy he is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
will more than iufinitely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
what ever by mans inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<hi>He</hi> is pleaſed to deprive him
of.</p>
                  <p>48. A miſerable <hi>King</hi> ſhall not
want the heavy and envied <hi>Crowns</hi>
of this world, when <hi>God</hi> hath mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully
<hi>Crowned</hi> and <hi>Conſummated</hi> his
graces with Glory, and exchanged
the ſhadowes of his <hi>earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi>
among men for the ſubſtance
of that <hi>Heavenly Kingdom</hi> with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>49. A good <hi>King</hi> overpower'd
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115964:144"/>
by <hi>Rebbels,</hi> may notwithſtanding
be perſwaded within himſelf, that
he is happy in the judicious love of
the ableſt and beſt of his <hi>Subjects,</hi>
who may not only pity and pray <hi>for
him,</hi> but may be content even to
dy <hi>with him,</hi> or <hi>for him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>50. No <hi>Subjects</hi> that pretend to
puniſh, can reaſonably therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the errours of their <hi>Princes,</hi>
eſpecially where more than ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ſatisfaction hath been made
to the publick, the enjoyment of
which private ambitions may have
fruſtrated.</p>
                  <p>51. An injur'd <hi>King's</hi> chiefeſt
comfort in death conſiſts in his <hi>peace</hi>
made with <hi>God;</hi> before whoſe exact
<hi>Tribunal</hi> he need not fear to appear,
as to any cauſe long-diſputed by the
<hi>Sword</hi> between <hi>Him</hi> and his cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<hi>Enemies.</hi>

                  <p>52. A good <hi>King</hi> may look upon
it with infinite more content and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115964:145"/>
quiet of <hi>Soul,</hi> to have been worſted
in his enforced conteſtation for, and
vindication of the juſt <hi>Lawes</hi> of his
<hi>Land,</hi> the freedom and honour of

and the true <hi>Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
in its <hi>Doctrines, Government,</hi>
and due encouragements, than if He

                  <p>53. The <hi>King</hi> that ſuffers for
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he is the Authour of <hi>Truth,
Order,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> being forced to

<hi>Him,</hi> be more than <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi>
in the end.</p>
                  <p>54. Although any violent death
of an unfortunate <hi>King</hi> be the wages
of his <hi>own</hi> ſin, as from <hi>God,</hi> and the

that they ſhall be no ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients

                  </p>
                  <p>55. An unfortunate <hi>King,</hi> though
us'd like <hi>Jonas,</hi> ſhould wiſh no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than the ſafe-bringing of the
ſhip to ſhore, when they have caſt
Him over-board.</p>
                  <p>56. The cruelty of a devoted
<hi>King's</hi> Enemies cannot prevent his
preparation, whoſe malice, by <hi>God's</hi>
mercy, He may in this defeat, that
they ſhall not have the ſatisfaction
to have deſtroyed his <hi>Soul</hi> with his

                  </p>
                  <p>57. Converſation is the chief <hi>joy,</hi>
or <hi>vexation,</hi> of a <hi>King's</hi> life.</p>
                  <p>58. The converſation a <hi>King</hi> has
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:115964:146"/>
in his troubles can be no way ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
or uſefull, when ſome about
Him are too <hi>wiſe,</hi> others too <hi>fooliſh;</hi>
ſome too <hi>buſie,</hi> others too <hi>reſerved,</hi>
many <hi>fantaſtick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>59. A <hi>King</hi> much delighted with
the converſation of his vertuous
<hi>Queen,</hi> is hard to be pleaſed by any
elſe about <hi>Him,</hi> when forced to part
from <hi>her,</hi> but not leſs to be pitied
by <hi>her,</hi> who is the only cure for that
diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>60. A vertuous <hi>Queen's kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
is as neceſſary to comfort the
heart of her <hi>King</hi> who is ſeparated
from her by his troubles or misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
as her <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> is for his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
                  <p>61. A <hi>King</hi> full fraught with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
need pray <hi>God</hi> to ſend
him a good unlading, eſpecially
when ſome blow of importance is to
be given between his and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
Army</hi> in the field.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:115964:146"/>
62. Although a <hi>King</hi> cannot
brag of ſtore of mony in his Wars;
yet a <hi>ſharp ſword</hi> alwayes hinders
ſtarving at leaſt.</p>
                  <p>63. In <hi>Civil Wars,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> may
make as good a ſhift with an empty
purſe as the <hi>Rebels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>64. A generous <hi>Queen</hi> whoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to her <hi>King</hi> is truly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
will be in as much (if not more)
trouble to find his <hi>Reputation,</hi> as his
<hi>Life</hi> in danger.</p>
                  <p>65. When diſtractions in <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
ariſe amongſt <hi>Rebels,</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>
is ſet againſt <hi>General</hi> in point

not to be refuſed by <hi>Him,</hi> when all
means uſed to procure it, ſhall be
conſiſtent with his <hi>Royal Honour</hi> and
<hi>ſafety,</hi> and all elſe unqueſtionably
councelable conſidered.</p>
                  <p>66. When <hi>Rebels,</hi> confident of
their <hi>power,</hi> or obſtinate in their

                     <hi>purpoſe,</hi> become ſomewhat difficult
to be brought into a <hi>Treaty,</hi> the
ſound of their <hi>King's</hi> coming to
them may have ſome force of <hi>popular
Rhetorick</hi> to obtain it; of, if refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
it may bring much prejudice
to them, and be advantageous to
their <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>67. When fooliſh or malicious
Peope ſhall interpret their <hi>King's</hi>
deſire, to treat with <hi>Rebels</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>folly; He</hi> is to
joyn ſuch conditions with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of it, as may be found to
be moſt of the chief ingredients of
an <hi>honourable</hi> and <hi>ſafe Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>68. A <hi>King</hi> may prudently yield
to a <hi>Treaty</hi> with <hi>Rebels</hi> in their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ſo that the conditions ſave any
aſperſion of diſhonour, if <hi>factious
Spirits</hi> about Him are likely to infuſe
their malignity in his own.</p>
                  <p>69. When a <hi>King</hi> in ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,
expreſſeth his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:115964:147"/>

whence falſe malicious rumours may
give trouble to his abſent <hi>Queen;</hi>
although <hi>He</hi> judge <hi>Himſelf</hi> ſecure in
her thoughts from ſuſpecting Him
guilty of any <hi>baſeneſs;</hi> yet He may
hold it neceſſary to ſend her ſome
account, to the end ſhe may make
others know as well as her ſelf this,
which ought to be a certain truth,
That no danger of <hi>death</hi> or <hi>miſery</hi>
(which He may think much worſe)
ſhould make Him do any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of her <hi>love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>70. In times of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> when
diverſe men propoſe ſeveral <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences</hi>
to themſelves for their pains
and hazard with their <hi>King,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery

and wiſh for <hi>Himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>71. A <hi>King</hi> in no extremity,
ſhould make a peace with <hi>Rebels</hi>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:115964:148"/>
by abandoning his friends, or ſuch a

                  </p>
                  <p>72. <hi rend="margQuotes">Although a <hi>King</hi> cannot

                  </p>

                  <p>79. Although a <hi>Queen</hi> have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed

He ought to ſay ſomething, leaving
the reſt to be read by her, out of her

                  <p>80. When <hi>Rebels</hi> have once

                  </p>

                  </p>

two things are chiefly conſiderable

                  <p>1. IT is a high thing to tax a <hi>King</hi>
with breach of promiſe.</p>
                  <p>2. A <hi>Parliament</hi> may have worſe
informations, than the <hi>King</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
againſt which they except.</p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>King</hi> of whom the <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>

is not to part with it for an hour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Nor ſhould that be demanded of a
<hi>King,</hi> wherewith his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are not to be truſted.</p>
                  <p>4. A <hi>King</hi> is not to puniſh or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
his <hi>People</hi> for petitioning to
<hi>Him</hi> in an humble way, though
the <hi>Subject</hi> do not agree with his

5. A <hi>King</hi> ſometimes cannot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
his <hi>People</hi> in a debt due to the
Country, when all the <hi>Water</hi> goes
not to the right <hi>Mill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. When <hi>Lawes</hi> are altered by
any other <hi>Authority,</hi> than that by
which they were made, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of the <hi>Peoples</hi> happineſs are
deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>7. When the <hi>King</hi> is oppreſſed,
and his juſt <hi>Kights</hi> taken from <hi>Him,</hi>
it is impoſſible for the <hi>Subjects Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties</hi>
and <hi>properties</hi> to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Errours</hi> and <hi>miſtakes</hi> among
Loyal Subjects proceeding from
misinformation, are removed with
more ſatisfaction and eaſe to them,
than they were received.</p>
                  <p>9. A <hi>King</hi> ſhould hold it a piece
of his duty, to take the utmoſt
pains He can, fully to inform and
undeceive his <hi>People;</hi> and rather to
<hi>prevent</hi> crimes, than to <hi>puniſh</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:115964:153"/>
10. Perſons of ill diſpoſitions
take as great pains to do miſchief,
and to bring <hi>confuſion,</hi> as good men
ſhould for <hi>peace</hi> and happineſs in a
<hi>Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. When a good <hi>King</hi> ſends
ſuch <hi>Propoſitions</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation</hi>
to his <hi>Parliament</hi> that
conteſted with <hi>Him,</hi> as to which <hi>He</hi>
may expect they ſhould with ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity
ſubmit, if the unexcuſable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of <hi>Peace</hi> be not ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to prevail, <hi>He</hi> may reaſonably
hope to have no other uſe of his
Loyal <hi>Peoples</hi> affections, but in their
<hi>prayers,</hi> not needing their aſſiſtance,
when <hi>He</hi> requireth nothing that
with more juſtice can be denied <hi>Him,</hi>
than his <hi>Crown</hi> or <hi>Life</hi> be taken
from <hi>Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. When the <hi>Religion, Liberty-Lawes,</hi>
which are good <hi>Subjects</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg
and protection, become the
quarrel between a <hi>King</hi> and any
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:115964:154"/>
his <hi>People</hi> in <hi>Rebellion,</hi> the taking
his <hi>Towns, Ships, Armies</hi> and <hi>money</hi>
from <hi>Him,</hi> ſhould not diſhearten
<hi>Him;</hi> the concurrence and affection
of his people with <hi>God's</hi> bleſſing will
ſupply and recover all.</p>
                  <p>13. In time of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> when
any Country or Province have
ſhewed much forwardneſs, and made
great expreſſions of their affections
to the <hi>King, He</hi> ſhould never be
ſatisfied with <hi>Himſelf,</hi> till <hi>He</hi> have
found ſome way to fix a mark of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and eſtimation upon the ſame,
which may tell Poſterity how good
<hi>Subjects,</hi> and how much <hi>Gentlemen</hi>
they have been.</p>
                  <p>14. The memory of any ſignal
<hi>Loyalty</hi> ſhewed by <hi>Perſons</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces</hi>
to the <hi>Royal Father,</hi> ſhould
grow up in a juſt acknowledgment
with his <hi>Sons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. In times of diſtraction, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
<hi>Spirits</hi> will be abroad, and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:115964:154"/>
every day throw in new accidents to
diſturb and confound the publick
<hi>Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>16. <hi>Rebellion</hi> that at firſt but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies
it ſelf in a <hi>Town,</hi> will at length
riſe to that inſolence, as not to be
any longer confined within the
<hi>Walls,</hi> but make ſallies out to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
murder, cruelty and rapine upon
the perſons and poſſeſſions of good
<hi>Subjects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. The ſad effects of counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
<hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Jealouſies</hi> in a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
are ſuch, as no men can tell the
leaſt <hi>good</hi> they <hi>do,</hi> nor the leaſt <hi>evill</hi>
they <hi>prevent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18. The <hi>King</hi> againſt whom all
advantages will be taken by perſons
diſaffected to <hi>Him,</hi> ſhould take heed
where <hi>He</hi> comes, that no eminent
diſorder or damage befall any Man
by any perſon of his Train, or under
his protection.</p>
                  <p>19. Where a Party of <hi>People</hi>
                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:115964:155"/>
have ſhewed themſelves eminently
<hi>loyal</hi> to their <hi>King,</hi> the fulleſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of his affection to them, and
to the <hi>peace</hi> of their County may be
this, to paſs over the conſiderations
of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Reproach,</hi> and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a provocation to provoke <hi>Him</hi>
to make that place be the ſeat of his
<hi>War.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>20. No honeſt man can imagine
that his <hi>King</hi> will ever ſit down
under a bold and unexcuſable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>21. A <hi>King</hi> wholly caſt upon the
affections of his <hi>People,</hi> having no
hope but in the bleſſing and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of <hi>God,</hi> the juſtneſs of his
<hi>Cauſe,</hi> and the love of his <hi>Subjects,</hi>
to recover what is taken from <hi>Him</hi>
and <hi>Them,</hi> may expect a good iſſue,
the rather in that <hi>they</hi> are equal loſers
with <hi>Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>22. When a <hi>King</hi> deſires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his <hi>People,</hi> but what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:115964:155"/>
to be done for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>God's</hi> true <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Lawes</hi>
of the <hi>Land,</hi> the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
and the very being of his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
He</hi> has reaſon to look for a
ſpeedy and effectual compliance with
his demands.</p>
                  <p>23. A <hi>King</hi> has no reaſon to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Reſolution</hi> of
thoſe his <hi>Subjects,</hi> whoſe <hi>Conſcience</hi>
and <hi>Loyalty</hi> have brought them to
<hi>Him,</hi> to fight for their <hi>Religion,</hi>
their <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Lawes</hi> of their
<hi>Land,</hi> eſpecially when they are to
meet with no <hi>Enemies</hi> but <hi>Traytors,
Schiſmaticks,</hi> and <hi>Atheïſts,</hi> ſuch as
deſire to deſtroy both <hi>Church</hi> and
<hi>State,</hi> and who have before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
them to ruine for being <hi>loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
to their <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. It gives courage to the <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,</hi>
when his <hi>King</hi> ſatisfies <hi>Him</hi>
that the cauſe is juſt, wherein <hi>He</hi>
means to make uſe of his valour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="272" facs="tcp:115964:156"/>
25. If the time of <hi>War,</hi> and the
great neceſſity and ſtraits a <hi>King</hi> is
driven to, beget any violation of
thoſe <hi>Lawes</hi> to which He hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
He may hope it ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
by <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> to the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi>
of the <hi>War,</hi> and not to <hi>Him,</hi>
if ſo <hi>He</hi> hath earneſtly laboured for
the preſervation of the <hi>Peace</hi> of his
<hi>Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>26. The Reſidence of an <hi>Army</hi>
is not uſually pleaſant to any place,
and that of a diſtreſſed <hi>King</hi> caries
more fear with it, who, it may be
thought, muſt only live upon the aid
and relief of his people.</p>
                  <p>27. It is not prudence in loyal
<hi>Subjects,</hi> to ſuffer a good <hi>Cauſe</hi> to
be loſt, for want of ſupplying their
<hi>King</hi> with that which will be taken
from them by thoſe who purſue
Him with violence.</p>
                  <p>28. Whilſt ill men ſacrifice their
<hi>Money, Plate,</hi> and utmoſt <hi>Induſtry</hi>
                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:115964:156"/>
to <hi>deſtroy</hi> the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> good
men ſhould be no leſs liberal to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it.</p>
                  <p>29. When it hath pleaſed <hi>God</hi> to
bleſs a <hi>King</hi> with ſucceſs in a <hi>War,</hi>
He ſhould remember the <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi>
every particular man gave Him, to
his advantage.</p>
                  <p>30. However a <hi>King</hi> ſucceeds in
his <hi>Wars,</hi> it will be honour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to his <hi>loyal Subjects,</hi> that with
ſome charge and trouble to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they did their part to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
their <hi>King,</hi> and preſerve the
<hi>Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>31. The <hi>People</hi> that have been
awed by a <hi>Rebellious Army,</hi> will be
more prone to expreſs their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to their <hi>King,</hi> with that courage
which becomes them, when his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence</hi>
ſhall be ſo near, that his
<hi>Power</hi> ſhall have an influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Country</hi> for their prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:115964:157"/>
32. No man ſhould have more
power to fright <hi>People</hi> from their
<hi>Loyalty,</hi> than their <hi>King</hi> have to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
them to it.</p>
                  <p>33. <hi>Loyal Subjects,</hi> in aſſiſting
their <hi>King,</hi> defend <hi>themſelves,</hi> who
may be ſure the <hi>Sword</hi> which is
drawn againſt <hi>Him,</hi> will deſtroy
<hi>them,</hi> if <hi>He</hi> defend them not.</p>
                  <p>34. It will be a ſhame for <hi>People</hi>
to venture nothing for their <hi>King,</hi>
who ventures his life for <hi>them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>35. In a <hi>Civil War,</hi> whatſoever
good <hi>People</hi> ſhall be willing freely to
contribute, their <hi>King</hi> ſhould take
kindly from them: and whatſoever
they <hi>lend Him,</hi> he ſhould, having
paſſed the word of a <hi>King,</hi> ſee juſtly
<hi>repayed</hi> to them.</p>
                  <p>36. A <hi>King</hi> ſhould take eſpecial
notice, of ſuch who are backward to
<hi>contribute</hi> in a time of viſible <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>37. When a <hi>King</hi> conſiders the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:115964:157"/>
publick intereſts and concernments
of his <hi>Parliament</hi> in the happineſs
and honour of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and their
particular ſufferings in a <hi>Rebellion</hi>
for their affection and <hi>Loyalty</hi> unto
Him, He muſt look upon them as
the moſt competent <hi>Conſiderers,</hi> and
<hi>Counſellours,</hi> how to manage and
improve the condition all are in, <hi>his</hi>
and <hi>their</hi> condition being ſo equall
that the ſame violence hath op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
them all.</p>
                  <p>38. It will be in vain for them
who have informed the <hi>World</hi> by

                  </p>
                  <p>39. It will be hard for a <hi>King,</hi>
who is to ſtruggle with many <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi>
and <hi>neceſſities,</hi> to keep a ſtrict
<hi>diſcipline</hi> among his <hi>Soldiers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>40. <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Deſpair</hi> make <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi>
ſometimes more wicked than

                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:115964:158"/>
41. A <hi>King</hi> ſhould have no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>ſadneſs</hi> for thoſe who are his <hi>ill
Subjects,</hi> than He hath <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>

who are his <hi>good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>42. <hi>Licenſe</hi> and <hi>Diſorder</hi> in an

the <hi>beſt</hi> cauſe.</p>
                  <p>43. <hi>Subjects</hi> ought to remember,
That <hi>moneys</hi> are the <hi>nerves</hi> of <hi>War,</hi>
and accordingly expedite <hi>ſupplies</hi> to
their <hi>King,</hi> when He needs them.</p>
                  <p>44. There is no profeſſion a <hi>King</hi>
hath made for the defence and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of <hi>right Religion, Lawes</hi> and
<hi>Liberties,</hi> which He ſhould not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably

                  <p>45. A <hi>King's</hi> Opinion, wherein

ſhould not be like the <hi>Lawes</hi>
of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians, unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>46. Nothing ſhould ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict

                  </p>
                  <p>48. <hi>Civil Diſſentions</hi> that are

a <hi>foreign Enemy</hi> to make a prey

                  <p>49. <hi>Plague, Peſtilence</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>50. A <hi>Kingdom</hi> being infeſted
with <hi>Civil War,</hi> ſo general a habit
of <hi>uncharitableneſs</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
throughout, that even <hi>Peace</hi>

                  <p>51. In the time of a <hi>Civil War,</hi>

the <hi>Epiſcopal power</hi> originally from

14. The teſtimonies of ſo many
writers, <hi>ancient,</hi> and <hi>modern,</hi> as
have been produced for the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Original</hi>
of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> may be
conceived of ſo great importance in

                  <p>15. One witneſs for the <hi>affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>16. A <hi>Prince</hi> to ſhew the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

17. A <hi>King</hi> may expect not to
be ceuſur'd for having parted with
too much of his <hi>right,</hi> when the
<hi>price</hi> and <hi>commodity</hi> is ſo great, ſuch
as <hi>ſecurity</hi> to <hi>Himſelf,</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> to

                  </p>
                  <p>18. A prudent <hi>Parliament</hi> ought

power</hi> is to a <hi>Peoples liberty.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>23. <hi>Subjects,</hi> who have learnt,
that <hi>Victories</hi> over their <hi>Princes,</hi> are
but <hi>triumphs</hi> over <hi>themſelves,</hi> will
be more unwilling to hearken to
changes afterward.</p>
                  <p>24. A diſtreſſed <hi>King</hi> may beſt
learn to own <hi>Himſelf,</hi> by retiring
into <hi>Himſelf,</hi> and therefore can the
better digeſt what befalls <hi>Him,</hi> not
doubting but <hi>God</hi> can reſtrain his
<hi>Enemies</hi> malice, and turn their fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
unto his praiſe.</p>
                  <p>25. If <hi>God</hi> give an injur'd <hi>King</hi>

                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:115964:171"/>
26. If <hi>God</hi> reſtore an exil'd <hi>King</hi>
to his right upon hard conditions,
whatſoever <hi>He promiſeth, He</hi> ought
to <hi>keep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>27. Thoſe men who have forced

of <hi>troubles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>28. A <hi>Prince</hi> is not to think
any thing in this world worth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
by <hi>foul</hi> and <hi>unjuſt</hi> means.</p>
                  <p>29. No <hi>Earthly</hi> power can juſtly

                  </p>
                  <p>30. A good <hi>King</hi> will not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

<hi>belief</hi> upon his <hi>Subjects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>31. There is no proceeding juſt
againſt any man, but what is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
either by <hi>God's Lawes,</hi> or the
<hi>municipal Lawes</hi> of the <hi>Country</hi>

                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:115964:172"/>
32. The true <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Subjects</hi>
conſiſts not in the power of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
but in living under ſuch
<hi>Lawes,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Government,</hi> as may
give themſelves the beſt aſſurance
of their <hi>lives,</hi> and <hi>propriety</hi> of their
goods.</p>
                  <p>33. The <hi>King</hi> who has a <hi>Truſt</hi>
committed to <hi>Him</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> by <hi>old</hi>
and <hi>lawfull deſcent,</hi> muſt not betray
it, to anſwer to a <hi>new unlawfull Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>34. It is a great ſin for <hi>Subjects,</hi>
to withſtand <hi>lawfull Authority,</hi> as it
is to ſubmit to an <hi>Authority Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,</hi>
or any other wayes <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>35. A haſty <hi>ſentence</hi> once <hi>paſt,</hi>
may be ſooner <hi>repented,</hi> than <hi>recalled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>36. It is in vain, for a <hi>King</hi> to be
a <hi>Sceptick,</hi> by denying the power
<hi>Rebels</hi> have, when greater than <hi>He</hi>

                     <pb n="305" facs="tcp:115964:172"/>
37. A haſty <hi>Judgment,</hi> paſſed
upon the <hi>Life</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi> may bring
on that trouble and perpetual incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
to a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that the
<hi>child</hi> which is then unborn may <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi>
it.</p>
                  <p>38. God many times does pay
<hi>Juſtice</hi> by an <hi>unjuſt Sentence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>39. <hi>Conqueſt</hi> is never <hi>juſt,</hi> except
there be a good <hi>juſt cauſe,</hi> either for
matter of wrong of <hi>juſt Title,</hi> and
then they that go beyond it, the

it that makes <hi>unjuſt</hi> at the <hi>end</hi> what

                  </p>
                  <p>40. Sole matter of <hi>Conqueſt</hi> is a
great <hi>Robbery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>41. Thoſe <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> or <hi>Officers</hi>

42. The regulating a <hi>Church</hi>

                  <head>The Firſt Century.</head>
                  <p>1. REſolutions of future <hi>Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
do not alwayes ſatisfie
Gods <hi>Juſtice,</hi> nor prevent his <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi>
for former miſcariages.</p>
                  <p>2. When out <hi>Sins</hi> have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lai'd
our <hi>Hopes,</hi> we are taught to
depend on Gods mercies to forgive,
not on our purpoſe to amend.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:115964:181"/>
3. God often vindicates his <hi>glory</hi>
by his <hi>judgments,</hi> and ſhews us how
unſafe it is to <hi>offend</hi> him, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions
afterwards to <hi>pleaſe</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>4. For want of timely <hi>repentance</hi>
of our ſins, God gives us cauſe to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi>
of thoſe <hi>remedies</hi> we too late
apply.</p>
                  <p>5. When God gives us the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of our <hi>afflictions</hi> and his <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements,</hi>
we may dare account
them the ſtrokes not of an <hi>Enemy,</hi>
but a <hi>Father,</hi> whoſe <hi>rod,</hi> as well as his
<hi>ſtaf,</hi> may comfort us.</p>
                  <p>6. Gods <hi>grace</hi> is infinitely better
with our <hi>ſufferings,</hi> than our <hi>peace</hi>
could be with our <hi>ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. When God that over-rules
our <hi>Counſels,</hi> over-rules alſo our
<hi>hearts,</hi> the worſe things we ſuffer by
his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> the better we may be by
his <hi>Mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Sin</hi> may turn our <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes</hi>
into <hi>Poyſon;</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115964:181"/>
our <hi>Poyſon</hi> into <hi>Antidotes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. An act of ſinful compliance,
hath greater aggravations in a <hi>King,</hi>
than any man; eſpecially when
without the leaſt temptation of <hi>envy</hi>
or <hi>malice,</hi> he conſents to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a <hi>Peer,</hi> or meaner <hi>Subject,</hi>
whom by his place he ought to have
preſerved.</p>
                  <p>10. God ſees the contradiction
between a <hi>King's heart</hi> and his <hi>hand,</hi>
againſt whom the ſin is more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,
when he ſigns any man's
death, unſatisfied that he hath deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it.</p>
                  <p>11. A <hi>King</hi> may learn <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>
by God's <hi>Judgments,</hi> and ſee
his own <hi>frailty</hi> in God's <hi>juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. A <hi>King</hi> ought to prefer
<hi>Juſtice,</hi> which is the <hi>will of God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all contrary clamours, which do
but diſcover the injurious <hi>will of
man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. It is <hi>once</hi> too much, that a
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:115964:182"/>
                     <hi>King</hi> has <hi>once</hi> been overcome, to
<hi>pleaſe</hi> his Subjects by <hi>diſpleaſing</hi> of
God.</p>
                  <p>14. A <hi>King</hi> by divine permiſſion,
going againſt his <hi>Reaſon of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
for any <hi>Reaſon of State,</hi> highly
ſins againſt the God of Reaſon, and
Judg of Conſciences.</p>
                  <p>15. God's free Spirit ſupports
the <hi>Will</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi> and ſubjects it to
none but the divine light of <hi>Reaſon,
Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> which ſhine in
his Soul.</p>
                  <p>16. God deſireth <hi>Truth</hi> in the
<hi>inward</hi> parts of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi>
in their <hi>outward</hi> expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>17. When God hears the <hi>voyce</hi>
of our Saviour's <hi>bloud</hi> before the <hi>cry</hi>
of others undeſervedly ſhed, he
ſpeaks to <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> in the
<hi>voice</hi> of <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Gladneſs,</hi> which
makes the bones he had broken re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in his Salvation</p>
                  <p>18. A <hi>King</hi> purpoſing violence
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115964:182"/>
or oppreſſion againſt the <hi>Innocent,</hi>
may expect the <hi>Enemy</hi> to perſecute
his Soul, to tread his life to the
ground, and to lay his honour in the
duſt.</p>
                  <p>19. God that <hi>ſees</hi> not as man
<hi>ſees,</hi> lookes beyond all popular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
ſearches the heart, and
tryes the reins, and brings to light
things hidden in the dark.</p>
                  <p>20. A <hi>Kings afflictions</hi> cannot
be eſteemed by wiſe and godly men
any argument of his <hi>ſin,</hi> in ſhedding
<hi>bloud</hi> he would have ſaved, more
than their <hi>impunity</hi> among good
men is any ſure token of their <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi>
that forc't him to it.</p>
                  <p>21. A <hi>King</hi> may expect God's
Protection from the privy <hi>conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies,</hi>
and open <hi>violence</hi> of <hi>bloudy</hi>
and unreaſonable men, according to
the <hi>uprightneſs</hi> of his <hi>heart,</hi> and the
<hi>innocency</hi> of his <hi>hands</hi> in the matter
of <hi>bloud,</hi> or deſtruction of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:115964:183"/>
22. In time of <hi>civil diſſenſions,</hi> a
<hi>King</hi> may moſt ſafely flie to God
as his refuge and defence, who rules
the <hi>raging</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> and the <hi>mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of the <hi>People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>23. A <hi>King</hi> ſhould look upon his
own ſins, and the ſins of his People
(which are the <hi>tumults</hi> of their Souls
againſt God) as the juſt cauſe of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
inundations, permitted by God
to over-bear all the banks of <hi>Loyalty,
Modeſty, Lawes, Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. God can rebuke the <hi>rebellious</hi>
beaſts of the People, and deliver his
<hi>King</hi> from the rudeneſs and ſtrivings
of the multitude.</p>
                  <p>25. It becomes <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People,</hi>
as <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> unpaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
to ſee the light of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and
<hi>Religion;</hi> and with all due order and
gravity to follow it.</p>
                  <p>26. A Charitable <hi>King</hi> will wiſh
his <hi>rebellious</hi> People a timely ſenſe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115964:183"/>
and ſorrow, that <hi>ſhame</hi> here, and not
<hi>ſuffering</hi> hereafter, may be the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of their <hi>Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>27. When God ſhall ſet bounds
to our <hi>Paſſions</hi> by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> to our <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi>
by <hi>Truth,</hi> to our <hi>Seditions</hi> by
<hi>Lawes</hi> duly executed, and to our
<hi>Schiſmes</hi> by <hi>Charity,</hi> then we may
be as <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a City at unity in it
ſelf.</p>
                  <p>28. A <hi>King</hi> in diſtreſs, ſhould ſtill
appeal to his God, whoſe all-diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Juſtice</hi> ſees through all the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes</hi>
of mens pretenſions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
<hi>darkneſſes</hi> of their hearts.</p>
                  <p>29. A <hi>King</hi> to whom God gave
a heart to <hi>grant</hi> much to his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi>
may need a heart fitted to <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi>
much from them.</p>
                  <p>30. Gods Grace may teach a
<hi>King,</hi> wiſely to enjoy as well the
<hi>fruſtratings</hi> as the <hi>fullfillings</hi> of his
beſt hopes, and moſt ſpecious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:115964:184"/>
31. A <hi>King</hi> ſometimes, while he
thinks to allay others <hi>fears,</hi> may
raiſe his own; and by <hi>ſetling</hi> them,
<hi>unſettle</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>32. <hi>Evil</hi> for <hi>good</hi> is a bad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital;
and <hi>hatred</hi> for the <hi>good will</hi>
of a <hi>King</hi> to his <hi>People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>33. A <hi>King</hi> needs <hi>God</hi> for his <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot</hi>
in ſuch a dark and dangerous
<hi>ſtorm,</hi> as neither admits his return to
the <hi>Port</hi> whence he ſet out, nor his
making any other with that ſafety
and honour which he deſigned.</p>
                  <p>34. It is eaſie for God, to keep a
<hi>King</hi> ſafe in the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> of
his <hi>people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>35. A <hi>King</hi> needs <hi>God</hi> for his
<hi>Guardian</hi> amidſt the unjuſt hatred
and jealouſies of them whom he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
ſo far to prevail, as to pervert
and abuſe his <hi>acts</hi> of greateſt <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi>
to, and aſſurance of them.</p>
                  <p>36. A <hi>penitent King</hi> ought to
know no <hi>favours</hi> of his can make
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115964:184"/>
others more <hi>guilty</hi> than himſelf may
be in abuſing thoſe many and great
ones which God had conferred upon
him.</p>
                  <p>37. A <hi>King</hi> in time of publick
calamity by civil diſſenſions, ſhould
ask of God ſuch <hi>Repentance</hi> for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and his people as <hi>he</hi> will <hi>accept,</hi>
and ſuch <hi>Grace</hi> as <hi>they</hi> may not <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>38. The <hi>King</hi> is happy, who can
make a right <hi>uſe</hi> of others <hi>abuſes,</hi> and
by their failings of <hi>him,</hi> reflect with
a <hi>reforming</hi> diſpleaſure, upon his own
<hi>offemces</hi> againſt <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>39. Although a <hi>King</hi> for his <hi>own
ſins,</hi> be by <hi>other mens ſins</hi> deprived
of temporal bleſſings, yet he may be

                  <p>40. It is God's will a <hi>King</hi> ſhould

41. God requires of <hi>Kings,</hi> to
ſubmit <hi>their</hi> underſtandings and wills
unto <hi>his,</hi> whoſe wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
can neither erre, nor miſguide
them.</p>
                  <p>42. God requires of <hi>Kings,</hi> ſo
far to <hi>deny</hi> their carnal <hi>reaſon,</hi> in
order to his ſacred Myſteries and
Commands, that they ſhould <hi>believe</hi>
and <hi>obey,</hi> rather than <hi>diſpute</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>43. God expects from <hi>Kings</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuch a <hi>reaſonable ſervice</hi> of him, as

their <hi>Conſciences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>44. As to the deſires of men,
God enjoins <hi>Kings</hi> to try all things
by the touch-ſtone of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and
<hi>Lawes,</hi> which are the rules of <hi>civil
Juſtice,</hi> and to declare their conſents
to that only which their <hi>judgments</hi>

                  <p>45. <hi>Kings</hi> ſhould be very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to <hi>deſert</hi> that place in which
God hath ſet them, and whereto
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115964:185"/>
the affairs of their Kingdoms do call
them.</p>
                  <p>46. A <hi>King</hi> may be content, for
his Peoples good, to <hi>deny</hi> himſelf,
in what God hath ſubjected to his
diſpoſal.</p>
                  <p>47. The unthankfull <hi>importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
and tumultuary <hi>violence</hi> of ſome
mens immoderate <hi>demands,</hi> ſhould
never betray a <hi>King</hi> to that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

him ſtrengthen them by his <hi>conſent</hi>

the diſcharge of his own duty to
<hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>48. A <hi>King</hi> ſhould be willing to

<hi>Rebellious</hi> people preſs upon

againſt his <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>49. The juſt <hi>liberties</hi> of <hi>People</hi>
may well be preſerved in fair and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115964:186"/>
equal wayes, without the <hi>ſlavery</hi> of
their <hi>King's Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>50. He whom God hath inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his favours in the power of a
<hi>Chriſtian King,</hi> ſhould not ſubject his
<hi>Reaſon</hi> to other mens <hi>Paſſions</hi> and

                  <p>51. The way of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi>
will bring a diſtreſſed <hi>King</hi> at

though for them he hath much <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>52. A <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> ſcattered
on earth by their deſpightfull and
deadly enemies, may be prepared by
their <hi>ſufferings</hi> for God's preſence.</p>
                  <p>53. Though a <hi>King's</hi> difference
from his <hi>Queen</hi> in ſome things, as to
<hi>Religion,</hi> may be his greateſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
infelicity; yet the ſincerity of
their affections, which deſire to ſeek,
find, and to embrace every <hi>Truth,</hi>
given by God, may be acceptable
unto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:115964:186"/>
54. It is happy for <hi>King</hi> and
<hi>Queen</hi> different in <hi>Religion,</hi> when
either <hi>ignorance</hi> of what is neceſſary
to be known, or <hi>unbelief,</hi> or <hi>diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
to what they know, becomes
their <hi>miſery,</hi> or their wilfull <hi>default.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>55. The great ſcandal of <hi>Subjects</hi>
profeſſing the ſame true <hi>Religion</hi>
with their <hi>King,</hi> may be an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
to the diſſenting <hi>Queen,</hi> in
the love of ſome <hi>Truth</hi> God would
have her to learn; or may harden
her in ſome <hi>errour</hi> he would have
cleared to her.</p>
                  <p>56. A <hi>King's</hi> own and his <hi>Parties
conſtancy,</hi> is the beſt antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the poyſon of their example
that gave ſuch <hi>ſcandal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>57. The <hi>Truth</hi> of that <hi>Religion</hi>
the <hi>King</hi> propfeſſeth repreſented
with all the beauties of <hi>Humility,
Loyalty, Charity</hi> and <hi>Peaceableneſs,</hi>
as the proper fruits and ornaments
thereof, may prevail much upon
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115964:187"/>
the judgment of his <hi>diſſenting
Queen;</hi> as the odious diſguiſes of
<hi>Levity, Schiſm, Hereſie, Novelty,
Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Diſloyalty,</hi> which any
men's practiſes put upon it, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
her averſion from it.</p>
                  <p>58. God's ſacred and ſaving
<hi>Truths,</hi> cleared from all ruſt and
droſs of humane mixtures, gain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
love, and obedience to them, as
<hi>his.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>59. God beheld in the glaſs of
his <hi>Truth,</hi> in thoſe <hi>mercies</hi> which he
hath offered unto us in his only Son
and our Saviour, inviteth us to ſerve
him in all thoſe holy <hi>duties,</hi> which
moſt agree with his holy <hi>doctrine,</hi>
and moſt imitable <hi>example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>60. The experience a <hi>King</hi> and
<hi>Queen</hi> ſeparated by <hi>Rebels,</hi> have of
the vanity and uncertainty of all
humane glory and greatneſs, in their
ſcatterings and Eclipſes, ſhould make
them both ſo much the more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115964:187"/>
to be inveſted in thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
honours and perfections, which
are only to be found in <hi>God,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
through <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>61. A <hi>King</hi> ought not to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
his <hi>paſſion</hi> by any ſecret <hi>pleaſure</hi>
in <hi>his</hi> death or deſtruction, who hath
thereby ſatisfied the injury <hi>he</hi> did
him, leſt he make <hi>divine</hi> vengeance
<hi>his,</hi> and conſider the <hi>affront</hi> againſt
<hi>himſelf</hi> more than the <hi>ſin</hi> againſt
<hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>62. God often pleads the cauſe
of <hi>Kings</hi> before the ſons of men, by
making without their deſire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
the miſchief of <hi>Rebels</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
on their own heads, and their
violent dealing come down on their
own pates.</p>
                  <p>63. An injur'd <hi>King</hi> in charity
ſhould pray that <hi>God's juſtice</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
not the objects and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>his mercy,</hi> but that they who
have moſt offended him may live
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:115964:188"/>
and be forgiven by him, in that <hi>their
offenſes</hi> bear a proportion with <hi>his
treſpaſſes,</hi> for which he hopes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
from God.</p>
                  <p>64. A King ſhould pray for his
<hi>Rebellious Subjects,</hi> that God lay not
their ſins to their charge for <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi>
but to their Conſcience
for <hi>amendment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>65. God's exemplary <hi>vengeance</hi>
ſhew'd in the deſtruction of any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
<hi>Rebel,</hi> is as the lighting of
a <hi>thunderbolt,</hi> which by ſo ſevere a

                  </p>
                  <p>66. It may be wiſh'd, that they
who know not they have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs,
might have their ſin diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
to them; and that they who
ſin of <hi>malicious wickedneſs,</hi> might be
ſcared.</p>
                  <p>67. They who prevent Gods
<hi>judgments</hi> by their true <hi>repentance,</hi>
ſhall eſcape the ſtrokes of his eternal
<hi>vengeance.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="233" facs="tcp:115964:188"/>
68. <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
are the beſt ſupporters of a

                  <p>69. God ſees clearly through all
the cloudings of humane affairs, and
judges without prejudice, his uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
judgment having eternally his
<hi>omniſcience</hi> for its guide.</p>
                  <p>70. It is time for a <hi>King</hi> to call
upon God, when the <hi>proud</hi> riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and the <hi>Aſſemblies of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
men</hi> ſeek after his Soul, who
have not ſet God before their eyes.</p>
                  <p>71. A <hi>King</hi> ſhould have no <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>
nor <hi>deſign,</hi> to embroyl his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in a <hi>Civil War,</hi> to which he
has the leaſt temptation, as knowing
he muſt <hi>adventure</hi> more than any,
and <hi>gain</hi> leaſt of any by it.</p>
                  <p>72. A <hi>King</hi> ought to deplore
and ſtudy to divert the neceſſity of a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115964:189"/>
                     <hi>Civil War,</hi> unleſs he will be thought
ſo prodigally thirſty of his Subjects
<hi>bloud,</hi> as to venture his own life,
which were better ſpent to <hi>ſave,</hi>
than to <hi>deſtroy</hi> his People.</p>
                  <p>73. A <hi>King</hi> in time of <hi>Rebellion,</hi>
needs much of Gods grace with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to bear the <hi>afflictions,</hi> but
much more to ſuſtain the <hi>reproaches</hi>
of men, eſpecially if they make the
War <hi>his,</hi> which <hi>they</hi> have raiſed
<hi>themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>74. The <hi>confidence</hi> of ſome mens
falſe tongues is ſuch, that they would
make a <hi>King</hi> almoſt ſuſpect his own
<hi>Innocence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>75. A <hi>King</hi> whoſe <hi>innocency</hi> is
known unto God, may be content
(at leaſt by his ſilence) to take upon
him the imputed guilt before men,
if by that he can allay the malice of
his Enemies, and redeem his people
from the miſeries of <hi>War.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>76. God will find out <hi>bloudy</hi> and

                     <hi>deceitfull</hi> men, many of whom live
not half their dayes, in which they
promiſed themſelves the enjoyment
of the fruits of their violent and
wicked Counſels.</p>
                  <p>77. God will ſave a <hi>King</hi> that's
his ſervant, and in due time ſcatter
the people that delight in <hi>War.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>78. It is time for God to ariſe
and lift up himſelf, when the King's
enemies rage and increaſe, <hi>conceiving</hi>
miſchief, <hi>travailing</hi> with iniquity,
and <hi>bringing forth</hi> falſhood.</p>
                  <p>79. The deſign of a <hi>Civil War</hi>
is either to deſtroy the <hi>King's perſon,</hi>
or force <hi>his judgment,</hi> and to make
him renege <hi>his Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>Gods
Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>80. A <hi>King</hi> may be driven to
croſs <hi>David's</hi> choice, and deſire ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to fall into the hands of <hi>Men,</hi>
by denying them (though their

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:115964:190"/>
Conſcience,</hi> and in that againſt <hi>him</hi>
who is a conſuming fire: It being
better they <hi>deſtroy him,</hi> than God
<hi>damn him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>81. If nothing but a <hi>King's bloud</hi>
will ſatisfie his Enemies, or quench
the flames of his Kingdom, or
God's temporal Juſtice, he ſhould
be content, if it be Gods Will,
that it be ſhed by the hands of his

                  </p>
                  <p>82. When the <hi>bloud</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi>
though a <hi>ſinner,</hi> is waſh'd with the
<hi>bloud</hi> of his innocent and peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

both for the <hi>King's</hi> ſins,
and his <hi>Peoples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>83. A King that hath God on his

<hi>againſt him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>84. None in Heaven or Earth
is deſireable by a <hi>King</hi> in compariſon
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115964:190"/>
of <hi>God,</hi> who in the loſs of <hi>all,</hi> may be

                  <p>85. When people are encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

he may caſt his eyes up to Heaven,
he has no other power to oppoſe

                  <p>86. <hi>God</hi> needs no help, nor the

at leaſt to <hi>ſuffer,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>87. If God <hi>delights</hi> not in a

ought to render himſelf up to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to what God will have him,
whoſe judgments oft begin with his

                  <p>88. A <hi>King</hi> ſhould be content to

                  </p>
                  <p>89. God, who teacheth, That no

                  <p>91. A <hi>King</hi> ought to give <hi>God's

                  </p>
                  <p>92. <hi>Gods mercy</hi> muſt have the

                  <p>93. Any <hi>King</hi> that hath fought

by his ſins, and robbed him of <hi>his

                  <p>94. The <hi>King</hi> whoſe hope and

<hi>There is no help for him in his God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>95. The <hi>King's</hi> footſteps will

                  <p>97. God has marveilous loving

                  <p>2. That cannot be blameable in
a <hi>King,</hi> which is commendable vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and conſtancy in <hi>others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. It is open partiality and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
for <hi>ſeditious Subjects</hi> to deny
that freedom to their <hi>King,</hi> which
God hath given to <hi>all men,</hi> and
which <hi>themſelves</hi> pertinaciouſly

4. God can guide a diſtreſſed
<hi>King</hi> by an unerring rule, through
the perplexed <hi>Lubyrinths</hi> of his own
thoughts and other mens propoſals,
which he may have ſome cauſe to
ſuſpect, are purpoſely caſt as <hi>ſnares,</hi>
that by his granting or denying
them, he might be more entangled
in thoſe <hi>difficulties,</hi> wherewith they
lye in wait to afflict him.</p>
                  <p>5. A <hi>Kings</hi> own ſinfull <hi>paſſions</hi>
may cloud or divert <hi>Gods</hi> ſacred <hi>ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. A <hi>King</hi> ſhould propund to

Word</hi> for his rule, and then reſign
himſelf to <hi>Gods Will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. A <hi>King</hi> can hardly pleaſe <hi>all,</hi>
he need not care to pleaſe <hi>ſome</hi> men;
If he may be happy to pleaſe <hi>God,</hi>
he need not fear whom he diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>8. God maketh the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of
the World <hi>fooliſhneſs,</hi> and taketh in
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:115964:193"/>
their own <hi>deviſes,</hi> ſuch as are <hi>wiſe</hi> in
their own conceits.</p>
                  <p>9. A <hi>King</hi> made wiſe by God's
Truth, for God's honour, his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
general good, and his own
Souls ſalvation, need not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the Worlds opinion, or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
of him.</p>
                  <p>10. The leſs <hi>wiſdom</hi> ill-affected
Subjects are willing to impute to
their <hi>King,</hi> the more they ſhall be
convinced of <hi>God's wiſdom</hi> directing
him, while he <hi>denies</hi> nothing ſit to
be <hi>granted,</hi> out of <hi>croſsneſs,</hi> or <hi>humor;</hi>
nor <hi>grants</hi> any thing which is to be
<hi>denied</hi> out of any <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>flattery</hi> of
men.</p>
                  <p>11. A <hi>King</hi> ought to take care
he become not <hi>guilty,</hi> or <hi>unhappy,</hi> by
willing or inconſiderate advancing
any mens <hi>deſigns</hi> which are injurious
to the publick good, while he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
them by his <hi>conſent;</hi> Nor
muſt he be any occaſion to hinder
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:115964:194"/>
or defraud the publick of what is
beſt, by any moroſe or perverſe <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. A <hi>King</hi> ought to be ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
charitable, as to follow their <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>
when it appears to be for the
publick good, of whoſe <hi>affections</hi> to
him he may have but few evidences
to aſſure him.</p>
                  <p>13. God can as well bleſs <hi>honeſt
errours,</hi> as blaſt <hi>fraudulent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. Since <hi>Kings</hi> themſelves muſt
give an account of every evil and
idle <hi>word in private,</hi> at God's Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal;
they ought to be much more
careſull of thoſe <hi>ſolemn Declarations</hi>
of their mind, which are like to have
the greateſt influence upon the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
either for <hi>woe,</hi> or <hi>weal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. The leſs unreaſonable <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
conſider what they <hi>ask,</hi> the
more ſolicitous ſhould a <hi>King</hi> be
what he <hi>anſwers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:115964:194"/>
16. In time of <hi>Civil War,</hi> though
a <hi>King's</hi> own and his <hi>People's</hi> preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
are grievous, and <hi>peace</hi> would
be very pleaſing; yet ſhould he not
avoid the <hi>one,</hi> nor purchaſe the <hi>other</hi>
with the leaſt expence or waſt of his
<hi>Conſcience,</hi> whereof <hi>God</hi> alone is
deſervedly more Maſter than <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. So much <hi>cruelty</hi> among
Chriſtians is acted under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of <hi>Religion,</hi> as if we could not
be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> unleſs we <hi>crucifie</hi> one
another.</p>
                  <p>18. If a <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>People</hi> love
not <hi>God's Truth</hi> as they ought, and
practiſe it in charity, God may juſtly
ſuffer a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>errour</hi> and <hi>bitterneſs,</hi>
of mutual and mortal <hi>hatred</hi> to riſe
among them.</p>
                  <p>19. God who forgives wherein
we <hi>ſin,</hi> may ſanctifie what we <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>20. <hi>Repentance</hi> muſt be our <hi>reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi>
                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:115964:195"/>
(by God's mercy) when our
great <hi>ſins</hi> have been our <hi>ruine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. The miſeries a <hi>King</hi> and his
<hi>Kingdom</hi> have ſuffered being great,
they may deſire God ſo to account
them, but withal, that their ſins
may appear to then Conſciences, as
they are repreſented in the glaſs of
God's judgments; for God never
puniſheth <hi>ſmall failings</hi> with <hi>ſevere
afflictions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>22. They ſhould farther deſire,
that their <hi>ſins</hi> may be ever more
grievous to them than God's <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>
and be more willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
than to be relieved: firſt ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God the peace of <hi>penitent
Conſciences,</hi> and then the tranquillity
of <hi>united Kingdoms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>23. God can drown the ſins of a
<hi>King</hi> and <hi>People</hi> at <hi>Civil Wars</hi> in
the Sea of our Saviours bloud, and
through the <hi>Red Sea</hi> of their own
<hi>bloud</hi> bring them at laſt to a State
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115964:195"/>
of <hi>Piety, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Plenty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. A <hi>King's</hi> publick relations
to all, make him ſhare in all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ſufferings; of which he ought
to have ſuch a pious ſenſe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a <hi>Chriſtian King,</hi> and a <hi>loving
Father</hi> of his People.</p>
                  <p>25. God can make the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and unjuſt <hi>reproaches</hi> caſt upon
a <hi>good King</hi> be as a breath, more to
kindle his <hi>compaſſion,</hi> and give him
grace to heap charitable coles of fire
upon their heads to melt them,
whoſe <hi>malice</hi> or <hi>cruel zeal</hi> hath kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
or hindred the quenching of
thoſe flames, which may have much
waſted his Kingdomes.</p>
                  <p>26. <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Errour</hi> may ſill
men with <hi>rebellious</hi> and deſtructive
Principles, which they act under an
opinion, That they do God good
ſervice. For theſe a King ought to
pray God to lead them in the wayes
of his <hi>ſaving Truths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:115964:196"/>
27. A King may pray for the
hand of God's juſtice to be againſt
thoſe, who <hi>maliciouſly</hi> and <hi>deſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi>
have raiſed, or fomented, cruel
and deſperate <hi>Wars</hi> againſt him.</p>
                  <p>28. God is far from deſtroying
the <hi>innocent</hi> with the <hi>guilty,</hi> and <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious</hi>
with the <hi>malicious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>29. God that had pity on <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh</hi>
for the many children that were
therein, will not eaſily give over the
whole ſtock of a populous and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
Nation, to the wrath of thoſe
whoſe <hi>covetouſneſs</hi> makes them <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el;</hi>
nor to their <hi>anger,</hi> which is too
<hi>fierce,</hi> and therefore juſtly <hi>curſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>30. God many times is pleaſed,
in the midſt of the furnace of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
juſtice, to preſerve a <hi>Poſterity,</hi>
which may praiſe him for his mercy.</p>
                  <p>31. God will not deal with his
<hi>King,</hi> according to man's unjuſt <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,</hi>
but according to the <hi>iuno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi>
of his hands in his ſight.</p>

                     <pb n="249" facs="tcp:115964:196"/>
32. If a <hi>King</hi> have deſired or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in the wofull day of his
Kingdomes calamities; If he have
not earneſtly ſtudied, and faithfully

in his Kingdome, It is juſt that God's
hand be againſt him and his fathers
houſe.</p>
                  <p>33. A <hi>King</hi> that hath enemies
enough of men, if his <hi>Conſcience</hi> do
witneſs his <hi>integrity,</hi> may <hi>conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi>
dare to imprecate God's <hi>curſe</hi>

which God himſelf knowes right
well; provided that he truſt not to

                  </p>
                  <p>34. When the troubles of a
<hi>King's</hi> Soul are enlarged, it is the
Lord that muſt bring him out of his
diſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>35. Pious <hi>ſimpliciy</hi> is the beſt

                  </p>

                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:115964:197"/>
36. They who have too much of

innocency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>37. Though <hi>hand</hi> joyn in <hi>hand,</hi>
a <hi>King</hi> (by Gods aſſiſtance) ſhould
never let them prevail againſt his

and <hi>Honour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>38. God having turn'd the hearts
of the men of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they
reſtored <hi>David</hi> with as much <hi>loyal
zeal,</hi> as they did with <hi>inconſtancy,</hi> and
<hi>eargerneſs,</hi> purſue him.</p>
                  <p>39. A depreſſed <hi>King,</hi> in whom
God preſerves the love of his truth
and uprightneſs, need not deſpair of
his Subjects affections returning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him.</p>
                  <p>40. God can ſoon cauſe the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
<hi>Seas</hi> to ebbe, and retire back
again to the bounds which he has
appointed for them.</p>
                  <p>41. He can as ſoon make them

laid upon the Conſciences of men,
no pretenſions of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>

that God would not ſuffer his <hi>ſilence</hi>
to betray his <hi>innocence,</hi> nor his <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure</hi>
his <hi>patience;</hi> but that after
his Saviour's example, being reviled,
he may not revile again; and being
<hi>curſed</hi> by his enemies, he may <hi>bleſs</hi>
them.</p>
                  <p>63. God would not ſuffer <hi>Shemei's</hi>
tongue to go unpuniſhed, whoſe

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:115964:200"/>
to juſtifie his diſdainfull reproaches.</p>
                  <p>64. Hot burning coals of eternal
fire ſhould be the reward of <hi>falſe,</hi> and
<hi>lying tongues</hi> againſt their <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>65. A <hi>King's prayer</hi> and <hi>patience</hi>
ſhould be as water to cool and
quench their tongues, who are ſet on
fire with the fire of Hell, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with thoſe malicious flames.</p>
                  <p>66. The <hi>King</hi> is happy that can
refute and put to ſilence mens <hi>evil
ſpeaking,</hi> by <hi>well-doing;</hi> praying
that they may not enjoy the fruit of
their lips, but of his prayer, for their
repentance, and God's pardon.</p>
                  <p>67. A King ought to learn <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's
patience</hi> and <hi>Hezekia's devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
that he may look to God's <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>68. Even <hi>Sheba's</hi> ſeditious ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<hi>Rabſhekah's</hi> railing, and <hi>Shemei's</hi>
curſing, may provoke as a <hi>King's</hi>
humble prayer to God, ſo God's
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:115964:200"/>
renewed bleſſing toward him.</p>
                  <p>69. Though men <hi>curſe,</hi> God may
<hi>bleſs,</hi> and the afflicted <hi>King</hi> ſhall be
bleſſed, and made a bleſſing to his
people: and ſo the ſtone which ſome
builders refuſe, may become the
head-ſtone of the corner.</p>
                  <p>70. If God look not down from
heaven and ſave, the <hi>reproach</hi> of
ſome men would ſwallow up their
<hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>71. God can hide the <hi>King</hi> in the
ſecret of his Preſence from the <hi>pride
of men,</hi> and keep him from the <hi>ſtrife
of tongues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>72. God's <hi>mercies</hi> are full of <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,</hi>
and yet of <hi>conſtancy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>73. God denieth us not a new
and freſh ſenſe of our old and daily
wants, nor deſpiſeth renewed affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
joined to conſtant expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>74. The matters of our prayers
ought to be agreeable to God's Will,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:115964:201"/>
which is alwayes the ſame; and the
fervency of our ſpirits, to the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his holy Spirit in us.</p>
                  <p>75. God's Spiritual perfections
are ſuch, as he is neither to be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>affected Novelties</hi> for <hi>matter</hi>
or <hi>manner,</hi> nor offended with the
pious <hi>conſtancy</hi> of our <hi>petitions</hi> in
them both.</p>
                  <p>76. A pious <hi>moderation</hi> of mens
judgments is moſt commendable in
matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> that their <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
may not offend others, nor
their <hi>opinion</hi> of their own <hi>abilities</hi>
tempt them to deprive others of
what they may lawfully and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly
uſe to help their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>77. The advantage of <hi>Errour</hi>
conſiſts in <hi>novelty</hi> and <hi>variety;</hi> as of
<hi>Truth,</hi> in <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>conſtancy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>78. The <hi>Church</hi> is ſometimes
peſt'red with <hi>errours,</hi> and deformed
with <hi>undecencies</hi> in God's ſervice,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:115964:201"/>
nnder the pretenſe of <hi>variety</hi> and <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty;</hi>
as deprived of <hi>truth, unity,</hi>

<hi>Conſtancy</hi> is the cauſe of <hi>formality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>79. If God keep us from <hi>formal
Hypocriſie</hi> in our hearts, we know
that <hi>praying</hi> to him, or <hi>praiſing</hi> of
him (with <hi>David</hi> and other holy
men) in the <hi>ſame formes,</hi> cannot
hurt us.</p>
                  <p>80. If God gives us wiſdom to

will be leſs to <hi>amend without us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>81. The effects of <hi>blind zeal,</hi> and

                  <p>20. When a <hi>King</hi> knowes not

God, <hi>God</hi> will make his enemies to

his preſence is better than life; and
his <hi>ſervice</hi> is perfect <hi>freedom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>29. The <hi>Soveraign</hi> whom <hi>God</hi>

                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>31. Though God ſuffer a <hi>King</hi>
to be ſtript of all <hi>outward orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
yet he may preſerve him ever

                  <p>32. No fire of <hi>affliction</hi> ſhould

or ſordid <hi>fears.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>33. Though many ſay of an <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>34. When a <hi>King's</hi> ſtrength is

defeated, his perſon reſtrained: if
God be not far from him, his enemies
ſhall not prevail too much againſt
him.</p>
                  <p>35. When a <hi>King</hi> is become a

be his <hi>Helper</hi> and <hi>Defender.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>36. When <hi>God</hi> ſhewes any token

they that hate him are aſhamed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Lord hath holpen and

37. When <hi>God</hi> eſtabliſheth a

<hi>do</hi> and <hi>ſuffer</hi> God's Will, as he would
have him.</p>
                  <p>38. <hi>God</hi> will be mercifull to that
<hi>King,</hi> whoſe Soul truſteth in him, and
who makes his refuge in the ſhadow
of God's wings, until all calamities
be overpaſt.</p>
                  <p>39. A <hi>good King,</hi> though <hi>God</hi>

his Saviours <hi>merits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>40. So long as an <hi>afflicted King</hi>
knoweth that his <hi>Redeemer</hi> liveth,
though God lead him through the
vail and ſhadow of death, yet ſhall
he fear no ill.</p>
                  <p>41. When a <hi>Captive King</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to ſolitary prayers, what
he wants of his <hi>Chaplains</hi> help, God
can ſupply with the more immediate
aſſiſtances of <hi>his Spirit,</hi> which alone
will both <hi>enlighten</hi> his darkneſs, and

42. God who is the <hi>Sun of

of heavenly light and heat, can at
once <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>warm</hi> the <hi>King's</hi>
heart, both by <hi>inſtructing</hi> of him,

                  <p>43. <hi>God</hi> is all fullneſs; From <hi>God</hi>

<hi>God</hi> is company enough,

                  <p>44. The ſingle wreſtlings of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>

                  </p>

                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:115964:210"/>
45. The joint and <hi>ſociated Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of others, is a bleſſing unto a
<hi>King,</hi> their fervency inflaming the
coldneſs of his affections towards
God, when they go up to, or meet

Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>46. A <hi>King</hi> ought to ask God

                  </p>
                  <p>49. The <hi>hardneſs</hi> of <hi>Rebels</hi> hearts

Their inexorable <hi>deafneſs</hi> may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline

                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:115964:211"/>
50. God's <hi>ear</hi> is not heavy, that

it will not hear; nor his <hi>hand</hi> ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that it cannot help a <hi>King,</hi> his
Suppliant in a deſolate condition.</p>
                  <p>51. Though <hi>God</hi> permit men to
deprive a <hi>King</hi> of thoſe <hi>outward
means</hi> which he hath appointed in

him from the communion of that

breaths into humble hearts.</p>
                  <p>52. When God hath once made

will <hi>hear</hi> him, he will <hi>help</hi> him; for,
The broken and contrite heart, God

                  <p>53. <hi>God</hi> can make a <hi>King</hi> in <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,</hi>

his <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and his <hi>Altar;</hi> while

Truths he had formerly learned,

he had ſometime felt, then to be
wanting to his heart, in the famine
of ordinary and wholſome food, for
the refreſhing of his Soul.</p>
                  <p>55. A <hi>Captive King</hi> in <hi>ſolitude,</hi>
may rather chuſe to want the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the <hi>ſaving Truths</hi> he had

                  <p>56. They who wreſt the holy

                  </p>
                  <p>57. Some men (under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour

                  </p>
                  <p>58. A <hi>diſtreſſed King</hi> may pray
againſt their wickedneſs, whoſe

may be delivered from the <hi>poyſon</hi>

nevertheleſs God may hear the voice
of his ſupplication, when he cries

                  <p>60. If the Lord would be <hi>extreme</hi>
to mark what is done amiſs, who

therefore it is that ſinners flie unto

                  <p>61. A <hi>King,</hi> in the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment

62. A <hi>King</hi> ought to beſeech
God to forgive as his <hi>Perſonal,</hi> ſo
his <hi>Peoples</hi> ſins, which are ſo far <hi>his,</hi>
as he hath not improved the power
that God gave him to his glory, and

                  <p>63. <hi>God</hi> may juſtly, as to his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruling

                  </p>
                  <p>64. Though <hi>God</hi> may permit a

and his grace toward <hi>him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>65. God may give the comforts
and the ſure mercies of <hi>David</hi> to the

piety, yet equals <hi>David</hi> in afflictions.</p>
                  <p>66. God may make the penitent

ſhould not ſeem little to him,
though God puniſheth them not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

                  <p>68. When the ſorrowes of a

of his prayers, if <hi>God</hi> bring

                  </p>
                  <p>69. An <hi>Afflicted King</hi> may ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<hi>faint,</hi> if he <hi>believe</hi> not to ſee the

                  <p>70. The <hi>ſins</hi> of our <hi>proſperity</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

                  </p>
                  <p>71. It is happy for us, if the <hi>fiery

which in <hi>long peace,</hi> and <hi>plenty,</hi> we

72. Though God continue <hi>our
miſeries,</hi> yet if he withdraw not <hi>his

may be made up in <hi>patience</hi> and
<hi>repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>73. An <hi>afflicted King,</hi> from

                  </p>

                  </p>

which God alone can give him.</p>

                  </p>

                  <p>97. <hi>God</hi> that is <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi>
who filleth Heaven and Earth, who
is the fountain of eternal life, in

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:115964:221"/>
cruelty</hi> with <hi>his compaſſion,</hi> and the
charity of their <hi>devoted King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18. When <hi>God</hi> maketh inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for <hi>Royal bloud,</hi> the Souls which
he ſindeth <hi>penitent,</hi> though <hi>polluted,</hi>
he can ſprinkle with the <hi>bloud</hi> of his
<hi>Son,</hi> and then the <hi>deſtroying Angel</hi>
ſhall paſs over them.</p>
                  <p>19. Though <hi>Regicides</hi> in deſign
think any Kingdom on earth too
little to entertain at once both <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi>
and <hi>their King;</hi> yet he ought
to pray that the capacious Kingdom
of God's infinite Mercy may at laſt
receive them both.</p>
                  <p>20. When <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People</hi> be
reconciled in the <hi>bloud</hi> of the ſame
<hi>Redeemer,</hi> they ſhall come at laſt
to live far above the ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
which begat mortal enmities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them.</p>
                  <p>21. When the <hi>hands</hi> of <hi>Regicides</hi>
ſhall be heavieſt and cruelleſt upon
<hi>their King,</hi> if he fall into <hi>the armes</hi>
                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:115964:221"/>
of God's tender and eternal mercies,
he ſhall be ſafe.</p>
                  <p>22. What is cut off of a <hi>King's</hi>
life in the miſerable moment of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
death, may be repayed in <hi>God's</hi>
ever-bleſſed eternity.</p>
                  <p>23. The <hi>King,</hi> whoſe eyes have
ſeen <hi>Gods</hi> ſalvation, ſhall depart in
peace.</p>

                  <p>1. THe <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ſhould
call their <hi>Parliaments,</hi> not
more by <hi>others advice,</hi> and the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi>
of their <hi>affairs,</hi> than by their
own <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>inclination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The right way of <hi>Parliaments</hi>
is moſt ſafe for the <hi>Crown,</hi> and beſt
pleaſing to the <hi>People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. When ſome mens <hi>diſtempers</hi>
ſtudy to kindle ſparks in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
the <hi>King</hi> may hope to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
them by <hi>forbearing</hi> to <hi>convene</hi>
for ſome years.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:115964:225"/>
4. The <hi>King</hi> reſolving with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to give all <hi>juſt ſatisfaction</hi> to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
and ſober deſires, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
all <hi>publick grievances</hi> in <hi>Church</hi>
and <hi>State,</hi> may hope by his freedom,
and the <hi>Members</hi> moderation, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all miſunderſtandings, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariages
in the <hi>Parliament</hi> he calls.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Elections</hi> of <hi>Parliament men,</hi>
are many times carried in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with <hi>partiality</hi> and popular heat.</p>
                  <p>6. The <hi>King</hi> knowing beſt the
largeneſs of his own heart toward his
<hi>Peoples</hi> good and juſt contentment,
may pleaſe himſelf in the hopes of a
good and firm underſtanding, which
by a <hi>Parliament</hi> may grow between
<hi>him</hi> and <hi>them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. The <hi>King</hi> ſhould reſolve to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi>
what by free and full advice in
<hi>Parliament</hi> he is convinced to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs;
and to grant what ever his <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
and <hi>Conſcience</hi> tells him is ſit to
be deſired.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:115964:225"/>
8. Though the <hi>King</hi> reſolve not
to imploy in his affairs a queſtiond
<hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>State</hi> againſt the advice
of his <hi>Parliament;</hi> yet he ſhould not
have any hand in his death, of whoſe
guiltleſneſs he is better aſſured, than
any man living can be.</p>
                  <p>9. The <hi>Peoples</hi> clamours for <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi>
in exorbitance of fury is not to
be regarded, when they mean there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Two Houſes</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
ſhould Vote as they would
have them.</p>
                  <p>10. A <hi>Tumultuous Parliaments
after-Act</hi> vacating the Authority of
the <hi>precedent</hi> for <hi>future</hi> imitation [in
caſe of <hi>bloud]</hi> ſufficiently tells the
World, that ſome <hi>remorſe</hi> toucheth
them that are moſt implacable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>perſon,</hi> as if knowing he
had <hi>hard meaſure,</hi> and ſuch as they
would be very loth ſhould be repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:115964:226"/>
11. The tenderneſs and regret
the <hi>King</hi> may find in his ſoul, for
having had any hand though very
<hi>unwillingly)</hi> in ſhedding one man's
<hi>bloud unjuſtly</hi> (though under the
colour and formalities of <hi>Juſtice,</hi>
and pretenſes of avoyding <hi>publick
miſchief)</hi> may be hop'd to be ſome
evidence before <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> to
all <hi>Poſterity;</hi> that he is far from
bearing <hi>juſtly</hi> the vaſt load and
guilt of all the <hi>bloud</hi> ſhed in an
unhappy <hi>Civil War,</hi> as his <hi>Rebels</hi>
charge upon him.</p>
                  <p>To overawe the <hi>freedom</hi> of the
<hi>Houſes</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> or to weaken
their juſt Authority by any <hi>violent</hi>
impreſſions upon them, is a deſign
unworthy of the <hi>King,</hi> who ſhall
not need ſo rough aſſiſtance, if
he have <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> on his
ſide.</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>Popular Tumults</hi> are not the
beſt removers of obſtructions in
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:115964:226"/>
                     <hi>Parliaments,</hi> which rather infringe
all freedome or differing in <hi>Votes,</hi>
and debating matters with <hi>reaſon</hi>
and <hi>candor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. When the obſtinacy of Men
in <hi>Parliament,</hi> reſolved to diſcharge
their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> muſt be ſubdued
by <hi>Tumults,</hi> it may be feared, that
by the ſame all factious, ſeditious,
and ſciſmatical propoſals againſt
Government <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> or <hi>Civil,</hi>
will be backed and abetted till they
prevail.</p>
                  <p>15. The riot and impatience of
<hi>popular Tumults</hi> is ſuch, that they
will not ſtay the ripening and ſeaſon
of <hi>Counſels,</hi> or fair production of
<hi>Acts,</hi> in the order, gravity, and
deliberateneſs, beſitting a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
but will rip up with barbarous
cruelty, and forcibly cut out <hi>abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Votes,</hi> ſuch as their <hi>Inviters,</hi> and
<hi>Incouragers</hi> moſt fancy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:115964:227"/>
16. When <hi>Tumults</hi> are become
ſo inſolent, that there is no ſecuring
of the <hi>King's</hi> freedom in <hi>Parliament,</hi>
nor of his very <hi>perſon</hi> in the <hi>ſtreets,</hi>
he is not bound by his preſence to
provoke them to higher boldneſs
and contempts.</p>
                  <p>17. When, and only when, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi>
in their firſt <hi>Election,</hi> and
<hi>Conſtitution,</hi> ſit <hi>full</hi> and <hi>free,</hi> as in all
<hi>reaſon, honour,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> they
ought to be, things may be ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
as will give no leſs content
to all good men, than they wiſh or
expect.</p>
                  <p>18. It may prove unhappy to
convene a <hi>Parliament,</hi> where the
<hi>Place</hi> affords the greateſt <hi>Confluence</hi>
of various and vitious humours.</p>
                  <p>19. The <hi>King,</hi> when he calls a
<hi>Parliament,</hi> ſhould purpoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
what in <hi>Juſtice, Reaſon, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> he can, to the
happy ſucceſs of it; nor ſhould it
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:115964:227"/>
have any other deſign in him, but
the General good of his <hi>Kingdoms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>20. <hi>Triennial Parliaments,</hi> in a
Kingdom, as gentle and ſeaſonable
<hi>Phyſick,</hi> might (if well applied) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
any diſtempers from getting
head, or prevailing, eſpecially if the
<hi>remedy</hi> prove not a <hi>diſeaſe</hi> beyond
all <hi>remedy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. Some men, when they meet
in <hi>Parliament,</hi> occaſion more work
than they find to do, by <hi>undoing</hi> ſo
much as they find well done to their
hands.</p>
                  <p>22. The <hi>perpetuating</hi> a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
is an Act of higheſt <hi>confidence,</hi>
whereby a <hi>King</hi> hopes to ſhut out
and lock the dore, upon all preſent
<hi>jealouſies,</hi> and future <hi>miſtakes,</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
not thereby to exclude <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
as ſome may requite him.</p>
                  <p>23. Thoſe <hi>Subjects</hi> are unworthy
of an <hi>indulgent King,</hi> who deceive his
extreme <hi>confidence</hi> by ill uſing any
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:115964:228"/>
                     <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> wherein he declares ſo
much to <hi>truſt them,</hi> as to <hi>deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>
in a high point of his <hi>Prerogative.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. A <hi>continual Parliament</hi> by
preſerving <hi>Lawes</hi> in their due execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and vigour (but <hi>no otherwiſe)</hi>
may be thought, until <hi>Experiment</hi>
ſhew a <hi>fallacy,</hi> the beſt means to keep
the <hi>Commonweal</hi> in tune.</p>
                  <p>25. The agreeing <hi>Votes</hi> of the
<hi>major part</hi> in both <hi>Houſes</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
are not, by any <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>Reaſon,</hi>
concluſive to the judgment of their
<hi>King;</hi> nor do they carry with them
his conſent, whom they in no kind
repreſent.</p>
                  <p>26. The <hi>King</hi> is not further bound
to agree with the <hi>Votes</hi> of both <hi>Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
then he ſees them agree with the
<hi>will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> with his juſt <hi>Rights,</hi> as a
<hi>King,</hi> and the general <hi>good</hi> of his
<hi>People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>27. The <hi>Members</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi>
as many men, are ſeldom of one
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:115964:228"/>
mind; and it is oft ſeen, that the
major part of them are not the
right.</p>
                  <p>28. The Majeſty of the <hi>Crown</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> is not bound by any <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation
Oath</hi> to conſent to whatever
its<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Subjects</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
                  <p>29. The <hi>Coronation Oath</hi> is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
by the <hi>King's</hi> governing by
ſuch <hi>Lawes</hi> as his <hi>People</hi> with the
<hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Peers</hi> have choſen, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
hath conſented unto.</p>
                  <p>30. The <hi>King</hi> ſhould give no ear
to the importunity of his <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
when, inſtead of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and
<hi>Publick concernments,</hi> they obtrude
nothing but what makes for the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi>
of <hi>parties,</hi> and flowes from the
<hi>partialities</hi> of <hi>private wills</hi> and <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>31. Every <hi>Subject</hi> is bound to
ſtand to the ſentence of <hi>Parliament</hi>
according to <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:115964:229"/>
32. Where an orderly <hi>guard</hi> is
granted unto the <hi>Parliament,</hi> no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in reaſon can be given for the
not ſuppreſſing <hi>Tumults,</hi> but only to
<hi>oppreſs</hi> both the <hi>King's</hi> and the <hi>Two
Houſes</hi> freedom of <hi>declaring</hi> and
<hi>voting</hi> according to every mans <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>33. The <hi>King</hi> ſhould not by pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>protect</hi> any againſt the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of
<hi>Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
