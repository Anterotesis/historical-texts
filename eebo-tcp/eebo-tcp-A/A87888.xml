            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving diligently peruſed two <hi>Printed Papers,</hi> bearing <hi>date</hi> the 14th. <hi>of this inſtant December:</hi> The one, in form of <hi>a Proclamation concerning the ſummoning of a Parliament:</hi> The other, as an <hi>Order of the Common Council,</hi> commanding the City to acquieſce in expectation of that Parliament: We find therein contained, matters, ſo contrary to the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and to the <hi>Freedom</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> that we ſtand obliged, both as <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and as <hi>Citizens,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, againſt the <hi>Impoſitions</hi> of the <hi>Former,</hi> as <hi>illegal,</hi> and the <hi>Conceſsions</hi> of the Latter, as a direct <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination</hi> againſt us. Theſe <hi>two Papers</hi> are <hi>Seconded</hi> by a <hi>Third:</hi> (for the <hi>Two</hi> are <hi>One,</hi> both in <hi>effect,</hi> and Deſign,) and that is, a <hi>Proclamation of Baniſhment,</hi> directing to the late Kings Party, under the notion of the Common Enemy: ſo that there's no love loſt betwixt the <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> and the <hi>Common Council,</hi> when the <hi>General</hi> provides for the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>City;</hi> and the <hi>Mayor,</hi> for the <hi>Safety</hi> of the <hi>Army;</hi> not to argue <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Oblivion;</hi> and the violation of <hi>Publique Faith</hi> in the Caſe: that they <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned</hi> for their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Liberties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Compounded</hi> for their <hi>Fortunes.</hi> This is not our <hi>Concern,</hi> what <hi>they do</hi> ſuffer; but what <hi>we may, if we Truſt thoſe, that Keep no Faith with them:</hi> And that we'll take a care of: When <hi>They</hi> are Gone, Then <hi>we are</hi> the <hi>Common Enemy; So are the Laws of God, and of the Nation, and ſuch is every Man that Loves them.</hi> What this <hi>Malignant Party</hi> is, theſe People talk of, we neither <hi>Know,</hi> nor <hi>Meddle;</hi> the <hi>Gentry</hi> 'tis we Live by, and by the Laws of <hi>Gratitude,</hi> and <hi>Hoſpitality,</hi> we are Bound to <hi>Protect</hi> them, and as well reſolved to do it, within our Walls, againſt any other Power, than that of the Known Law. The ſhort of the Deſign is this, a <hi>Danger</hi> is pretended to the <hi>City,</hi> from the <hi>late Kings party,</hi> and to prevent the miſchief, the Kind <hi>Committee Baniſhes</hi> the <hi>Gentlemen;</hi> with Order to the <hi>Mayor of Wallingford,</hi> (late of <hi>London</hi>) &amp;c.—<hi>to make ſtrict Searches for Delinquents.</hi> Now in purſuance of this Pretious Order, our <hi>Houſes</hi> muſt be <hi>Forced,</hi> and <hi>we Diſarmed,</hi> and Then, our <hi>Throats cut, to preſerve the City.</hi> Let thoſe that would be <hi>Chronicled</hi> for <hi>Slaves,</hi> &amp; <hi>Fools, Submit to ſuffer this; and after that Infamous Hour, may a Yellow Coat, and a Wooden Dagger be the Badge, and Diſtinction of a Citizen.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>We</hi> our ſelves <hi>are that City,</hi> ſo much the Care and Cry of the Proclamation; and <hi>This</hi> is our <hi>Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous ſence,</hi> and <hi>Reſolve.</hi> The Army propoſes to <hi>Pillage,</hi> and <hi>Murther</hi> us, the <hi>Mayor,</hi> and his worthy <hi>Adviſers, Ireton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> &amp;c.—are to hold our <hi>hands,</hi> whiles they give the <hi>Blow;</hi> So, that we are now to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide both againſt <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Treaſon;</hi> having <hi>One</hi> Enemy within our <hi>Walls,</hi> and <hi>Another in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.</hi> But withall, we have our <hi>Swords</hi> in our <hi>Hands,</hi> and our <hi>Brains</hi> in our <hi>Heads;</hi> ſo that only to <hi>Strike</hi> the <hi>One,</hi> and to <hi>Diſ-believe</hi> the <hi>Other,</hi> is to <hi>Subdue,</hi> and <hi>Diſappoint</hi> them <hi>Both.</hi> We do therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to the World, that We will by <hi>Violence</hi> oppoſe all <hi>Violence</hi> whatſoever, which is not warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Letter of the <hi>eſtabliſhed Law:</hi> and that in purſuance of this Duty, both toward the <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and <hi>City,</hi> an Inſolent <hi>Souldier,</hi> and an <hi>Apoſtatized Magiſtrate</hi> ſhall be to us as the ſame thing.—Not to word it much further, as we will not be <hi>Bafled,</hi> by <hi>Affronts,</hi> ſo neither will we be <hi>Fooled by Flatteries.</hi>—After the Loſs of Trade, and Liberty, a vaſt expence of Blood, and Treaſure; After <hi>many Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes received, more Threatned,</hi> and <hi>none Returned;</hi> We made a ſober, and Regular <hi>Application,</hi> to the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> for <hi>Redreſſe.</hi> This They <hi>Promiſed,</hi> and Wee <hi>Expected,</hi> til at laſt, inſtead of a <hi>Reparation for Paſt Wrongs,</hi> or a <hi>Security</hi> againſt <hi>worſe to come;</hi> We are paid with an <hi>Expectation</hi> of a <hi>Parliament</hi> in <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</hi> This is a Logique We underſtand not. It is in <hi>Engliſh, Lye ſtill,</hi> till you have your <hi>Throats cut.</hi> It would be well to commit the diſpoſition of our Fortunes, to thoſe people, that are at this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant deſigning an Execution upon our Perſons; and to requite thoſe <hi>Worthies,</hi> that have already <hi>Robb'd</hi> us of <hi>all</hi> we have <hi>Loſt,</hi> with the <hi>Offer</hi> of that little <hi>Reſt</hi> they have <hi>Left.</hi> But this will not do our Buſineſſe; we will not have our <hi>Murtherers,</hi> for our <hi>Judges:</hi> nor will we wait. That <hi>Parliament</hi> they <hi>Babble</hi> of ſo much, will not ſoon <hi>Vote</hi> up the <hi>City</hi> again out of Aſhes, nor all the Saints in that holy Aſſembly, be able to bring the <hi>poor Cobler</hi> into the World again, that was <hi>Kill'd</hi> by order of his <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hewſon.</hi> No, the <hi>Cheat</hi> is too ſtale, and we are Determined to Redeem our ſelves; but with this Caution; we do ſolemnly profeſſe, that we will exerciſe all the Tenderneſſe which poſſibly the Caſe will bear. The <hi>Common Soldier</hi> is engaged rather out of a <hi>Heedeleſſe,</hi> than <hi>Malitious Intereſt:</hi> We do therefore Proteſt, that ſuch of thoſe as ſhall not evidence their <hi>Malice,</hi> by their <hi>Obſtinacy,</hi> ſhall receive a Faire Conſideration; But, for ſuch as <hi>Lead</hi> them, we do <hi>Reſolve,</hi> not to allow Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to any one of them, that draws his Sword in the Quarrel: and in Order to the Quicker, and Gentler Diſpatch of the Buſineſſe: We conclude with a Text. <hi>Fight neither with Small nor Great, but with the King of Iſrael.</hi> And ſo God give a Bleſſing to the Endeavours of all Honeſt Men.</p>
