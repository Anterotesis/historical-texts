            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST Noble, and most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
honoured LORD.
The true, and hearty Zeale,
which I owe vnto my God,
King, Church, and Country,
hath moued, and made me to
prostrate before the Three
thrice honourable Estates of
<hi>PARLIAMENT,</hi> assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
And in them to all the Cleriques, Courtiers, and
Commons within our Nation, euen from Sea to Sea, and
<pb facs="tcp:9284:3"/>
from the Riuer to the Lands end, (being ledde hereunto
by the words of the Prophet prefixed) the still passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of this small Voyce, which hath laine suppressed
some yeares, by meanes of a certaine Great-one, (who
not long sithence was great, but now is not, so mutable
and nutable is the state of things on earth) taking of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
at some passages herein. Whose ouer-weening great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and wilfulnesse, had then at the least shut me vp, if
not sent me (as there was great cause to suspect and feare)
not the way of all flesh in respect of the manner, but of
mortalitie) if some reuerend Fathers of the Church, the
blessed Beaue-Peeres of Diuinitie, had not stayed that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
fury against mee: But not long after, the hand of
Almightie God surprized that greatnes, clipped it, restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it, that it might doe no more harme, &amp; so it remaines to
this day. Happy had it beene for that man, that hee had
then hearkened to that Voyce from God, deliuered by the
weake ministry of him, who neuer saw his face to this day,
that if it had pleased the Almightie, his soule might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
haue beene awakened out of that fearefull slumber,
wherein hee then lay, bewitched with the Circean Cups
of Ambition, Wantonnesse, and sensuall securitie. Then
had not his fingers, nor the hands of others, his Agents in
euill, dropped with the cruell bloud-guiltinesse, neyther
had their consciences beene tortured, and tormented with
the Hellish horrour of heart-bleeding wickednesse. What
I then spake in the accent, and action of a liuing man, to the
greatest Auditorie of this Land, I now present to publique
view, in the lesse effectual elements of a dead Letter: To no
other purpose (God is my record) but intending and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuouring
hereby the aduancement of Gods glory, some
good of his Church, and in all Estates a remembrance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these present times, a manifestation of our happinesse
<pb facs="tcp:9284:3"/>
vnder so Christian a King, whose heart detesteth all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice,
the maintenance of the truth then deliuered, and
that these palpable and pisculent imputations and aspersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Faction, and Sedition, might in some sort be spun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
out, which it pleased that Great-one mentioned to cast
vpon me at that time in an honourable Assembly, and since
that time some others (strangely alienated both from our
Church and State) who haue endeuoured to be-sprinkle
me with the like, for that I vndertooke, and did reconcile,
and compose, by directions from his Maiesties owne mouth,
some differences in Ecclesiasticall discipline, happened into
a famous Fellowship, (to which I am much obliged) resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in part beyond the Seas, whither I was not long si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence
sent by authority, allowance, and Recommendation
of his sacred Maiesty, and the most Reuerend Archbishop
of Canterbury. Which imployment and seruice, albeit it hath
in some part impayred, yea almost impouerished mee in my
poore personall eflate, and lost me some friends, whom I
thought had beene better minded, and may (in Gods good
time) bethinke themselues better: Yet, were either the one
abroad, or this seruice at home to be done againe; for the
vnfained loue I beare vnto the free passage of Gods glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Gospel, and to the present setled subsistants of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of our Church, I would not onely (as a Merchant
Aduenturer) hazard my weake body, poore estate, and
liuelihood; but also would willingly (as a free Minister of
the Gospell) expose my selfe to all the Snibbes, Quippes,
Taunts, Reproaches, Disgraces, and Punishments, that any
wicked, and vngodly Great-one (little, or not at all affected
to God) should preuaile against mee in, that (at the least)
I might herein manifest to the World, my Willingnesse and
Indeauour to maintaine and make good (<hi>quantum in me</hi>)
the sacred freedome of the one, and the Christian Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb facs="tcp:9284:4"/>
of the other; both which, our Nation most comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
enioyeth vnder God, by the blessing of so Christian a
King as is our most gracious Soueraigne, vnder Christ
Iesus, the breath of all our nosthrils, my most dread Liege-Lord
and Master. Desiring all true honest English
hearts, which are not poysoned with preiudicate opinion of,
exotique niceties, and imitation of strangers, to iudge, if
there be any passage herein, that deserueth either manicles,
or menaces, or ought; but what becommeth a sober and a
true English-hearted Diuine. But be this little <hi>Hin</hi> of
mine either accepted or reiected (by such as care not how
the World goes, so they may atchieue their owne ends) I
passe not, so it may please your most noble Worth, that it
may shelter it selfe vnder your honourable protecting fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.
When I went ouer to that seruice mentioned beyond
the Seas, I made bold to present his Highnesse with a Tract

and so foolishly to cast, translate, and bandy the sinnes of the
time from one to another.</p>
            <p n="2"> Iudgement begins at Gods owne House, and Church-men
if they offend but as others, yet shall they be punished
(euen because they are Church-men) more then others, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse

            <p n="3"> In a religious Common-wealth, the common people are
encompassed with blessings from God on euery side, from the
Church, and from the Court, both set vp by God for bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
to their soules, bodies, goods, and good names.</p>
            <p n="4"> No dignity of person, nor preheminence of place, is
exempted, or excepted from Gods iustice, but euen the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

and more seuerely punished then others of inferiour
ranke and condition.</p>
            <p n="5"> It dearely and nearely concernes all degrees in Court,
Church, and Common-wealth, that they attend as well to
<pb facs="tcp:9284:9"/>
the ripping vp of their sinnes, and to the Denuntiation of
Gods Iudgements for the same, as to the Promulgation of
Gods mercies, that all Estates hauing a sence, and sight of
their iniquities, may breake them off by repentance, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
pardon by Iesus Christ our Lord.</p>
            <p n="6"> No voyce, nor rebuke of God, or good men laying
forth the hideousnesse, and horror of sinnes neuer so often
to the view of the conscience, can preuaile with the mighty
hunting <hi>Nimrods</hi> of this World, to restraine their rage,
and furious madnesse, but still they make their greatnesse
in Church, Court, and Common-wealth, baties, and guiles for
their gaine and glory.</p>

WATCH-VVORD. The
Vials of Gods <hi>Wrath</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

mighty, how high, or how holy soeuer they be, that

of God, not from <hi>Popular Discontent,</hi> or from inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling
busie-bodies, or giddy-headed <hi>Statizers.</hi> It is
Gods voyce by the Ministery of his Prophet vnto

no singular spirit of <hi>Prophecie.</hi> It is a cleare,

discouereth these miscreants, and the like, to be <hi>Verè

Court,</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and the dizzy conceits that

most palpable, and pisculent vntruths.</p>
            <p n="2"> In the feare of God therefore (<hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Mortals</hi>)
set before your eyes a paralell of times pourtrayed in
this Text, and feare the menaces of Gods <hi>Iudgements,</hi>
knowing that if Gods right hand lay once hold of
<hi>Execution,</hi> and strike, who shall escape the blow? Let
not the blessed peace we enioy in our <hi>Israel,</hi> marre our
manners, corrupt our bloud, or settle vs vpon our lees,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9284:10"/>
as many were in the time of this Prophet. <hi>Iebusitzs, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites,
Ismaelites,</hi> and such like, make themselues mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
with God, and sleight his <hi>Iudgements;</hi> yet wee see
disconsolate <hi>Saul</hi> when hee felt God to depart from
him, desires <hi>Samuels</hi> prayers: <hi>Heathenish Foelix</hi> trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at <hi>Pauls</hi> Sermon, which treated of iudgement to
come, and foolish <hi>Ahab</hi> being terrified with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
words of <hi>Iudgement,</hi> walkes softly, and makes
outward semblance, as if hee had truly, and inwardly
repented. If the worst natures shuddered at Gods
<hi>Iudgements,</hi> menaced onely, shall not the best bloud
truly feare God, and tremble? Shall not the Beasts of
the Forrest quake, when the Lyon doth roare? In this
<hi>Watchword</hi> God threatneth his owne people, yea, all
estates of his owne people by an old Prophet, not by
a young Schollar; (as <hi>Paul</hi> speakes to <hi>Timothy</hi>) but
euen by one that had beene threescore and ten yeeres
a Prophet, during the raignes of fiue Kings.</p>
            <p n="3"> The forme of speech vsed in this <hi>Watchword</hi> is
iuridicall by way of <hi>Proclamation, Declaration,</hi> and
<hi>Commination.</hi> The <hi>Proclamation</hi> is a generall <hi>Summons</hi>
set out by <hi>Exclamation,</hi> and <hi>Iniunction.</hi> The <hi>Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
citeth the parties, <hi>O ye Priests, O ye house of Israel,
O house of the King.</hi> The <hi>Iniunction</hi> enioynes them
what they must doe, that is, <hi>Heare this, Hearken, and giue
eare.</hi> The <hi>Declaration</hi> sets forth the cause of their sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
which was their sinnes. It also further disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth
the quality of their sinnes, by <hi>Nets,</hi> and <hi>snares,</hi>
the height of their wickednesse by the altitudes of
<hi>Mizpah,</hi> and <hi>Tabor,</hi> and the horror of their enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
by the aggrauation of these words, <hi>Reuolting, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing,</hi>
and <hi>Profundity.</hi> The imperious insolency of<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9284:11"/>
their preuarications appeared, in that they were incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible;
for they not onely sleighted the Ministery of
the Prophet sent from God, but despised euen God
himselfe, who as the Context saith, had beene a <hi>Rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of them all.</hi> Lastly, the <hi>Commination</hi> is a <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,</hi>
or <hi>Watchword,</hi> that <hi>Iudgement</hi> was toward them
all, for their great and grieuous enormities. See the
summe of all this in a view. It seemeth that great was
the <hi>Cataclysme</hi> of the exorbitant sinnes and transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
transgressions of those times: For all the Estates
are summoned, none excepted, none exempted. Their
sinnes haughty, haynous, and heauy to the whole
Land, growne in sublimity like vnto Mountaines, dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
then hell in their profound subtilty, and the actors
of them growne incorrigible. Hereupon is <hi>Iudgement</hi>
awarded toward them all, that as there was a parity in
their preuarications; so there should be also paralels in
their punishments.</p>
            <p n="4"> But I had rather you should heare an <hi>Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the particular sinnes of that time, from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
owne mouth, in his owne words. The sinnes of
the <hi>Church-men</hi> of that time were as the Prophet saith.
<hi>That they refused knowledge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 4.</note> 
               <hi>they forsooke the Law, and
did eate vp the sinnes of the people.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 6.</note> Whereupon grew
the Prouerbe vsual in that time.<note place="margin">Chap. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Like people, like Priests.</hi>
The Commons had no truth in them, but <hi>swearing,
and lying,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and killing, and stealing, and whoring, they broke
out,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>and bloud touched bloud.</hi> The Courtiers had lost
<hi>their hearts with wine, women, and wantons; they were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous,
and cryed,<note place="margin">8</note> Bring, Bring; they did oppresse the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minalty,
they flattered others,<note place="margin">7</note> and suffered themselues to
be abused by flattery.</hi> Thus you see in the very words
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9284:11"/>
of the Prophet, to what a height of presumption the
sinnes of all Estates were growne, how they all were
become <hi>Nets,</hi> and <hi>Snares</hi> one to another in these enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities;
heare now the menaces of Gods <hi>Iudgements</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them all in the words of the same Prophet. <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was toward the Church-men; They should weepe for
want,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Thornes and thistles should grow vpon their Altars,
and in the end should be so confounded,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>that they should call,
and crie to the hilles and mountaines to fall on them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>and
couer them. Iudgement was also towards the Commons,
God should poure his wrath on them like water,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 5.</note> 
               <hi>and his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
should be as moathes, and rottennesse vnto them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
               <hi>their young lings should be dashed in pieces,<note place="margin">14</note> and their women
great with childe should be ripped vp.</hi> The Courtiers
<hi>Iudgements</hi> were, <hi>That God would be as a Lyon vnto them,
and as a Lyons whelpe he would teare them in pieces,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 5.</note> 
               <hi>and
there should be none to deliuer.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>He would destroy the King
as the foame vpon the water;<note place="margin">13</note> and bind vp all their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for their greater plague.</hi> In a word, Gods voyce to
all Estates by the Prophet, is this; <hi>O ye Church-men,
Commons, and Courtiers, Iudgement is toward you all,</hi> and
vnlesse you all repent, <hi>you shall all of you be as the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
cloud, and as the early deaw that passeth away, as the

               <p n="3"> The prime and principall causes hereof are three,

Ambition, that grieuous gangrene of the

base <hi>Detraction</hi> and censure, so they may seeme to

               <p>The secondary, or accessory causes of this ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spreading

               <p n="2"> This appeares out of the very words of the Text:
For these people not long before were the House of
bondage, and slauery, but now are setled in an estate
of freedome, and liberty. Heretofore they had beene
the House of limping <hi>Iacob,</hi> but now a preuailing <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi>
heretofore the House of <hi>Hadadrimmon,</hi> of woe

when I see <hi>Israel</hi> to become a King, yea, to become

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:9284:20"/>
World is well amended with <hi>Iacob</hi> since the time hee
went ouer <hi>Iordan</hi> with his staffe, since he made a stone
his pillow, since hee serued twice seauen yeeres with
his churlish Vncle <hi>Laban,</hi> and since he knew not where
to lay his head. I admire therefore that euer any of
his generation should offend so gracious a God. But
that of the Apostle is most apposite to this purpose;
<hi>All are not Israel, that are in Israel,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> or of Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3"> This further appeares how the common people

the Apostle saith;<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Magistrate is a Minister of

man liueth in quiet vnder his owne Vine, and vnder

                  </note> What else
would become of the helpelesse multitude? if they
had not one set vp by God to order many? Surely if
God had not taken care of mankinde euen in this case,
the wicked nature of man would daily breake forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
shamelesse and bloudy shambles of thefts, butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
murthers, adulteries, rapines, incests, treasons, and
what not? And vnlesse Christian policy had found out
dayes, times, places, and persons to redresse wrongs,
and to distribute right to euery man, no man should
haue enioyed the comfort of one day, nor knowne
the blessed state or condition of any pleasing time, or
place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:9284:21"/>Secondly, in particular this blessing of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
both especially and indiuidually for body,
goods, and good name; for the body, Cannibals must
not liue among Christians. For the state-politique
taketh care that the hand of violence shall not touch
any subiect, and if any man shed the bloud of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by the man of authoritie his bloud shall be shed.
Yea, the tender hearts of true Christian Princes haue
prouided against the hot-spirited duels, that the image
of God may not be destroyed by sudden enraged
passions, nor Subiects wound their owne soules by
bringing in the price of bloud vpon their owne Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
as a Noble Lady once said to her brother in
the like case. For Goods, the State-Politique pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides,
that euery man eate his owne bread: No Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonicall
community, no Anabaptisticall Anarchy,
nor yet Plutonicall villany is heard of in a Christian
Common-wealth: For he that doth not labour, must
not eate. Ideots say, that which is mine is thine, and
that which is thine is mine, yet Indians and Tartari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
speake not so. Vngodly persons say, that which
is thine is mine, and that which is mine is mine owne.
Indeed so speakes the violent theefe; that is, the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
by the high-way; and the slie theefe, which is the
Vsurer. Mediocrity, and Pietie, speake otherwise in
a Christian Common-wealth. Mediocrity saith, that
which is mine, is mine, &amp; that which is thine is thine,
so speaketh the morall Christian. But Pieties parlee
is, that which is mine is thine to pleasure and profit
thee, and that which is thine is thine owne. Yea, the
politique State taketh care, not onely against out-rage
and violence, but also that no man be cosoned, or

abused by forged cauilations. Otherwise, there were
no voyaging by Sea for Pyrats, no trauelling by
Land for Robbers, no sleeping in an house for Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaries,
no commerce for violence, cosenage, deceipt,
and fraud, did not the wholsome Lawes of the State-politique
preuent these miserable mischeeuances.
Blessing comes vpon our good names, which is as a
pretious oyntment, for our Reputations would be
tainted by the stinking Flies of Aegypt, if the State-politique
did not prouide Antidotes against so Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicall
a poyson. Yea, heauen and earth would be
infected with Libels of blacke obloquie, and the sons
of men would fat themselues with infamings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochings
of others. Euery mans braine would be a
forge of choller, and passion, euery mans studie a
dung-hil of vntruths, &amp; all things would be carried by
passion, &amp; not by iudgement, yea the giddy multitude
of the sonnes of men, would become a rabble of blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
<hi>Goliahs</hi> against God, the Lord of hosts, a
rout of rayling Rabshekahs against their betters, a
skull of scoffing Ismalites against their brethren, a

and euery man would giue liberty to that
vnruly euill of the tongue (which the Apostle saith)
is enraged by hell fire.</p>
               <p n="5"> Thus are the people blest by the State-politique,
in body, goods, and good name. Blessed they are
also vnder the politique State, by the State-Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall,
both in their soules and consciences: Blessed
in their Initiation and reception into the Church,
for when they are children, they are brought into the
Church by Baptisme, afterwards confirmed in the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:9284:22"/>
grace receiued, which is as Palmes to their hands,
Crownes to their heads, Wreaths to their browes,
Triumphs and Trophies to their whole life: Blessed
they are by the ministeriall function, in restrayning
the sonnes and daughters of men from their exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
and extrauagant courses, by all meanes possible
that can be. Sometime, by the menaces of Gods
Desertion; for <hi>Church-men</hi> tell them, if they forsake
God, God will forsake them: Sometime, by threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them with Gods fearefull traditions, that hee
will deliuer them that forsake him, into a three-fold
misery; that is, vnto vile affections, vnto their owne
hearts lusts,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> and into a Reprobate sence. Sometime
with menacing of iudgement to come, which hath
caused the very Heathen to tremble, as is apparent
in the case of <hi>Faelix.</hi> Blessed they are (when they are
ready to fall) by the effectuall assistances of ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
supportations, both <hi>Externally, Internally,</hi>
and <hi>Eternally.</hi> Externally, by the preaching of the
Word, that heauenly <hi>Manna</hi> to feed their soules, by
prayer, and sollicitation to God for them, and also
by application of the Word, which is as the balme of
<hi>Gilead</hi> to the seuerall cases of their distressed consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
Internally, blessed they are by the meanes of
the outward ministery, which worketh the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of grace inwardly by the motion of the spirit, and
in the communion of Saints, by the prayers of the
whole Church, both of the triumphant Church in
generall, and of the militant in particular. <hi>Moses</hi>
prayeth, and <hi>Iosua</hi> ouer-commeth; <hi>Peter</hi> is impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the Church prayeth, and he is deliuered. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
are they blessed, by the meanes of Gods Church
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:9284:22"/>
in the reception of the blessed body and bloud of
Christ sacramentally, which if they receaue worthily,
they goe on in the world, breathing out breath, feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the very Deuill himselfe, and to all the powers
of darknesse (as golden-mouthed <hi>Chrisostome</hi>) vsed
to speake vnto his <hi>Antiochians,</hi> yea, wherewith wee
goe confidently on in the spirit of <hi>Dauid,</hi> that albeit
we walke through the valley of the shadow of death,
yet feare wee none ill, for euery Christian in that

               <p n="7"> The vse of this concernes both the Kingdome
in generall, the Chamber of the Kingdome in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
and euery mans conscience indiuidually. Doth
not the people of this Land (the house of England)
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:9284:23"/>
see, and consider how God hath made our State his
owne deare darling, which the Iesuites, and other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missaries
of <hi>Rome</hi> spite at. Hath not God chosen it as
his Lilly among the flowers of the field? as the Doue
among the Fowles of Heauen? as the Cedar among
the Trees of the Forrest? as his <hi>Iudea</hi> among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
and as his <hi>Syon</hi> amongst the mountains? Is not
this our Iland the house of preuailing Israel? a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
for his Elect? an Oracle for his Word? and an
habitation for himselfe? Is not our <hi>Republique</hi> to
<hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>Aegina</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> not onely an eye-sore, but
an heart-sore. The State-politique whereof doth
right euery man both in iudgement and iustice. The
principall agent of <hi>Iustice</hi> vnder the King, is called in
the abstract the <hi>Chiefe-Iustice.</hi> The King himselfe is
the fountaine of all Iustice, and doth delegate his
power of administration vnto seuerall Iustices <hi>Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi>
who in their set circuits for the benefit and ease
of the subiect, doe expedite the lesser causes. Yea, the
whole Land being diuided into Shires, or Shares,
Hundreds, Wapentakes, and Tithings, that euery
man, to the number of tenne, may answere for each
other, and may be liable to Law, if they doe any
harme, and also may receiue right to that number in
euery particular place, and Parish. The inferiour
Courts are erected for the good of the subiect in smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
causes, and the Parliament in supreame causes is
conueened, wherein the King himselfe (albeit he hath
royall assent in all) yet by Law, Reason, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he is legally limited, and concluded. So that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlled
no wicked <hi>Nimrod</hi> can offend by strong

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:9284:23"/>
nor any griping <hi>Zacheus</hi> by forged cauillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Our Christian King hath so prouided, that this
his house of England may be indeed the house of
preuailing Israel. That God may generally be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
hee hath ordained (as the King of <hi>Babel</hi> in
his Prouinces) that all his subiects within the foure
seas may truly worship the God of Israel. That God
may be pleased with our prayers and fastings, he hath
ordained a <hi>Lent,</hi> as the King of <hi>Niniue</hi> a fast. That
God may be glorified with a Festiuity, hee hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
the fift of Nouember to his diuine worship,
in thankes-giuing for the States wonderfull deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from the hellish Gun-pouder Treason, as
Queene <hi>Hester</hi> ordained the Feast of <hi>Purim,</hi> for the
<hi>Iewes</hi> deliuerance from wicked <hi>Hamans</hi> cruelty. Hee
hath set an order to things indifferent, as did good
King <hi>Ioas,</hi> that there may be no confusion, no schisme
in his Land. He hath restrayned foolish, vaine, and
idle questions, both priuate and publique, with all
fruitlesse opposition, lest that carpet-Preachers
should through a singular spirit, broach the Lees of
<hi>Anabaptisme, Brownisme, Vorstianisme,</hi> and other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticall
delusions, and lest they should sow schismes,
heresies, and seditious murmurings amongst his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
subiects. In a word, our King hath taken course
that the hand of violence may in no wise touch the
bodies of his subiects, to which purpose <hi>Coroners</hi> are
appointed in all shires, and corporate Townes, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
by secret inquest vpon such as come to violent
or vntimely deaths, that the Kings Delegates may be
certified how his Subiects come to their ends.</p>
               <p n="8"> He hath also most Christianly prouided, that your
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:9284:24"/>
goods may be kept from rapine, fraud, and cousenage.
To which purpose are ordained Clerkes of Markets
to looke to weights, and measures, and Iudges and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices
for theeues, robbers, and all other oppressors.
And also for your reputation, and good name, he hath
ordained that no black-mouthed Curre, with a tongue
enflamed by hell fire, shall besmut the same, but he is
lyable to censure.</p>
               <p n="9"> Is not therefore the blessing of God vpon the

ouer the Land, applying themselues in euery

and the sonnes of thunder to a boysterous and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boned
<hi>Nimrod:</hi> In a word, becomming all to all, that
they may winne some. Say then, if the blessing of God
be not also on the people from the state <hi>Ecclesiastique?</hi>
Descend wee from the state of the Kingdome, to the
Chamber of the Kingdome, the great City of <hi>London.</hi>
What blessings hath not that City from the state <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique,</hi>
in their bodies, goods, and good name, which if
any man impeach, hee is lyable to Law? How are
the soules and consciences of the Citizens blessed by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:9284:24"/>
that sacred Company of many able Preachers, to
whom God hath giuen the Word? Insomuch that I
may truly say, that no City in the World on which
the Sunne shineth, hath more cause to magnifie God,
and to multiply their thankefulnesse. Oh how many,
and how manifold are Gods blessings vpon that City?
Oh how many are the wayes, that God hath reuealed
for the saluation of chose Citizens? Insomuch that a
man may take vp the words which Saint <hi>Chrisostome</hi>
vsed to his <hi>Antiochians:</hi> Is it possible that a people fed
with such holy viands, bred with such dainty fare,
should be guilty of such grosse, and so grieuous sinnes,
eating sacramentally of the holy Lambe of GOD,
should become Wolues and Tygers one to another?
For all in that great and populous City are not pure
wheate, some are tares; all are not wise Virgines, some
are foolish sleepers; all are not sheepe, some are goates.
Discontent is the foode of the wretched, to whom the
present state is alwayes grieuous, and imitation of
strangers is a bane to others, whereby diuers are alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
both from nature, and Nation, from Church,
and Common-wealth: All which proceeds from the
want of comparing the State of other Nations with
their owne present blessed condition, which causeth
them not to see their owne felicity, &amp; others misery. O
foolish people, do you thus reward the Lord? O <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
destruction is of thy self for thy vnthankfulnesse.</p>
               <p n="10"> Wherefore let all the people in Church, City,

of God ouer the great ones, but to visit the mighty,
that they grow not carelesse like, <hi>Gallio</hi> the <hi>Proconsull</hi>
of <hi>Achaia,</hi> to watch ouer them, that they become not

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:9284:26"/>
it vpon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and vpon all his seruants.</p>
               <p n="3"> But stay, is not <hi>Maiestie</hi> and <hi>Soueraigntie</hi> Gods
peculiar? Doubtlesse: and he is accursed that doth
not conceiue so. Why then doth God deale so seuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with them, as oft-times so euidently, and so exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarily
to punish them more then others for their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences?
There are important reasons for it. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
great ones sinne with greater impunity, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
then others. If inferiours offend, they are
lyable to the censures of great ones; but great ones
may play the Pike in a Pond, and who dares con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troule
them?<note place="margin">Psal. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>I will vp therefore saith the Lord, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge.</hi>
Secondly, great ones taxe others, and none
dare touch them. Is not a <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> a blacke Swan?
Who dares tell a great one, <hi>Non licet tibi?</hi> Is not an
<hi>Elias</hi> as rare? What is hee, and who is hee that hath
an heart to tell a <hi>Cassandrian</hi> great one what <hi>Elias</hi> told
<hi>Ahab?</hi> Therefore God will speake to them himselfe.
Thirdly, none are more bitter then great ones to
those that tell them their faults. For a carelesse great
one will scoffe, and scorne at a sincere dealing <hi>Iohn
Baptist.</hi> A wanton reputes admonition as an olde
wiues tale, albeit it come from graue <hi>Zacharias.</hi> A
sterne great one will presently enioyne you silence, as
<hi>Amazia</hi> did <hi>Amos,</hi> and an vnbeleeuer will neuer leaue
till he haue quite banished you. Fourthly, there is no
appeale from great ones, as in the case of <hi>Naboth,</hi> no
Citizen of <hi>Samaria</hi> durst open his mouth for that
poore <hi>Innocent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> and therefore God said, <hi>I will arise and
reuenge his wrong, for it is high time that the Lord set to
his hand,</hi> when the great ones who haue the Law in
their hands doe destroy it. Fiftly, God dealeth thus
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:9284:27"/>
seuerely with great ones to appease the blasphemies
of the enraged multitude: For what will <hi>Atheists</hi> and
wretches say, when they see great ones outrageously
offending? What say they,<note place="margin">Ioh. 21.</note> where is Gods prouidence?
What care hath hee of vs to set a woolfe to gouerne
sheepe? a tyrant to rule ouer innocents? Is God silent?
Is he at leisure? For these and the like blasphemies,
occasioned by the vniust dealings and wicked gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of great ones, God being iealous of his owne
glory, will rise vp, and reuenge, as it is most plaine
in the message that God put into the mouth of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi>
to speake vnto King <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.</note> in the case of <hi>Vria<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s</hi>
wrongs.</p>
               <p n="4"> Great ones (if they haue grace) may make good
vse of this: First, of <hi>Caution,</hi> to beware how they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
their greatnesse to ill example: For superiors like
starres are potent by their influence vpon inferior bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
If the head be crasie, the whole body cannot be
haile: If the aire be infected with an Epidemical quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
they that dwel therein cannot be very sound. And
if the Pilot be peeuish, the passengers may be in great
hazard. Besides, inferiours are mutable: If the <hi>Abbot</hi>
dance, the <hi>Monke</hi> will shake his heeles; and if <hi>Dyoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
study philosophy, his Courtiers will philosophize,
if he but intermit his study, they will altogether omit
all studie.</p>
               <p n="5">Now the reason of this facile inclination, which
causeth inferiours to be like yron drawne with these
Loadstones, and to be like straw drawne with these
jeats and ambers, is because great ones haue eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of place, therefore the poore inferiours conceiue,
as therein is nothing but greatnes, so there is nothing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9284:27"/>
but goodnesse. Secondly, because inferiours haue an
opinion of infallibility, like the <hi>Pythagorians,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi>
that the great ones are too bigge to be deceiued.
Thirdly, the very imitation of great ones hath hope
of impunity. For, with what face can he that is in place
of authority punish an inferiour, when the great one
is as grosely obnoxious, and as peccant in the same
sinne as the inferiour? Fourthly, inferiours haue a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to please great ones, insomuch, that to creepe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the fauor of great ones, some haue made no bones,
not onely to imitate their gestures, and voyces, but
their vices also; yea, to stammer, to lispe, to limpe, to
weare long haire, yellow bands, and what not? such
Camelions, Apes, fawning Dogges, and questing
Puppies are the giddie multitude to please great ones.
As therefore great ones (if they be good ones) are as
eminent and apparent <hi>Land-markes</hi> at Sea for safe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
into the hauen: so in euill they are like <hi>Eur<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clidons</hi>
to hurry many vpon the Sands, Shelfes, and
Rockes of ineuitable destruction.</p>
               <p n="6"> In the second place, great ones may learne to
practise humilitie, lest they should be proude and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
their God. For it is neither <hi>Pharaohs</hi> greatnesse,
nor <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> imperiousnesse, nor <hi>Iehues</hi> furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,
nor <hi>Herods</hi> craftinesse, nor <hi>Saules</hi> goodlines,
nor <hi>Rehoboams</hi> lustinesse, nor any thing else that can
exempt them from the mighty hand of God, if they
grow exorbitant. For if <hi>Zenacherib</hi> be extrauagant,
God hath a hooke to put into his nostrils, and a bridle
to put into his lippes. If <hi>Baasha</hi> will become a <hi>Behe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth,</hi>
of the flesh of his progeny what the Dogges in
the City leaue,<note place="margin">2 Reg. 19.</note> the fowles of the field shall eate vp. If

                  <hi>Zimri</hi> be treacherous,<note place="margin">1 Reg. 16.</note> fire shall deuoure him, and the
pallace ouer his head. And if foolish <hi>Ahab</hi> become
hellish,<note place="margin">1 Reg. 22.</note> and sell himselfe to doe euill, an Arrow shall
pierce through the riuets of his briggandine, and strike
him to the very heart: yea for all great ones (whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
they be) that abuse their potencie, and opulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
God hath prepared instruments of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
euen for all strong hunting <hi>Nimrods,</hi> prophane
<hi>Esaus,</hi> threatning <hi>Rehoboams,</hi> and Machauilian <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophels,</hi>
albeit either to vphold, or aduance their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
they temper exotique poysons, consult <hi>Wisards,</hi>
vse whores, hire bauds, and practise a thousand wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesses,
yet Gods iudgements shall come like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into their bowells, and like oyle into their bones,
and some man of God shall discouer the very secrets
that such <hi>Arams</hi> do in their very bed-chamber, be the
Curtaines drawne neuer so close, whisper they neuer
so secretly. And then shall they curse the day, and the
houre (when the hand of the Lord is vpon them) that
euer they were borne, or that they did enioy the light
of the Sunne. Then shall they know that the feare
of the Lord in goodnesse, is better then all the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the world.</p>
               <p n="7"> In the third place is practize of Obedience for
the Subiects, that they submit themselues to euerie
ordinance of God, whether it be to a Monarchie,
wherein is one Soueraigne, as the head, or vnto <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stochracie</hi>
wherein is an assembly of the best, or vnto
<hi>Demochracie,</hi> or <hi>Plebeian</hi> gouernement. For there is
no power, but of God, whether it be like the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the <hi>Heluetian,</hi> or the state of the <hi>Grisons,
Venetians, Ragusa,</hi> or other mixt gouernements, or the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:9284:28"/>
Monarchies of <hi>England, Spaine, France,</hi> and the like.

on all hands, yea, not onely the hand, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
the treason, but the heart that consents thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and the head that conceiues it. Let that hand dry
vp, as <hi>Ieroboams</hi> hand, and that heart tremble, as <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shazars,</hi>

Let the blacke Rauen of the Valley, feed vpon the

               <p n="8"> In the fourth place is practise of vision, that great
ones also may see that they dispise not little ones. For
what is more frequent in the Scripture, then for euill
great ones to be vanquished with little ones. <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi>
the Colonel of the horse, vanquisheth his foolish
Master <hi>Rehoboam</hi> the King. <hi>Mordocheus,</hi> the Kings
Porter, putteth downe <hi>Haman</hi> the fauorite, by the
meanes of <hi>Hester</hi> a poore captiue Hebrew Girle. And
the reason is, because God doth not only work his will
by weake, and vile meanes, as the world oft reputeth
them, to the end that no flesh should boast it selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, but also oft-times God armeth in his
iudgement little wicked ones to subuert great wicked
ones, as it is most plaine in <hi>Baasha, Zimri, Omri, Asa,
Ahab, Iehu,</hi> and others.<note place="margin">Psalme 52.</note> 
                  <hi>Boast not thou thy selfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
(O great one,) that thou canst doe mischiefe,</hi> for
Gods iudgement is greater then thou. And let not
great ones forget by whom they raigne: For what
was more excellent in Heauen then an Angell? yet
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:9284:29"/>
for his pride hee was cast downe to Hell. What on
earth more glorious then an Emperour? yet <hi>Charles</hi>

yet when hee set himselfe against God in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with the Duke of <hi>Saxony, the Lant-Graue of Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,</hi>

The Spaniard in eightie eight, that brought to
Sea that inuincible <hi>Atalantado</hi> (as the <hi>Nunne</hi> of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall

in the pride of the imaginations of his owne heart.
And most memorable is that of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, the
last King of <hi>France,</hi> hauing two of his teeth strucken
out by <hi>Iohn Chastell, a Iesuites</hi> Scholer; one of the
Religion standing by (perceiuing the wound not to
be mortall) be-spake the King on this fashion, <hi>O
King, thou hast denyed God with thy mouth,</hi> meaning
the Kings outward reuolt to <hi>Popery, but when thou
shalt deny God with thine heart, God will stabb thee through
the heart,</hi> which fell out diuers yeares after in the

pleased God that wee liue in a Common-wealth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

gouernement: Wherein the King is the <hi>Vnite</hi> from
whence all numbers are deriued; hee is the Father of

he is the Pilote that stands at the helme; he is

hereunto, let the great ones of the World know that
if they be scandalous, a woe belongeth vnto them;
for Christ saith: <hi>Woe vnto the World, because of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
If woe to the whole World, then vnto England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
It were better that a great one which giueth publique
scandall had a great mil-stone hanged about his neck;
and be cast into the Sea, then that hee should lay a
stumbling blocke before Gods children, or that his
wickednesse should cause the whole land to mourne,
and bring in the sword of the enemie, by Gods iust
iudgement, to be sheathed into our owne bowels. Let
not the greatnesse of other Kingdomes and States de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre

in the Scriptures. <hi>He that hath eares to heare, let

                  <note place="margin">Luk. 8.</note>) <hi>And he that hath eares to heare,

the spirit of God in the <hi>Reuelation</hi> to the seauen Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:9284:31"/>
that is to say, intend with your hearts to doe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
what you heare and conceiue. The reason why
the Scripture vseth this earnest elocution, as to say,
<hi>He that hath eares to heare, let him heare,</hi> (as if men did
any thing else with their eares, but heare) is this. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men see with their eares, as they doe who but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ought of their neighbours (especially if it be of
euill report) beleeue it to be true, as if verily they
had seene it with their eyes, and these kinde of people
indeed see with their eares. The goutie haue two feet
and cannot goe: the goggle-eyed, bleare-eyed, and
pur-blinde, haue two eyes to see, and yet cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
discerne: euen so, many haue both eares, who
either with the Adder stop both, and so heare nothing,
or being of the generation of <hi>Malchus,</hi> they haue
neuer a right-eare, rightly to heare, hearken, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
as they should. In this place therefore, <hi>obaudire</hi>
is <hi>obedire:</hi> so <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe saith in a double paralell
of the Gospel.<note place="margin">Luke 8.</note> In Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> Christ saith, concerning

eares to attend vaine and vile things, are they not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners

is enioyned, as the elegancy and efficacy of this phrase
requireth, that wee not onely beleeue what we heare
from God, but assent also thereunto, and submit our

(according to the old English Prouerbe)
<hi>Where God hath his Church, the Diuell hath his Chappell,</hi>
Whence it is that many in Christian Assemblies, when
they should heare Gods voyce, behaue themselues as
if they were <hi>Gothes, Vandales, Guelphes,</hi> and <hi>Gibelline<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

For while other well-affected Christians attend, reade,
lift vp their hands to Heauen, pray, sing, sigh, fit still
vnto the end; these ill-affected ones sleepe, prare, put
out the foole-finger, curse, grinne, scoffe, and hasten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
as vnworthy of the peace of God. Maruell not
therefore why so many come so often to Church, and
are neuer the better: For their hearts are waxen grosse,
and their eares and eyes, and all are stupified by the
Diuell. Hence is it that they come without heart to
God, and are but halfe Christians at the best, like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa,</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:9284:33"/>
or like <hi>Hagar,</hi> who sate right euer against the
waters and did not see them. Nothing likes these
kinde of people, but a hunting Masse (as <hi>Henry</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> was wont to say) and a straw-berry Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
               <p n="8"> But happily you will say: The Pulpits ought to
be mercy-seates, and Chaires of consolation, but they
are become <hi>Tribunals,</hi> where the Auditory is arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
accused, and condemned. I answere. Behold I
shew you a Paradoxe. <hi>It is a plague vnto you when you
are not plagued, and you are vndone, when you are not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</hi>
It was neuer worse with the <hi>Israelites,</hi> then when
their mouthes and stomakes were full of <hi>Quailes.</hi> The
dolors of <hi>Synai,</hi> to some, are more wholsome then the
songs of <hi>Syon.</hi> Indeede he that endeauoureth to teach
a foole, gleweth a potshard together; and he that spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
vnto a heart that doth not attend, is as if he should
speake to one newly raised from sleepe. Weepe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ouer the dead but seauen dayes, because they are
depriued of the light, but weepe ouer such fooles eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day, because they are destitute of vnderstanding:
Their heart is like a broken pitcher, it will hold no wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and if it doe hold any thing, it is like a syue that
retaines the chaffe onely, and lets the good grain passe
through.</p>
               <p n="9"> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his time was at a <hi>non-plus</hi> what
he should preach: So may the Church-men be of our
time; for saith Saint <hi>Augufline,</hi> When <hi>I did behold the
louers of this World, I knew not how to preach to them:
For the rich disdained at what I said, and the poore had
rather haue bread, then the Manna that I brought; yea, and
the miserable would oft times murmur that it fared better
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9284:33"/>
with the Preacher then with them.</hi> Yet for all this the
true humble soule that comes to God, puts on confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
comes trembling, quaking, sighing, and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and putteth on <hi>Elias</hi> mantle, which is verecundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
modesty, that Princely Robe so pleasing to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God. The true Christian soule, though affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in it selfe, comes yet well affected to be cured. If
it hath retters, it is well content to haue inke and gall
to be sprinkled vpon it; if it hath a perilous pleuresie,
it is contented to haue it launced, lest the cure grow
by delatory shifts incurable. Knowing that it is against
the Law of <hi>Armes, Nature, and Nations,</hi> that <hi>Herolds</hi>
and <hi>Embassadors</hi> should be euilly entreated. The bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
soules that breathe and long for Heauen, will heare
what the Lord will say; for <hi>at the last he will speake peace
vnto their soules, that they returne not againe to folly.</hi> They
will hearken vnto Gods voyce, that he may hearken
vnto their voyce, when they call vnto him in the euill
day; and they will attend and waite his pleasure: For
in a still voyce he will speake comfort vnto them, and
with his powerfull hand in his owne good time hee
will take them vnto himselfe for euer; yea, albeit God
tell them of their sinnes in plaine termes, and lay them
open to the view of the World, yet will they assure
themselues that God doth it, to make their iniquities
appeare in their right colours, (as they are) exceeding
and out of measure sinnefull, that so the godly hauing
a sight of the vglinesse, filth, and horror of their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,
may the sooner lothe them to the death, abhor
themselues in a godly hatred, and sue for pardon in
the meritorious sufferings of their all-sufficient Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> Assuring themselues that Gods word,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:9284:34"/>
which they heare, is not spoken in vaine, but in them
that are saued, worketh that good effect wherefore it
is sent, that as the Snowe and Raine, which descend
downe from Heauen returne not in vaine, but wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the earth, that it may bring forth fruit vnto him
that laboureth, and seede vnto the sower; so the
word that we heare from God (if our hearts be not
heathy and sandy ground) worketh that which it
was sent out for, to Gods glorie and mans saluation
for euer.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou haue heard the generall Summons,
the particular parties summoned, and
the Charge vnto them all. Now ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
what they all must attend vnto,
which is the <hi>Declaration,</hi> setting out their sinnes, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9284:34"/>
the <hi>Commination</hi> of iudgement, which is the sequell of
their sinnes: The <hi>Declaration</hi> sets out the sinnes of all
estates to be subtile sinnes, high, heauie, and hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
sinnes. All this appeares by the <hi>Declaration</hi> in
these tearmes: <hi>For you haue beene a snare on Mizpah,
and a net spread vpon Tabor, And the Reuolters are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
to make slaughter, albeit I haue beene a rebuker of
them all.</hi> These words shew foure things. First, the
qualitie of their sins, that they were <hi>Nets</hi> and <hi>Snares.</hi>
In which resemblance of <hi>Nets</hi> and <hi>Snares,</hi> other foure
things are couched. First the subtilty, and slyenesse
of their sinnes: For their trickes and deuices, like
<hi>Nets</hi> and <hi>Snares,</hi> were so cunningly set, that few or
none could perceiue them. Secondly, the cursed gaine
which they intended by their sinnes, <hi>Nets</hi> and <hi>Snares</hi>
are not set for nifles, they intend not <hi>vaga indiuidua.</hi>
Thirdly, the irregularity of their sins, <hi>Quo warranto?</hi>
What Law or what Warrant had they to deuise such
trickes and proiects of hauing? Fourthly, the stength
of their <hi>Iniquities,</hi> for the seely soules whom they
caught being free before, but now captiuated, and
ensnared in their trammells, were brought into great
bondage, and extreame misery, as seely Birds and
harmelesse Beasts are caught in trammels.</p>
               <p n="2"> Secondly, in the <hi>Declaration</hi> is set downe the
height of their sinnes, by the two Mountains <hi>Mizpah,</hi>
and <hi>Tabor,</hi> wherein I will not either out of Saint <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi>
or <hi>Martine Luther,</hi> Corographically describe
their scites. It is most plaine in the booke of <hi>Iosuah,</hi>
that <hi>Mizpah</hi> was a famous hil, by the victory that <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suah</hi>
obtained neere vnto it: It was a mountaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they went vp to it, and vpon it was an Altar,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:9284:35"/>
because it is said, they went vp to the Lord in <hi>Miz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pah.</hi>
Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> is famous in the Gospel,<note place="margin">Matth. 17.</note> by Christs
transfiguration thereon.</p>
               <p n="3"> The litterall sence is this: The manner of these
<hi>Reuolters</hi> was to intercept by Ambuscados, the poore
soules that fled out of <hi>Israell</hi> to <hi>Iuda</hi> (where the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
worship of God was) and to bring them backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to <hi>Bethel,</hi> or <hi>Dan,</hi> as the manner of the <hi>Romanists</hi>
haue beene, who haue surprised vpon the <hi>Alpes</hi> those
deuoute soules, that hasted out of reuolted <hi>Italie</hi> to
<hi>Geneuah,</hi> and other reformed parts, and to reduce
them backe againe to their cruell <hi>Inquisition.</hi> The
mysticall sence is: These Reuolters did ensnare Gods
people by foolish and fond traditions, enioyning the
obseruation of them, as if they had beene the true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of God. The Metaphoricall sence is: As on
these mountaines the fowlers, and hunters, did catch
birds and beasts with nets and trammells; so these in
Church, Court, and Countrey ensnared poore weake
soules with thousand mischieuances. The Synecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall
sence is: They did not onely ensnare Gods
people, at <hi>Dan,</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> but also extended their
reuolt to the toppes of <hi>Mizpah,</hi> and <hi>Tabor,</hi> and where
not?</p>
               <p n="4"> Thirdly, this <hi>Declaration</hi> shewes the horrour of
their sins by words of degrees. For these estates had
not onely internally reuolted, but euen to the view of
the world externally also, hauing no respect, either to
time, place, or person: The set place of Gods worship
at that time was <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> They would worship at
<hi>Dan, Bethel, Mizpah, Tabor,</hi> any where. The times, and
holie festiuities appointed by the Law, they regarded
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9284:35"/>
not. The persons designed for the Priesthoode they
fleighted. Moreouer, they had multiplied their <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarications,</hi>
by enhaunsing their Sacrifices, which the
Spirit of God laugheth to scorne, by terming <hi>a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iugatis,</hi>
their Sacrifices, slaughters, their Temples,
shambles, and their Priests, Butchers. Yea, and that
which is more, all the estates, as it seemes, had subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
themselues in their reuolt to the base vulgar, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
to giue them content for aduantage, in what
straine or depth of impietie so euer.</p>
               <p n="5">Fourthly, in this <hi>Declaration</hi> also is shewed the
insolencie of their sinnes: For they were growne to
that impudencie and height of sinning, albeit God
himselfe, both by immediate, and mediate means had
beene a rebuker of them all. Wherein they endeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to preuent the obiection that is ordinarily made
in the Prophets, whereby they might haue said to
God, <hi>If we are deceiued, thou hast deceiued vs.</hi> But
the Text meetes with that, and saith, <hi>God himselfe
had beene a rebuker of them all.</hi> O how great is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty,
deepenesse, and slienesse of sinne, that hath all
these foule and fearefull ingrediences? Learne hence
therefore, that.</p>
               <p>No voyce nor rebuke of God or good men, laying forth
the hideousnesse and horror of sinnes, neuer so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to the view of the conscience, can preuaile with
the mighty hunting Nimrods of this world, to
restraine their rage and furious madnes, but still
they make their greatnesse in Church, Court, and
Common-wealth, baites and guiles for their gaine
and glorie.</p>

                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:9284:37"/>This appeareth in the very termes and passages
of the context: For from the Court to the Cart, they
would be <hi>Nets</hi> and <hi>Snares</hi> to one another, albeit the
Lord God himselfe had beene a rebuker of them all
for it. This is <hi>Patriarchall</hi> truth; for righteous <hi>Noah,</hi>
holy <hi>Lot,</hi> and meeke <hi>Moses</hi> preuaile not with some in
their times. It is Propheticall truth; for all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
grieuously complaine hereof. It is Euangelicall
truth; for, Christ himselfe preuailes not with <hi>Herod,</hi>
and other miscreants. And it is also Apostolicall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
for the Apostles preuaile not with such as <hi>Symon
Magus</hi> was, and others of that stampe, nor all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of the glorious Gospell of Christ, (sithence
that time) doth preuaile with those that are miscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
and none of Gods eternall Election.</p>
               <p n="7"> The reason hereof is plaine: for these wicked
ones are enwrapped in the snares of the diuell.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.</note> They
are the Diuells slaues, bound to doe his will. They are

appeare out of the <hi>Declaration,</hi> both in <hi>Israel</hi> alreadie
reuolted, and in <hi>Iuda</hi> that yet staggered. <hi>Israel</hi> reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

<hi>Iudgement</hi> signifieth discrimination, or difference, and
that must be left vntill the generall audit. I will not
take vpon me to iudge before the time, who are sheepe
who are goates, who are wheate, who are the chaffe;

               <p n="2"> In a word, vnderstand by <hi>Iudgement</hi> in this place,
that which <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romans.
Indignation, and wrath, tribulation and anguish vpon euery
soule of man that doth euill.</hi> So then the <hi>Iudgement</hi> here

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:9284:42"/>
                  <hi>Anguish,</hi> shall be poured out of the vyals of Gods

exuberant goodnesse of God, which thus speaketh:
<hi>Iudgement</hi> is toward you; <hi>Iudgement</hi> instant, but not
yet extant; <hi>Iudgement</hi> toward you, but not vpon you.

               <p n="7"> The case is otherwise with vs in <hi>England</hi> (God

They make no merchandizing of the word of God,
as doe the Italian Montebanks of <hi>Rome.</hi> Our Church-men
ensnare vs not, (as the <hi>Romanists</hi> doe theirs) with
conceited <hi>Saints,</hi> as salues for all sores, or with rotten
Romish Reliques, such as are <hi>Martines</hi> bootes, <hi>George</hi>
his Sword, <hi>Crispines</hi> cutting Knife, <hi>Iosephs</hi> breeches,
<hi>Thomas</hi> his Shooe, the swadling Clowts of Christ, the
Milke and Haire of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the like sop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries.
Neither doe they tell vs that the Breath of
Christ is in that boxe, as some hideous blasphemous
impostors of the <hi>Latian-Lateran</hi>-monster haue made
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:9284:44"/>

<hi>England</hi> preach vnto vs nothing, but <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
the great Angel of the Lord, presenting to our
God the vialls of odours, which are the prayers of
the Saints. They preach vnto vs the pure Word, and
administer the blessed Sacraments, (without blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or mixture) as the reliques of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> In the
ministration whereof, albeit they are by some sort of
miscreants meanly handled, and coursly entertained,
yet they haue resolued with <hi>Gideons</hi> souldiers to lap
colde water, before they would for filthie lucre or
vaine-glorie become Nets and Snares to entangle the
consciences of any the least of Gods deare ones with
mis-leading vntruths, or mis-perswading traditions.
Let vs not therefore become a by-word to forraine
Nations, but let vs shew our selues to be Gods true
<hi>Israel,</hi> as a people beleeuing that God hath appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a day, wherein he will iudge all orders and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

               <p n="8"> In which day of Iudgement, he will iudge our

and all men, of all sorts, shall there be presented

the Witnesse, Aduocate, and Iudge; Where
many Orators shall impleade one, the Angels whom
we haue grieued by our impenitencie, the poore and

shall vrge <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Naboth</hi> shall impleade <hi>Ahab</hi>
for their blouds. Those that haue beene corrupted
by our perswasion, example, meanes, or money, shall
cry out against vs. In which iudgement there shall
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:9284:44"/>
be no cuasion, no appeale: For if we deny any thing,
heauen and earth shall witnesse it against vs: If we
translate our crimes, we shall be pointed at with this,
<hi>Thou art the man:</hi> If wee pleade ignorance, the long
time of Gods sufferings, and the many yeares of the
preaching of the Gospell shall be vrged against vs: If
we pretend necessity of sinning, it will be answered,
it was not of co-action, but of our owne corruption:
If wee aplogize for our selues in a Panegyricall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration,
what good deedes we haue done, and
how many Sermons wee haue heard, the voyce will
come forth from God, <hi>I know you not that worke ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity:</hi>
And if we become Suppliants, it will not serue
our turne, for the maister of Requests will then bee
come out of heauen: If we appeale, it will be told vs,
that God hath delegated all the iudgement to his
Sonne. Listen therefore vnto the voyce of <hi>Iehouahs</hi>
fatherly Admonitions, so shall you stand in that
Iudgement. Lift vp your heads, and reioyce to heare
Christ say, <hi>Come yee blessed.</hi> But if you will not heare
his Commonition, Confusion shall couer you, as a
Cloake, you shall roare for dolour, and that great
<hi>Anathema Maranatha</hi> shall plunge you into hell, with
<hi>Goe ye cursed.</hi> There remayneth onely an <hi>Exhortation,

               <p n="9"> 
                  <hi>First, I exhort therefore,</hi> That Prayers and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.</note>
be made for all Estates of this Land, Especially
for the house of the King: That the King as the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his house, may euer loue the glory of Gods house, and
the place where Gods honour dwelleth. That the Prince
and the rest of the Kings regall posterity, may learne to
execute true iudgement and iustice. That his Counsell may
be loyall, and religious in the simplicity of their hearts, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:9284:45"/>
in the dexterity of their hands. That the Peeers and Iudges
may be as prudent Patrons, Fathers, &amp; guides to the whole
State. That vniust Monopolies which are but as the baites
of these Nets, vnnecessary taxations, which are but the
lead of these Nets, to make them sinke, and faire pretences,
which are but the corke, to make them floate aloft, may
neuer be once named amongst the Courtiers of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Let vs euer pray that God would alwayes keepe
three things in the Kings Court, that were reserued in the
Arke of the Couenant, that is, The Law of God, and the
lawes of our kingdome consonant thereunto, whereby the
policy of the State may be ordered, both piousty and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently:
The Manna, which is the maintenance of the State,
may be aduanced: And <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod, the Ecclesiasticall
Doctrine and Discipline, which may bud and blossome, and
bring forth Almonds of Peace and Piety, so long as the
Sunne and Moone endure. So shall the House of our King,
and Kingdome, be an Administration of a most blessed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy
and a most sacred Ministery, wherein shall dwest
true Christian piety, and policy, vntill the second comming
of Iesus Christ. I exhort you also, that Prayers and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
be made for all the Prelates and Preachers of this
house of <hi>England,</hi> that the eminent in the Church vaunt
not themselues in their Domination aboue their brethren,
for that is but the baite of these Nets, nor that they exen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
their Clergy, for that is but the lead of these Nets
to make them vnseene in the great waters, nor pretend
their greatnesse and superintendency onely, for that is but
the Corke to make them floate aboue. But let vs euer pray,
that those that doe rule in the Church, may doe it with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glenesse
of heart, and those that are subordinate, and are
to be ruled, may be obedient vnto them with all cheareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that all, as Gods good seruants, may feare the Lord,
may goe when hee bids them goe, and come when hee bids
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:9284:45"/>
them come, and neuer leaue off their Euangelicall negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but doe it with all diligence vntill Christ come. So
shall our Church-men be as precious Diamonds (like <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robabel</hi>
the sonne of <hi>Shealtiel</hi>) vpon Gods right hand,
they shall be the Iewells of the State, and by their constant
preaching shall saue themselues, and others. And I exhort
you, that Prayers and Supplications be made for the whole
people of this Land, that they may be obedient to their God
in all goodnesse, subiect, and seruiceable to their King in
body, goods, and life, and ayding, and assisting one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in all Christian charity: so shall all of euery order
be a people of Gods owne acquisition, election, sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
glorification, and as Gods blessed Israel. This God grant
vnto the Court, Church, and Common-wealth, for his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable
loues sake, for his promise sake, which hee hath
ratified with the bloud of his Sonne, and for the glory of
his great Name.</p>
               <p n="10"> For mine owne part, I shall euer poure out my soule
to God, that he would for euer diuert from the house of the
King, the iudgement of Proscription, that the King may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be safe vnder Gods wings, and secure vnder his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that no Iesuited <hi>Chastell, Baltazar Gerard,</hi> nor
<hi>Iacobine, Clement, Rauilack,</hi> nor Pouder-plotter, nor
any such wicked villaine, be able once to looke vpon him
with an eye, heart, or hand, to hurt him. That God would
turne from our noble Peeres, the iudgement of Desertion,
that their hopefull sonnes may grow vp as Plants, and their
noble daughters become, as the polished angles of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
That God would diuert from the Gentry the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of fearefull slumber, lest they forget their God that
made them. From the Iudges the iudgement of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but that they may put on Iustice, as a Robe, Honour
as a Crowne, and vnanimous consent for the good of the
King and kingdome, as the linkes of their collars of S S.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:9284:46"/>
From the Prelates and Preachers the iudgement of Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Faction, and singular opinion, lest the seamelesse coat
of Iesus Christ be rent asunder. Clothe (O Lord) all the
hearts of our Church-men with thy righteousnesse, their
liues with thy grace, and their learning with thy praise.
And turne (O Lord) from the whole people of this Nation,
the iudgement of Contempt of thy Word and Sacraments,
lest deuouring fire burne vp their houses to the ground, lest
the ayre infect their breaths with the plague of pestilence,
to the death, lest the sword of the enemy be sheathed in their
owne bowells, and lest euery man become a Lion, A Wolfe, a
Tigar, and a Fox, to hunt his brother with Nets &amp; Snares.</p>
               <p n="11"> Yea, I shall euer remaine, during breath, an humble
Suppliant before the Throne of Almighty God, that the
house of the King may alwayes be as Gods <hi>Silo,</hi> the Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prickes
as Seats, and Sees, for the principall wel-deseruing
masters of the Assemblies, the Deanries as the Apostolicall
Presbyteries, the godly Magistracy of our Land, as Mount
<hi>Gerazim,</hi> filled with blessings, and the sacred Ministery, as
mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> wherein the Church-men may continually
conferre with the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apostles lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.
Yea, that the whole people may be Gods beloued Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
the cities as <hi>Bethel,</hi> the Townes and Villages as <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phage,</hi>
and <hi>Bethany,</hi> and the citie of <hi>LONDON</hi> the
chamber of the kingdome (whither the prudent Tribes are
now come vp to be Assessors, and assistants in Parliament,
may be as a closet of all precious things. Make, Lord, the
Citizens Saints, their houses Sanctuaries, and the three
Estates now assembled in <hi>PARLIAMENT,</hi> the most pious,
and most prudent <hi>Sanedrim,</hi> that euer the Sun shined on.
God perswade <hi>Iaphet</hi> to dwell in the Tents of <hi>Shem:</hi>
And let the faithfull witnesse in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
