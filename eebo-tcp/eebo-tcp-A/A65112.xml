            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I <hi>HAVE found it not more difficult to Tranſlate</hi> Virgil, <hi>than to find ſuch Patrons as I deſire for my Tranſlation. For though</hi> England <hi>is not wanting in a Learned Nobility, yet ſuch are my unhappy Circumſtances, that they have confin'd me to a narrow choice. To the greater part, I have not the Honour to be known; and to ſome of them I cannot ſhew at preſent, by any publick Act, that grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reſpect which I ſhall ever bear them in my heart. Yet I have no reaſon to complain of Fortune, ſince in the midſt of that abundance I could not poſſibly have choſen better, than the Worthy Son of ſo Illuſtrious a Father. He was the Patron of my Manhood, when I Flouriſh'd in the opinion of the World; though with ſmall advantage to my Fortune, 'till he awaken'd the remembrance of my Royal Maſter. He was that</hi> Pollio, <hi>or that</hi> Varus, <hi>who introduc'd me to</hi> Auguſtus: <hi>And tho' he ſoon diſmiſs'd himſelf from State-Affairs, yet in the ſhort time of his Adminiſtration he ſhone ſo powerfully upon me, that like the heat of a</hi> Ruſſian<hi>-Summer, he ripen'd the Fruits of Poetry in a cold Clymate; and gave me wherewithal to ſubſiſt at leaſt, in the long Winter which ſucceeded. What I now offer to your Lordſhip, is the wretched remainder of a ſickly Age, worn out with Study, and oppreſs'd by Fortune: without other ſupport than the Conſtancy and Patience of a Chriſtian. You, my Lord, are yet in the flower of your Youth, and may live to enjoy the benefits of the Peace which is promis'd</hi> Europe: <hi>I can only hear of that Bleſſing: for Years, and, above all things, want of health, have ſhut me out from ſharing in the happineſs. The Poets, who condemn their</hi> Tantalus <hi>to Hell, had added to his Torments, if they had plac'd him in</hi> Elyſium, <hi>which is the proper Emblem of my Condition. The Fruit and the Water may reach my Lips, but cannot enter: And if they cou'd, yet I want a Palate as well as a Digeſtion. But it is ſome kind of pleaſure to me, to pleaſe</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:43031:3"/>
                     <hi>thoſe whom I reſpect. And I am not altogether out of hope, that theſe</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorals <hi>of</hi> Virgil <hi>may give your Lordſhip ſome delight, though made En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh by one, who ſcarce remembers that Paſſion which inſpir'd my Author when he wrote them. Theſe were his firſt Eſſay in Poetry, (if the</hi> Ceiris <hi>was not his:) And it was more excuſable in him to deſcribe Love when he was young, than for me to Tranſlate him when I am Old. He died at the Age of fifty two, and I began this Work in my great</hi> Clymacterique. <hi>But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perhaps a better conſtitution than my Author, I have wrong'd him leſs, conſidering my Circumſtances, than thoſe who have attempted him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, either in our own, or any Modern Language. And though this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is not void of Errours, yet it comforts me that the faults of others are not worth finding. Mine are neither groſs nor frequent, in thoſe</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, <hi>wherein my Maſter has rais'd himſelf above that humble Stile in which</hi> Paſtoral <hi>delights, and which I muſt confefs is proper to the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Converſe of Shepherds: for he found the ſtrength of his Genius b<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>times, and was even in his youth preluding to his</hi> Georgics, <hi>and his</hi> Aeneis. <hi>He cou'd not forbear to try his Wings, though his Pinions were not harden'd to maintain a long laborious flight. Yet ſometimes they bore him to a pitch as lofty, as ever he was able to reach afterwards. But when he was admoniſh'd by his ſubject to deſcend, he came down gently circling in the air, and ſinging to the ground. Like a Lark, melodious in her mounting, and continuing her Song 'till ſhe alights: ſtill preparing for a higher flight at her next ſally, and tuning her voice to better muſick. The Fourth, the Sixth, and the Eighth</hi> Paſtorals, <hi>are clear Evidences of this truth. In the three firſt he contains himſelf within his bounds; but Addreſſing to</hi> Pollio, <hi>his great Patron, and himſelf no vulgar Poet, he no longer cou'd reſtrain the freedom of his Spirit, but began to aſſert his Native Character, which is ſublimity. Putting himſelf under the conduct of the ſame</hi> Cumaean Sybil, <hi>whom afterwards he gave for a Guide to his</hi> Aeneas. <hi>'Tis true he was ſenſible of his own boldneſs; and we know it by the</hi> Paulo Majora, <hi>which begins his Fourth</hi> Eclogue. <hi>He remember'd, like young</hi> Manlius, <hi>that he was forbidden to Engage; but what avails an expreſs Command to a youthful Courage, which preſages Victory in the attempt? Encourag'd with Succeſs, he proceeds farther in the Sixth, and invades the Province of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. And notwithſtanding that</hi> Phoebus <hi>had forewarn'd him of Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wars, as he there confeſſes, yet he preſum'd that the ſearch of Nature was as free to him as to</hi> Lucretius, <hi>who at his Age explain'd it according to the Principles of</hi> Epicurus. <hi>In his Eighth</hi> Eclogue, <hi>he has innovated nothing; the former part of it being the Complaint and Deſpair of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken Lover: the latter, a Charm of an Enchantreſs, to renew a loſt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. But the Complaint perhaps contains ſome Topicks which are above the Condition of his Perſons; and our Author ſeems to have made his Herdſmen ſomewhat too Learn'd for their Profeſſion: The Charms are alſo of the ſame nature, but both were Copied from</hi> Theocritus, <hi>and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the applauſe of former Ages in their Original. There is a kind of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity in all thoſe pompous Verſes; ſomewhat of a Holiday Shepherd ſtrut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in his Country Buskins. The like may be obſerv'd, both in the</hi> Pollio, <hi>and the</hi> Silenus; <hi>where the Similitudes are drawn from the Woods and Meadows. They ſeem to me to repreſent our Poet betwixt a Farmer, and a Courtier, when he left</hi> Mantua <hi>for</hi> Rome, <hi>and dreſt himſelf in his beſt Habit to appear before his Patron: Somewhat too fine for the place from whence he came, and yet retaining part of its ſimplicity. In the Ninth</hi> Paſtoral <hi>he Collects ſome Beautiful paſſages which were ſcatter'd in</hi> Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus, <hi>which he cou'd not inſert into any of his former</hi> Eclogues, <hi>and yet</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:43031:3"/>
                     <hi>was unwilling they ſhou'd be loſt. In all the reſt he is equal to his</hi> Sicilian <hi>Maſter, and obſerves like him a juſt decorum, both of the Subject, and the Perſons. As particularly in the Third</hi> Paſtoral; <hi>where one of his Shepherds deſcribes a Bowl, or Mazer, curiouſly Carv'd.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>In Medio duo ſigna: Conon, &amp; quis fuit alter,</l>
                        <l>Deſcripſit radio, totum qui Gentibus orbem.</l>
                     </q>
                     <hi>He remembers only the name of</hi> Conon, <hi>and forgets the other on ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: (whether he means</hi> Anaximander <hi>or</hi> Eudoxus <hi>I diſpute not,) but he was certainly forgotten, to ſhew his Country Swain was no great Scholar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>After all, I muſt confeſs that the Booriſh Dialect of</hi> Theocritus <hi>has a ſecret charm in it, which the</hi> Roman <hi>Language cannot imitate, though</hi> Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil <hi>has drawn it down as low as poſſibly he cou'd; as in the</hi> Cujum pecus, <hi>and ſome other words, for which he was ſo unjuſtly blam'd by the bad Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks of his Age, who cou'd not ſee the Beauties of that</hi> merum Rus, <hi>which the Poet deſcrib'd in thoſe expreſſions. But</hi> Theocritus <hi>may juſtly be preferr'd as the Original, without injury to</hi> Virgil, <hi>who modeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents himſelf with the ſecond place, and glories only in being the firſt who tranſplanted</hi> Paſtoral <hi>into his own Country; and brought it there to bear as happily as the Cherry-trees which</hi> Lucullus <hi>brought from</hi> Pontus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Our own Nation has produc'd a third Poet in this kind, not inferiour to the two former. For the Shepherd's Kalendar of</hi> Spencer, <hi>is not to be match'd in any Modern Language. Not even by</hi> Taſſo's Amynta, <hi>which infinitely tranſcends</hi> Guarinis<hi>'s</hi> Paſtor-Fido, <hi>as having more of Nature in it, and being almoſt wholly clear from the wretched affectation of Learning. I will ſay nothing of the</hi> Pifcatory Eclogues, <hi>becauſe no modern</hi> Latin <hi>can bear Criticiſm. 'Tis no wonder that rolling down through ſo many barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Ages, from the Spring of</hi> Virgil, <hi>it bears along with it the filth and ordures of the</hi> Goths <hi>and</hi> Vandals. <hi>Neither will I mention Monſieur</hi> Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinelle, <hi>the living Glory of the</hi> French. <hi>'Tis enough for him to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd his Maſter</hi> Lucian, <hi>without attempting to compare our miſerable Age with that of</hi> Virgil, <hi>or</hi> Theocritus. <hi>Let me only add, for his reputation,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>—Si Pergama dextrâ</l>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> Spencer <hi>being Maſter of our Northern Dialect; and skill'd in</hi> Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer<hi>'s Engliſh, has ſo exactly imitated the</hi> Doric <hi>of</hi> Theocritus, <hi>that his Love is a perfect Image of that Paſſion which God infus'd into both Sexes, before it was corrupted with the Knowledge of Arts, and the Ceremonies of what we call good Manners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lord, I know to whom I dedicate: And cou'd not have been induc'd by any motive to put this part of</hi> Virgil, <hi>or any other, into unlearned Hands. You have read him with pleaſure, and I dare ſay, with admiration in the Latine, of which you are a Maſter.

Courage, Probity, and Humanity are inherent in you.

                     <hi>It being almoſt morally impoſſible for you to be other than you are by kind; I need neither praiſe nor incite your Vertue.

And the natural inclination, which I have to ſerve you, adds to your paternal right, for I was wholly yours from the firſt moment, when I had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and honour of being known to you.

The Subject is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to your Youth, which allows you yet to Love, and is proper to your preſent Scene of Life. Rural Recreations abroad, and Books at home, are the innocent Pleaſures of a Man who is early Wiſe; and gives Fortune no more hold of him, than of neceſſity he muſt.

                  <head>THE LIFE OF <hi>Pub. Virgilius Maro.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>VIRGIL</hi> was born at <hi>Mantua,</hi> which City was built no leſs than Three Hundred Years before <hi>Rome;</hi> and was the Capital of the New <hi>Hetruria,</hi> as himſelf, no leſs An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary, than Poet, aſſures us. His Birth is ſaid to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in the firſt Conſulſhip of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, and <hi>Lic. Craſſus;</hi> but ſince the Relater of this preſently after contradicts himſelf; and <hi>Virgil</hi>'s manner of Addreſſing to <hi>Octavius,</hi> implies a greater difference of Age than that of Seven Years, as appears by his Firſt Paſtoral, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places; it is reaſonable to ſet the Date of it ſomething back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: And the Writer of his Life having no certain Memorials to work upon, ſeems to have pitched upon the two moſt Illuſtrious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls he could find about that time, to ſignalize the Birth of ſo Eminent a Man. But it is beyond all Queſtion, that he was Born on, or near the Fifteenth of <hi>October.</hi> Which Day was kept Feſtival in honour of his Memory, by the <hi>Latin,</hi> as the Birth-Day of <hi>Homer</hi> was by the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets. And ſo near a reſemblance there is, betwixt the Lives of theſe two famous <hi>Epic</hi> Writers, that <hi>Virgil</hi> ſeems to have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the <hi>Fortune</hi> of the other, as well as the Subject and manner of his Writing. For <hi>Homer</hi> is ſaid to have been of very mean Parents, ſuch as got their Bread by Day-labour; ſo is <hi>Virgil. Homer</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>Baſe Born;</hi> ſo is <hi>Virgil.</hi> The former to have been born in the open Air, in a Ditch, or by the Bank of a River; ſo is the latter. There was a Poplar Planted near the place of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Birth, which ſuddenly grew up to an unuſual heighth and bulk, and to which the Superſtitious Neighbourhood attributed marvellous Vertue. <hi>Homer</hi> had his Poplar too, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> relates, which was viſited with great Veneration. <hi>Homer</hi> is deſcrib'd by one of the Ancients, to have been of a ſlovenly and neglected Meen and Habit, ſo was <hi>Virgil.</hi> Both were of a very delicate and ſickly Conſtitution: Both addicted to Travel, and the ſtudy of Aſtrology: Both had their Compoſitions uſurp'd by others: Both Envy'd and traduc'd during their Lives. We know not ſo much as the true Names of either of them with any exactneſs: For the Criticks are not yet agreed how the word <hi>[Virgil]</hi> ſhould be Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Name there is no certainty at all. Whoſoever
<pb facs="tcp:43031:5"/>
ſhall conſider this Parallel in ſo many particulars; (and more might be added) would be inclin'd to think, that either the ſame Stars Rul'd ſtrongly at the Nativities of them both, or what is a great deal more probable; that the <hi>Latin</hi> Grammarians wanting Materials for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Life, after the <hi>Legendary Faſhion,</hi> ſupply'd it out of <hi>Herodotus;</hi> and like ill Face-Painters, not being able to hit the true <hi>Features,</hi> endeavour'd to make amends by a great deal of impertinent <hi>Landſcape</hi> and <hi>Drapery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Without troubling the Reader with needleſs Quotations, now, or afterwards; the moſt probable Opinion is, that <hi>Virgil</hi> was the Son of a Servant, or Aſſiſtant to a wandring <hi>Aſtrologer;</hi> who practis'd Phyſic. For <hi>Medicus, Magus,</hi> as <hi>Juvenal</hi> obſerves, uſually went together; and this courſe of Life was follow'd by a great many <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Syrians;</hi> of one of which Nations it ſeems not improbable, that <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Father was. Nor could a Man of that Profeſſion have choſen a fitter place to ſettle in, than that moſt Superſtitious Tract of <hi>Italy;</hi> which by her ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Rites and Ceremonies as much enſlav'd the <hi>Romans,</hi> as the <hi>Romans</hi> did the <hi>Hetrurians</hi> by their Arms. This Man therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got together ſome Money, which Stock he improv'd by his Skill in Planting and Husbandry, had the good Fortune, at laſt, to Marry his Maſters Daughter, by whom he had <hi>Virgil;</hi> and this Woman ſeems, by her Mothers ſide, to have been of good Extraction; for ſhe was nearly related to <hi>Quintilius Varus,</hi> whom <hi>Paterculus</hi> aſſures us to have been an Illuſtrious, tho' not Patrician Family; and there is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mention made of it in the Hiſtory of the ſecond <hi>Carthaginian</hi> War. It is certain, that they gave him very good Education, to which they were inclin'd; not ſo much by the Dreams of his Mother, and thoſe preſages which <hi>Donatus</hi> relates, as by the early indications which he gave of a ſweet Diſpoſition, and Excellent Wit. He paſſed the firſt Seven Years of his Life at <hi>Mantua,</hi> not Seventeen, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> miſcorrects his Author; for the <hi>initia aetatis</hi> can hardly be ſuppoſed to extend ſo far. From thence he removed to <hi>Cremona,</hi> a Noble <hi>Roman</hi> Colony, and afterwards to <hi>Milan.</hi> In all which places he proſecuted his Studies with great application; he read over, all the beſt <hi>Latin,</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, for which he had convenience by the no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote diſtance of <hi>Marſeils,</hi> that famous <hi>Greek</hi> Colony, which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd its Politeneſs, and Purity of Language, in the midſt of all thoſe Barbarous Nations amongſt which it was ſeated: And ſome Tincture of the latter ſeems to have deſcended from them down to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>French.</hi> He frequented the moſt Eminent Profeſſors of the <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> Philoſophy, which was then much in vogue, and will be always in declining and ſickly States. But finding no ſatisfactory Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from his Maſter <hi>Syron,</hi> he paſs'd over to the <hi>Academick School,</hi> to which he adher'd the reſt of his Life, and deſerv'd, from a great Emperour, the Title of the <hi>Plato</hi> of <hi>Poets.</hi> He compos'd at leiſure hours a great number of Verſes, on various Subjects; and deſirous rather of a <hi>great,</hi> than <hi>early</hi> Fame, he permitted his Kinſman, and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſtudent <hi>Varus,</hi> to derive the Honour of one of his Tragedies to himſelf. Glory neglected in proper time and place, returns often with large Increaſe, and ſo he found it: For <hi>Varus</hi> afterwards prov'd a great Inſtrument of his Riſe: In ſhort, it was here that he form'd the <hi>Plan,</hi> and collected the Materials of all thoſe excellent Pieces which he afterwards finiſh'd, or was forc'd to leave leſs perfect by his Death. But whether it were the Unwholſomneſs of his Native Air,
<pb facs="tcp:43031:5"/>
of which he ſomewhere complains, or his too great abſtinence, and Night-watchings at his Study, to which he was always addicted, as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> obſerves; or poſſibly the hopes of improving himſelf by Travel, he reſolv'd to Remove to the more Southern Tract of <hi>Italy;</hi> and it was hardly poſſible for him not to take <hi>Rome</hi> in his Way; as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to any one who ſhall caſt an Eye on the Map of <hi>Italy:</hi> And therefore the late <hi>French Editor</hi> of his Works is miſtaken, when he aſſerts that he never ſaw <hi>Rome,</hi> 'till he came to Petition for his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: He gain'd the Acquaintance of the Maſter of the Horſe to <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> and Cur'd a great many Diſeaſes of Horſes, by methods they had never heard of: It fell out, at the ſame time, that a very fine Colt, which promiſed great Strength and Speed, was preſented to <hi>Octavius: Virgil</hi> aſſur'd them, that he came of a faulty Mare, and would prove a Jade, upon trial it was found as he had ſaid; his Judgment prov'd right in ſeveral other inſtances, which was the more ſurprizing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becauſe the <hi>Romans</hi> knew leaſt of Natural Cauſes of any civiliz'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World: And thoſe Meteors, and Prodigies which coſt them incredible Sums to expiate, might eaſily have been accounted for, by no very profound Naturaliſt. It is no wonder, therefore, that <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> was in ſo great Reputation, as to be at laſt Introduced to <hi>Octavius</hi> himſelf. That Prince was then at variance with <hi>Marc. Antony,</hi> who vex'd him with a great many Libelling Letters, in which he reproaches him with the baſeneſs of his Parentage, that he came of a <hi>Scrivener,</hi> a <hi>Ropemaker,</hi> and a <hi>Baker,</hi> as <hi>Suetonius</hi> tells us: <hi>Octavius</hi> finding that <hi>Virgil</hi> had paſſed ſo exact a judgment upon the Breed of Dogs, and Horſes, thought that he poſſibly might be able to give him ſome Light con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his <hi>own.</hi> He took him into his Cloſet, where they continu'd in private a conſiderable time. <hi>Virgil</hi> was a great Mathematician, which, in the Senſe of thoſe times, took in Aſtrology: And if there be any thing in that Art, which I can hardly believe; if that be true which the Ingenious <hi>De le Chambre</hi> aſſerts confidently; that from the Marks on the Body, the Configuration of the Planets at a Nativity may be gathered, and the Marks might be told by knowing the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, never had one of thoſe Artiſts a fairer Opportunity to ſhew his skill, than <hi>Virgil</hi> now had; for <hi>Octavius</hi> had Moles upon his Body, exactly reſembling the Conſtellation call'd <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſa Major.</hi> But <hi>Virgil</hi> had other helps: The Predictions of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Catulus,</hi> and that Vote of the Senate had gone abroad, that no Child Born at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Year of his Nativity, ſhould be bred up; becauſe the Seers aſſur'd them that an Emperour was Born that Year. Beſides this, <hi>Virgil</hi> had heard of the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prophecies, (which in truth, were no other but the <hi>Jewiſh,)</hi> that about that time a great King was to come into the World. Himſelf takes notice of them, <hi>Aen.</hi> 6. where he uſes a very ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Word, (now in all Liturgies) <hi>hujus in adventu,</hi> ſo in another place, <hi>adventante Dea.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>Every one knows whence this was taken: It was rather a miſtake, than impiety in <hi>Virgil,</hi> to apply theſe Propheſies to the Perſon of <hi>Octavius,</hi> it being a uſual piece of flattery for near a Hundred Years together, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute them to their Emperours, and other great Men. Upon the whole
<pb facs="tcp:43031:6"/>
matter, it is very probable, that <hi>Virgil</hi> Predicted to him the Empire at this time. And it will appear yet the more, if we conſider that he aſſures him of his being receiv'd into the Number of the Gods, in his Firſt <hi>Paſtoral,</hi> long before the thing came to paſs; which Prediction ſeems grounded upon his former Miſtake. This was a ſecret, not to be divulg'd at that time, and therefore it is no wonder that the ſlight Story in <hi>Donatus</hi> was given abroad to palliate the matter. But certain it is, that <hi>Octavius</hi> diſmiſſed him with great Marks of eſteem, and earneſtly recommended the Protection of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Affairs to <hi>Pollio,</hi> then Lieutenant of the <hi>Ciſ-Alpine Gaule,</hi> where <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Patrimony lay. This <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi> from a mean Original, became one of the moſt Conſiderable Perſons of his time: A good General, Orator, States-man, Hiſtorian, Poet, and Favourer of Learned Men; above all, he was a Man of <hi>Honour</hi> in thoſe critical times: He had join'd with <hi>Octavius,</hi> and <hi>Antony,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging the Barbarous Aſſaſſination of <hi>Julius Caeſar:</hi> When they two were at variance, he would neither follow <hi>Antony,</hi> whoſe courſes he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, nor join with <hi>Octavius</hi> againſt him, out of a grateful Senſe of ſome former Obligations. <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who thought it his intereſt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige Men of Principles, notwithſtanding this, receiv'd him afterwards into Favour, and promoted him to the higheſt Honours. And thus much I thought fit to ſay of <hi>Pollio,</hi> becauſe he was one of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s greateſt Friends. Being therefore eas'd of Domeſtick cares, he purſues his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Naples:</hi> The Charming ſituation of that Place, and view of the beautiful <hi>Villa</hi>'s of the <hi>Roman</hi> Nobility, equalling the Magnificence of the greateſt Kings; the Neighbourhood of the <hi>Baiae,</hi> whither the <hi>Sick</hi> reſorted for recovery, and the States-man when he was <hi>Politickly</hi> Sick; whither the wanton went for Pleaſure, and witty Men for good Company; the wholeſomneſs of the Air, and improving <hi>Converſation,</hi> the <hi>beſt Air of all,</hi> contributed not only to the re-eſtabliſhing his Health; but to the forming of his Style, and rendring him Maſter of that happy turn of Verſe, in which he much ſurpaſſes all the <hi>Latins,</hi> and in a leſs advantageous Language, equals even <hi>Homer</hi> himſelf. He propos'd to uſe his Talent in Poetry, only for Scaffolding to Build a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Fortune, that he might Proſecute with leſs interruption, thoſe Nobler Studies to which his elevated Genius led him, and which he deſcribes in theſe admirable Lines.</p>

                  <p>But the current of that Martial Age, by ſome ſtrange <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> drove ſo violently towards Poetry, that he was at leſt carried down with the ſtream. For not only the Young Nobility, but <hi>Octavius,</hi> and <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio, Cicero</hi> in his Old Age, <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and the Stoical <hi>Brutus,</hi> a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, would needs be tampering with the Muſes; the two latter had taken great care to have their Poems curiouſly bound, and lodg'd in the moſt famous Libraries; but neither the Sacredneſs of thoſe places, nor the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Names, cou'd preſerve ill Poetry. Quitting therefore the Study of the Law, after having pleaded but one Cauſe with indifferent Succeſs, he reſolv'd to puſh his Fortune this way, which he ſeems to have diſcontinu'd for ſome time, and that may be the reaſon why the
<pb facs="tcp:43031:6"/>
                     <hi>Culex,</hi> his firſt Paſtoral, now extant, has little beſides the novelty of the Subject, and the Moral of the Fable, which contains an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to gratitude, to recomend it; had it been as correct as his other pieces, nothing more proper and pertinent cou'd have at that time bin addreſſed to the Young <hi>Octavius,</hi> for the Year in which he Preſented it, probably at the <hi>Baiae,</hi> ſeems to be the very ſame, in which that Prince conſented (tho' with ſeeming reluctance) to the Death of <hi>Cicero,</hi> under whoſe Conſulſhip he was Born, the preſerver of his Life, and chief inſtrument of his advancement. There is no reaſon to queſtion its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing genuine, as the late <hi>French</hi> Editor does; its meaneſs, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s other Works, (which is that Writers only Objection) confutes himſelf: For <hi>Martial,</hi> who certainly ſaw the true Copy, ſpeaks of it with contempt; and yet that <hi>Paſtoral</hi> equals, at leaſt, the addreſs to the <hi>Dauphin</hi> which is prefix'd to the late Edition. <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> to unbend his mind from application to publick buſineſs, took frequent turns to <hi>Baiae,</hi> and <hi>Sicily;</hi> where he compos'd his Poem call'd <hi>Sicelides,</hi> which <hi>Virgil</hi> ſeems to allude to, in the Paſtoral beginning <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celides Muſae;</hi> this gave him opportunity of refreſhing that Princes Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of him, and about that time he wrote his <hi>Aetna.</hi> Soon after he ſeems to have made a Voyage to <hi>Athens,</hi> and at his return preſented his <hi>Ceiris,</hi> a more elaborate Piece, to the Noble and Eloquent <hi>Meſſala.</hi> The forementioned Author groundleſly taxes this as ſuppoſititious: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides other Critical marks, there are no leſs than Fifty, or Sixty Verſes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd indeed and poliſh'd, which he inſerted in the <hi>Paſtorals,</hi> according to his faſhion: and from thence they were called <hi>Eclogues,</hi> or <hi>Select Buco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics:</hi> We thought fit to uſe a Title more intelligible, the reaſon of the other being ceas'd; and we are ſupported by <hi>Virgil</hi>'s own authority, who expreſly calls them <hi>Carmina Paſtorum.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Editor is again miſtaken, in aſſerting, that the <hi>Ceiris</hi> is borrow'd from the Ninth of <hi>Ovid's Metamorphoſis;</hi> he might have more reaſonably conjectur'd it, to be taken from <hi>Parthenius,</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Poet, from whom <hi>Ovid</hi> borrow'd a great part of his Work. But it is indeed taken from neither, but from that Learn'd, unfortunate Poet <hi>Apollonius Rhodius,</hi> to whom <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> is more indebted, than to any other <hi>Greek</hi> Writer, excepting <hi>Homer.</hi> The Reader will be ſatisfied of this, if he conſult that Author in his own Language, for the Tranſlation is a great deal more obſcure than the Original.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt <hi>Virgil</hi> thus enjoy'd the ſweets of a Learn'd Privacy, the Troubles of <hi>Italy</hi> cut off his little Subſiſtance; but by a ſtrange turn of Human Affairs, which ought to keep good Men from ever deſpairing; the loſs of his Eſtate prov'd the effectual way of making his Fortune. The occaſion of it was this; <hi>Octavius,</hi> as himſelf relates, when he was but Nineteen Years of Age, by a Maſterly ſtroke of Policy, had gain'd the <hi>Veteran</hi> Legions into his Service, (and by that ſtep, out-witted all the Republican Senate:) They grew now very clamorous for their Pay: The Treaſury being Exhauſted, he was forc'd to make Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Land, and none but in <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf would content them. He pitch'd upon <hi>Cremona</hi> as the moſt diſtant from <hi>Rome;</hi> but that not ſuffiſing, he afterwards threw in part of the State of <hi>Mantua. Cremona</hi> was a Rich and noble Colony, ſetled a little before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of <hi>Hannibal.</hi> During that Tedious and Bloody War, they had done ſeveral important Services to the Common-Wealth. And when Eighteen other Colonies, pleading Poverty and Depopulation, refus'd to contribute Money, or to raiſe Recruits; they of <hi>Cremona</hi> voluntarily
<pb facs="tcp:43031:7"/>
paid a double Quota of both: But paſt Services are a fruitleſs Plea; Civil Wars are one continued Act of Ingratitude: In vain did the Miſerable Mothers, with their famiſhing Infants in their Arms, fill the Streets with their Numbers, and the Air with Lamentations; the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Legions were to be ſatisfi'd at any rate. <hi>Virgil,</hi> involv'd in the common Calamity, had recourſe to his old Patron <hi>Pollio,</hi> but he was, at this time, under a Cloud; however, compaſſionating ſo worthy a Man, not of a make to ſtruggle thro' the World, he did what he could, and recommended him to <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> with whom he ſtill kept a private Correſpondence. The Name of this great Man being much better known than one part of his Character, the Reader, I preſume, will not be diſpleas'd if I ſupply it in this place.</p>
                  <p>Tho' he was of as deep Reach, and eaſie diſpatch of Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as any in his time, yet he deſignedly liv'd beneath his true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. Men had oftentimes medled in Publick Affairs, that they might have more ability to furniſh for their Pleaſures: <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> by the honeſteſt Hypocriſie that ever was, pretended to a Life of Pleaſure, that he might render more effectual Service to his Maſter. He ſeem'd wholly to amuſe himſelf with the Diverſions of the Town, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Mask he was the greateſt Miniſter of his Age. He would be carried in a careleſs, effeminate poſture thro' the Streets in his Chair, even to the degree of a Proverb, and yet there was not a Cabal of ill diſpos'd Perſons which he had not early notice of; and that too in a City as large as <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> and perhaps two or three more of the moſt populous put together. No Man better underſtood that Art ſo neceſſary to the <hi>Great;</hi> the Art of <hi>declining Envy:</hi> Being but of a Gentleman's Family, not <hi>Patrician,</hi> he would not provoke the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility by accepting invidious Honours; but wiſely ſatisfi'd himſelf that he had the <hi>Ear</hi> of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and the <hi>Secret</hi> of the Empire. He ſeems to have committed but one great Fault, which was the truſting a Secret of high Conſequence to his Wife; but his Maſter, enough Uxorious himſelf, made his <hi>own</hi> Frailty more excuſable, by generouſly forgiving that of his Favourite. He kept in all his Greatneſs exact meaſures with his Friends; and chuſing them wiſely, found, by Experience, that good <hi>Senſe and Gratitude</hi> are almoſt inſeparable. This appears in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> and <hi>Horace;</hi> the former, beſides the Honour he did him to all Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, return'd his Liberalities at his Death: The other, whom <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caenas</hi> recommended with his laſt Breath, was too generous to ſtay behind, and enjoy the Favour of <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> He only deſir'd a place in his Tomb, and to mingle his Aſhes with thoſe of his deceaſed Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor. But this was Seventeen Hundred Years ago. <hi>Virgil,</hi> thus powerfully ſupported, thought it mean to Petition for himſelf alone, but reſolutely ſolicits the Cauſe of his whole Country, and ſeems, at firſt, to have met with ſome Encouragement: But the matter cooling, he was forc'd to ſit down contented with the Grant of his own Eſtate. He goes therefore to <hi>Mantua,</hi> produces his Warrant to a Captain of Foot, whom he found in his Houſe; <hi>Arrius</hi> who had eleven Points of the Law, and fierce of the Services he had rendred to <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> was ſo far from yielding Poſſeſſion, that words growing betwixt them, he wounded him dangerouſly, forc'd him to fly, and at laſt to ſwim the River <hi>Mincius</hi> to ſave his Life. <hi>Virgil,</hi> who us'd to ſay, that no Virtue was ſo neceſſary as Patience, was forc'd to drag a fick Body half the length of <hi>Italy,</hi> back again to <hi>Rome,</hi> and by the way, probab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, compos'd his Ninth Paſtoral, which may ſeem to have been
<pb facs="tcp:43031:7"/>
made up in haſte out of the Fragments of ſome other pieces; and natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough repreſents the diſorder of the Poets Mind, by its disjointed Faſhion, tho' there be another Reaſon to be given elſewhere of its want of Connexion. He handſomly ſtates his Caſe in that Poem, and with the pardonable Reſentments of Injur'd Innocence, not only claims <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctavius</hi>'s Promiſe, but hints to him the uncertainty of Human Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Glory: All was taken in good part by that Wiſe Prince: At laſt effectual Orders were given: About this time, he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd that admirable Poem, which is ſet firſt, out of reſpect to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar;</hi> for he does not ſeem either to have had leiſure, or to have been in the Humour of making ſo ſolemn an Acknowledgment, 'till he was poſſeſs'd of the Benefit. And now he was in ſo great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Intereſt, that he reſolved to give up his Land to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and himſelf to the Court. His Paſtorals were in ſuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, that <hi>Pollio,</hi> now again in high Favour with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> deſir'd him to reduce them into a Volume. Some Modern Writer, that has a conſtant flux of Verſe, would ſtand amaz'd how <hi>Virgil</hi> could employ three whole Years in reviſing five or ſix hundred Verſes, moſt of which, probably, were made ſome time before; but there is more reaſon to wonder how he could do it ſo ſoon in ſuch Perfection. A courſe Stone is preſently faſhion'd; but a Diamond, of not many Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats, is many Weeks in Cutting, and in Poliſhing many more. He who put <hi>Virgil</hi> upon this, had a Politick good end in it.</p>
                  <p>The continu'd Civil Wars had laid <hi>Italy</hi> almoſt waſte; the Ground was Uncultivated and Unſtock'd; upon which enſu'd ſuch a Famine, and Inſurrection, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> hardly ſcap'd being Ston'd at <hi>Rome;</hi> his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition being look'd upon by all Parties as the principal occaſion of it. He ſet himſelf therefore with great Induſtry to promote <hi>Country-Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements;</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> was ſerviceable to his Deſign, as the good keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Bees, <hi>Georg.</hi> 4.</p>

                     <hi>Caeſar</hi> having now Vanquiſh'd <hi>Sextus Pompeius,</hi> a Spring-tide of Proſperities breaking in upon him, before he was ready to receive them as he ought, fell ſick of the <hi>Imperial Evil,</hi> the deſire of being thought ſomething more than Man. <hi>Ambition is an infinite Folly:</hi> When it has attain'd to the utmoſt pitch of <hi>Humane</hi> Greatneſs, it ſoon falls to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king pretenſions upon <hi>Heaven.</hi> The <hi>crafty Livia</hi> would needs be drawn in the Habit of a <hi>Prieſteſſe</hi> by the Shrine of the new God: And this became a Faſhion not to be diſpens'd with amongſt the Ladies: The Devotion was wondrous great amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> for it was their Intereſt, and, which ſometimes avails more, it was the <hi>Mode. Virgil,</hi> tho' he deſpis'd the Heathen Superſtitions, and is ſo bold as to call <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Janus,</hi> by no better a Name than that of <hi>Old Men,</hi> and might deſerve the Title of <hi>Subverter</hi> of Superſtitions, as well as <hi>Varro,</hi> thought fit to follow the <hi>Maxim</hi> of <hi>Plato</hi> his Maſter; that every one ſhould ſerve the Gods after the Uſage of his own Country, and therefore was not the laſt to preſent his Incenſe, which was of too <hi>Rich</hi> a Compoſition for <hi>ſuch</hi> an <hi>Altar:</hi> And by his Addreſs to <hi>Caeſar</hi> on this occaſion, made an unhappy Precedent to <hi>Lucan</hi> and other Poets which came after him, <hi>Geor.</hi> 1. and 3. And this Poem being now in great forwardneſs, <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who in imitation of his Predeceſſor <hi>Julius,</hi> never intermitted his Studies in the Camp, and much leſs in other places, refreſhing himſelf by a ſhort ſtay in a pleaſant Village of <hi>Campania,</hi> would needs be entertained with the rehearſal of ſome part of it. <hi>Virgil</hi> recited with a marvellous <hi>Grace,</hi> and ſweet Accent of Voice, but his Lungs failing him, <hi>Mecaenas</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſupplied his place for what remained. Such a piece of condecenſion wou'd now be very ſurprizing, but it was no more than cuſtomary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Friends, when Learning paſs'd for Quality. <hi>Lelius,</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Man of <hi>Rome</hi> in his time, had done as much for that Poet, out of whoſe Droſs he would ſometimes pick Gold; as himſelf ſaid, when one found him reading <hi>Ennius:</hi> (the like he did by ſome Verſes of <hi>Varro,</hi> and <hi>Pacuvius, Lucretius,</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> which he inſerted into his Works.) But Learned Men then liv'd eaſy and familiarly with the great: <hi>Auguſtus</hi> himſelf would ſometimes ſit down betwixt <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> and ſay jeaſtingly, that he ſate betwixt Sighing and Tears, allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Aſthma of one, and Rheumatick Eyes of the other; he would frequently Correſpond with them, and never leave a Letter of theirs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered: Nor were they under the conſtraint of formal Superſcriptions in the beginning, nor of violent Superlatives at the cloſe of their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: The invention of theſe is a Modern Refinement. <hi>In which this may be remarked, in paſſing, that (humble Servant) is reſpect, but (Friend) an affront, which notwithſtanding implies the former, and a great deal more.</hi> Nor does true Greatneſs loſe by ſuch Familiarity; and thoſe who have it not, as <hi>Mecaenas</hi> and <hi>Pollio</hi> had, are not to be accounted Proud, but rather very Diſcreet, in their Reſerves. Some Play-houſe Beauties do wiſely to be ſeen at a diſtance, and to have the Lamps twinckle betwixt them and the Spectators.</p>
                  <p>But now <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who tho' he were none of the greateſt Souldiers, was certainly the greateſt Traveller, of a Prince, that had ever
<pb facs="tcp:43031:9"/>
been, (for which <hi>Virgil</hi> ſo dexterouſly Complements him, <hi>Aeneid.</hi> 6.) takes a Voyage to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and having happily finiſh'd that War, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that mighty Kingdom into the Form of a Province; over which he appointed <hi>Gallus</hi> his Lieutenant. This is the ſame Perſon to whom <hi>Virgil</hi> addreſſes his Tenth Paſtoral; changing, in compliance to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, his purpoſe of limiting them to the number of the Muſes. The Praiſes of this <hi>Gallus</hi> took up a conſiderable part of the Fourth Book of the <hi>Georgics,</hi> according to the general conſent of Antiquity: But <hi>Caeſar</hi> would have it put out, and yet the Seam in the Poem is ſtill to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd; and the matter of <hi>Ariſtaeus</hi>'s recovering his Bees, might have been diſpatched in leſs compaſs, without fetching the Cauſes ſo far, or intereſſing ſo many Gods and Goddeſſes in <hi>that</hi> Affair. Perhaps ſome Readers may be inclin'd to think this, tho' very much labour'd, not the moſt entertaining part of that Work; ſo hard it is for the greateſt Maſters to Paint againſt their Inclination. But <hi>Caeſar</hi> was content he ſhou'd be mention'd in the laſt Paſtoral, becauſe it might be taken for a Satyrical ſort of Commendation; and the Character he there ſtands under, might help to excuſe his Cruelty, in putting an Old Servant to death for no very great Crime.</p>

                     <hi>Caeſar,</hi> about this time, either cloy'd with Glory, or terrifi'd by the Example of his Predeceſſor; or to gain the Credit of Moderation with the People, or poſſibly to feel the Pulſe of his Friends, delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whether he ſhould retain the Soveraign Power, or reſtore the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who was a very honeſt Man, but whoſe View was of no great extent, advis'd him to the latter; but <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> who had throughly ſtudied his Maſter's Temper, in an Eloquent Oration, gave contrary Advice. That Emperour was too Politick to commit the over-ſight of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> in a deliberation ſomething reſembling this. <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> had never been more deſirous of the <hi>Power,</hi> than he was afterwards of the Title of King: And there was nothing, in which the Heads of the Parties, who were all his Creatures, would not comply with him: But by too vehement Allegation of Arguments againſt it, he, who had out-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted every body beſides, at laſt out-witted himſelf, by too deep diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For his Council, thinking to make their Court by aſſenting to his judgment, voted unanimouſly <hi>for him</hi> againſt <hi>his Inclination;</hi> which ſurpriz'd and troubled him to ſuch a degree, that as ſoon as he had got into his Coach, he fell into a Swoon. But <hi>Caeſar</hi> knew his People better, and his Council being thus divided, he ask'd <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Advice: Thus a Poet had the Honour of determining the greateſt Point that ever was in Debate, betwixt the Son-in-Law, and Favourite of <hi>Caeſar. Virgil</hi> deliver'd his Opinion in Words to this effect. <hi>The change of a Popular into an Abſolute Government, has generally been of very ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence: For betwixt the Hatred of the People, and Injuſtice of the Prince, it of neceſſity comes to paſs that they live in diſtruſt, and mutual Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. But if the Commons knew a juſt Perſon, whom they entirely conſided in, it would be for the advantage of all Parties, that ſuch a one ſhould be their Soveraign: Wherefore if you ſhall continue to adminiſter Juſtice impartially, as hitherto you have done, your Power will prove ſafe to your ſelf, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial</hi>

                  <p>And now <hi>Virgil</hi> proſecutes his <hi>Aeneis,</hi> which had Anciently the Title of the <hi>Imperial Poem,</hi> or <hi>Roman Hiſtory,</hi> and deſervedly; for though he were too Artful a Writer to ſet down Events in exact Hiſtorical order, for which <hi>Lucan</hi> is juſtly blam'd; yet are all the moſt conſiderable Affairs and Perſons of <hi>Rome</hi> compriz'd in this Poem.

After this, he touches promiſcuouſly the moſt remarkable Occurrences at home and abroad, but inſiſts more particularly upon the Exploits of <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> inſomuch, that tho' this Aſſertion may appear, at firſt, a little ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing; he has in his Works deduc'd the Hiſtory of a conſiderable part of the World from its <hi>Original,</hi> thro' the <hi>Fabulous</hi> and <hi>Heroick</hi> Ages, thro' the <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the ſpace of four Thouſand Years, down to within leſs than Forty of our Saviour's time, of whom he has preſerv'd a moſt Illuſtrious Prophecy.

of making Peace and War, is preſerv'd in this Poem. <hi>Rome</hi> is ſtill above ground, and flouriſhing in <hi>Virgil.</hi> And all this he does with admirable brevity. The <hi>Aeneis</hi> was once near twenty times bigger than he left it; ſo that he ſpent as much time in blotting out, as ſome Moderns have done in Writing whole Volumes. But not one Book has his finiſhing Strokes: The ſixth ſeems one of the moſt perfect, the which, after long entreaty, and ſometimes threats of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> he was at laſt prevail'd upon to recite: This fell out about four Years before his own Death: That of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> whom <hi>Caeſar</hi> deſign'd for his Succeſſor, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd a little before this Recital: <hi>Virgil</hi> therefore with his uſual dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, inſerted his Funeral Panegyrick in thoſe admirable Lines, beginning,

                        <l>

His Mother, the Excellent <hi>Octavia,</hi> the <hi>beſt Wife of the worſt Husband that ever was,</hi> to divert her Grief, would be of the Auditory. The Poet artificially deferr'd the naming <hi>Marcellus,</hi> 'till their Paſſions were rais'd to the higheſt; but the mention of it put both Her and <hi>Auguſtus</hi> into ſuch a Paſſion of weeping, that they commanded him to proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Virgil</hi> anſwer'd, that he had already ended that Paſſage. Some relate, that <hi>Octavia</hi> fainted away; but afterwards ſhe preſented the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et with two Thouſand one Hundred Pounds, odd Money; a round Sum for Twenty Seven Verſes. Another Writer ſays, that with a Royal Magnificence, ſhe order'd him Maſſy Plate, unweigh'd, to a great value.</p>
                  <p>And now he took up a Reſolution of Travelling into <hi>Greece,</hi> there to ſet the laſt Hand to this Work; purpoſing to devote the reſt of his Life to Philoſophy, which had been always his principal Paſſion. He juſtly thought it a fooliſh Figure for a grave Man to be over-taken by Death, whilſt he was weighing the Cadence of Words, and meaſuring Verſes; unleſs Neceſſity ſhould conſtrain it, from which he was well ſecur'd by the liberality of that I earned Age. But he was not aware, that whilſt he allotted three Years for the Reviſing of his Poem, he drew Bills upon a <hi>failing Bank:</hi> For unhappily meeting <hi>Auguſtus</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> he thought himſelf oblig'd to wait upon him into <hi>Italy,</hi> but being deſirous to ſee all he could of the <hi>Greek</hi> Antiquities, he fell into a languiſhing Diſtemper at <hi>Megara;</hi> this, neglected at firſt, prov'd Mortal. The agitation of the Veſſel, for it was now <hi>Autumn,</hi> near the time of his Birth, brought him ſo low, that he could hardly reach <hi>Brindiſi.</hi> In his Sickneſs he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with great importunity, call'd for his Scrutore, that he might Burn his <hi>Aeneis,</hi> but <hi>Auguſtus</hi> interpoſing by his Royal Authority, he made his laſt Will, of which ſomething ſhall be ſaid afterwards. And conſidering probably how much <hi>Homer</hi> had been disfigur'd by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Compilers of his Works, oblig'd <hi>Tucca</hi> and <hi>Varius</hi> to add nothing, nor ſo much as fill up the Breaks he left in his Poem. He order'd that his Bones ſhould be carried to <hi>Naples,</hi> in which place he had paſs'd the moſt agreeable part of his Life. <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> not only as Executor, and Friend, but according to the Duty of the <hi>Pont.

                  <p>His Sicklineſs, Studies, and the Troubles he met with, made his Hair gray before the uſual time; he had an heſitation in his Speech, as many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Men: It being rarely found that a very fluent Elocution, and depth of judgment meet in the ſame Perſon. His Aſpect and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ruſtick, and ungraceful: And this defect was not likely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify'd in the place where he firſt liv'd, nor afterwards, becauſe the weakneſs of his Stomach would not permit him to uſe his Exerciſes; he was frequently troubled with the Head-ach, and ſpitting of Blood; ſpare of Dyet, and hardly drank any Wine. Baſhful to a fault; and when People crouded to ſee him, he would ſlip into the next Shop, or by-paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, to avoid them. As this Character could not recommend him to the fair Sex; he ſeems to have as little conſideration for them as <hi>Euripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> himſelf. There is hardly the Character of one good Woman to be found in his Poems: He uſes the Word <hi>[Mulier]</hi> but once in the whole <hi>Aeneis,</hi> then too by way of Contempt, rendring literally a piece of a Verſe out of <hi>Homer.</hi> In his Paſtorals he is full of invectives againſt Love: In the <hi>Georgics</hi> he appropriates all the <hi>rage</hi> of <hi>it</hi> to the Females. He makes <hi>Dido,</hi> who never deſerv'd that Character, Luſtful and Revengeful to the utmoſt degree; ſo as to dye devoting her Lover to deſtruction; ſo <hi>changeable,</hi> that the <hi>Deſtinies</hi> themſelves could not fix the time of her Death. But <hi>Iris,</hi> the Emblem of <hi>Inconſtancy,</hi> muſt determine it. Her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is ſomething worſe.

                     <hi>Virgil</hi> is ſo far from this complaiſant Humour, that his <hi>Heroe</hi> falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an unmanly and ill-tim'd deliberation, whether he ſhould not kill her in a Church; which directly contradicts what <hi>Deiphobus</hi> ſays of her, <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neid</hi> 6. in that place where every body tells the truth. He transfers the dogged Silence of <hi>Ajax</hi> his Ghoſt, to that of <hi>Dido;</hi> tho' that be no very natural Character to an injur'd Lover, or a Woman. He brings in the <hi>Trojan</hi> Matrons ſetting their own Fleet on Fire; and running after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, like Witches on their <hi>Sabbat,</hi> into the Woods. He beſtows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome Ornaments upon the Character of <hi>Camilla;</hi> but ſoon abates his Favour, by calling her <hi>aſpera &amp; horrenda Virgo:</hi> He places her in the Front of the line for an ill Omen of the Battel, as one of the Ancients has obſerv'd; (we may obſerve, on this occaſion, it is an Art peculiar to <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> to intimate the Event by ſome preceding Accident.) He hardly ever deſcribes the riſing of the Sun, but with ſome circumſtance which fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignifies the Fortune of the Day. For inſtance, when <hi>Aeneas</hi> leaves <hi>Africa</hi> and Queen <hi>Dido,</hi> he thus deſcribes the fatal Morning:
<q>
                        <l>Tithoni croceum linguens Aurora cubile.</l>
                     </q>
[And for the Remark, we ſtand indebted to the curious Pencil of <hi>Pollio.]</hi> The <hi>Mourning Fields (Aeneid.</hi> 6.) are crowded with Ladies of a loſt Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
<pb facs="tcp:43031:12"/>
Hardly one Man gets admittance, and that is <hi>Caeneus,</hi> for a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Reaſon. <hi>Latinus</hi> his Queen is turbulent, and ungovernable, and at laſt hangs her ſelf: And the fair <hi>Lavinia</hi> is diſobedient to the Oracle, and to the King, and looks a little flickering after <hi>Turnus.</hi> I wonder at this the more, becauſe <hi>Livy</hi> repreſents her as an excellent Perſon, and who behav'd her ſelf with great Wiſdom in her Regency during the minority of her Son: So that the Poet has done her Wrong, and it reflects on her Poſterity. His Goddeſſes make as ill a Figure; <hi>Juno</hi> is always in a rage, and the Fury of Heaven: <hi>Venus</hi> grows ſo unreaſonably confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as to ask her Husband to forge Arms for her Baſtard Son; which were enough to provoke one of a more Phlegmatick Temper than <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> was. Notwithſtanding all this raillery of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s, he was certainly of a very Amorous diſpoſition, and has deſcrib'd all that is moſt delicate in the Paſſion of Love; but he Conquer'd his natural Inclinations by the help of Philoſophy; and refin'd it into Friendſhip, to which he was extreamly ſenſible. The Reader will admit of or reject the following Conjecture, with the free leave of the Writer, who will be equally pleas'd either way. <hi>Virgil</hi> had too great an Opinion of the Influence of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bodies: An Ancient Writer ſays, that he was born under the Sign of <hi>Virgo,</hi> with which Nativity perhaps he pleas'd himſelf, and would exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie her <hi>Vertues</hi> in his Life. Perhaps it was thence that he took his Name of <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Parthenias,</hi> which does not neceſſarily ſignifie <hi>Baſe-born. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus,</hi> and <hi>Servius,</hi> very good Grammarians, give a quite contrary ſenſe of it. He ſeems to make alluſion to this Original of his Name in that Paſſage,
<q>
                        <l>Illo Virgilium me tempore dulcis alebat,</l>
                        <l>Parthenope.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this may ſerve to illuſtrate his Complement to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in which he invites him into his own Conſtellation,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Where, in the void of Heaven, a place is free,</hi>

                        <l>
                           <hi>Betwixt the</hi> Scorpion, <hi>and the</hi> Maid <hi>for thee.</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>
Thus placing him betwixt Juſtice and Power, and in a Neighbour Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his own; for <hi>Virgil</hi> ſuppos'd Souls to aſcend again to their <hi>proper Stars.</hi> Being therefore of this Humour, it is no wonder that he refus'd the Embraces of the Beautiful <hi>Plotia,</hi> when his indiſcreet Friend almoſt threw her into his Arms.</p>
                  <p>But however he ſtood affected to the Ladies, there is a dreadful Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation brought againſt him for the moſt unnatural of all Vices, which by the Malignity of Humane nature has found more Credit in latter times than it did near his own. This took not its riſe ſo much from the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis,</hi> in which Paſtoral there is not one immodeſt Word; as from a ſort of ill-nature, that will not let any one be without the imputation of ſome Vice; and principally becauſe he was ſo ſtrict a follower of <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> and <hi>Plato.</hi> In order therefore to his Vindication, I ſhall take the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little higher.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cretans</hi> were Anciently much addicted to Navigation, inſomuch that it became A <hi>Greek</hi> Proverb, (tho' omitted, I think, by the Induſtrious <hi>Eraſmus,)</hi> A <hi>Cretan that does not know the Sea.</hi> Their Neighbourhood gave them occaſion of frequent Commerce with the <hi>Phaenicians,</hi> that accurſed People, who infected the <hi>Weſtern</hi> World with endleſs Superſtitions, and groſs immoralities. From them it is probable, that the <hi>Cretans</hi> learn'd this infamous Paſſion, to which they were ſo much addicted, that <hi>Cicero</hi> remarks, in his Book <hi>de Rep.</hi> that it was <hi>a diſgrace for a young Gentleman to be without Lovers. Socrates,</hi> who was a great Admirer of the <hi>Cretan</hi> Conſtitutions, ſet his excellent Wit to find out ſome good Cauſe, and Uſe of this Evil Inclination, and therefore gives an Account, wherefore
<pb facs="tcp:43031:12"/>
Beauty is to be lov'd, in the following Paſſage; for I will not trouble the Reader, weary perhaps already with a long <hi>Greek</hi> Quotation. <hi>There is but one Eternal, Immutable, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niform Beauty; in contemplation of which, our Soveraign Happineſs does conſiſt: And therefore a true Lover conſiders Beauty and Proportion as ſo many Steps and Degrees, by which he may aſcend from the particular to the general, from all that is lovely of Feature, or regular in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or charming in Sound, to the general Fountain of all Beauty and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And if you are ſo much tranſported with the ſight of Beautiful Perſons, as to wiſh neither to Eat or drink, but paſs your whole Life in looking on them; to what extaſie would it raiſe you to behold the Original Beauty, not fill'd up with Fleſh and Blood, or varniſh'd with a fading mixture of Colours, and the reſt of Mortal Trifles and Fooleries, but ſeparate, unmix'd, uniform, and divine,</hi> &amp;c. Thus far <hi>Socrates,</hi> in a ſtrain, much beyond the <hi>Socrate Cre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tien</hi> of Mr. <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac:</hi> And thus that admirable Man lov'd his <hi>Phoedon,</hi> his <hi>Charmides,</hi> and <hi>Theatetus;</hi> and thus <hi>Virgil</hi> lov'd his <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Cebes,</hi> under the feign'd Name of <hi>Alexis:</hi> He receiv'd them illiterate, but return'd them to their <hi>Maſters,</hi> the one a good Poet, and the other an excellent Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian: And to prevent all poſſible Miſinterpretations, he warily inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the livelieſt <hi>Epiſode</hi> in the whole <hi>Aeneis,</hi> theſe words,
<q>
                        <l>Niſus amore pio pueri.</l>
                     </q>
And in the Sixth, <hi>Quique pii vates.</hi> He feems fond of the Words, <hi>caſtus, pius, Virgo,</hi> and the Compounds of it; and ſometimes ſtretches the Uſe of that word further than one would think he reaſonably ſhould have done, as when he attributes it to <hi>Paſiphaé</hi> her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Another Vice he is Tax'd with, is Avarice; becauſe he dy'd Rich, and ſo indeed he did in compariſon of modern Wealth; his Eſtate amounts to near Seventy Five Thouſand Pounds of our Money: But <hi>Donatus</hi> does not take notice of this as a thing extraordinary; nor was it eſteem'd ſo great a Matter, when the Caſh of a great part of the World lay at <hi>Rome; Antony</hi> himſelf beſtow'd at once Two Thouſand Acres of Land in one of the beſt Provinces of <hi>Italy,</hi> upon a ridiculous Poet, who is nam'd by <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> A late Cardinal us'd to purchaſe ill flattery at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of 100000 Crowns a Year. But beſides <hi>Virgil</hi>'s other Benefactors, he was much in favour with <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> whoſe Bounty to him had no limits, but ſuch as the Modeſty of <hi>Virgil</hi> preſcrib'd to it. Before he had made his own Fortune, he ſetled his Eſtate upon his Parents and Brothers; ſent them Yearly large Sums, ſo that they liv'd in great Plenty and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; and at his Death, divided his Eſtate betwixt <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Gratitude,</hi> leaving one half to his Relations, and the other to <hi>Mecenas,</hi> to <hi>Tucca</hi> and <hi>Varius,</hi> and a conſiderable Legacy to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who had introduc'd a politick Faſhion of being in every bodies Will; which alone was a fair Revenue for a Prince. <hi>Virgil</hi> ſhews his deteſtation of this Vice, by pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the front of the Damn'd thoſe who did not relieve their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Friends; for the <hi>Romans</hi> hardly ever extended their Liberality further; and therefore I do not remember to have met in all the <hi>Latin</hi> Poets, one Character ſo noble as that ſhort one in <hi>Homer.</hi>

Counteſs of <hi>C.</hi> was the <hi>Helen of her Country.</hi> There is nothing in Pagan Philoſophy more true, more juſt, and regular than <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Ethics;</hi> and it is hardly poſſible to ſit down to the ſerious peruſual of his Works, but a Man ſhall riſe more diſpos'd to virtue and goodneſs, as well as moſt agreeably entertain'd.

Thus was his <hi>Life</hi> as chaſt as his <hi>Stile,</hi> and thoſe who can Critick his <hi>Poetry,</hi> can never find a blemiſh in his <hi>Manners;</hi> and one would rather wiſh to have that <hi>purity</hi> of <hi>Mind,</hi> which the Satyriſt himſelf attributes to him; that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſition, and evenneſs of temper, and patience, which he was Maſter of in ſo eminent a degree, than to have the honour of being Author of the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> or even of the <hi>Georgics</hi> themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Having therefore ſo little reliſh for the uſual amuſements of the world, he proſecuted his Studies without any conſiderable interruption, during the whole courſe of his Life, which one may reaſonably conjecture to have been ſomething longer than 52 years; and therefore it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he became the moſt general Scholar that <hi>Rome</hi> ever bred, unleſs ſome one ſhould except <hi>Varro.</hi> Beſides the exact knowledge of Rural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, he underſtood Medicine, to which Profeſſion he was deſign'd by his Parents.

                     <hi>PREFACE TO THE PASTORALS, With a ſhort DEFENCE of VIRGIL, Againſt ſome of the Reflections of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> Fontanelle.</head>
                  <p>AS the Writings of greateſt Antiquity are in Verſe, ſo of all ſorts of Poetry, <hi>Paſtorals</hi> ſeem the moſt Ancient; being form'd upon the Model of the Firſt <hi>Innocence,</hi> and <hi>Simplicity,</hi> which the Moderns, better to diſpence themſelves from imitating, have wiſely thought fit to treat as <hi>Fabulous,</hi> and <hi>impracticable;</hi> and yet they, by obeying the <hi>unſophiſticated</hi> Dictates of Nature, enjoy'd the moſt valuable Bleſſings of Life; a vigorous Health of Body, with a conſtant ſerenity, and freedom of Mind, whilſt we, with all our fanciful Refinements, can ſcarcely paſs an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn without ſome acceſs of a Feaver, or a whole Day, not ruffled by ſome unquiet Paſſion. He was not then look'd upon as a very Old Man; who reach'd to a greater Number of Years, than in theſe times an ancient Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can reaſonably pretend to; and we know the Names of ſeveral, who ſaw, and practis'd the World for a longer ſpace of time, than we can read the Account of in any one entire Body of Hiſtory. In ſhort, they invented the moſt uſeful Arts, <hi>Paſtorage, Tillage, Geometry, Writing, Muſick, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomy,</hi> &amp;c. Whilst the Moderns, like Extravagant Heirs, made rich by their Induſtry, ingratefully deride the good Old <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> who left them the <hi>Eſtate.</hi> It is not therefore to be wonder'd at, that <hi>Paſtorals</hi> are fallen into Diſeſteem, together with that Faſhion of Life, upon which they were grounded. And methinks, I ſee the Reader already uneaſie at this Part of <hi>Virgil,</hi> counting the Pages, and poſting to the <hi>Aeneis;</hi> ſo delightful an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment is the very Relation of publick Miſchief, and ſlaughter, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to Mankind: and yet <hi>Virgil</hi> paſs'd a much different judgment on his own Works: He valu'd moſt this part, and his <hi>Georgics,</hi> and depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them for his Reputation with Poſterity: But Cenſures himſelf in one of his Letters to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> for medling with <hi>Heroics,</hi> the Invention of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating Age. This is the Reaſon that the Rules of <hi>Paſtoral,</hi> are ſo little known or ſtudied. <hi>Ariſtotle, Horace,</hi> and the <hi>Eſſay of Poetry,</hi> take no notice of it. And Mr. <hi>Boileau,</hi> one of the moſt accurate of the Moderns, becauſe he never loſes the Ancients out of his Sight, beſtows ſcarce half a Page on it.
<pb facs="tcp:43031:14"/>
It is the Deſign therefore of the few following pages, to clear this ſort of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from vulgar Prejudices; to vindicate our Author from ſome unjuſt Imputations; to look into ſome of the Rules of this ſort of Poetry, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what ſort of Verſification is moſt proper for it, in which point we are ſo much inferiour to the Ancients; that this Conſideration alone, were enough to make ſome Writers think as they ought, that is, <hi>Meanly,</hi> of their own Performances.</p>
                  <p>As all ſorts of Poetry conſiſt in imitation; Paſtoral is the <hi>imitation of a Shepherd conſider'd under that Character:</hi> It is requiſite therefore to be a little inform'd of the Condition, and Qualification of theſe Shepherds.</p>
                  <p>One of the Ancients has obſerv'd truly, but Satyrically enough, that <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is the Meaſure of every thing:</hi> And thus by a gradual improvement of this miſtake, we come to make our own <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Countrey</hi> the Rule and <hi>Standard</hi> of others, and our ſelves at laſt the meaſure of them <hi>all.</hi> We figure the Ancient Countrey-men like our own, leading a painful Life in Poverty and Contempt, without Wit, or Courage, or Education: But Men had quite different Notions of theſe things, for the firſt four Thouſand Years of the World; Health and Strength were then in more eſteem than the refinements of Pleaſure; and it was accounted a great deal more Honourable to Till the Ground, or keep a Flock of Sheep, than to diſſolve in Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and effeminating Sloath. Hunting has now an Idea of Quality join'd to it, and is become the moſt important Buſineſs in the Life of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; Antiently it was quite otherways. Mr. <hi>Fleury</hi> has ſeverely remark'd, that this Extravagant Paſſion for Hunting is a ſtrong Proof of our <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic</hi> Extraction, and ſhews an affinity of Humour with the Savage <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans.</hi> The Barbarous <hi>Franks</hi> and other <hi>Germans,</hi> (having neither Corn, nor Wine of their own growth,) when they paſs'd the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and poſſeſs'd themſelves of Countreys better Cultivated, left the Tillage of the Land to the Old Proprietors; and afterwards did hazard their Lives as freely for their <hi>Diverſion,</hi> as they had done before for their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſubſiſtance. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> gave this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage the <hi>Sacred ſtamp</hi> of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,</hi> and from hence it is that moſt of our Terms of Hunting are <hi>French.</hi> The Reader will, I hope, give me his Pardon for my freedom on this Subject, ſince an ill Accident, occaſion'd by Hunting, has kept <hi>England</hi> in pain, theſe ſeveral Months together, for one of the <hi>beſt,</hi> and <hi>greateſt Peers</hi> which ſhe has bred for ſome Ages; no leſs Illuſtrious for <hi>Civil Vertues,</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> than his <hi>Anceſtors</hi> were for all their Victories in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there are ſome Prints ſtill left of the Ancient Eſteem for Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry and their plain Faſhion of Life in many of our Sir-Names, and in the <hi>Eſcutcheons</hi> of the moſt Ancient Families, even thoſe of the greateſt Kings, the <hi>Roſes,</hi> the <hi>Lillies,</hi> the <hi>Thiſtle, &amp;c.</hi> It is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, that one of the principal Cauſes of the Depoſing of <hi>Mahomet</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> was, that he would not allot part of the Day to ſome manual Labour, according to the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and Ancient Practice of his Predeceſſors. He that reflects on this will be the leſs ſurpriz'd to find that <hi>Charlemaign</hi> Eight Hundred Years ago, order'd his Children to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in ſome Profeſſion. And Eight Hundred Years yet higher, that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> wore no Cloaths but ſuch as were made by the Hands of the Empreſs, and her Daughters; and <hi>Olympias</hi> did the ſame for <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. Nor will he wonder that the <hi>Romans,</hi> in great exigency, ſent for their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator from the Plow, whoſe whole Eſtate was but of Four Acres; too little a ſpot now for the Orchard, or Kitchin-Garden of a <hi>Private Gentleman.</hi> It is commonly known, that the Founders of three the moſt renown'd Monarchies in the World, were Shepherds: And the Subject of Husbandry has been adorn'd
<pb facs="tcp:43031:14"/>
by the <hi>Writings</hi> and <hi>Labour</hi> of more than twenty <hi>Kings.</hi> It ought not therefore to be matter of ſurprize to a Modern Writer, that Kings, the <hi>Shepherds</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> laid down their firſt <hi>Rudiments</hi> in tending their <hi>mute Subjects;</hi> nor that the Wealth of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> conſiſted in Flocks and Herds, the Intendants over which, were then in equal eſteem with Officers of State in latter times. And therefore <hi>Eumaeus</hi> is call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in <hi>Homer;</hi> not ſo much becauſe <hi>Homer</hi> was a lover of a Countrey Life, to which he rather ſeems averſe, but by reaſon of the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Greatneſs of his Truſt, and becauſe he was the Son of a <hi>King,</hi> ſtollen away, and Sold by the <hi>Phaenician</hi> Pyrates, which the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> ſeems not to have taken notice of. Nor will it ſeem ſtrange, that the Maſter of the Horſe to King <hi>Latinus,</hi> in the Ninth <hi>Aeneid,</hi> was found in the homely Employment of cleaving Blocks, when news of the firſt Skirmiſh betwixt the <hi>Trojans</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> was brought to him.</p>
                  <p>Being therefore of ſuch Quality, they cannot be ſuppos'd ſo very <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> and <hi>unpoliſh'd;</hi> the Learning and good breeding of the World was then in the hands of ſuch People. He who was choſen by the conſent of all Parties to <hi>arbitrate</hi> ſo delicate an affair, as which was the <hi>faireſt</hi> of the three <hi>Celebrated Beauties</hi> of <hi>Heaven;</hi> he who had the addreſs to debauch away <hi>Helen</hi> from her <hi>Husband,</hi> her Native <hi>Country,</hi> and from a <hi>Crown,</hi> underſtood what the <hi>French</hi> call by the too ſoft name of <hi>Gallantry;</hi> he had Accompliſhments enough, how ill uſe ſoever he made of them. It ſeems therefore that Mr. <hi>F.</hi> had not duly conſider'd the matter, when he reflected ſo ſeverely upon <hi>Virgil,</hi> as if he had not obſerv'd the Laws of <hi>decency</hi> in his <hi>Paſtorals,</hi> in making Shepherds ſpeak to things <hi>beſide</hi> their <hi>Character,</hi> and <hi>above</hi> their Capacity. He <hi>ſtands amaz'd that Shepherds ſhould thunder out, as he expreſſes himſelf, the formation of the World, and that too according to the Syſtem of</hi> Epicurus. In truth, <hi>ſays he, page 176. I cannot tell what to make of this whole piece; (the Sixth</hi> Paſt.) <hi>I can neither comprehend the Deſign of the Author, nor the Connexion of the parts; firſt come the Ideas of Philoſophy, and preſently after thoſe incoherent Fables,</hi> &amp;c. To expoſe him yet more, he ſubjoyns, <hi>it is</hi> Silenus <hi>himſelf who makes all this abſurd Diſcourſe.</hi> Virgil <hi>ſays in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that he had drank too much the day before; perhaps the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch hung in his head when he compos'd this Poem,</hi> &amp;c. Thus far Mr. <hi>F.</hi> who, to the diſgrace of Reaſon, as himſelf ingenuouſly owns, firſt built his Houſe, and then ſtudied <hi>Architecture;</hi> I mean firſt Compos'd his <hi>Eclogues,</hi> and then ſtudied the Rules. In anſwer to this, we may obſerve, firſt, that this very <hi>Paſtoral</hi> which he ſingles out to triumph over, was recited by a Famous Player on the <hi>Roman</hi> Theatre, with marvellous applauſe; inſomuch that <hi>Cicero</hi> who had heard part of it only, order'd the whole to be rehears'd, and ſtruck with admiration of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd then upon <hi>Virgil</hi> the Glorious Title of
<q>Magnae ſpes alterae Romae.</q>
Nor is it Old <hi>Donatus</hi> only who relates this, we have the ſame account from another very Credible and Ancient Author; ſo that here we have the judgment of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> to confront the ſingle Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of this adventrous Critick. A Man ought to be well aſſur'd of his own Abilities, before he attack an Author of <hi>eſtabliſh'd</hi> Reputation. If Mr. <hi>F.</hi> had perus'd the fragments of the <hi>Phaenician</hi> Antiquity, trac'd the progreſs of Learning thro' the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Writers, or ſo much as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted his Learned Countrey-Man <hi>Huetius,</hi> he would have found, (which
<pb facs="tcp:43031:15"/>
falls out unluckily for him) that a <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Shepherd diſcover'd to the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> the <hi>Creation of the World.</hi> And what Subject more fit for ſuch a <hi>Paſtoral,</hi> than that Great Affair which was firſt noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the World by one of that <hi>Profeſſion?</hi> Nor does it appear, (what he takes for granted) that <hi>Virgil</hi> deſcribes the Original of the World according to the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of <hi>Epicurus;</hi> he was too well ſeen in Antiquity to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch a groſs Miſtake; there is not the leaſt mention of <hi>Chance</hi> in that whole paſſage, nor of the <hi>Clinamen Principiorum,</hi> ſo peculiar to <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s <hi>Hypotheſis. Virgil</hi> had not only more Piety, but was of too nice a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to introduce a <hi>God</hi> denying the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> and ſinging a Hymn to the Atoms, and Blind Chance. On the contrary, his Deſcription agrees very well with that of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and the Learn'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator <hi>D'Acier,</hi> who is ſo confident that <hi>Horace</hi> had perus'd the Sacred Hiſtory, might with greater Reaſon have affirm'd the ſame thing of <hi>Virgil.</hi> For, beſides that Famous Paſſage in the Sixth <hi>Aeneid,</hi> (by which this may be illuſtrated,) where the word <hi>Principio</hi> is us'd in the front of both by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and the <hi>Seas</hi> are firſt mention'd, and the <hi>Spiritus intus alit,</hi> which might not improbably, as Mr. <hi>D'Acier</hi> would ſuggeſt, allude to the <hi>Spirit moving upon the face of the Waters;</hi> But omitting this paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel place, the <hi>ſucceſſive</hi> formation of the World is evidently deſcrib'd in theſe words,
<q>
                        <l>Rerum paulatim ſumere formas;</l>
                     </q>
And 'tis hardly poſſible to render more literally that verſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let the Waters be gathered into one place, and let the dry Land appear,</hi> than in this of <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Jam durare ſolum, &amp; diſcludere Nerea Ponto.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this the formation of the Sun is deſcrib'd (exactly in the <hi>Moſaical</hi> order,) and next the production of the firſt Living Creatures, and that too in a ſmall number, (ſtill in the ſame method.)</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Rara per ignotos errent animalia montes.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>And here the foreſaid Author would probably remark, that <hi>Virgil</hi> keeps more exactly to the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Syſtem, than an Ingenious Writer, who will by no means allow Mountains to be <hi>coaeval</hi> with the World. Thus much will make it probable at leaſt, that <hi>Virgil</hi> had <hi>Moſes</hi> in his thoughts rather than <hi>Epicurus,</hi> when he compos'd this Poem. But it is further remarkable, that this paſſage was taken from a Song attributed to <hi>Apollo,</hi> who himſelf too <hi>unluckily</hi> had been a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> and he took it from another yet more ancient, compos'd by the firſt <hi>Inventer</hi> of <hi>Muſick,</hi> and at that time a <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd</hi> too; and this is one of the Nobleſt Fragments of <hi>Greek</hi> Antiquity; and becauſe I cannot ſuppoſe the Ingenious Mr. <hi>F.</hi> one of their number, who pretend to cenſure the <hi>Greeks,</hi> without being able to diſtinguiſh <hi>Greek</hi> from <hi>Epheſian Characters,</hi> I ſhall here ſet down the Lines from which <hi>Virgil</hi> took this paſſage, tho' none of the Commentators have obſerv'd it.</p>

So that our Poet here with great Judgment, as always, follows the ancient Cuſtom of beginning their more Solemn Songs with the <hi>Creation,</hi> and does it too moſt <hi>properly</hi> under the perſon of a <hi>Shepherd;</hi> and thus <hi>the firſt and beſt Employment of Poetry was to compoſe Hymns in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Great Creator of the Univerſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Few words will ſuffice to anſwer his other Objections. He demands why thoſe ſeveral <hi>Transformations</hi> are mention'd in that <hi>Poem?</hi> And is not Fable then the Life and Subject of Poetry? Can himſelf aſſign a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Subject of <hi>Paſtoral,</hi> than the <hi>Saturnia Regna,</hi> the <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Scene</hi> of this kind of Poetry? What Theme more fit for the Song of a <hi>God,</hi> or to imprint Religious awe, than the Omnipotent Power of <hi>transforming</hi> the Species of Creatures at their pleaſure? Their Families liv'd in Groves, near clear Springs; and what better warning could be given to the hopeful young Shepherds, than that they ſhould not gaze too much into the Liquid dangerous Looking-glaſs, for fear of being <hi>ſtoln</hi> by the <hi>Water-Nymphs,</hi> that is, falling and being drown'd, as <hi>Hylas</hi> was? <hi>Paſiphea's</hi> monſtrous paſſion for a <hi>Bull,</hi> is certainly a Subject enough fitted for <hi>Bucolic's?</hi> Can Mr. <hi>F.</hi> Tax <hi>Silenus</hi> for fetching <hi>too far</hi> the Transformation of the Siſters of <hi>Phaeton</hi> into <hi>Trees,</hi> when perhaps they ſat at that very time under the hoſpitable ſhade of thoſe Alders or Poplars? Or the Metamorphoſes of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomela</hi> into that raviſhing Bird, which makes the ſweeteſt muſick of the <hi>Groves?</hi> If he had look'd into the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Writers, or ſo much as Conſulted honeſt <hi>Servius,</hi> he would have diſcover'd that under the Allegory of this <hi>drunkenneſs</hi> of <hi>Silenus,</hi> the refinement and <hi>exaltation</hi> of Mens <hi>Minds</hi> by <hi>Philoſophy</hi> was intended. But if the Author of theſe Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can take ſuch flights in his Wine, it is almoſt pity that drunkenneſs ſhou'd be a Sin, or that he ſhou'd ever want good ſtore of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Champaign.</hi> But indeed he ſeems not to have ever drank out of <hi>Silenus</hi> his Tankard, when he made either his <hi>Critique,</hi> or <hi>Paſtorals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Cenſure on the Fourth ſeems worſe grounded than the other; it is Entituled in ſome ancient Manuſcripts, The Hiſtory of the <hi>Renovation of the World;</hi> he complains <hi>that he cannot underſtand what is meant by thoſe many Figurative Expreſſions:</hi> But if he had conſulted the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>Voſſius</hi> his Diſſertation on this <hi>Paſtoral,</hi> or read the Excellent Oration of the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> made <hi>French</hi> by a good Pen of their own, he would have found there the plain inerpretation of all thoſe Figurative Expreſſions; and withall, very ſtrong proofs of the truth of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; ſuch as Converted Heathens, as <hi>Valerianus,</hi> and others: And upon account of this Piece, the moſt Learn'd of the Latin Fathers calls <hi>Virgil</hi> a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> even before <hi>Chriſtianity. Cicero</hi> takes notice of it in his Books of Divination, and <hi>Virgil</hi> probably had put it in Verſe a conſiderable time before the Edition of his <hi>Paſtorals.</hi> Nor does he appropriate it to <hi>Pollio,</hi> or <hi>his Son,</hi> but <hi>Complementally</hi> dates it from his Conſulſhip. And therefore ſome one who had not ſo kind thoughts of Mr. <hi>F.</hi> as I, would be inclin'd to think him as bad a <hi>Catholick</hi> as <hi>Critick</hi> in this place.</p>
                  <p>I paſs by, in reſpect therefore to ſome Books he has wrote ſince, a great part of this, and ſhall only touch briefly ſome of the Rules of this ſort of Poem.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:43031:16"/>
The Firſt is, that an air of Piety upon all occaſions ſhould be maintain'd in the whole Poem: This appears in all the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Writers; as <hi>Homer,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Virgil</hi> is ſo exact in the obſervation of it, not only in this Work, but in his <hi>Aeneis</hi> too, that a Celebrated <hi>French</hi> Writer taxes him for permitting <hi>Aeneas</hi> to do nothing without the aſſiſtance of ſome God. But by this it appears, at leaſt, that Mr. St. <hi>Eur.</hi> is no <hi>Janſeniſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſeems a little defective in this point; he brings in a pair of Shepherdeſſes diſputing very warmly, whether <hi>Victoria,</hi> (none of the fitteſt Names for a Shepherdeſs) be a <hi>Goddeſs,</hi> or a <hi>Woman.</hi> Her great conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion and compaſſion, her affability and goodneſs, none of the meaneſt Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of the Divinity, paſs for convincing Arguments that ſhe <hi>could not</hi> poſſibly be a Goddeſs.

In ſhort, ſhe has too many <hi>Divine Perfections</hi> to be a <hi>Deity,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe is a Mortal [which was the thing to be prov'd.] It is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the practice of all ancient Poets, as well as to the Rules of decency and Religion, to make ſuch odious Compariſons. I am much ſurpriz'd therefore that he ſhould uſe ſuch an argument as this.

But the <hi>Odyſſes</hi> are full of greater inſtances of condeſcenſion than this.</p>
                  <p>This brings to mind that Famous paſſage of <hi>Lucan,</hi> in which he prefers <hi>Cato</hi> to all the Gods at once,
<q>Victrix cauſa deis placuit ſed victa Catoni.</q>

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:43031:16"/>
But letting that paſs, this whole <hi>Eclogue</hi> is but a long Paraphraſe of a trite Verſe in <hi>Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Homer,</hi>
                     <q>Nec vox Hominem ſonat, O Dea certe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So true is that Remark of the Admirable E. of <hi>Roſcomon,</hi> if apply'd to the <hi>Romans,</hi> rather I fear than to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſince his own Death.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Another Rule is, that the Characters ſhould repreſent that Ancient Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and unpractis'd Plainneſs, which was then in the World. <hi>P. Rapine</hi> has gather'd many Inſtances of this out of <hi>Theocritus,</hi> and <hi>Virgil;</hi> and the Reader can do it as well himſelf. But Mr. <hi>F.</hi> tranſgreſs'd this Rule, when he hid himſelf in the Thicket, to liſten to the private Diſcourſe of the two Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſes. This is not only ill Breeding at <hi>Verſailles;</hi> the <hi>Arcadian Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſes</hi> themſelves would have ſet their Dogs upon one for ſuch an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable piece of Rudeneſs.</p>
                  <p>A Third Rule is, That there ſhould be ſome Ordonnance, ſome Deſign, or little Plot, which may deſerve the Title of a Paſtoral <hi>Scene.</hi> This is every where obſerv'd by <hi>Virgil,</hi> and particularly remarkable in the firſt <hi>Eclogue;</hi> the ſtandard of all Paſtorals; a Beautiful <hi>Landſcape</hi> preſents it ſelf to your view, a Shepherd with his Flock around him, reſting ſecurely under a ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beech, which furniſh'd the firſt Food to our Anceſtors. Another in quite different Situation of Mind and Circumſtances, the Sun ſetting, the Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the more fortunate Shepherd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And here Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſeems not a little wanting.</p>
                  <p>A Fourth Rule, and of great importance in this delicate ſort of Writing, is, that there be choice diverſity of Subjects; that the <hi>Eclogues,</hi> like a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Proſpect, ſhould Charm by its Variety. <hi>Virgil</hi> is admirable in this Point, and far ſurpaſſes <hi>Theocritus,</hi> as he does every where, when Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Contrivance have the principal part. The Subject of the firſt <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral</hi> is hinted above.</p>
                  <p>The Second contains the Love of <hi>Coridon</hi> for <hi>Alexis,</hi> and the ſeaſonable reproach he gives himſelf, that he left his Vines half prun'd, (which according to the <hi>Roman Rituals,</hi> deriv'd a Curſe upon the Fruit that grew upon it) whilſt he purſu'd an Object undeſerving his Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>The Third, a ſharp Contention of two Shepherds for the Prize of Poetry.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth contains the Diſcourſe of a Shepherd Comforting himſelf in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Age, that a better was enſuing.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth a Lamentation for a Dead Friend, the firſt draught of which is probably more Ancient than any of the Paſtorals now extant; his Brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at firſt intended; but he afterwards makes his Court to <hi>Auguſtrus,</hi> by turning it into an Apotheſis of <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sixth is the <hi>Silenus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Seventh, another Poetical Diſpute, firſt Compos'd at <hi>Mantua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:43031:17"/>
The Eighth is the Deſcription of a deſpairing Lover, and a Magical Charm.</p>
                  <p>He ſets the Ninth after all theſe, very modeſtly, becauſe it was particular to himſelf; and here he would have ended that Work, if <hi>Gallus</hi> had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd upon him to add one more in his Favour.</p>
                  <p>Thus Curious was <hi>Virgil</hi> in <hi>diverſifying</hi> his Subjects. But Mr. <hi>F. is</hi> a great deal too <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niform; begin where you pleaſe, the Subject is ſtill the ſame. We find it true what he ſays of himſelf,</p>
                  <q>Toûjours, toûjours de l'Amour.</q>
                  <p>He ſeems to take <hi>Paſtorals</hi> and <hi>Love-Verſes</hi> for the ſame thing. Has Humaen Nature no other Paſſion? Does not <hi>Fear, Ambition, Avarice, Pride,</hi> a Capricio of Honour, and <hi>Lazineſs</hi> it ſelf often Triumph over <hi>Love?</hi> But this Paſſion does all, not only in <hi>Paſtorals,</hi> but on <hi>Modern Tragedies</hi> too. A Heroe can no more <hi>Fight, or</hi> be <hi>Sick,</hi> or <hi>Dye,</hi> than he can be <hi>Born</hi> without a <hi>Woman.</hi> But <hi>Dramatic's</hi> have been compos'd in compliance to the Humour of the Age, and the prevailing Inclination of the great, whoſe <hi>Example</hi> has a very powerful Influence, not only in the little Court behind the Scenes, but on the great Theatre of the World. This inundation of <hi>Love-Verſes</hi> 'tis not ſo much an effect of their Amorouſneſs, as of immoderate <hi>Self-love.</hi> This being the only ſort of Poetry, in which the Writer can, not only without Cenſure, but even with <hi>Commendation,</hi> talk of <hi>himſelf.</hi> There is generally more of the Paſſion of <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> than concern for <hi>Chloris</hi> and <hi>Corinna</hi> in this whole Affair. Be pleas'd to look into almoſt any of thoſe Writers, and you ſhall meet every where that <hi>eternal Moy,</hi> which the admirable <hi>Paſchal</hi> ſo judiciouſly condemns. <hi>Homer</hi> can never be enough admir'd for this one ſo particular Quality, that he never ſpeaks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, either in the <hi>Iliad,</hi> or the <hi>Odyſſes;</hi> and if Horace had never told us his Genealogy, but left it to the Writer of his Life, perhaps he had not been a loſer by it. This Conſideration might induce thoſe great Criticks, <hi>Varius</hi> and <hi>Tucca,</hi> to raze out the four firſt Verſes of the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> in great meaſure, for the ſake of that unlucky <hi>Ille ego.</hi> But extraordinary <hi>Genius's</hi> have a ſort of Prerogative, which may diſpence them from Laws, binding to <hi>Subject-Wits.</hi> However, the Ladies have the leſs Reaſon to be pleas'd with thoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, of which the Poet takes the greater ſhare to himſelf. Thus the <hi>Beau</hi> preſſes into their <hi>Dreſſing-Room,</hi> but it is not ſo much to adore their fair Eyes, as to adjuſt his own Steenzkirk and Peruke, and ſet his Countenance in their Glaſs.</p>
                  <p>A fifth Rule, (which one may hope will not be conteſted) is that the Writer ſhould ſhew in his Compoſitions, ſome competent skill of the Subject matter, that which makes the Character of the Perſons introduc'd. In this, as in all other Points of Learning, Decency, and Oeconomy of a Poem, <hi>Virgil</hi> much excells his Maſter <hi>Theocritus.</hi> The <hi>Poet</hi> is better skill'd in <hi>Husbandry</hi> than thoſe that get their Bread by <hi>it.</hi> He deſcribes the Nature, the Diſeaſes, the Remedies, the proper places, and Seaſons, of Feeding, of Watering their Flocks; the Furniture, Diet; the Lodging and paſtimes of his Shepherds. But the Perſons brought in by Mr. <hi>F.</hi> are Shepherds in Maſquerade, and handle their <hi>Sheep-Hook</hi> as awkardly, as they do their <hi>Oaten-Reed.</hi> They Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about with their <hi>chers Moutons,</hi> but they relate as little to the Buſineſs in hand, as the <hi>Painter's Dog,</hi> or a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship, does to the Hiſtory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd. One would ſuſpect ſome of them, that inſtead of leading out their Sheep
<pb facs="tcp:43031:17"/>
into the Plains of <hi>Mont-Briſon,</hi> and <hi>Marcilli,</hi> to the flowry Banks of <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> or the <hi>Charanthe;</hi> that they are driving directly, <hi>à la boucherie,</hi> to make Money of them. I hope hereafter Mr. <hi>F.</hi> will chuſe his Servants better.</p>
                  <p>A ſixth Rule is, That as the Style ought to be natural, clear, and elegant, it ſhould have ſome peculiar reliſh of the Ancient Faſhion of Writing. Parables in thoſe times were frequently us'd, as they are ſtill by the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Nations; Philoſophical Queſtions, Aenigma's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of this we find Inſtances in the <hi>Sacred Writings,</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> Contemporary with King <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tragedians; this piece of Antiquity is imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by <hi>Virgil</hi> with great judgment and diſcretion: He has propos'd one Riddle which has never yet been ſolv'd by any of his Commentators. Tho' he knew the Rules of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> as well as <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf; he conceals that skill in his Paſtorals, and keeps cloſe to the Character of Antiquity: Nor ought the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions and Tranſitions to be very ſtrict, and regular; this would give the <hi>Paſtorals</hi> an Air of <hi>Novelty,</hi> and of this neglect of exact Connexions, we have inſtances in the Writings of the Ancient <hi>Chineſes,</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> in <hi>Pindar,</hi> and other Writers of <hi>Dithyrambics,</hi> in th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Chorus<hi>'s</hi> of <hi>Aeſchylus, Sophocles,</hi> and <hi>Euripides.</hi> If Mr. <hi>F.</hi> and <hi>Ruaeus,</hi> had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd this, the one wou'd have ſpar'd his Critic of the Sixth, and the other, his Reflections upon the Ninth <hi>Paſtoral.</hi> The over-ſcrupulous care of Connexions, makes the Modern Compoſitions oftentimes tedious and flat: And by the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them it comes to paſs, that the <hi>Penſees</hi> of the incomparable <hi>Mr. Paſcal,</hi> and perhaps of Mr. <hi>Bruyere,</hi> are two of the moſt Entertaining Books which the Modern <hi>French</hi> can boaſt of. <hi>Virgil,</hi> in this point, was not only faithful to the Character of Antiquity, but Copies after <hi>Nature</hi> her ſelf. Thus <hi>a Meadow,</hi> where the Beauties of the Spring are <hi>profuſely</hi> blended together, makes a more delightful Proſpect, than a curious Knot of ſorted Flowers in our Gardens; and we are much more tranſported with the Beauty of the Heavens, and admiration of their Creator, in a clear Night, when we behold Stars of all <hi>Magnitudes, promiſcuouſly</hi> moving together, than if thoſe glorious Lights were rank'd in their ſeveral <hi>Orders,</hi> or reduc'd into the fineſt <hi>Geometrical</hi> Figures.</p>
                  <p>Another Rule omitted by <hi>P. Rapine,</hi> as ſome of his are by me, (for I do not deſign an entire Treatiſe in this Preface,) is, that not only the Sentences ſhould be <hi>ſhort,</hi> and <hi>ſmart,</hi> upon which account, he juſtly blames the <hi>Italian,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> as too Talkative, but that the whole piece ſhould be ſo too. <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> transgreſs'd this Rule in his firſt Paſtorals, I mean thoſe which he compos'd at <hi>Mantua,</hi> but rectifi'd the Fault in his Riper Years. This appears by the <hi>Culex,</hi> which is as long as five of his Paſtorals put together. The greater part of thoſe he finiſh'd, have leſs than a Hundred Verſes, and but two of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed that Number. But the <hi>Silenus,</hi> which he ſeems to have deſign'd for his Maſter-piece, in which he introduces a God ſinging, and he too full of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, (which is intended by that ebriety, which Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſo unreaſonably ridicules,) tho' it go thro' ſo vaſt a Field of Matter, and comprizes the Mytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of near Two Thouſand Years, conſiſts but of <hi>Fifty</hi> Lines; ſo that its bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity is no leſs admirable, than the ſubject Matter; the noble Faſhion of handling it, and the <hi>Deity</hi> ſpeaking. <hi>Virgil</hi> keeps up his Characters in this reſpect too, with the ſtricteſt decency: For Poetry and Paſtime was not the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mens Lives in thoſe days, but only their ſeaſonable Recreation after neceſſary Labours. And therefore the length of ſome of the Modern <hi>Italian,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Compoſitions, is againſt the Rules of this kind of Poeſy.</p>

I ſhall add ſomething very briefly touching the Verſification of <hi>Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> tho' it be a mortifying Conſideration to the Moderns. Heroic Verſe, as it is commonly call'd, was us'd by the <hi>Latins</hi> in this ſort of Poem, as very Ancient and Natural. <hi>Lyrics, Iambics, &amp;c.</hi> being Invented afterwards: but there is ſo great a difference in the Numbers, of which it may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, that it may paſs rather for a <hi>Genus,</hi> than <hi>Species,</hi> of Verſe.

                  <p>The <hi>Sound</hi> of the Verſes, is almoſt as different as the <hi>Subjects.</hi> But the <hi>Greek</hi> Writers of <hi>Paſtoral,</hi> uſually limited themſelves to the Example of the firſt; which <hi>Virgil</hi> found ſo exceedingly difficult, that he quitted it, and left the Honour of that part to <hi>Theocritus.</hi> It is indeed probable, that what we improperly call <hi>rhyme,</hi> is the moſt Ancient ſort of Poetry; and Learned Men have given good Arguments for it; and therefore a <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorian commits a groſs miſtake, when he attributes that Invention to a King of <hi>Gaul,</hi> as an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman does, when he makes a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor of it. But the <hi>Greeks</hi> who underſtood fully the force and power of <hi>Numbers,</hi> ſoon grew weary of this Childiſh ſort of Verſe, as the Younger <hi>Voſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> juſtly calls it, and therefore thoſe rhyming Hexameters, which <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerves in <hi>Homer himſelf,</hi> ſeem to be the Remains of a barbarous Age. <hi>Virgil</hi> had them in ſuch abhorrence, that he would rather make a falſe <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax,</hi> than what we call a Rhime, ſuch a Verſe as this

So that the principal Ornament of Modern Poetry, was accounted <hi>deformity</hi> by the <hi>Latins,</hi> and <hi>Greeks;</hi> it was they who invented the different termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of words, thoſe happy compoſitions, thoſe ſhort monoſyllables, thoſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions for the elegance of the ſound and ſenſe, which are wanting ſo much in modern Languages. The <hi>French</hi> ſometimes crowd together ten, or twelve Monoſyllables, into one disjoynted Verſe; they may underſtand the nature of, but cannot imitate, thoſe wonderful <hi>Spondees</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> by which he could ſuddenly pacifie a Man that was in a violent tranſport of anger; nor thoſe <hi>ſwift numbers</hi> of the Prieſts of <hi>Cybele,</hi> which had the force to enrage the moſt <hi>ſedate</hi> and <hi>Phlegmatick</hi> Tempers. Nor can any Modern put into his own Language the <hi>Energy</hi> of that ſingle Poem of <hi>Catullus,</hi>

Latin is but a corrupt dialect of <hi>Greek;</hi> and the <hi>French, Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> a corruption of <hi>Latine;</hi> and therefore a Man might as well go about to perſuade me that <hi>Vinegar</hi> is a <hi>Nobler</hi> Liquor than <hi>Wine,</hi> as that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Compoſitions can be as graceful and harmonious as the <hi>Latine</hi> it ſelf. The <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue very naturally falls into <hi>Iambicks,</hi> and therefore the diligent Reader may find ſix or ſeven and twenty of them in thoſe accurate Orations of <hi>Iſocrates.</hi> The <hi>Latin</hi> as naturally falls into <hi>Heroic;</hi> and therefore the beginning of <hi>Livy</hi>'s Hiſtory is half an Hexameter, and that of <hi>Tacitus</hi> an entire one. The <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorian deſcribing the glorious effort of a Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel to break thro' a <hi>Brigade</hi> of the Enemies, juſt after the defeat at <hi>Cannae,</hi> falls, unknowingly, into a Verſe not unworthy <hi>Virgil</hi> himſelf.</p>

                  <p>Ours and the <hi>French</hi> can at beſt but fall into Blank Verſe, which is a fault in Proſe. The misfortune indeed is common to us both, but we deſerve more compaſſion, becauſe we are not vain of our Barbarities. As Age brings Men back into the ſtate and infirmities of Childhood, upon the fall of their Empire, the <hi>Romans doted</hi> into <hi>Rhime,</hi> as appears ſufficiently by the <hi>Hymns</hi> of the <hi>Latin Church;</hi> and yet a great deal of the <hi>French</hi> Poetry does hardly deſerve that poor title. I ſhall give an inſtance out of a Poem which had the good luck to gain the Prize in <hi>1685,</hi> for the Subject deſerv'd a Nobler Pen.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Tous les jours ce grand Roy des autres Roys l'exemple,</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>The Judicious <hi>Malherbe</hi> exploded this ſort of Verſe near Eighty Years ago. Nor can I forbear wondering at that paſſage of a Famous Academician, in which he, moſt compaſſionately, excuſes the Ancients for their not being ſo exact in their Compoſitions, as the Modern <hi>French,</hi> becauſe they wanted <hi>a Dictionary,</hi> of which the <hi>French</hi> are at laſt happily provided. If <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> had been ſo lucky as to have had a <hi>Dictionary,</hi> and ſuch a Patron as Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> perhaps they might have aſpir'd to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Balzac</hi>'s Legacy of <hi>Ten Pounds, Le prix de l'Eloquence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the contrary, I dare aſſert that there are hardly ten Lines in either of thoſe great Orators, or even in the Catalogue of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Ships, which is not more harmonious, more truly <hi>Rythmical,</hi> than moſt of the <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Sonnets; and therefore they loſe, at leaſt, one half of their native Beauty by Tranſlation.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but add one Remark on this occaſion, that the <hi>French</hi> Verſe is oftentimes not ſo much as Rhime, in the loweſt Senſe; for the Childiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the ſame Note cannot be call'd <hi>Muſick;</hi> ſuch Inſtances are infinite, as in the forecited Poem.

Seven Years together I have conceal'd the longing which I had to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you: A time as tedious as <hi>Aeneas</hi> paſs'd in his wandring Voyage, before he reach'd the promis'd <hi>Italy.</hi> But I conſider'd, that nothing which my meanneſs cou'd produce, was worthy of your Patronage. At laſt this happy Occaſion offer'd, of Preſenting to you the beſt Poem of the beſt Poet. If I balk'd this opportunity, I was in deſpair of finding ſuch another; and if I took it, I was ſtill uncertain whether you wou'd vouchſafe to accept it from my hands. 'Twas a bold venture which I made, in deſiring your permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to lay my unworthy Labours at your feet. But my raſhneſs has ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded beyond my hopes: And you have been pleas'd not to ſuffer an Old Man to go diſcontented out of the World, for want of that protection, of which he had been ſo long Ambitious. I have known a Gentleman in diſgrace, and not daring to appear before King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, though he much deſir'd it: At length he took the confidence to attend a fair Lady to the Court; and told His Majeſty, that under her protection he had preſum'd to wait on him. With the ſame humble confidence I preſent my ſelf before your Lordſhip, and attending on <hi>Virgil</hi> hope a gracious reception. The Gentleman ſucceeded, becauſe the powerful Lady was his Friend; but I have too much injur'd my great Author, to expect he ſhould intercede for me. I wou'd have Tranſlated him, but according to the litteral <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Phraſes, I fear I have traduc'd him. 'Tis the fault of many a well-meaning Man, to be officious in a wrong place, and do a prejudice, where he had endeavour'd to do a ſervice. <hi>Virgil</hi> wrote his <hi>Georgics</hi> in the full ſtrength and vigour of his Age, when his Judgment was at the height, and before his Fancy was declining. He had, (according to our homely Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) his full ſwing at this Poem, beginning it about the Age of Thirty Five; and ſcarce concluding it before he arriv'd at Forty. 'Tis obſerv'd both of him, and <hi>Horace,</hi> and I believe it will hold in all great Poets; that though they wrote before with a certain heat of Genius which inſpir'd them, yet that heat was not perfectly digeſted. There is requir'd a continuance of warmth to ripen the beſt and Nobleſt Fruits. Thus <hi>Horace</hi> in his Firſt and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb facs="tcp:43031:63"/>
Book of <hi>Odes,</hi> was ſtill riſing, but came not to his <hi>Meridian</hi> 'till the Third. After which his Judgment was an overpoize to his Imagination: He grew too cautious to be bold enough, for he deſcended in his Fourth by ſlow degrees, and in his <hi>Satires</hi> and <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> was more a Philoſopher and a Critick than a Poet. In the beginning of Summer the days are almoſt at a ſtand, with little variation of length or ſhortneſs, becauſe at that time the Diurnal Motion of the Sun partakes more of a Right Line, than of a Spiral. The ſamè is the method of Nature in the frame of Man. He ſeems at Forty to be fully in his Summer Tropick; ſomewhat before, and ſomewhat after, he finds in his Soul but ſmall increaſes or decays. From Fifty to Threeſcore the Ballance generally holds even, in our colder Clymates: For he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes not much in Fancy; and Judgment, which is the effect of Obſervation, ſtill increaſes: His ſucceeding years afford him little more than the ſtubble of his own Harveſt: Yet if his Conſtitution be healthful, his Mind may ſtill retain a decent vigour; and the Gleanings of that <hi>Ephraim,</hi> in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with others, will ſurpaſs the Vintage of <hi>Abiezer.</hi> I have call'd this ſomewhere by a bold Metaphor, a green Old Age; but <hi>Virgil</hi> has given me his Authority for the Figure.</p>

                  <p>Amongst thoſe few who enjoy the advantage of a latter Spring, your Lordſhip is a rare Example: Who being now arriv'd at your great <hi>Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macterique,</hi> yet give no proof of the leaſt decay in your Excellent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and comprehenſion of all things, which are within the compaſs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding. Your Converſation is as eaſie as it is inſtructive, and I cou'd never obſerve the leaſt vanity or the leaſt aſſuming in any thing you ſaid: but a natural unaffected Modeſty, full of good ſenſe, and well digeſted. A clearneſs of Notion, expreſs'd in ready and unſtudied words. No Man has complain'd, or ever can, that you have diſcours'd too long on any Subject: for you leave us in an eagerneſs of Learning more; pleas'd with what we hear, but not ſatisfy'd, becauſe you will not ſpeak ſo much as we cou'd wiſh. I dare not excuſe your Lordſhip from this fault; for though 'tis none in you, 'tis one to all who have the happineſs of being known to you. I muſt confeſs the Criticks make it one of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Beauties, that having ſaid what he thought convenient, he always left ſomewhat for the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Readers to ſupply: That they might gratifie their fancies, by find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more, in what he had written, than at firſt they cou'd; and think they had added to his thought, when it was all there before-hand, and he only ſav'd himſelf the expence of words. However it was, I never went from your Lordſhip, but with a longing to return, or without a hearty Curſe to him who invented Ceremonies in the World, and put me on the nec<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſity of withdrawing, when it was my intereſt as well as my deſire, to have given you a much longer trouble. I cannot imagine (if your Lordſhip will give me leave to ſpeak my thoughts) but you have had a more than ordinary vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in your Youth. For too much of heat is requir'd at firſt, that there may not too little be left at laſt. A Prodigal Fire is only capable of large remains: And yours, my Lord, ſtill burns the clearer in declining. The Blaze is not ſo fierce as at the firſt, but the Smoak is wholly vaniſh'd; and your Friends who ſtand about you, are not only ſenſible of a chearful warmth, but are kept at an awful diſtance by its force. In my ſmall Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of Mankind, I have ever ſound, that ſuch as are not rather too full of Spirit when they are young, degenerate to dullneſs in their Age. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety in our riper years is the effect of a well-concocted warmth; but where
<pb facs="tcp:43031:63"/>
the Principles are only Phlegm, what can be expected from the wateriſh Matter, but an inſipid Manhood, and a ſtupid old Infancy; Diſcretion in Leading-ſtrings, and a confirm'd ignorance on Crutches? <hi>Virgil</hi> in his Third <hi>Georgic,</hi> when he deſcribes a Colt, who promiſes a Courſer for the Race, or for the Field of Battel, ſhews him the firſt to paſs the Bridge, which trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles under him, and to ſtem the torrent of the flood. His beginnings muſt be in raſhneſs; a Noble Fault: But Time and Experience will correct that Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and tame it into a deliberate and well-weigh'd Courage; which knows both to be cautious and to dare, as occaſion offers. Your Lordſhip is a Man of Honour, not only ſo unſtain'd, but ſo unqueſtion'd, that you are the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Standard of that Heroick Vertue; ſo truly ſuch, that if I wou'd flatter you, I cou'd not. It takes not from you, that you were born with Principles of Generoſity and Probity: But it adds to you, that you have cultivated Nature, and made thoſe Principles, the Rule and Meaſure of all your Actions. The World knows this, without my telling: Yet Poets have a right of Recording it to all Poſterity.

                     <hi>Epaminondas, Lucullus,</hi> and the two firſt <hi>Caeſars,</hi> were not eſteem'd the worſe Commanders, for having made Philoſophy, and the Liberal Arts their Study. <hi>Cicero</hi> might have been their Equal, but that he wanted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. To have both theſe Vertues, and to have improv'd them both, with a ſoftneſs of Manners, and a ſweetneſs of Converſation, few of our Nobility can fill that Character: One there is, and ſo conſpicuous by his own light, that he needs not</p>

                  <p>To be Nobly Born, and of an Ancient Family, is in the extreams of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, either good or bad; for Virtue and Deſcent are no Inheritance. A long Series of Anceſtours ſhews the Native with great advantage at the firſt; but if he any way degenerate from his Line, the leaſt Spot is viſible on Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. But to preſerve this whiteneſs in its Original Purity, you, my Lord, have, like that Ermine, forſaken the common Track of Buſineſs, which is not always clean: You have choſen for your ſelf a private Greatneſs, and will not be polluted with Ambition. It has been obſerv'd in former times, that none have been ſo greedy of Employments, and of managing the Publick, as they who have leaſt deſerv'd their Stations. But ſuch only merit to be call'd Patriots, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom we ſee their Country Flouriſh. I have laugh'd ſometimes (for who wou'd always be a <hi>Heraclitus?)</hi> when I have reflected on thoſe Men, who from time to time have ſhot themſelves into the World. I have ſeen many Succeſſions of them; ſome bolting out upon the Stage with vaſt applauſe, and others hiſs'd off, and quitting it with diſgrace. But while they were in action, I have conſtantly obſerv'd, that they ſeem'd deſirous to retreat from Buſineſs: Greatneſs they ſaid was nauſeous, and a Crowd was troubleſome; a quiet privacy was their Ambition. Some few of them I believe ſaid this in earneſt, and were making a proviſion againſt future want, that they might enjoy their Age with eaſe: They ſaw the happineſs of a private Life, and promis'd to themſelves a Bleſſing, which every day it was in their power to poſſeſs. But they deferr'd it, and linger'd ſtill at Court, becauſe they thought they had not yet enough to make them happy: They wou'd have more, and laid in to make their Solitude Luxurious. A wretched Philoſophy, which <hi>Epicurus</hi> never taught them in his Garden: They lov'd the proſpect of this
<pb facs="tcp:43031:64"/>
quiet in reverſion, but were not willing to have it in poſſeſſion; they wou'd firſt be Old, and made as ſure of Health and Life, as if both of them were at their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But put them to the neceſſity of a preſent choice, and they preferr'd continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Power: Like the Wretch who call'd Death to his aſſiſtance, but refus'd it when he came. The Great <hi>Scipio</hi> was not of their Opinion, who indeed ſought Honours in his Youth, and indur'd the Fatigues with which he purchas'd them. He ſerv'd his Country when it was in need of his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and his Conduct, 'till he thought it was time to ſerve himſelf: But diſmounted from the Saddle, when he found the Beaſt which bore him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to grow reſtiff and ungovernable. But your Lordſhip has given us a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Example of Moderation. You ſaw betimes that Ingratitude is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to Commonwealths; and therefore though you were form'd alike, for the greateſt of Civil Employments, and Military Commands, yet you puſh'd not your Fortune to riſe in either; but contented your ſelf with being capable, as much as any whoſoever, of defending your Country with your Sword, or aſſiſting it with your Counſel, when you were call'd. For the reſt, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and love which was paid you, not only in the Province where you live, but generally by all who had the happineſs to know you, was a wiſe Exchange for the Honours of the Court: A place of forgetfulneſs, at the beſt, for well deſervers. 'Tis neceſſary for the poliſhing of Manners, to have breath'd that Air, but 'tis infectious even to the beſt Morals to live always in it. 'Tis a dangerous Commerce, where an honeſt Man is ſure at the firſt of being Cheated; and he recovers not his Loſſes, but by learning to Cheat others. The undermining Smile becomes at length habitual; and the drift of his plauſible Converſation, is only to flatter one, that he may betray another. Yet 'tis good to have been a looker on, without venturing to play; that a Man may know falſe Dice another time, though he never means to uſe them. I commend not him who never knew a Court, but him who forſakes it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knows it. A young Man deſerves no praiſe, who out of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Zeal leaves the World before he has well try'd it, and runs headlong into Religion. He who carries a Maidenhead into a Cloyſter, is ſometimes apt to loſe it there, and to repent of his Repentance. He only is like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure Auſterities, who has already found the inconvenience of Pleaſures. For almoſt every Man will be making Experiments in one part or another of his Life: And the danger is the leſs when we are young: For having try'd it early, we ſhall not be apt to repeat it afterwards. Your Lordſhip therefore may properly be ſaid to have choſen a Retreat; and not to have choſen it 'till you had maturely weigh'd the advantages of riſing higher with the hazards of the fall. <hi>Res non parta labore, ſed relicta,</hi> was thought by a Poet, to be one of the requiſites to a happy Life. Why ſhou'd a reaſonable Man put it into the power of Fortune to make him miſerable, when his Anceſtours have taken care to releaſe him from her? Let him venture, ſays <hi>Horace, Qui Zonam perdidit.</hi> He who has nothing, plays ſecurely, for he may win, and cannot be poorer if he loſes. But he who is born to a plentiful Eſtate, and is Ambitious of Offices at Court, ſets a ſtake to Fortune, which ſhe can ſeldom anſwer: If he gains nothing, he loſes all, or part of what was once his own; and if he gets, he cannot be certain but he may refund.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, however he ſucceeds, 'tis Covetouſneſs that induc'd him firſt to play, and Covetouſneſs is the undoubted ſign of ill ſenſe at bottom. The Odds are againſt him that he loſes, and one loſs may be of more conſequence to him, than all his former winnings. 'Tis like the preſent War of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> againſt the <hi>Turk;</hi> every year they gain a Victory, and by that a Town; but if they are once defeated, they loſe a Province at a blow, and endanger the ſafety of the whole Empire. You, my Lord, enjoy your quiet in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<pb facs="tcp:43031:64"/>
where you have not only the leiſure of thinking, but the pleaſure to think of nothing which can diſcompoſe your Mind. A good Conſcience is a Port which is Land-lock'd on every ſide, and where no Winds can poſſibly invade, no Tempeſts can ariſe. There a Man may ſtand upon the Shore, and not only ſee his own Image, but that of his Maker, clearly reflected from the undiſturb'd and ſilent waters. Reaſon was intended for a Bleſſing, and ſuch it is to Men of Honour and Integrity; who deſire no more, than what they are able to give themſelves; like the happy Old <hi>Coricyan,</hi> whom my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor deſcribes in his Fourth <hi>Georgic;</hi> whoſe Fruits and Salads on which he liv'd contented, were all of his own growth, and his own Plantation. <hi>Virgil</hi> ſeems to think that the Bleſſings of a Country Life are not compleat, without an improvement of Knowledge by Contemplation and Reading.</p>

                  <head>AN ESSAY ON THE GEORGICS.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>VIRGIL</hi> may be reckon'd the firſt who introduc'd three new kinds of Poetry among the <hi>Romans,</hi> which he Copied after three the Greateſt Maſters of <hi>Greece. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> have ſtill diſputed for the advantage over him in <hi>Paſtoral</hi> and <hi>Heroicks,</hi> but I think all are Unanimous in giving him the precedence to <hi>Heſiod</hi> in his <hi>Georgies.</hi> The truth of it is, the Sweetneſs and Ruſticity of a <hi>Paſtoral</hi> cannot be ſo well expreſt in any other Tongue as in the <hi>Greek,</hi> when rightly mixt and qualified with the <hi>Doric</hi> Dialect; nor can the Majeſty of an Heroick Poem any where appear ſo well as in this Language, which has a Natural greatneſs in it, and can be often render'd more deep and ſonorous by the Pronunciation of the <hi>Ionians.</hi> But in the middle Stile, where the Writers in both Tongues are on a Level: we ſee how far <hi>Virgil</hi> has excell'd all who have written in the ſame way with him.</p>
                  <p>There has been abundance of Criticiſm ſpent on <hi>Virgil's Paſtorals</hi> and <hi>Aeneids,</hi> but the <hi>Georgics</hi> are a Subject which none of the <hi>Criticks</hi> have ſufficiently taken into their Conſideration; moſt of 'em paſſing it over in ſilence, or caſting it under the ſame head with <hi>Paſtoral;</hi> a diviſion by no means proper, unleſs we ſuppoſe the Stile of a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman ought to be imitated in a <hi>Georgic</hi> as that of a Shepherd is in <hi>Paſtoral.</hi> But tho' the Scene of both theſe Poems lies in the ſame place; the Speakers in them are of a quite different Character, ſince the Precepts of Husbandry are not to be deliver'd with the ſimplicity of a Plow-Man, but with the Addreſs of a Poet. No Rules therefore that relate to <hi>Paſtoral,</hi> can any way affect the <hi>Georgics,</hi> which fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Claſs of Poetry which conſiſts in giving plain and direct In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to the Reader; whether they be Moral Duties, as thoſe of <hi>Theognis</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras;</hi> or Philoſophical Speculations, as thoſe of <hi>Aratus</hi> and <hi>Lucretius;</hi> or Rules of Practice, as thoſe of <hi>Heſiod</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> Among theſe different kinds of Subjects, that which the <hi>Georgics</hi> goes upon, is I think the meaneſt and the leaſt improving, but the moſt pleaſing and delightful. Precepts of Morality, beſides the Natural Corruption of our Tempers, which makes us averſe to them, are ſo abſtracted from Ideas of Senſe, that they ſeldom give an
<pb facs="tcp:43031:65"/>
opportunity for thoſe Beautiful Deſcriptions and Images which are the Spirit and Life of Poetry. Natural Philoſophy has indeed ſenſible Objects to work upon, but then it often puzzles the Reader with the Intricacy of its Notions, and perplexes him with the multitude of its Diſputes. But this kind of Poetry I am now ſpeaking of, addreſſes it ſelf wholly to the Imagination: It is altogether Converſant among the Fields and Woods, and has the moſt delightful part of Nature for its Province. It raiſes in our Minds a pleaſing variety of Scenes and Landskips, whilſt it teaches us: and makes the dryeſt of its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts look like a Deſcription. <hi>A</hi> Georgic <hi>therefore is ſome part of the Science of Husbandry put into a pleaſing Dreſs, and ſet off with all the Beauties and Embelliſhments of Poetry.</hi> Now ſince this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Husbandry is of a very large extent, the Poet ſhews his Skill in ſingling out ſuch Precepts to preceed on, as are uſeful, and at the ſame time moſt capable of Ornament. <hi>Virgil</hi> was ſo well acquainted with this Secret, that to ſet off his firſt <hi>Georgic,</hi> he has run into a ſet of Precepts, which are almoſt foreign to his Subject, in that Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful account he gives us of the Signs in Nature, which precede the Changes of the Weather.</p>
                  <p>And if there be ſo much Art in the choice of fit Precepts, there is much more requir'd in the Treating of 'em; that they may fall in after each other by a Natural unforc'd Method, and ſhew themſelves in the beſt and moſt advantagious Light. They ſhou'd all be ſo finely wrought together into the ſame Piece, that no courſe Seam may diſcover where they joyn; as in a Curious Brede of Needle-Work, one Colour falls away by ſuch juſt degrees, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther riſes ſo inſenſibly, that we ſee the variety, without being able to diſtinguiſh the total vaniſhing of the one from the firſt appearance of the other. Nor is it ſufficient to range and diſpoſe this Body of Precepts into a clear and eaſie Method, unleſs they are deliver'd to us in the moſt pleaſing and agreeable manner: For there are ſeveral ways of conveying the ſame Truth to the Mind of Man, and to chuſe the pleaſanteſt of theſe ways, is that which chiefly diſtinguiſhes Poetry from Proſe, and makes <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Rules of Husbandry pleaſanter to read than <hi>Varro</hi>'s. Where the Proſe-writer tells us plainly what ought to be done, the Poet often conceals the Precept in a deſcription, and repreſents his Country-Man performing the Action in which he wou'd inſtruct his Reader. Where the one ſets out as fully and diſtinctly as he can, all the parts of the Truth, which he wou'd communicate to us; the other ſingles out the moſt pleaſing Circumſtance of this Truth, and ſo conveys the whole in a more diverting manner to the Underſtanding. I ſhall give one Inſtance out of a multitude of this nature, that might be found in the <hi>Georgics,</hi> where the Reader may ſee the different ways <hi>Virgil</hi> has taken to expreſs the ſame thing, and how much pleaſanter every manner of Expreſſion is, than the plain and direct mention of it wou'd have been. It is in the Second <hi>Georgic</hi> where he tells us what Trees will bear Grafting on each other.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Here we ſee the Poet conſider'd all the Effects of this Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Trees of different kinds, and took notice of that Effect which had the moſt ſurprize, and by conſequence the moſt delight in it, to expreſs the capacity that was in them of being thus united. This way of Writing is every where much in uſe among the Poets, and is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly practis'd by <hi>Virgil,</hi> who loves to ſuggeſt a Truth indirectly, and without giving us a full and open view of it: To let us ſee juſt ſo much as will naturally lead the Imagination into all the parts that lie conceal'd. This is wonderfully diverting to the Underſtanding, thus to receive a Precept, that enters as it were through a By-way, and to apprehend an Idea that draws a whole train after it: For here the Mind, which is always delighted with its own Diſcoveries, only takes the hint from the Poet, and ſeems to work out the reſt by the ſtrength of her own faculties.</p>
                  <p>But ſince the inculcating Precept upon Precept, will at length prove tireſom to the Reader, if he meets with no other Entertainment, the Poet muſt take care not to encumber his Poem with too much Buſineſs; but ſometimes to relieve the Subject with a Moral Reflection, or let it reſt a while for the ſake of a pleaſant and pertinent digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Nor is it ſufficient to run out into beautiful and diverting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions (as it is generally thought) unleſs they are brought in aptly, and are ſomething of a piece with the main deſign of the <hi>Georgic:</hi> for they ought to have a remote alliance at leaſt to the Subject, that ſo the whole Poem may be more uniform and agreeable in all its parts. We ſhou'd never quite loſe ſight of the Country, tho' we are ſometimes entertain'd with a diſtant proſpect of it. Of this nature are <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Deſcriptions of the Original of <hi>Agriculture,</hi> of the Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of <hi>Italy,</hi> of a Country Life, and the like, which are not brought in by force, but naturally riſe out of the principal Argument and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Poem. I know no one digreſſion in the <hi>Georgics</hi> that may ſeem to contradict this Obſervation, beſides that in the latter end of the Firſt Book, where the Poet launches out into a diſcourſe of the Battel of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> and the Actions of <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> But it's worth while to conſider how admirably he has turn'd the courſe of his narration into its proper Channel, and made his Husbandman concern'd even in what relates to the Battel, in thoſe inimitable Lines,

We now come to the Stile which is proper to a <hi>Georgic;</hi> and indeed this is the part on which the Poet muſt lay out all his ſtrength, that his words may be warm and glowing, and that every thing he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes may immediately preſent it ſelf, and riſe up to the Reader's view. He ought in particular to be careful of not letting his Subject debaſe his Stile, and betray him into a meanneſs of Expreſſion, but every where to keep up his Verſe in all the Pomp of Numbers, and Dignity of words.</p>
                  <p>I think nothing which is a Phraſe or Sayingin common talk, ſhou'd be admitted into a ſerious Poem: becauſe it takes off from the Solemnity of the expreſſion, and gives it too great a turn of Familiarity: much leſs ought the low Phraſes and Terms of Art, that are adapted to Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, have any place in ſuch a Work as the <hi>Georgic,</hi> which is not to appear in the natural ſimplicity and nakedneſs of its Subject, but in the pleaſanteſt Dreſs that Poetry can beſtow on it. Thus <hi>Virgil,</hi> to deviate from the common form of words, wou'd not make uſe of <hi>Tempore</hi> but <hi>Sidere</hi> in his firſt Verſe, and every where elſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with <hi>Metaphors, Greciſms,</hi> and <hi>Circumlocutions,</hi> to give his Verſe the greater Pomp, and preſerve it from ſinking into a <hi>Plebeian</hi> Stile. And herein conſiſts <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Maſter-piece, who has not only excell'd all other Poets, but even himſelf in the Language of his <hi>Georgics;</hi> where we receive more ſtrong and lively <hi>Ideas</hi> of things from his words, than we cou'd have done from the Objects themſelves: and find our Imaginations more affected by his Deſcriptions, than they wou'd have been by the very ſight of what he deſcribes.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now, after this ſhort Scheme of Rules, conſider the different ſucceſs that <hi>Heſiod</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> have met with in this kind of Poetry, which may give us ſome further Notion of the Excellence of the <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gics.</hi> To begin with <hi>Heſiod;</hi> If we may gueſs at his Character from his Writings, he had much more of the Husbandman than the Poet in his Temper: He was wonderfully Grave, Diſcreet, and Frugal, he liv'd altogether in the Country, and was probably for his great Prudence the Oracle of the whole Neighbourhood. Theſe Principles of good Husbandry ran through his Works, and directed him to the choice of Tillage, and Merchandiſe, for the Subject of that which is the moſt Celebrated of them. He is every where bent on Inſtruction, avoids all manner of Digreſſions, and does not ſtir out of the Field once in the whole <hi>Georgic.</hi> His Method in deſcribing Month after Month with its proper Seaſons and Employments, is too grave and fim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; it takes off from the ſurprize and variety of the Poem, and makes the whole look but like a modern Almanack in Verſe. The Reader is carried through a courſe of Weather, and may beforehand gueſs whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is to meet with Snow or Rain, Clouds or Sunſhine in the next Deſcription. His Deſcriptions indeed have abundance of Nature in them, but then it is Nature in her ſimplicity and undreſs. Thus when he ſpeaks of <hi>January;</hi> the Wild-Beaſts, ſays he, run ſhivering through the Woods with their Heads ſtooping to the ground, and their Tails clapt between their Legs; the Goats and Oxen are almoſt flead with Cold; but it is not ſo bad with the Sheep, becauſe they have a thick Coat of Wooll about 'em. The Old Men too are bitterly pincht with the Weather, but the young Girls feel nothing of it, who ſit at home
<pb facs="tcp:43031:67"/>
with their Mothers by a warm Fire-ſide. Thus does the Old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man give himſelf up to a looſe kind of Tattle, rather than endeavour after a juſt Poetical Deſcription. Nor has he ſhewn more of Art or Judgment in the Precepts he has given us, which are ſown ſo very thick, that they clog the Poem too much, and are often ſo minute and full of Circumſtances, that they weaken and un-nerve his Verſe. But after all, we are beholding to him for the firſt rough <hi>sketch</hi> of a <hi>Georgic:</hi> where we may ſtill diſcover ſomething venerable in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickneſs of the Work; but if we wou'd ſee the Deſign enlarg'd, the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures reform'd, the Colouring laid on, and the whole Piece finiſh'd, we muſt expect it from a greater Maſter's hand.</p>

                     <hi>Virgil</hi> has drawn out the Rules for Tillage and Planting into Two Books, which <hi>Heſiod</hi> has diſpatcht in half a one; but has ſo rais'd the natural rudeneſs and ſimplicity of his Subject with ſuch a ſignificancy of Expreſſion, ſuch a Pomp of Verſe, ſuch variety of Tranſitions, and ſuch a ſolemn Air in his Reflections, that if we look on both Poets toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we ſee in one the plainneſs of a down-right Country-Man, and in the other, ſomething of a Ruſtick Majeſty, like that of a <hi>Roman</hi> Dictator at the Plow-Tail. He delivers the meaneſt of his Precepts with a kind of Grandeur, he breaks the Clods and toſſes the Dung about with an air of gracefulneſs. His Prognoſtications of the Weather are taken out of <hi>Aratus,</hi> where we may ſee how judiciouſly he has pickt out thoſe that are moſt proper for his Husbandman's Obſervation; how he has enforc'd the Expreſſion, and heighten'd the Images which he found in the Original.</p>
                  <p>The Second Book has more wit in it, and a greater boldneſs in its Metaphors than any of the reſt. The Poet with a great Beauty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies Oblivion, Ignorance, Wonder, Deſire and the like to his Trees. The laſt <hi>Georgic</hi> has indeed as many Metaphors, but not ſo daring as this; for Humane Thoughts and Paſſions may be more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally aſcrib'd to a Bee, than to an Inanimate Plant. He who reads over the Pleaſures of a Country Life, as they are deſcrib'd by <hi>Virgil</hi> in the latter end of this Book, can ſcarce be of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Mind, in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring even the Life of a Philoſopher to it.</p>
                  <p>We may I think read the Poet's Clime in his Deſcription, for he ſeems to have been in a ſweat at the Writing of it.
<q>
                        <l>—O Quis me gelidis ſub Montibus Haemi</l>
                        <l>Siſtat, &amp; ingenti ramorum protegat umbr â!</l>
                     </q>
And is every where mentioning among his chief Pleaſures, the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Shades and Rivers, Vales and Grottos, which a more Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Poet wou'd have omitted for the deſcription of a Sunny Hill, and Fire-ſide.</p>
                  <p>The Third <hi>Georgic</hi> ſeems to be the moſt labour'd of 'em all; there is a wonderful Vigour and Spirit in the deſcription of the Horſe and Chariot-Race. The force of Love is repreſented in Noble Inſtances, and very Sublime Expreſſions. The <hi>Scythian</hi> Winter-piece appears ſo very cold and bleak to the Eye, that a Man can ſcarce look on it without ſhivering. The Murrain at the end has all the expreſſiveneſs
<pb facs="tcp:43031:67"/>
that words can give. It was here that the Poet ſtrain'd hard to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do <hi>Lucretius</hi> in the deſcription of his Plague; and if the Reader wou'd ſee what ſucceſs he had, he may find it at large in <hi>Scaliger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Virgil</hi> ſeems no where ſo well pleas'd, as when he is got among his Bees in the Fourth <hi>Georgic:</hi> And Ennobles the Actions of ſo trivial a Creature, with Metaphors drawn from the moſt important Concerns of Mankind. His Verſes are not in a greater noiſe and hurry in the Battels of <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Turnus,</hi> than in the Engagement of two Swarms. And as in his <hi>Aeneis</hi> he compares the Labours of his <hi>Trojans</hi> to thoſe of Bees and Piſmires, here he compares the Labours of the Bees to thoſe of the <hi>Cyclops.</hi> In ſhort, the laſt <hi>Georgic</hi> was a good Prelude to the <hi>Aeneis;</hi> and very well ſhew'd what the Poet could do in the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what was really great, by his deſcribing the Mock-grandeur of an Inſect with ſo good a grace. There is more pleaſantneſs in the little Platform of a Garden, which he gives us about the middle of this Book, than in all the ſpacious Walks and Water-works of <hi>Rapin</hi>'s. The Speech of <hi>Proteus</hi> at the end can never be enough admir'd, and was indeed very fit to conclude ſo Divine a Work.</p>
                  <p>After this particular account of the Beauties in the <hi>Georgics,</hi> I ſhou'd in the next place endeavour to point out its imperfections, if it has any. But tho' I think there are ſome few parts in it that are not ſo Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as the reſt, I ſhall not preſume to name them, as rather ſuſpecting my own Judgment, than I can believe a fault to be in that Poem, which lay ſo long under <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Correction, and had his laſt hand put to it. The firſt <hi>Georgic</hi> was probably Burleſqu'd in the Author's Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time; for we ſtill find in the Scholiaſts a Verſe that ridicules part of a Line Tranſlated from <hi>Heſiod. Nudus Ara, ſere Nudus—</hi>And we may eaſily gueſs at the Judgment of this extraordinary Critick, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was, from his Cenſuring this particular Precept. We may be ſure <hi>Virgil</hi> wou'd not have Tranſlated it from <hi>Heſiod,</hi> had he not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd ſome Beauty in it; and indeed the Beauty of it is what I have before obſerv'd to be frequently met with in <hi>Virgil,</hi> the delivering the Precept ſo indirectly, and ſingling out the particular circumſtance of Sowing and Plowing naked, to ſuggeſt to us that theſe Employments are proper only in the hot Seaſon of the Year.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not here compare the Stile of the <hi>Georgics</hi> with that of <hi>Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> which the Reader may ſee already done in the Preface to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Volume of <hi>Miſcellany Poems;</hi> but ſhall conclude this Poem to be the moſt Compleat, Elaborate, and finiſht Piece of all Antiquity. The <hi>Aeneis</hi> indeed is of a Nobler kind, but the <hi>Georgic</hi> is more perfect in its kind. The <hi>Aeneid</hi> has a greater variety of Beauties in it, but thoſe of the <hi>Georgic</hi> are more exquiſite. In ſhort, the <hi>Georgic</hi> has all the perfection that can be expected in a Poem written by the greateſt Poet in the Flower of his Age, when his Invention was ready, his Imagination warm, his Judgment ſettled, and all his Faculties in their full Vigour and Maturity.</p>

He ſhews the different kinds of Tillage proper to different Soils, traces out the Original of Agriculture, gives a Catalogue of the Husbandman's Tools, ſpecifies the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments pecultar to each Seaſon, deſcribes the changes of the Weather, with the Signs in Heaven and Earth that fore-bode them. Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces many of the Prodigies that happen'd near the time of</hi> Julius Caeſar<hi>'s Death.

                        <p>Virgil <hi>has taken care to raiſe the Subject of each Georgic: In the Firſt he has only dead Matter on which to work. In the ſecond he juſt ſteps on the World of Life, and deſcribes that degree of it which is to be found in Vegetables. In the third he advances to Animals. And in the laſt, ſingles out the Bee, which may be reckon'd the moſt ſagacious of 'em, for his Subject.</hi>
                        </p>

                  <p>A HEROICK Poem, truly ſuch, is undoubtedly the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Work which the Soul of Man is capable to perform. The Deſign of it, is to form the Mind to Heroick Virtue by Example; 'tis convey'd in Verſe, that it may delight, while it inſtructs: The Action of it is always one, entire, and great. The leaſt and moſt trivial Epiſodes, or under-Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are interwoven in it, are parts either neceſſary, or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to carry on the main Deſign. Either ſo neceſſary, that without them the Poem muſt be Imperfect, or ſo convenient, that no others can be imagin'd more ſuitable to the place in which they are. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be left void in a firm Building; even the Cavities ought not to be fill'd with Rubbiſh, which is of a periſhable kind, deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the ſtrength: But with Brick or Stone, though of leſs pieces, yet of the ſame Nature, and fitted to the Cranies. Even the leaſt por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them muſt be of the Epick kind; all things muſt be Grave, Majeſtical, and Sublime: Nothing of a Foreign Nature, like the trifling <hi>Novels,</hi> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and others have inſerted in their Poems. By which the Reader is miſs-led into another ſort of Pleaſure, oppoſite to that which is deſign'd in an Epick Poem. One raiſes the Soul and hardens it to Virtue, the other ſoftens it again and unbends it into Vice. One conduces to the Poet's aim, the compleating of his Work; which he is driving on, labouring and haſt'ning in every Line: the other ſlackens his pace, diverts him from his Way, and locks him up like a Knight Errant in an Enchanted Caſtle, when he ſhould be purſuing his firſt Adventure. <hi>Statius,</hi> as <hi>Boſſu</hi> has well obſerv'd, was ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of trying his ſtrength with his Maſter <hi>Virgil,</hi> as <hi>Virgil</hi> had before try'd his with <hi>Homer.</hi> The <hi>Grecian</hi> gave the two <hi>Romans</hi> an Example, in the Games which were Celebrated at the Funerals of <hi>Patroclus. Virgil</hi> imitated the Invention of <hi>Homer,</hi> but chang'd the Sports. But both the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Poet, took their occaſions from the Subject; though to confeſs the Truth, they were both Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, or at beſt, convenient parts of it, rather than of neceſſity ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb facs="tcp:43031:138"/>
from it. <hi>Statius,</hi> who through his whole Poem, is noted for want of Conduct and Judgment; inſtead of ſtaying, as he might have done, for the Death of <hi>Capaneus, Hippomedon, Tideus,</hi> or ſome other of his Seven Champions, (who are Heroes all alike) or more properly for the Tragical end of the two Brothers, whoſe Exequies the next Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor had leiſure to perform, when the Siege was rais'd, and in the Interval betwixt the Poets firſt Action, and his ſecond; went out of his way, as it were on propenſe Malice to commit a Fault. For he took his opportunity to kill a Royal Infant, by the means of a Serpent, (that Author of all Evil) to make way for thoſe Funeral Honours, which he intended for him. Now if this Innocent had been of any Relation to his <hi>Thebais;</hi> if he had either farther'd or hinder'd the taking of the Town, the Poet might have found ſome ſorry Excuſe at leaſt, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Reader from the promis'd Siege. I can think of nothing to plead for him, but what I verily believe he thought himſelf; which was, that as the Funerals of <hi>Anchiſes</hi> were ſolemniz'd in <hi>Sicily,</hi> ſo thoſe of <hi>Archemorus</hi> ſhould be celebrated in <hi>Candy.</hi> For the laſt was an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland; and a better than the firſt, becauſe <hi>Jove</hi> was Born there. On theſe terms, this <hi>Capaneus</hi> of a Poet ingag'd his two Immortal Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, and his Succeſs was anſwerable to his Enterpriſe.</p>
                  <p>If this Oeconomy muſt be obſerv'd in the minuteſt Parts of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick Poem, which, to a common Reader, ſeem to be detach'd from the Body, and almoſt independent of it; what Soul, tho' ſent into the World with great advantages of Nature, cultivated with the liberal Arts and Sciences; converſant with Hiſtories of the Dead, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd with Obſervations on the Living, can be ſufficient to inform the whole Body of ſo great a Work? I touch here but tranſiently, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſtrict Method, on ſome few of thoſe many Rules of imitating Nature, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> drew from <hi>Homer</hi>'s Iliads and Odyſſes, and which he fitted to the <hi>Drama;</hi> furniſhing himſelf alſo with Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the Practice of the Theater, when it flouriſh'd under <hi>Aeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilus, Eurypides,</hi> and <hi>Sophocles.</hi> For the Original of the Stage was from the Epick Poem. Narration, doubtleſs, preceded Acting, and gave Laws to it: What at firſt was told Artfully, was, in proceſs of time, repreſented gracefully to the ſight, and hearing. Thoſe Epiſodes of <hi>Homer,</hi> which were proper for the Stage, the Poets amplify'd each into an Action: Out of his Limbs they form'd their Bodies: What he had Contracted they Enlarg'd: Out of one <hi>Hercules</hi> were made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite of Pigmies; yet all endued with humane Souls: For from him, their great Creator, they have each of them the <hi>Divinae particulam Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae.</hi> They flow'd from him at firſt, and are at laſt reſolv'd into him. Nor were they only animated by him, but their Meaſure and Symetry was owing to him. His one, entire, and great Action was Copied by them according to the proportions of the <hi>Drama:</hi> If he finiſh'd his Orb within the Year, it ſuffic'd to teach them, that their Action being leſs, and being alſo leſs diverſify'd with Incidents, their Orb, of conſequence, muſt be circumſcrib'd in a leſs compaſs, which they reduc'd, within the limits either of a Natural or an Artificial Day. So that as he taught them to amplifie what he had ſhorten'd, by the ſame Rule apply'd the contrary way, he taught them to ſhorten what he had amplifi'd. Tragedy is the minature of Humane Life; an Epick Poem is the draught at length. Here, my Lord, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract alſo, for, before I was aware, I was almoſt running into a long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, to prove that there is no ſuch abſolute neceſſity that the
<pb facs="tcp:43031:138"/>
time of a Stage-Action ſhou'd ſo ſtrictly be confin'd to Twenty Four Hours, as never to exceed them, for which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> contends, and the <hi>Grecian</hi> Stage has practis'd. Some longer ſpace, on ſome occaſions, I think may be allow'd, eſpecially for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Theater, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more variety of Incidents than the <hi>French. Corneille</hi> himſelf, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long Practice, was inclin'd to think, that the time allotted by the Ancients was too ſhort to raiſe and finiſh a great Action: And better a Mechanick Rule were ſtretch'd or broken, than a great Beauty were omitted. To raiſe, and afterwards to calm the Paſſions, to purge the Soul from Pride, by the Examples of Humane Miſeries, which befall the greateſt; in few words, to expel Arrogance, and introduce Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, are the great effects of Tragedy. Great, I muſt confeſs, if they were altogether as true as they are pompous. But are Habits to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd at three Hours warning? Are radical Diſeaſes ſo ſuddenly remov'd? A Mountebank may promiſe ſuch a Cure, but a skilful Phyſician will not undertake it. An Epick Poem is not in ſo much haſte; it works leiſurely; the Changes which it makes are ſlow; but the Cure is likely to be more perfect. The effects of Tragedy, as I ſaid, are too violent to be laſting. If it be anſwer'd that for this Reaſon Tragedies are often to be ſeen, and the Doſe to be repeated; this is tacitely to confeſs, that there is more Virtue in one Heroick Poem than in many Tragedies. A Man is humbled one Day, and his Pride returns the next. Chymical Medicines are obſerv'd to Relieve oft'ner than to Cure: For 'tis the nature of Spirits to make ſwift impreſſions, but not deep. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenical</hi> Decoctions, to which I may properly compare an Epick Poem, have more of Body in them; they work by their ſubſtance and their weight. It is one Reaſon of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s to prove, that Tragedy is the more Noble, becauſe it turns in a ſhorter Compaſs; the whole Action being circumſcrib'd within the ſpace of Four-and-Twenty Hours. He might prove as well that a Muſhroom is to be preferr'd before a Peach, becauſe it ſhoots up in the compaſs of a Night. A Chariot may be driven round the Pillar in leſs ſpace than a large Machine, becauſe the Bulk is not ſo great: Is the <hi>Moon</hi> a more Noble Planet than <hi>Saturn,</hi> becauſe ſhe makes her Revolution in leſs than Thirty Days, and He in little leſs than Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years? Both their Orbs are in proportion to their ſeveral Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; and, conſequently, the quickneſs or ſlowneſs of their Motion, and the time of their circumvolutions, is no Argument of the greater or leſs Perfection. And beſides, what Virtue is there in a Tragedy, which is not contain'd in an Epick Poem? Where Pride is humbled, Vertue rewarded, and Vice puniſh'd; and thoſe more amply treated, than the narrowneſs of the <hi>Drama</hi> can admit? The ſhining Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiy of an Epick Heroe, his Magnanimity, his Conſtancy, his Patience, his Piety, or whatever Characteriſtical Virtue his Poet gives him, raiſes firſt our Admiration: We are naturally prone to imitate what we admire: And frequent Acts produce a habit. If the Hero's chief quality be vicious, as for Example, the Choler and obſtinate deſire of Vengeance in <hi>Achilles,</hi> yet the Moral is Inſtructive: And beſides, we are inform'd in the very propoſition of the <hi>Iliads,</hi> that this anger was pernicious: That it brought a thouſand ills on the <hi>Grecian</hi> Camp. The Courage of <hi>Achilles</hi> is propos'd to imitation, not his Pride and Diſobedience to his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, nor his brutal Cruelty to his dead Enemy, nor the ſelling his Body to his Father. We abhor theſe Actions while we read them, and what we abhor we never imitate: The Poet only ſhews them like Rocks or Quick-Sands, to be ſhun'd.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:43031:139"/>
By this Example the Criticks have concluded that it is not neceſſary the Manners of the Heroe ſhould be virtuous. They are Poetically good if they are of a Piece. Though where a Character of perfect Virtue is ſet before us, 'tis more lovely: for there the whole Heroe is to be imitated. This is the <hi>Aeneas</hi> of our Author: this is that Idea of perfection in an Epick Poem, which Painters and Statuaries have only in their minds; and which no hands are able to expreſs. Theſe are the Beauties of a God in a Humane Body. When the Picture of <hi>Achilles</hi> is drawn in Tragedy, he is taken with thoſe Warts, and Moles, and hard Features, by thoſe who repreſent him on the Stage, or he is no more <hi>Achilles:</hi> for his Creatour <hi>Homer</hi> has ſo deſcrib'd him. Yet even thus he appears a perfect Heroe, though an imperfect Character of Vertue. <hi>Horace</hi> Paints him after <hi>Homer,</hi> and delivers him to be Copied on the Stage with all thoſe imperfections. Therefore they are either not faults in a Heroick Poem, or faults common to the <hi>Drama.</hi> After all, on the whole merits of the Cauſe, it muſt be acknowledg'd that the Epick Poem is more for the Manners, and Tragedy for the Paſſions. The Paſſions, as I have ſaid, are violent: and acute Diſtempers require Medicines of a ſtrong and ſpeedy operation. Ill habits of the Mind are like Chronical Diſeaſes, to be corrected by degrees, and Cur'd by Alteratives: wherein though Purges are ſometimes neceſſary, yet Diet, good Air, and moderate Exerciſe, have the greateſt part. The Matter being thus ſtated, it will appear that both ſorts of Poetry are of uſe for their proper ends. The Stage is more active, the Epick Poem works at greater leiſure, yet is active too, when need requires. For Dialogue is imitated by the <hi>Drama,</hi> from the more active parts of it. One puts off a Fit like the <hi>Quinquina,</hi> and relieves us only for a time; the other roots out the Diſtemper, and gives a healthful habit. The Sun en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens and chears us, diſpels Fogs, and warms the ground with his daily Beams; but the Corn is ſow'd, increaſes, is ripen'd, and is reap'd for uſe in proceſs of time, and in its proper Seaſon. I proceed from the greatneſs of the Action, to the Dignity of the Actours, I mean to the Perſons employ'd in both Poems. There likewiſe Tragedy will be ſeen to borrow from the <hi>Epopee;</hi> and that which borrows is always of leſs Dignity, becauſe it has not of its own. A Subject, 'tis true, may lend to his Soveraign, but the act of borrowing makes the King inferiour, becauſe he wants, and the Subject ſupplies. And ſuppoſe the Perſons of the <hi>Drama</hi> wholly Fabulous, or of the Poet's Invention, yet Heroick Poetry gave him the Examples of that Invention, becauſe it was firſt, and <hi>Homer</hi> the common Father of the Stage. I know not of any one advantage, which Tragedy can boaſt above Heroick Poetry, but that it is repreſented to the view, as well as read: and inſtructs in the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, as well as on the Theatre. This is an uncontended Excellence, and a chief Branch of its Prerogative; yet I may be allow'd to ſay without partiality, that herein the Actors ſhare the Poet's praiſe. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip knows ſome Modern Tragedies which are beautiful on the Stage, and yet I am confident you wou'd not read them. <hi>Tryphon</hi> the Stationer complains they are ſeldom ask'd for in his Shop. The Poet who Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd in the Scene, is damn'd in the <hi>Ruelle;</hi> nay more, he is not eſteem'd a good Poet by thoſe who ſee and hear his Extravagancies with delight. They are a ſort of ſtately Fuſtian, and lofty Childiſhneſs. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Nature can give a ſincere pleaſure; where that is not imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, 'tis Groteſque Painting, the fine Woman ends in a Fiſhes Tail.</p>
                  <p>I might alſo add, that many things, which not only pleaſe, but are
<pb facs="tcp:43031:139"/>
real Beauties in the reading, wou'd appear abſurd upon the Stage: and thoſe not only the <hi>Specioſa Miracula,</hi> as <hi>Horace</hi> calls them; of Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, of <hi>Scylla, Antiphates,</hi> and the <hi>Leſtrigons,</hi> which cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented even in Opera's; but the proweſs of <hi>Achilles</hi> or <hi>Aeneas</hi> wou'd appear ridiculous in our Dwarf-Heroes of the Theatre. We can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they routed Armies in <hi>Homer</hi> or in <hi>Virgil,</hi> but <hi>ne Hercules contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duos</hi> in the <hi>Drama.</hi> I forbear to inſtance in many things which the Stage cannot or ought not to repreſent. For I have ſaid already more than I intended on this Subject, and ſhou'd fear it might be turn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; that I plead for the pre-eminence of Epick Poetry, becauſe I have taken ſome pains in tranſlating <hi>Virgil;</hi> if this were the firſt time that I had deliver'd my Opinion in this Diſpute. But I have more than once already maintain'd the Rights of my two Maſters againſt their Rivals of the Scene, even while I wrote Tragedies my ſelf, and had no thoughts of this preſent Undertaking. I ſubmit my Opinion to your Judgment, who are better qualified than any Man I know to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide this Controverſie. You come, my Lord, inſtructed in the Cauſe, and needed not that I ſhou'd open it. Your Eſſay of Poetry, which was publiſh'd without a Name, and of which I was not honour'd with the Confidence, I read over and over with much delight, and as much inſtruction: and, without flattering you, or making my ſelf more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral than I am, not without ſome Envy. I was loath to be inform'd how an Epick Poem ſhou'd be written, or how a Tragedy ſhou'd be contriv'd and manag'd in better Verſe and with more judgment than I cou'd teach others. A Native of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> and bred up in the Studies of its Fundamental Laws, may receive new Lights from his Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries, but 'tis a grudging kind of praiſe which he gives his Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. He is more oblig'd than he is willing to acknowledge: there is a tincture of Malice in his Commendations. For where I own I am taught, I confeſs my want of Knowledge. A Judge upon the Bench, may, out of good Nature, or at leaſt intereſt, encourage the Pleadings of a puny Councellor, but he does not willingly commend his Brother Serjeant at the Bar, eſpecially when he controuls his Law, and expoſes that ignorance which is made Sacred by his Place. I gave the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Author his due Commendation, I muſt conſeſs, but who can anſwer for me, and for the reſt of the Poets, who heard me read the Poem, whether we ſhou'd not have been better pleas'd to have ſeen our own Names at the bottom of the Title Page? perhaps we commended it the more, that we might ſeem to be above the Cenſure. We are naturally diſpleas'd with an unknown Critick, as the Ladies are with a Lampooner, becauſe we are bitten in the dark, and know not where to faſten our Revenge. But great Excellencies will work their way through all ſorts of oppoſition. I applauded rather out of decency than Affection; and was Ambitious, as ſome yet can witneſs, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a Man, with whom I had the honour to Converſe, and that almoſt daily, for ſo many years together. Heaven knows if I have heartily forgiven you this deceit. You extorted a Praiſe which I ſhou'd willingly have given had I known you. Nothing had been more eaſie than to commend a Patron of a long ſtanding. The World wou'd joyn with me, if the Encomiums were juſt; and if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, wou'd excuſe a grateful Flatterer. But to come <hi>Anonymous</hi> upon me, and force me to commend you againſt my intereſt, was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo fair, give me leave to ſay, as it was Politick. For by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing your Quality, you might clearly underſtand how your Work
<pb facs="tcp:43031:140"/>
ſucceeded; and that the general approbation was given to your Merit not your Titles. Thus like <hi>Apelles</hi> you ſtood unſeen behind your own <hi>Venus,</hi> and receiv'd the praiſes of the paſſing Multitude: the Work was commended, not the Author: And I doubt not this was one of the moſt pleaſing Adventures of your Life.</p>
                  <p>I have detain'd your Lordſhip longer than I intended in this Diſpute of preference betwixt the Epick Poem, and the <hi>Dramae:</hi> and yet have not formally anſwer'd any of the Arguments which are brought by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> on the other ſide, and ſet in the faireſt light by <hi>Dacier.</hi> But I ſuppoſe, without looking on the Book, I may have touch'd on ſome of the Objections. For in this Addreſs to your Lordſhip, I deſign not a Treatiſe of Heroick Poetry, but write in a looſe Epiſtolary way, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what tending to that Subject, after the Example of <hi>Horace,</hi> in his Firſt Epiſtle of the Second Book to <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> and of that to the <hi>Piſo</hi>'s, which we call his <hi>Art of Poetry.</hi> In both of which he obſerves no Method that I can trace, whatever <hi>Scaliger</hi> the Father, or <hi>Heinſius</hi> may have ſeen, or rather think they had ſeen. I have taken up, laid down, and reſum'd as often as I pleas'd the ſame Subject: and this looſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding I ſhall uſe thro' all this Prefatory Dedication. Yet all this while I have been Sailing with ſome ſide-wind or other toward the Point I propos'd in the beginning; the Greatneſs and Excellency of an Heroick Poem, with ſome of the difficulties which attend that work. The Compariſon therefore which I made betwixt the <hi>Epopee</hi> and the Tragedy was not altogether a digreſſion; for 'tis concluded on all hands, that they are both the Maſter-pieces of Humane Wit.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time I may be bold to draw this Corollary from what has been already ſaid, That the File of Heroick Poets is very ſhort: all are not ſuch who have aſſum'd that lofty Title in Ancient or Modern Ages, or have been ſo eſteem'd by their partial and ignorant Admirers.</p>
                  <p>There have been but one great <hi>Ilias</hi> and one <hi>Aeneis</hi> in ſo many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. The next, but the next with a long interval betwixt, was the <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> I mean not ſo much in diſtance of time, as in Excellency. After theſe three are entred, ſome Lord Chamberlain ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, ſome Critick of Authority ſhou'd be ſet before the door, to keep out a Crowd of little Poets, who preſs for Admiſſion, and are not of Quality. <hi>Maevius</hi> wou'd be deafning your Lordſhip's Ears with his
<q>Fortunam Priami, Cantabo, &amp; Nobile Bellum.</q>
meer Fuſtian, as <hi>Horace</hi> would tell you from behind, without preſſing forward, and more ſmoak than fire. <hi>Pulci, Boyardo,</hi> and <hi>Arioſto,</hi> wou'd cry out, make room for the <hi>Italian</hi> Poets, the deſcendants of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> in a right Line. Father <hi>Le Moin</hi> with his Saint <hi>Louis;</hi> and <hi>Scudery</hi> with his <hi>Alaric,</hi> for a godly King, and a <hi>Gothick</hi> Conquerour; and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelain</hi> wou'd take it ill that his Maid ſhou'd be refus'd a place with <hi>Helen</hi> and <hi>Lavinia. Spencer</hi> has a better plea for his <hi>Fairy-Queen,</hi> had his action been finiſh'd, or had been one. And <hi>Milton,</hi> if the Devil had not been his Heroe inſtead of <hi>Adam,</hi> if the Gyant had not foil'd the Knight, and driven him out of his ſtrong hold, to wander through the World with his Lady Errant: and if there had not been more Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Perſons than Humane, in his Poem. After theſe, the reſt of our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Poets ſhall not be mention'd. I have that Honour for them which I ought to have: but if they are Worthies, they are not to be rank'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb facs="tcp:43031:140"/>
the three whom I have nam'd, and who are eſtabliſh'd in their Reputation.</p>
                  <p>Before I quitted the Compariſon betwixt Epick Poetry and Tragedy, I ſhou'd have acquainted my Judge with one advantage of the former over the latter, which I now caſually remember out of the Preface of <hi>Segrais</hi> before his Tranſlation of the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> or out of <hi>Boſſu,</hi> no matter which. The ſtile of the Heroick Poem is and ought to be more lofty than that of the <hi>Drama.</hi> The Critick is certainly in the right, for the Reaſon already urg'd: The work of Tragedy is on the Paſſions, and in Dialogue, both of them abhor ſtrong Metaphors, in which the <hi>Epopee</hi> delights. A Poet cannot ſpeak too plainly on the Stage: for <hi>Volat irrevocabile verbum;</hi> the ſenſe is loſt if it be not taken flying: but what we read alone we have leiſure to digeſt. There an Author may beautifie his Senſe by the boldneſs of his Expreſſion, which if we underſtand not fully at the firſt, we may dwell upon it, 'till we find the ſecret force and excellence. That which cures the Manners by alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Phyſick, as I ſaid before, muſt proceed by inſenſible degrees; but that which purges the Paſſions, muſt do its buſineſs all at once, or wholly fail of its effect, at leaſt in the preſent Operation, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repeated Doſes. We muſt beat the Iron while 'tis hot, but we may poliſh it at leiſure. Thus, my Lord, you pay the Fine of my forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and yet the merits of both Cauſes are where they were, and undecided, 'till you declare whether it be more for the benefit of Mankind to have their Manners in general corrected, or their Pride and hard-heartedneſs remov'd.</p>
                  <p>I muſt now come cloſer to my preſent buſineſs: and not think of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more invaſive Wars abroad, when like <hi>Hannibal,</hi> I am call'd back to the defence of my own Country. <hi>Virgil</hi> is attack'd by many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: He has a whole Confederacy againſt him, and I muſt endeavour to defend him as well as I am able. But their principal Objections being againſt his Moral, the duration or length of time taken up in the action of the Poem, and what they have to urge againſt the Manners of his Hero, I ſhall omit the reſt as meer Cavils of Grammarians: at the worſt but caſual ſlips of a Great Man's Pen, or inconſiderable faults of an admirable Poem, which the Author had not leiſure to review be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death. <hi>Macrobius</hi> has anſwer'd what the Ancients cou'd urge againſt him: and ſome things I have lately read in <hi>Tanneguy le Fevrè, Valois,</hi> and another whom I name not, which are ſcarce worth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering. They begin with the Moral of his Poem, which I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where confeſs'd, and ſtill muſt own not to be ſo Noble as that of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi> But let both be fairly ſtated, and without contradicting my firſt Opinion, I can ſhew that <hi>Virgil</hi>'s was as uſeful to the <hi>Romans</hi> of his Age, as <hi>Homer</hi>'s was to the <hi>Grecians</hi> of his; in what time ſoever he may be ſuppos'd to have liv'd and flouriſh'd. <hi>Homer</hi>'s Moral was to urge the neceſſity of Union, and of a good underſtanding betwixt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate States and Princes engag'd in a War with a Mighty Monarch: as alſo of Diſcipline in an Army, and obedience in the ſeveral Chiefs, to the Supream Commander of the joynt Forces. To inculcate this, he ſets forth the ruinous Effects of Diſcord in the Camp of thoſe Allies, occaſion'd by the quarrel betwixt the General, and one of the next in Office under him. <hi>Agamemnon</hi> gives the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and <hi>Achilles</hi> reſents the injury. Both Parties are faulty in the Quarrel, and accordingly they are both puniſh'd: the Agreſſor is forc'd to ſue for peace to his Inferiour, on diſhonourable Conditions; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerter
<pb facs="tcp:43031:141"/>
reſuſes the ſatisfaction offer'd, and his Obſtinacy coſts him his beſt Friend. This works the Natural Effect of Choler, and turns his Rage againſt him, by whom he was laſt Affronted, and moſt ſenſib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The greater Anger expels the leſs; but his Caracter is ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd. In the mean time the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army receives Loſs on Loſs, and is half deſtroy'd by a Peſtilence into the Bargain.</p>
                  <q>Quicquid delirant Reges plectuntur Achivi.</q>
                  <p>As the Poet, in the firſt part of the Example, had ſhewn the bad effects of Diſcord, ſo after the Reconcilement, he gives the good effects of Unity. For <hi>Hector</hi> is ſlain, and then <hi>Troy</hi> muſt fall. By this, 'tis probable, that <hi>Homer</hi> liv'd when the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy was grown formidable to the <hi>Grecians:</hi> and that the joint Endeavours of his Country-men, were little enough to preſerve their common Freedom, from an encroaching Enemy. Such was his Moral, which all Criticks have allow'd to be more Noble than that of <hi>Virgil:</hi> though not adapted to the times in which the <hi>Roman</hi> Poet liv'd. Had <hi>Virgil</hi> flouriſh'd in the Age of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and addreſs'd to <hi>Scipio,</hi> he had probably taken the ſame Moral, or ſome other not unlike it. For then the <hi>Romans</hi> were in as much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Commonwealth, as the <hi>Grecians</hi> were from the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy. But we are to conſider him as writing his Poem in a time when the Old Form of Government was ſubverted, and a new one juſt Eſtabliſhed by <hi>Octavius Caeſar:</hi> In effect by force of Arms, but ſeemingly by the Conſent of the <hi>Roman</hi> People. The Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth had receiv'd a deadly Wound in the former Civil Wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla.</hi> The Commons, while the firſt prevail'd, had almoſt ſhaken off the Yoke of the Nobility; and <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Cinna,</hi> like the Captains of the Mobb, under the ſpecious Pretence of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good, and of doing Juſtice on the Oppreſſours of their Liberty, reveng'd themſelves, without Form of Law, on their private Enemies. <hi>Sylla,</hi> in his turn, proſcrib'd the Heads of the adverſe Party: He too had nothing but Liberty and Reformation in his Mouth; (for the Cauſe of Religion is but a Modern Motive to Rebellion, invented by the Chriſtian Prieſthood, refining on the Heathen:) <hi>Sylla,</hi> to be ſure, meant no more good to the <hi>Roman</hi> People than <hi>Marius</hi> before him, whatever he declar'd; but Sacrific'd the Lives, and took the Eſtates of all his Enemies, to gratifie thoſe who brought him into Power: Such was the Reformation of the Government by both Parties. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and the Commons were the two Baſes on which it ſtood; and the two Champions of either Faction, each deſtroy'd the Foundations of the other ſide: So the Fabrique of conſequence muſt fall betwxt them: And Tyranny muſt be built upon their Ruines. This comes of altering Fundamental Laws and Conſtitutions. Like him, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in good Health, lodg'd himſelf in a Phyſician's Houſe, and was over-perſwaded by his Landlord to take Phyſick, of which he dyed, for the benefit of his Doctor. <hi>Stavo ben</hi> (was written on his Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>ma, perſtar meglio, ſto qui.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Death of thoſe two Uſurpers, the Commonwealth ſeem'd to recover, and held up its Head for a little time: But it was all the while in a deep Conſumption, which is a flattering Diſeaſe. <hi>Pompey, Craſſus,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> had found the Sweets of Arbitrary Power; and each being a check to the others growth, ſtruck up a falſe Friendſhip amongſt themſelves; and divided the Government betwixt them,
<pb facs="tcp:43031:141"/>
which none of them was able to aſſume alone. Theſe were the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Spirited Men of their Age, that is, Patriots for their own Intereſt. The Commonwealth look'd with a florid Countenance in their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, ſpread in Bulk, and all the while was waſting in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. Not to trouble your Lordſhip with the Repetition of what you know: After the death of <hi>Craſſus, Pompey</hi> found himſelf out-witted by <hi>Caeſar;</hi> broke with him, over-power'd him in the Senate, and caus'd many unjuſt Decrees to paſs againſt him: <hi>Caeſar</hi> thus injur'd, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reſiſt the Faction of the Nobles, which was now uppermoſt (for he was a <hi>Marian)</hi> had recourſe to Arms; and his Cauſe was juſt againſt <hi>Pompey,</hi> but not againſt his Country, whoſe Conſtitution ought to have been ſacred to him; and never to have been Violated on the account of any private Wrong. But he prevail'd, and Heav'n declaring for him, he became a Providential Monarch, under the Title of <hi>Perpetual Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> He being Murther'd by his own Son, whom I neither dare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, nor can juſtly blame (though <hi>Dante</hi> in his <hi>Inferno,</hi> has put him and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> and <hi>Judas Iſcariot</hi> betwixt them, into the great Devil's Mouth) the Commonwealth popp'd up its Head for the third time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> and then ſunk for ever.</p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Roman</hi> People were groſly gull'd: twice or thrice over: and as often enſlav'd in one Century, and under the ſame pretence of Reformation. At laſt the two Battles of <hi>Philippi,</hi> gave the deciſive ſtroak againſt Liberty; and not long after, the Commonwealth was turn'd into a Monarchy, by the Conduct and good Fortune of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> 'Tis true, that the deſpotick Power could not have fallen into better Hands, than thoſe of the firſt and ſecond <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Your Lordſhip well knows what Obligations <hi>Virgil</hi> had to the latter of them: He ſaw, beſide, that the Commonwealth was loſt without reſſource: The Heads of it deſtroy'd; the Senate new moulded, grown degenerate; and either bought off, or thruſting their own Necks into the Yoke, out of fear of being forc'd. Yet I may ſafely affirm for our great Author (as Men of good Senſe are generally Honeſt) that he was ſtill of Republick principles in Heart.</p>
                  <q>Secretiſque Piis, his dantem jura Catonem.</q>
                  <p>I think, I need uſe no other Argument to juſtify my Opinion, than that of this one Line, taken from the Eighth Book of the <hi>Eneis.</hi> If he had not well ſtudied his Patron's Temper, it might have Ruin'd him with another Prince. But <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was not diſcontented, at leaſt that we can find, that <hi>Cato</hi> was plac'd, by his own Poet, in <hi>Eliſium;</hi> and there giving Laws to the Holy Souls, who deſerv'd to be ſeparated from the Vulgar ſort of good Spirits. For his Conſcience could not but whiſper to the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Monarch, that the Kings of <hi>Rome</hi> were at firſt Elective, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd not without a Senate: That <hi>Romulus</hi> was no Hereditary Prince, and though, after his Death, he receiv'd Divine Honours, for the good he did on Earth, yet he was but a God of their own making: that the laſt <hi>Tarquin</hi> was Expell'd juſtly, for Overt-Acts of Tyranny, and Male-Adminiſtration; for ſuch are the Conditions of an Elective Kingdom: And I meddle not with others: being, for my own Opinion, of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigns</hi> Principles, that an Honeſt Man ought to be contented with that Form of Government, and with thoſe Fundamental Conſtitutions of it, which he receiv'd from his Anceſtors, and under which himſelf was
<pb facs="tcp:43031:142"/>
Born: Though at the ſame time he confeſs'd freely, that if he could have choſen his Place of Birth, it ſhou'd have been at <hi>Venice:</hi> Which for many Reaſons I diſlike, and am better pleas'd to have been born an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man.</p>
                  <p>But to return from my long rambling: I ſay that <hi>Virgil</hi> having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely weigh'd the Condition of the Times in which he liv'd: that an entire Liberty was not to be retriev'd: that the preſent Settlement had the proſpect of a long continuance in the ſame Family, or thoſe adopted into it: that he held his Paternal Eſtate from the Bounty of the Conqueror, by whom he was likewiſe enrich'd, eſteem'd and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd: that this Conquerour, though of a bad kind, was the very beſt of it: that the Arts of Peace flouriſh'd under him: that all Men might be happy if they would be quiet: that now he was in poſſeſſion of the whole, yet he ſhar'd a great part of his Authority with the Senate: That he would be choſen into the Ancient Offices of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and Rul'd by the Power which he deriv'd from them; and Prorogu'd his Government from time to time: Still, as it were, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to diſmiſs himſelf from Publick Cares, which he exercis'd more for the common Good, than for any delight he took in greatneſs: Theſe things, I ſay, being conſider'd by the Poet, he concluded it to be the Intereſt of his Country to be ſo Govern'd: To infuſe an awful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect into the People, towards ſuch a Prince: By that reſpect to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their Obedience to him; and by that Obedience to make them Happy. This was the Moral of his Divine Poem: Honeſt in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et: Honourable to the Emperour, whom he derives from a Divine Extraction; and reflecting part of that Honour on the <hi>Roman</hi> People, whom he derives alſo from the <hi>Trojans;</hi> and not only profitable, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the preſent Age; and likely to be ſuch to their Poſterity. That it was the receiv'd Opinion, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were deſcended from the <hi>Trojans,</hi> and <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> from <hi>Julus</hi> the Son of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> was enough for <hi>Virgil;</hi> tho' perhaps he thought not ſo himſelf: Or that <hi>Aeneas</hi> ever was in <hi>Italy,</hi> which <hi>Bochartus</hi> manifeſtly proves. And <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> where he ſays that <hi>Jupiter</hi> hated the Houſe of <hi>Priam,</hi> and was reſolv'd to transfer the Kingdom to the Family of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> yet mentions nothing of his leading a Colony into a Foreign Country, and ſetling there: But that the <hi>Romans</hi> valued themſelves on their <hi>Trojan</hi> Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, is ſo undoubted a Truth, that I need not prove it. Even the Seals which we have remaining of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> which we know to be Antique, have the Star of <hi>Venus</hi> over them, though they were all graven after his Death, as a Note that he was Deifi'd. I doubt not but it was one Reaſon, why <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſhould be ſo paſſionately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for the preſervation of the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> which its Author had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to be Burnt, as an Imperfect Poem, by his laſt Will and Teſtament; was, becauſe it did him a real Service as well as an Honour; that a Work ſhould not be loſt where his Divine Original was Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Verſe, which had the Character of Immortality ſtamp'd upon it.</p>
                  <p>Neither were the great <hi>Roman</hi> Families which flouriſh'd in his time, leſs oblig'd by him than the Emperour. Your Lordſhip knows with what Addreſs he makes mention of them, as Captains of Ships, or Leaders in the War; and even ſome of <hi>Italian</hi> Extraction are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. Theſe are the ſingle Stars which are ſprinkled through the <hi>Aeneis:</hi> But there are whole Conſtellations of them in the Fifth Book. And I could not but take notice, when I Tranſlated it, of ſome Favourite
<pb facs="tcp:43031:142"/>
Families to which he gives the Victory, and awards the Prizes, in the Perſon of his Heroe, at the Funeral Games which were Celebrated in Honour of <hi>Anchiſes.</hi> I, Inſiſt not on their Names: But am pleas'd to find the <hi>Memmii</hi> amongſt them, deriv'd from <hi>Mneſtheus,</hi> becauſe <hi>Lucretius</hi> Dedicates to one of that Family, a Branch of which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd <hi>Corinth.</hi> I likewiſe either found or form'd an Image to my ſelf of the contrary kind; that thoſe who loſt the Prizes, were ſuch as had diſoblig'd the Poet, or were in diſgrace with <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> or Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to <hi>Mecenas:</hi> And this was the Poetical Revenge he took. For <hi>genus irritabile Vatum,</hi> as <hi>Horace</hi> ſays. When a Poet is throughly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd, he will do himſelf Juſtice, however dear it coſt him, <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamque, in Vulnere ponit.</hi> I think theſe are not bare Imaginations of my own, though I find no trace of them in the Commentatours: But one Poet may judge of another by himſelf. The Vengeance we defer, is not forgotten. I hinted before, that the whole <hi>Roman</hi> People were oblig'd by <hi>Virgil,</hi> in deriving them from <hi>Troy;</hi> an Anceſtry which they affected. We, and the <hi>French</hi> are of the ſame Humour: They would be thought to deſcend from a Son, I think, of <hi>Hector:</hi> And we wou'd have our <hi>Britain,</hi> both Nam'd and Planted by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant of <hi>Aeneas. Spencer</hi> favours this Opinion what he can. His Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> or whoever he intends by him, is a <hi>Trojan.</hi> Thus the Heroe of <hi>Homer</hi> was a <hi>Grecian,</hi> of <hi>Virgil</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> of <hi>Taſſo</hi> an <hi>Italian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have tranſgreſs'd my Bounds, and gone farther than the Moral led me. But if your Lordſhip is not tir'd, I am ſafe enough.</p>
                  <p>Thus far, I think, my Author is defended. But as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> is ſtill ſhadow'd in the Perſon of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> of which I ſhall ſay more, when I come to the Manners which the Poet gives his Hero: I muſt prepare that Subject by ſhewing how dext'rouſly he mannag'd both the Prince and People, ſo as to diſpleaſe neither, and to do good to both, which is the part of a Wiſe and an Honeſt Man: And proves that it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a Courtier not to be a Knave: I ſhall continue ſtill to ſpeak my Thoughts like a free-born Subject as I am; though ſuch things, perhaps, as no <hi>Dutch</hi> Commentator cou'd, and I am ſure no <hi>French-</hi>man durſt. I have already told your Lordſhip my Opinion of <hi>Virgil;</hi> that he was no Arbitrary Man. Oblig'd he was to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter for his Bounty, and he repays him with good Counſel, how to behave himſelf in his new Monarchy, ſo as to gain the Affections of his Subjects, and deſerve to be call'd the Father of his Country. From this Conſideration it is, that he choſe for the ground-work of his Poem, one Empire deſtroy'd, and another rais'd from the Ruins of it. This was juſt the Parallel. <hi>Aeneas</hi> cou'd not pretend to be <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>'s Heir in a Lineal Succeſſion: For <hi>Anchiſes</hi> the Heroe's Father, was only of the ſecond Branch of the Royal Family: And <hi>Helenus,</hi> a Son of <hi>Priam,</hi> was yet ſurviving, and might lawfully claim before him. It may be <hi>Virgil</hi> mentions him on that Account. Neither has he forgotten <hi>Atis,</hi> in the Fifth of his <hi>Aeneis,</hi> the Son of <hi>Polites,</hi> young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Son to <hi>Priam;</hi> who was ſlain by <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> in the Second Book. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> then, the Favourite Companion of <hi>Aſcanius,</hi> had a better Right than he; tho' I know he was introduc'd by <hi>Virgil,</hi> to do Honour to the Family, from which <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was deſcended by the Mothers ſide. <hi>Aeneas</hi> had only Married <hi>Creuſa, Priam</hi>'s Daughter, and by her could have no Title, while any of the Male Iſſue were remaining. In this caſe, the Poet gave him the next Title, which is, that of an Elective King. The remaining <hi>Trojans</hi> choſe him to lead them forth,
<pb facs="tcp:43031:143"/>
and ſettle them in ſome Foreign Country. <hi>Ilioneus</hi> in his Speech to <hi>Dido,</hi> calls him expreſly by the Name of King. Our Poet, who all this while had <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in his Eye, had no deſire he ſhould ſeem to ſucceed by any right of Inheritance, deriv'd from <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar;</hi> ſuch a Title being but one degree remov'd from Conqueſt. For what was introduc'd by force, by force may be remov'd. 'Twas bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the People that they ſhould give, than he ſhould take. Since that Gift was indeed no more at bottom than a Truſt. <hi>Virgil</hi> gives us an Example of this, in the Perſon of <hi>Mezentius.</hi> He Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd Arbitrarily, he was expell'd: And came to the deſerv'd End of all Tyrants. Our Author ſhews us another ſort of Kingſhip in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Latinus.</hi> He was deſcended from <hi>Saturn,</hi> and as I remember, in the Third Degree. He is deſcrib'd a juſt and a gracious Prince; ſolicitous for the Welfare of his People; always Conſulting with his Senate to promote the common Good. We find him at the head of them, when he enters into the Council-Hall. Speaking firſt, but ſtill demanding their Advice, and ſteering by it as far as the Iniquity of the Times wou'd ſuffer him. And this is the proper Character of a King by Inheritance, who is born a Father of his Country. <hi>Aeneas,</hi> tho' he Married the Heireſs of the Crown, yet claim'd no Title to it during the Life of his Father-in-Law. <hi>Pater arma Latinus habeto,</hi> &amp;c. are <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Words. As for himſelf, he was contented to take care of his Country Gods, who were not thoſe of <hi>Latium.</hi> Wherein our Divine Author ſeems to relate to the after practice of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which was to adopt the Gods of thoſe they Conquer'd, or receiv'd as Members of their Commonwealth. Yet withal, he plainly touches at the Office of the High Prieſthood, with which <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was inveſted: And which made his Perſon more Sacred and inviolable, than even the Tribunitial Power. It was not therefore for nothing, that the moſt Judicious of all Poets, made that Office vacant, by the Death of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi> in the Second Book of the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> for his Heroe ro ſucceed in it; and conſequently for <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to enjoy. I know not that any of the Commentatours have taken notice of that paſſage. If they have not, I am ſure they ought: And if they have, I am not indebted to them for the Obſervation: The words of <hi>Virgil</hi> are very plain.</p>
                  <q>Sacra, ſuoſque tibi, commendat Troja Penates.</q>
                  <p>As for <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> or his Uncle <hi>Julius,</hi> claiming by deſcent from <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas;</hi> that Title is already out of doors. <hi>Aeneas</hi> ſucceeded not, but was Elected. <hi>Troy</hi> was fore-doom'd to fall for ever.</p>

                     <hi>Auguſtus</hi> 'tis true, had once reſolv'd to re-build that City, and there to make the Seat of Empire: But <hi>Horace</hi> writes an Ode on purpoſe to deter him from that Thought; declaring the place to be accurs'd, and that the Gods would as often deſtroy it as it ſhou'd be rais'd. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Emperour laid aſide a Project ſo ungrateful to the <hi>Roman</hi> People: But by this, my Lord, we may conclude that he had ſtill his Pedigree in his Head; and had an Itch of being thought a Divine King, if his Poets had not given him better Counſel.</p>

can make out their Charge; for 'tis levell'd at the Manners which our Poet gives his Heroe; and which are the ſame which were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſeen in his <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> Thoſe Manners were Piety to the Gods, and a dutiful Affection to his Father; Love to his Relations; Care of his People; Courage and Conduct in the Wars; Gratitude to thoſe who had oblig'd him; and Juſtice in general to Mankind.</p>
                  <p>Piety, as your Lordſhip ſees, takes place of all, as the chief part of his Character: And the word in Latin is more full than it can poſſibly be expreſt in any Modern Language; for there it comprehends not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Devotion to the Gods, but Filial Love and tender Affection to Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all ſorts. As inſtances of this, the Deities of <hi>Troy</hi> and his own <hi>Penates</hi> are made the Companions of his Flight: They appear to him in his Voyage, and adviſe him; and at laſt he re-places them in <hi>Italy,</hi> their Native Country. For his Father he takes him on his Back: He leads his little Son, his Wife follows him; but loſing his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps through Fear or Ignorance, he goes back into the midſt of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to find her; and leaves not his purſute 'till her Ghoſt appears, to forbid his farther ſearch. I will ſay nothing of his Duty to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while he liv'd; his Sorrow for his Death; of the Games inſtituted in Honour of his Memory; or ſeeking him, by his Command, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death, in the <hi>Elyſian</hi> Fields. I will not mention his Tenderneſs for his Son, which every where is viſible; Of his raiſing a Tomb for <hi>Polydorus,</hi> the Obſequies for <hi>Miſenus,</hi> his pious remembrance of <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phobus:</hi> The Funerals of his Nurſe: His Grief for <hi>Pallas,</hi> and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge taken on his Murtherer; whom, otherwiſe by his Natural Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, he had forgiven: And then the Poem had been left imperfect: For we could have had no certain proſpect of his Happineſs, while the laſt Obſtacle to it was unremov'd. Of the other parts which compoſe his Character, as a King, or as a General, I need ſay nothing: The whole <hi>Aeneis</hi> is one continued Inſtance, of ſome one or other of them: And where I find any thing of them tax'd, it ſhall ſuffice me, as brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I can, to vindicate my Divine Maſter to your Lordſhip, and by you to the Reader. But herein, <hi>Segrais,</hi> in his admirable Preface to his Tranſlation of the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> as the Author of the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s <hi>Virgil</hi> juſtly calls it; has prevented me. Him I follow; and what I borrow from him, am ready to acknowledge to him. For, impartially ſpeaking, the <hi>French</hi> are as much better Criticks than the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as they are worſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets. Thus we generally allow that they better underſtand the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of a War, than our Iſlanders; but we know we are ſuperiour to them, in the day of Battel. They value themſelves on their Generals; we on our Souldiers. But this is not the proper place to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide that Queſtion, if they make it one. I ſhall ſayperhaps as much of other Nations, and their Poets, excepting only <hi>Taſſo:</hi> and hope to make my Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion good, which is but doing Juſtice to my Country. Part of which Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour will reflect on your Lordſhip, whoſe Thoughts are always juſt; your Numbers harmonious; your Words choſen; your Expreſſions ſtrong and manly; your Verſe flowing, and your turns as happy as they are eaſie. If you wou'd ſet us more Copies, your Example would make all Precepts needleſs. In the mean time, that little you have Written is own'd, and that particularly by the Poets, (who are a Nation not over-laviſh of praiſe to their Contemporaries,) as a principal Ornament of our Language: But the ſweeteſt Eſſences are always confin'd in the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Glaſſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:43031:144"/>
When I ſpeak of your Lordſhip, 'tis never a digreſſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I need beg no pardon for it; but take up <hi>Segrais</hi> where I left him: And ſhall uſe him leſs often than I have occaſion for him. For his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face is a perfect piece of Criticiſm, full and clear, and digeſted into an exact Method; mine is looſe, and, as I intended it, Epiſtolary. Yet I dwell on many things which he durſt not touch: For 'tis dangerous to offend an Arbitrary Maſter: And every Patron who has the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> has not his Clemency. In ſhort, my Lord, I wou'd not Tranſlate him, becauſe I wou'd bring you ſomewhat of my own. His Notes and Obſervations on every Book, are of the ſame Excellency; and for the ſame Reaſon I omit the greater part.</p>
                  <p>He takes notice that <hi>Virgil</hi> is Arraign'd for placing Piety before Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and making that Piety the chief Character of his Heroe. I have ſaid already from <hi>Boſſu,</hi> that a Poet is not oblig'd to make his Heroe a Virtuous Man: Therefore neither <hi>Homer</hi> nor <hi>Taſſo</hi> are to be blam'd, for giving what predominant quality they pleas'd to their firſt Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. But <hi>Virgil,</hi> who deſign'd to form a perfect Prince, and would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, that <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> whom he calls <hi>Aeneas</hi> in his Poem, was truly ſuch, found himſelf oblig'd to make him without blemiſh; thoroughly Virtuous; and a thorough Virtue both begins and ends in Piety. <hi>Taſſo,</hi> without queſtion, obſerv'd this before me; and therefore ſplit his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe in two. He gave <hi>Godfrey</hi> Piety, and <hi>Rinaldo</hi> Fortitude; for their chief Qualities or Manners. <hi>Homer,</hi> who had choſen another Moral, makes both <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and <hi>Achilles</hi> vicious: For his deſign was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct in Virtue, by ſhewing the deformity of Vice. I avoid repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one of that I have ſaid above. What follows is Tranſlated literally from <hi>Segrais.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> had conſider'd that the greateſt Virtues of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> conſiſted in the perfect Art of Governing his People; which caus'd him to Reign for more than Forty Years in great Felicity. He conſider'd that his Emperour was Valiant, Civil, Popular, Eloquent, Politick, and Religious. He has given all theſe Qualities to <hi>Aeneas.</hi> But knowing that Piety alone comprehends the whole Duty of Man towards the Gods; towards his County, and towards his Relations, he judg'd, that this ought to be his firſt Character, whom he would ſet for a Pattern of Perfection. In reality, they who believe that the Praiſes which ariſe from Valour, are ſuperiour to thoſe, which proceed from any other Virtues, have not conſider'd (as they ought), that Valour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of other Virtues, cannot render a Man worthy of any true eſteem. That Quality which ſignifies no more than an intrepid Courage, may be ſeparated from many others which are good, and accompany'd with many which are ill. A Man may be very Valiant, and yet Impious and Vicious. But the ſame cannot be ſaid of Piety; which excludes all ill Qualities, and comprehends even Valour it ſelf, with all other Qualities which are good. Can we, for Example, give the praiſe of Valour to a Man who ſhou'd ſee his Gods prophan'd, and ſhou'd want the Courage to defend them? To a Man who ſhou'd abandon his Father, or deſert his King in his laſt Neceſſity?</p>
                  <p>Thus far <hi>Segrais,</hi> in giving the preference to Piety before Valour. I will now follow him, where he conſiders this Valour, or intrepid Courage, ſingly in it ſelf; and this alſo <hi>Virgil</hi> gives to his <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and that in a Heroical Degree.</p>
                  <p>Having firſt concluded, that our Poet did for the beſt in taking the firſt Character of his Heroe, from that Eſſential Vertue on which the
<pb facs="tcp:43031:144"/>
reſt depend, he proceeds to tell us, that in the Ten Years war of <hi>Troy,</hi> he was conſider'd as the ſecond Champion of his Country; allowing <hi>Hector</hi> the firſt place; and this, even by the Confeſſion of <hi>Homer,</hi> who took all occaſions of ſetting up his own Countrymen the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and of undervaluing the <hi>Trojan</hi> Chiefs. But <hi>Virgil,</hi> (whom <hi>Segrais</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to cite,) makes <hi>Diomede</hi> give him a higher Character for Strength and Courage. His Teſtimony is this in the Eleventh Book.</p>

                  <p>I give not here my Tranſlation of theſe Verſes; though I think I have not ill ſucceeded in them; becauſe your Lordſhip is ſo great a Maſter of the Original, that I have no reaſon to deſire you ſhou'd ſee <hi>Virgil</hi> and me ſo near together: But you may pleaſe, my Lord, to take notice, that the Latin Author refines upon the Greek; and inſinuates, That <hi>Homer</hi> had done his Heroe Wrong, in giving the advantage of the Duel to his own Country-man: Though <hi>Diomedes</hi> was manifeſtly the ſecond Champion of the <hi>Grecians:</hi> And <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> preferr'd him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ajax,</hi> when he choſe him for the Companion of his Nightly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition: For he had a Head-piece of his own; and wanted only the fortitude of another, to bring him off with ſafety; and that he might compaſs his Deſign with Honour.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> Tranſlator thus proceeds: They who accuſe <hi>Aeneas</hi> for want of Courage, either underſtand not <hi>Virgil,</hi> or have read him ſlightly; otherwiſe they would not raiſe an Objection ſo eaſie to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd: Hereupon he gives ſo many inſtances of the Heroe's Valour, that to repeat them after him would tire your Lordſhip, and put me to the unneceſſary trouble of Tranſcribing the greateſt part of the three laſt <hi>Aeneids.</hi> In ſhort, more could not be expected from an <hi>Amadis,</hi> a Sir <hi>Lancelot,</hi> or the whole round Table, than he performs. <hi>Proxima quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que metit gladio,</hi> is the perfect Account of a Knight Errant. If it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, <hi>continues Segrais,</hi> that it was not difficult for him to undertake and atchieve ſuch hardy Enterprizes, becauſe he wore Enchanted Arms. That Accuſation, in the firſt place, muſt fall on <hi>Homer</hi> e're it can reach <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil. Achilles</hi> was as well provided with them as <hi>Aeneas,</hi> though he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulnerable without them: And, <hi>Arioſto,</hi> the two <hi>Taſſo</hi>'s, <hi>Bernardo</hi> and <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quato,</hi> even our own <hi>Spencer;</hi> in a word, all Modern Poets have Copied <hi>Homer</hi> as well as <hi>Virgil:</hi> He is neither the firſt nor laſt; but in the midſt of them; and therefore is ſafe if they are ſo. Who knows, ſays <hi>Segrais,</hi> but that his fated Armour was only an Allegorical Defence, and ſignifi'd no more than that he was under the peculiar protection of the Gods; born, as the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> will tell us out of <hi>Virgil</hi> (who was well vers'd in the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Myſteries) under the favourable influence of <hi>Jupiter, Venus,</hi> and the <hi>Sun:</hi> But I inſiſt not on this, becauſe I know you believe not
<pb facs="tcp:43031:145"/>
there is ſuch an Art: though not only <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Perſius,</hi> but <hi>Auguſtus</hi> himſelf, thought otherwiſe. But in defence of <hi>Virgil,</hi> I dare poſitively ſay, that he has been more cautious in this particular than either his Predeceſſour, or his Deſcendants. For <hi>Aeneas</hi> was actually wounded, in the Twelfth of the <hi>Aeneis;</hi> though he had the ſame God-Smith to Forge his Arms, as had <hi>Achilles.</hi> It ſeems he was no War-luck, as the <hi>Scots</hi> commonly call ſuch Men, who they ſay, are Iron-free, or Lead-free. Yet after this Experiment, that his Arms were not impenetrable, when he was Cur'd indeed by his Mother's help, becauſe he was that day to conclude the War by the death of <hi>Turnus,</hi> the Poet durſt not carry the Miracle too far, and reſtore him wholy to his former Vigour: He was ſtill too weak to overtake his Enemy; yet we ſee with what Courage he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks <hi>Turnus,</hi> when he faces and renews the Combate. I need ſay no more, for <hi>Virgil</hi> defends himſelf, without needing my aſſiſtance; and proves his Heroe truly to deſerve that Name. He was not then a Second-rate Champion, as they would have him, who think Fortitude the firſt Vertue in a Heroe. But being beaten from this hold, they will not yet allow him to be Valiant; becauſe he wept more often, as they think, than well becomes a Man of Courage.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, if Tears are Arguments of Cowardiſe, What ſhall I ſay of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Heroe? ſhall <hi>Achilles</hi> paſs for timorous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wept? and wept on leſs occaſions than <hi>Aeneas?</hi> Herein <hi>Virgil</hi> muſt be granted to have excell'd his Maſter. For once both Heroes are deſcrib'd lamenting their loſt Loves: <hi>Briſeis</hi> was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by force from the <hi>Grecian: Ceruſa</hi> was loſt for ever to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. But <hi>Achilles</hi> went roaring along the ſalt Sea-ſhore, and like a Booby, was complaining to his Mother, when he ſhou'd have reveng'd his Injury by Arms. <hi>Aeneas</hi> took a Nobler Courſe; for having ſecur'd his Father and his Son, he repeated all his former Dangers to have found his Wife, if ſhe had been above ground. And here your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip may obſerve the Addreſs of <hi>Virgil;</hi> it was not for nothing, that this Paſſage was related with all theſe tender Circumſtances. <hi>Aeneas</hi> told it; <hi>Dido</hi> hear'd it: That he had been ſo affectionate a Husband, was no ill Argument to the coming Dowager, that he might prove as kind to her. <hi>Virgil</hi> has a thouſand ſecret Beauties, tho' I have not leiſure to remark them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Segrais</hi> on this Subject of a Heroe's ſhedding Tears, obſerves that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians commend <hi>Alexander</hi> for weeping, when he read the mighty Actions of <hi>Achilles.</hi> And <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> is likewiſe prais'd, when out of the ſame Noble Envy, he wept at the Victories of <hi>Alexander.</hi> But if we obſerve more cloſely, we ſhall find, that the tears of <hi>Aeneas</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways on a laudable Occaſion. Thus he weeps out of Compaſſion, and tenderneſs of Nature, when in the Temple of <hi>Carthage</hi> he beholds the Pictures of his Friends, who Sacrific'd their Lives in Defence of their Country. He deplores the lamentable End of his Pilot <hi>Palinurus;</hi> the untimely death of young <hi>Pallas</hi> his Confederate; and the reſt, which I omit. Yet even for theſe Tears his wretched Criticks dare condemn him. They make <hi>Aeneas</hi> little better than a kind of a St. <hi>Swithen</hi> Heroe, always raining. One of theſe Cenſors is bold enough to argue him of Cowardiſe; when in the beginning of the Firſt Book, he not only weeps, but trembles at an approaching Storm.</p>

                  <p>But to this I have anſwer'd formerly; that his fear was not for himſelf, but for his People. And who can give a Soveraign a better Commendation, or recommend a Heroe more to the affection of the Reader? They were threatned with a Tempeſt, and he wept; he was promis'd <hi>Italy,</hi> and therefore he pray'd for the accompliſhment of that Promiſe. All this in the beginning of a Storm, therefore he ſhew'd the more early Piety, and the quicker ſenſe of Compaſſion. Thus much I have urg'd elſewhere in the defence of <hi>Virgil;</hi> and ſince I have been inform'd, by Mr. <hi>Moyl,</hi> a young Gentleman, whom I can never ſufficiently commend, that the Ancients accounted drowning an accurſed Death. So that if we grant him to have been afraid, he had juſt occaſion for that fear, both in relation to himſelf, and to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. I think our Adverſaries can carry this Argument no farther, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they tell us that he ought to have had more confidence in the promiſe of the Gods: But how was he aſſur'd that he had underſtood their Oracles aright? <hi>Helenus</hi> might be miſtaken, <hi>Phoebus</hi> might ſpeak doubtfully, even his Mother might flatter him, that he might proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his Voyage, which if it ſucceeded happily, he ſhou'd be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of an Empire. For that ſhe her ſelf was doubtful of his Fortune, is apparent by the Addreſs ſhe made to <hi>Jupiter</hi> on his behalf. To which the God makes anſwer in theſe words:

                  </p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding which, the Goddeſs, though comforted, was not aſſur'd: For even after this, through the courſe of the whole <hi>Aeneis,</hi> ſhe ſtill apprehends the intereſt which <hi>Juno</hi> might make with <hi>Jupiter</hi> againſt her Son. For it was a moot Point in Heaven, whether he cou'd alter Fate or not. And indeed, ſome paſſages in <hi>Virgil</hi> wou'd make us ſuſpect, that he was of Opinion, <hi>Jupiter</hi> might deferr Fate, though he cou'd not alter it. For in the latter end of the Tenth Book, he introduces <hi>Juno</hi> begging for the Life of <hi>Turnus,</hi> and flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Husband with the power of changing Deſtiny. <hi>Tua qui potes, orſa reflectas.</hi> To which he graciouſly anſwers:

                  <p>He reply'd, and I think with an exact Judgment, that when <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> gave <hi>Juno</hi> leave to withdraw <hi>Turnus</hi> from the preſent danger, it was becauſe he certainly fore-knew that his Fatal hour was not come: that it was in Deſtiny for <hi>Juno</hi> at that time to ſave him; and that he himſelf obey'd Deſtiny, in giving her that leave.</p>
                  <p>I need ſay no more in juſtification of our Heroe's Courage, and am much deceiv'd, if he ever be attack'd on this ſide of his Character again. But he is Arraign'd with more ſhew of Reaſon by the Ladies; who will make a numerous Party againſt him, for being falſe to Love, in forſaking <hi>Dido.</hi> And I cannot much blame them; for to ſay the truth, 'tis an ill Precedent for their Gallants to follow.

                  <p>In the firſt place, <hi>Segrais</hi> obſerves with much accuteneſs, that they who blame <hi>Aeneas</hi> for his inſenſibility of Love, when he left <hi>Carthage,</hi> contradict their former accuſation of him, for being always Crying, Compaſſionate, and Effeminately ſenſible of thoſe Misfortunes which befell others. They give him two contrary Characters, but <hi>Virgil</hi> makes him of a piece, always grateful, always tender-hearted. But they are impudent enough to diſcharge themſelves of this blunder, by laying the Contradiction at <hi>Virgil</hi>'s door. He, they ſay, has ſhewn his Heroe with theſe inconſiſtent Characters: Acknowledging, and Ungrateful, Compaſſionate, and Hard-harted; but at the bottom, Fickle, and Self-intereſted. For <hi>Dido</hi> had not only receiv'd his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-beaten Troops before ſhe ſaw him, and given them her protection, but had alſo offer'd them an equal ſhare in her Dominion.</p>

                  <p>This was an obligement never to be forgotten: and the more to be conſider'd, becauſe antecedent to her Love.

But when ſhe had made all theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, it was ſtill in his power to have refus'd them: After the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue
<pb facs="tcp:43031:146"/>
of the Cave, call it Marriage, or Enjoment only, he was no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger free to take or leave; he had accepted the favour, and was oblig'd to be Conſtant, if he wou'd be grateful.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I have ſet this Argument in the beſt light I can, that the Ladies may not think I write booty: and perhaps it may happen to me, as it did to Doctor <hi>Cudworth,</hi> who has rais'd ſuch ſtrong Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the being of a God, and Providence, that many think he has not anſwer'd them. You may pleaſe at leaſt to hear the adverſe Party. <hi>Segrais</hi> pleads for <hi>Virgil,</hi> that no leſs than an Abſolute Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> cou'd excuſe this inſenſibility of the Heroe, and this abrupt departure, which looks ſo like extream ingratitude. But at the ſame time, he does wiſely to remember you, that <hi>Virgil</hi> had made Piety the firſt Character of <hi>Aeneas:</hi> And this being allow'd, as I am afraid it muſt, he was oblig'd, antecedent to all other Conſiderations, to ſearch an <hi>Aſylum</hi> for his Gods in <hi>Italy.</hi> For thoſe very Gods, I ſay, who had promis'd to his Race the Univerſal Empire. Cou'd a Pious Man diſpence with the Commands of <hi>Jupiter</hi> to ſatisfie his paſſion; or take it in the ſtrongeſt ſenſe, to comply with the obligations of his gratitude? Religion, 'tis true, muſt have Moral Honeſty for its ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, or we ſhall be apt to ſuſpect its truth; but an immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation diſpenſes with all Duties of Morality. All Caſuiſts agree, that Theft is a breach of the Moral Law: yet if I might preſume to mingle Things Sacred with Prophane, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> only ſpoil'd the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> not rob'd them, becauſe the propriety was transferr'd; by a Revelation to their Law-giver. I confeſs <hi>Dido</hi> was a very Infidel in this Point: for ſhe wou'd not believe, as <hi>Virgil</hi> makes her ſay, that ever <hi>Jupiter</hi> wou'd ſend <hi>Mercury</hi> on ſuch an Immoral Errand. But this needs no Anſwer; at leaſt no more than <hi>Virgil</hi> gives it:

                  <p>Upon the whole Matter, and humanely ſpeaking, I doubt there was a fault ſomewhere; and <hi>Jupiter</hi> is better able to bear the blame, than either <hi>Virgil</hi> or <hi>Aeneas.</hi> The Poet it ſeems had found it out, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brings the deſerting Heroe and the forſaken Lady to meet together in the lower Regions; where he excuſes himſelf when 'tis too late, and accordingly ſhe will take no ſatisfaction, nor ſo much as hear him. Now <hi>Segrais</hi> is forc'd to abandon his defence, and excuſes his Author, by ſaying that the <hi>Aeneis</hi> is an imperfect Work, and that Death prevented the Divine Poet from reviewing it; and for that Reaſon he had condemn'd it to the fire; though at the ſame time, his two Tranſlators muſt acknowledge, that the Sixth Book is the moſt Correct of the whole <hi>Aeneis.</hi> Oh, how convenient is a Machine ſometimes in a Heroick Poem! This of <hi>Mercury</hi> is plainly one, and <hi>Virgil</hi> was conſtrain'd to uſe it here, or the honeſty of his Heroe
<pb facs="tcp:43031:147"/>
wou'd be ill-defended. And the Fair Sex however, if they had the Deſertour in their power, wou'd certainly have ſhewn him no more mercy, than the <hi>Bacchanals</hi> did <hi>Orpheus.</hi> For if too much Conſtancy may be a fault ſometimes, then want of Conſtancy, and Ingratitude after the laſt Favour, is a Crime that never will be forgiven. But of Machines, more in their proper place: where I ſhall ſhew, with how much judgment they have been us'd by <hi>Virgil;</hi> and in the mean time paſs to another Article of his defence on the preſent Subject: where if I cannot clear the Heroe, I hope at leaſt to bring off the Poet; for here I muſt divide their Cauſes. Let <hi>Aeneas</hi> truſt to his Machine, which will only help to break his Fall, but the Addreſs is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. <hi>Plato,</hi> who borrow'd ſo much from <hi>Homer,</hi> and yet concluded for the Baniſhment of all Poets, wou'd at leaſt have Rewarded <hi>Virgil,</hi> before he ſent him into Exile. But I go farther, and ſay, that he ought to be acquitted, and deſerv'd beſide, the Bounty of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi> and the gratitude of the <hi>Roman</hi> People. If after this, the Ladies will ſtand out, let them remember, that the Jury is not all agreed; for <hi>Octavia</hi> was of his Party, and was alſo of the firſt Quality in <hi>Rome;</hi> ſhe was preſent at the reading of the Sixth <hi>Aeneid,</hi> and we know not that ſhe condemn'd <hi>Aeneas;</hi> but we are ſure ſhe preſented the Poet, for his admirable Elegy on her Son <hi>Marcellus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let us conſider the ſecret Reaſons which <hi>Virgil</hi> had, for thus framing this Noble Epiſode, wherein the whole paſſion of Love is more exactly deſcrib'd than in any other Poet. Love was the Theme of his Fourth Book; and though it is the ſhorteſt of the whole <hi>Aeneis,</hi> yet there he has given its beginning, its progreſs, its traverſes, and its concluſion. And had exhauſted ſo entirely this Subject, that he cou'd reſume it but very ſlightly in the Eight enſuing Books.</p>
                  <p>She was warm'd with the graceful appearance of the Heroe, ſhe ſmother'd thoſe Sparkles out of decency, but Converſation blew them up into a Flame. Then ſhe was forc'd to make a Confident of her whom ſhe beſt might truſt, her own Siſter, who approves the paſſion, and thereby augments it, then ſucceeds her publick owning it; and after that, the conſummation. Of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Juno, Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> I ſay nothing, for they were all Machining work; but poſſeſſion ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cool'd his Love, as it increas'd hers, ſhe ſoon perceiv'd the change, or at leaſt grew ſuſpicious of a change; this ſuſpicion ſoon turn'd to Jealouſie, and Jealouſie to Rage; then ſhe diſdains and threatens, and again is humble, and intreats; and nothing availing, deſpairs, curſes, and at laſt becomes her own Executioner. See here the whole proceſs of that paſſion, to which nothing can be added. I dare go no farther, leſt I ſhou'd loſe the connection of my Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>To love our Native Country, and to ſtudy its Benefit and its Glory, to be intereſſed in its Concerns, is Natural to all Men, and is indeed our common Duty. A Poet makes a farther ſtep; for endeavouring to do honour to it, 'tis allowable in him even to be partial in its Cauſe; for he is not ty'd to truth, or fetter'd by the Laws of Hiſtory. <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Taſſo</hi> are juſtly prais'd for chuſing their Heroes out of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy; Virgil</hi> indeed made his a <hi>Trojan,</hi> but it was to derive the <hi>Romans,</hi> and his own <hi>Auguſtus</hi> from him; but all the three Poets are manifeſtly partial to their Heroes, in favour of their Country. For <hi>Dares Phrygius</hi> reports of <hi>Hector,</hi> that he was ſlain Cowardly; <hi>Aeneas</hi> according to the beſt account, ſlew not <hi>Mezentius,</hi> but was ſlain by him: and the Chronicles of <hi>Italy</hi> tell us little of that <hi>Rinaldo d'Eſtè</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:43031:147"/>
who Conquers <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in <hi>Taſſo.</hi> He might be a Champion of the Church; but we know not that he was ſo much as preſent at the Siege. To ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this to <hi>Virgil,</hi> he thought himſelf engag'd in Honour to eſpouſe the Cauſe and Quarrel of his Country againſt <hi>Carthage.</hi> He knew he cou'd not pleaſe the <hi>Romans</hi> better, or oblige them more to Patronize his Poem, than by diſgracing the Foundreſs of that City. He ſhews her ungrateful to the Memory of her firſt Husband, doting on a Stranger; enjoy'd, and afterwards forſaken by him. This was the Original, ſays he, of the immortal hatred betwixt the two Rival Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 'Tis true, he colours the falſehood of <hi>Aeneas</hi> by an expreſs Command from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> to forſake the Queen, who had oblig'd him: but he knew the <hi>Romans</hi> were to be his Readers, and them he brib'd, perhaps at the expence of his Heroe's honeſty, but he gain'd his Cauſe however; as Pleading before Corrupt Judges. They were content to ſee their Founder falſe to Love, for ſtill he had the advantage of the Amour: It was their Enemy whom he forſook, and ſhe might have forſaken him, if he had not got the ſtart of her: ſhe had already for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten her Vows to her <hi>Sichaeus;</hi> and <hi>varium &amp; mutabile ſemper femina,</hi> is the ſharpeſt Satire in the feweſt words that was ever made on Womankind; for both the Adjectives are Neuter, and <hi>Animal</hi> muſt be underſtood, to make them Grammar. <hi>Virgil</hi> does well to put thoſe words into the mouth of <hi>Mercury. If a God had not ſpoken them, neither durſt he have written them, nor I tranſlated them.</hi> Yet the Deity was forc'd to come twice on the ſame Errand: and the ſecond time, as much a Heroe as <hi>Aeneas</hi> was, he frighted him. It ſeems he fear'd not <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſo much as <hi>Dido.</hi> For your Lordſhip may obſerve, that as much intent as he was upon his Voyage, yet he ſtill delay'd it, 'till the Meſſenger was oblig'd to tell him plainly, that if he weigh'd not Anchor in the Night, the Queen wou'd be with him in the Morning. <hi>Notum<expan>

                  <p>Thus I hope, my Lord, that I have made good my Promiſe, and juſtify'd the Poet, whatever becomes of the falſe Knight. And ſure a Poet is as much priviledg'd to lye, as an Ambaſſador, for the Honour and Intereſt of his Country; at leaſt as Sir <hi>Henry Wootton</hi> has defin'd.</p>
                  <p>This naturally leads me to the defence of the Famous <hi>Anachroniſm,</hi> in making <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Dido</hi> Contemporaries. For 'tis certain that the Heroe liv'd almoſt two hundred years before the Building of <hi>Carthage.</hi> One who imitates <hi>Bocaline,</hi> ſays that <hi>Virgil</hi> was accus'd before <hi>Apollo</hi> for this Error. The God ſoon found that he was not able to defend his Favourite by Reaſon, for the Caſe was clear: he therefore gave this middle Sentence; That any thing might be allow'd to his Son <hi>Virgil</hi> on the account of his other Merits; That being a Monarch he had a diſpenſing Power, and pardon'd him. But that this ſpecial Act of Grace might never be drawn into Example, or pleaded by his puny Succeſſors, in juſtification of their ignorance; he decreed for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, No Poet ſhou'd preſume to make a Lady die for Love two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before her Birth. To Moralize this Story, <hi>Virgil</hi> is the <hi>Apollo,</hi> who has this Diſpenſing Power. His great Judgment made the Laws of Poetry, but he never made himſelf a Slave to them:
<pb facs="tcp:43031:148"/>
Chronology at beſt is but a Cobweb-Law, and he broke through it with his weight. They who will imitate him wiſely, muſt chuſe as he did, an obſcure and a remote <hi>Aera,</hi> where they may invent at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and not be eaſily contradicted. Neither he, nor the <hi>Romans</hi> had ever read the Bible, by which only his falſe computation of times can be made out againſt him: this <hi>Segrais</hi> ſays in his defence, and proves it from his Learned Friend <hi>Bochartus,</hi> whoſe Letter on this Subject, he has Printed at the end of the Fourth <hi>Aeneid,</hi> to which I referr your Lordſhip, and the Reader. Yet the Credit of <hi>Virgil</hi> was ſo great, that he made this Fable of his own Invention paſs for an Authentick Hiſtory, or at leaſt as credible as any thing in <hi>Homer. Ovid</hi> takes it up after him, even in the ſame Age, and makes an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Heroine of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s new-created <hi>Dido;</hi> Dictates a Letter for her juſt before her death, to the ingrateful Fugitive; and very unluckily for himſelf, is for meaſuring a Sword with a Man ſo much ſuperiour in force to him on the ſame ſubject. I think I may be Judge of this, becauſe I have Tranſlated both. The Famous Author of the Art of Love has nothing of his own, he borrows all from a greater Maſter in his own profeſſion; and which is worſe, improves nothing which he finds. Nature fails him, and being forc'd to his old ſhift, he has recourſe to Witticiſm. This paſſes indeed with his Soft Admirers, and gives him the preference to <hi>Virgil</hi> in their eſteem. But let them like for themſelves, and not preſcribe to others, for our Author needs not their Admiration.</p>
                  <p>The Motives that induc'd <hi>Virgil</hi> to Coyn this Fable, I have ſhew'd already; and have alſo begun to ſhew that he might make this <hi>Anacro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> by ſuperſeding the mechanick Rules of Poetry, for the ſame Reaſon, that a Monarch may diſpenſe with, or ſuſpend his own Laws, when he finds it neceſſary ſo to do; eſpecially if thoſe Laws are not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fundamental. Nothing is to be call'd a fault in Poetry, ſays <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> but what is againſt the Art; therefore a Man may be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Poet, without being an exact Chronologer. Shall we dare, continues <hi>Segrais,</hi> to condemn <hi>Virgil,</hi> for having made a Fiction againſt the order of time, when we commend <hi>Ovid</hi> and other Poets who have made many of their Fictions againſt the Order of Nature? For what are elſe the ſplendid Miracles of the Metamorphoſes? Yet theſe are Beautiful as they are related; and have alſo deep Learning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Mythologies couch'd under them: But to give, as <hi>Virgil</hi> does in this Epiſode, the Original Cauſe of the long Wars betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> to draw Truth out of Fiction, after ſo probable a manner, with ſo much Beauty, and ſo much for the Honour of his Country, was proper only to the Divine Wit of <hi>Maro;</hi> and <hi>Taſſo</hi> in one of his Diſcourſes, admires him for this particularly. 'Tis not lawful indeed, to contradict a Point of Hiſtory, which is known to all the World; as for Example, to make <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries with <hi>Alexander;</hi> but in the dark Receſſes of Antiquity, a great Poet may and ought to feign ſuch things as he finds not there, if they can be brought to embeliſh that Subject which he treats. On the other ſide, the pains and diligence of ill Poets is but thrown away, when they want the Genius to invent and feign agreeably. But if the Fictions be delightful, which they always are, if they be natural, if they be of a piece; if the beginning, the middle, and the end be in their due places, and artfully united to each other, ſuch Works can never fail of their deſerv'd Succeſs. And ſuch is <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Epiſode of
<pb facs="tcp:43031:148"/>
                     <hi>Dido</hi> and <hi>Aeneas;</hi> where the ſoureſt Critick muſt acknowledge' that if he had depriv'd his <hi>Aeneis</hi> of ſo great an Ornament, becauſe he found no traces of it in Antiquity, he had avoided their unjuſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but had wanted one of the greateſt Beauties of his Poem. I ſhall ſay more of this, in the next Article of their Charge againſt him, which is want of Invention. In the mean time I may affirm in honour of this Epiſode, that it is not only now eſteem'd the moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing entertainment of the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> but was ſo accounted in his own Age; and before it was mellow'd into that reputation, which time has given it; for which I need produce no other teſtimony, than that of <hi>Ovid,</hi> his Contemporary.</p>

Now mark a little, if your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip pleaſes, why <hi>Virgil</hi> is ſo much concern'd to make this Marriage (for he ſeems to be the Father of the Bride himſelf, and to give her to the Bridegroom) it was to make way for the Divorce which he intended af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; for he was a finer Flatterer than <hi>Ovid:</hi> and I more than conjecture that he had in his eye the Divorce which not long before had paſs'd betwixt the Emperour and <hi>Scribonia.</hi> He drew this dimple in the Cheek of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> to prove <hi>Auguſtus</hi> of the ſame Family, by ſo remarkable a Feature in the ſame place. Thus, as we ſay in our home-ſpun <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proverb, <hi>He kill'd two Birds with one ſtone;</hi> pleas'd the Emperour by giving him the reſemblance of his Anceſtor; and gave him ſuch a reſemblance as was not ſcandalous in that Age. For to leave one Wife and take another, was but a matter of Gallantry at that time of day among the <hi>Romans. Neque haec in faedera veni,</hi> is the very Excuſe which <hi>Aeneas</hi> makes, when he leaves his Lady. I made no ſuch Bargain with you at our Marriage, to live always drudging on at <hi>Carthage;</hi> my buſineſs was <hi>Italy,</hi> and I never made a ſecret of it. If I took my pleaſure, had not you your ſhare of it? I leave you free at my departure, to comfort your ſelf with the next Stranger who happens to be Shipwreck'd on your Coaſt. Be as kind an Hoſteſs as
<pb facs="tcp:43031:149"/>
you have been to me, and you can never fail of another Husband. In the mean time, I call the Gods to witneſs, that I leave your Shore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly; for though <hi>Juno</hi> made the Marriage, yet <hi>Jupiter</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me to forſake you. This is the effect of what he ſays, when it is diſhonour'd out of Latin Verſe, into Engliſh Proſe. If the Poet argued not aright, we muſt pardon him for a poor blind Heathen, who knew no better Morals.</p>
                  <p>I have detain'd your Lordſhip longer than I intended on this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: Which wou'd indeed weigh ſomething in a Spiritual Court; but I am not to defend our Poet there. The next I think is but a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, though the Cry is great againſt him, and has continu'd from the time of <hi>Macrobius</hi> to this preſent Age. I hinted it before. They lay no leſs than want of Invention to his Charge. A capital Crime I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge. For a Poet is a Maker, as the word ſignifies: And who cannot make, that is, invent, has his Name for nothing. That which makes this Accuſation look ſo ſtrange at the firſt ſight, is, That he has borrow'd ſo many things from <hi>Homer, Appollonius Rhodius,</hi> and others who preceded him. But in the firſt place, if Invention is to be taken in ſo ſtrict a ſenſe, that the Matter of a Poem muſt be wholly new, and that in all its Parts; then <hi>Scaliger</hi> has made out, ſays <hi>Segrais,</hi> that the Hiſtory of <hi>Troy</hi> was no more the Invention of <hi>Homer,</hi> than of <hi>Virgil.</hi> There was not an Old Woman, or almoſt a Child, but had it in their Mouths, before the Greek Poet or his Friends digeſted it into this admirable order in which we read it. At this rate, as <hi>Solomon</hi> has told us, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new beneath the Sun: Who then can paſs for an Inventor, if <hi>Homer,</hi> as well as <hi>Virgil</hi> muſt be depriv'd of that Glory? Is <hi>Verſailles</hi> the leſs a New Building, becauſe the Architect of that Palace has imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted others which were built before it? Walls, Doors and Windows, Apartments, Offices, Rooms of convenience and Magnificence, are in all great Houſes. So Deſcriptions Figures, Fables, and the reſt, muſt be in all Heroick Poems. They are the Common Materials of Poetry, furniſh'd from the Magazine of Nature: Every Poet has as much right to them, as every Man has to Air or Water. <hi>Quid prohibetis Aquas? <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſus communis aquarum eſt.</hi> But the Argument of the Work, that is to ſay, its principal Action, the Oeconomy and Diſpoſition of it; theſe are the things which diſtinguiſh Copies from Originals. The Poet, who borrows nothing from others, is yet to be Born. He and the <hi>Jews</hi> Meſſias will come together. There are parts of the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble ſome parts both of the <hi>Ilias</hi> and of the <hi>Odyſſes;</hi> as for Example, <hi>Aeneas</hi> deſcended into Hell, and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> had been there before him: <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> lov'd <hi>Dido,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> lov'd <hi>Calypſo:</hi> In few words, <hi>Virgil</hi> has imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated <hi>Homer</hi>'s Odyſſes in his firſt ſix Books, and in his ſix laſt the <hi>Ilias.</hi> But from hence can we infer, that the two Poets write the ſame Hiſtory? Is there no invention in ſome other parts of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Aeneis?</hi> The diſpoſition of ſo many various matters, is not that his own? From what Book of <hi>Homer</hi> had <hi>Virgil</hi> his <hi>Epiſode</hi> of <hi>Nyſus</hi> and <hi>Euryalus,</hi> of <hi>Mezentius</hi> and <hi>Lauſus?</hi> From whence did he borrow his Deſign of bringing <hi>Aeneas</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> of Eſtabliſhing the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire on the Foundations of a <hi>Trojan</hi> Colony; to ſay nothing of the honour he did his Patron, not only in his deſcent from <hi>Venus,</hi> but in making him ſo like him in his beſt Features, that the Goddeſs might have miſtaken <hi>Auguſtus</hi> for her Son. He had indeed the Story from common Fame, as <hi>Homer</hi> had his from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſteſs. <hi>Aeneadum Genetrix</hi> was no more unknown to <hi>Lucretius</hi> than to him. But <hi>Lucretius</hi> taught him
<pb facs="tcp:43031:149"/>
not to form his Heroe; to give him Piety or Valour for his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and both in ſo eminent a degree, that having done what was poſſible for Man, to ſave his King and Country; his Mother was forc'd to appear to him and reſtrain his Fury, which hurry'd him to death in their Revenge. But the Poet made his Piety more ſucceſsful; he brought off his Father and his Son; and his Gods witneſs'd to his Devotion, by putting themſelves under his Protection; to be re-plac'd by him in their promis'd <hi>Italy.</hi> Neither the Invention, nor the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this great Action, were owing to <hi>Homer</hi> or any other Poet. 'Tis one thing to Copy, and another thing to imitate from Nature. The Copyer is that ſervile Imitator, to whom <hi>Horace</hi> gives no better a Name than that of Animal: He will not ſo much as allow him to be a Man. <hi>Raphael</hi> imitated Nature: They who Copy one of <hi>Raphael</hi>'s Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, imitate but him, for his Work is their Original. They Tranſlate him as I do <hi>Virgil;</hi> and fall as ſhort of him as I of <hi>Virgil.</hi> There is a kind of Invention in the imitation of <hi>Raphael;</hi> for though the thing was in Nature, yet the Idea of it was his own. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> Travell'd, ſo did <hi>Aeneas;</hi> but neither of them were the firſt Travellers; for <hi>Cain</hi> went into the Land of <hi>Nod,</hi> before they were born: And neither of the Poets ever heard of ſuch a Man. If <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> had been kill'd at <hi>Troy,</hi> yet <hi>Aeneas</hi> muſt have gone to Sea, or he could never have arriv'd in <hi>Italy.</hi> But the deſigns of the two Poets were as different as the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their Heroes; one went Home, and the other ſought a Home. To return to my firſt ſimilitude: Suppoſe <hi>Apelles</hi> and <hi>Raphael</hi> had each of them Painted a burning <hi>Troy;</hi> might not the Modern Painter have ſucceeded as well as the Ancient, tho' neither of them had ſeen the Town on Fire? For the draughts of both were taken from the Idea's which they had of Nature. Cities had been burnt before either of them were in Being. But to Cloſe the Simile as I begun it; they wou'd not have deſign'd after the ſame manner. <hi>Apelles</hi> wou'd have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> from the reſt of all the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and ſhew'd him forcing his entrance into <hi>Priam</hi>'s Palace; there he had ſet him in the faireſt Light, and given him the chief place of all his Figures, becauſe he was a <hi>Grecian,</hi> and he wou'd do Honour to his Country. <hi>Raphael,</hi> who was an <hi>Italian,</hi> and deſcended from the <hi>Trojans,</hi> wou'd have made <hi>Aeneas</hi> the Heroe of his piece: And perhaps not with his Father on his Back; his Son in one hand, his Bundle of Gods in the other, and his Wife fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; (for an Act of Piety, is not half ſo graceful in a Picture as an Act of Courage:) He would rather have drawn him killing <hi>Androgeos,</hi> or ſome other, Hand to Hand; and the blaze of the Fires ſhou'd have darted full upon his Face, to make him conſpicuous amongſt his <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans.</hi> This I think is a juſt Compariſon betwixt the two Poets in the Conduct of their ſeveral deſigns. <hi>Virgil</hi> cannot be ſaid to copy <hi>Homer:</hi> The <hi>Grecian</hi> had only the advantage of writing firſt. If it be urg'd that I have granted a reſemblance in ſome parts; yet therein <hi>Virgil</hi> has excell'd him: For what are the Tears of <hi>Calypſo</hi> for being left, to the Fury and Death of <hi>Dido?</hi> Where is there the whole proceſs of her Paſſion, and all its violent Effects to be found, in the languiſhing <hi>Epiſode</hi> of the <hi>Odyſſes?</hi> If this be to Copy, let the Criticks ſhew us the ſame Diſpoſition, Features, or Colouring in their Original. The like may be ſaid of the Deſcent to Hell; which was not of <hi>Homer</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention neither: He had it from the Story of <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Eurydice.</hi> But to what end did <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> make that Journey? <hi>Aeneas</hi> undertook it by the expreſs Commandment of his Father's Ghoſt: There he was to
<pb facs="tcp:43031:150"/>
ſhew him all the ſucceeding Heroes of his Race; and next to <hi>Romulus,</hi> (mark, if you pleaſe, the Addreſs of <hi>Virgil)</hi> his own Patron <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar. Anchiſes</hi> was likewiſe to inſtruct him, how to manage the <hi>Italian</hi> War; and how to conclude it with his Honour. That is, in other words, to lay the Foundations of that Empire which <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was to Govern. This is the Noble Invention of our Author: But it has been Copyed by ſo many Sign-poſt Daubers; that now 'tis grown fulſom, rather by their want of Skill, than by the Commonneſs.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place I may ſafely grant, that by reading <hi>Homer, Virgil</hi> was taught to imitate his Invention: That is, to imitate like him; which is no more, than if a Painter ſtudied <hi>Raphael,</hi> that he might learn to deſign after his manner. And thus I might imitate <hi>Virgil,</hi> if I were capable of writing an Heroick Poem, and yet the Invention be my own: But I ſhou'd endeavour to avoid a ſervile Copying. I would not give the ſame Story under other Names: With the ſame Characters, in the ſame Order, and with the ſame Sequel: For every common Reader to find me out at the firſt ſight for a Plagiary: And cry, this I read before in <hi>Virgil,</hi> in a better Language, and in better Verſe: This is like merry <hi>Andrew</hi> on the low Rope, copying lubberly the ſame Tricks, which his Maſter is dextrouſly performing on the high.</p>
                  <p>I will trouble your Lordſhip but with one Objection more; which I know not whether I found in <hi>Le Fevre</hi> or <hi>Valois,</hi> but I am ſure I have read it in another <hi>French</hi> Critick, whom I will not name, becauſe I think it is not much for his Reputation. <hi>Virgil,</hi> in the heat of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſuppoſe for Example, in deſcribing the fury of his Heroe in a Battel, when he is endeavouring to raiſe our concernments to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pitch, turns ſhort on the ſudden into ſome ſimilitude, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, ſay they, your attention from the main Subject, and miſpends it on ſome trivial Image. He pours cold Water into the Caldron when his buſineſs is to make it boil.</p>
                  <p>This Accuſation is general againſt all who wou'd be thought Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Poets; but I think it touches <hi>Virgil</hi> leſs than any. He is too great a Maſter of his Art, to make a Blott which may ſo eaſily be hit. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes, as I have ſaid, are not for Tragedy, which is all violent, and where the Paſſions are in a perpetual ferment; for there they deaden where they ſhould animate; they are not of the nature of Dialogue, unleſs in Comedy: A Metaphor is almoſt all the Stage can ſuffer, which is a kind of Similitude comprehended in a word. But this Figure has a contrary effect in Heroick Poetry: There 'tis employ'd to raiſe the Admiration, which is its proper buſineſs. And Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not of ſo violent a nature as Fear or Hope, Compaſſion or Horrour, or any Concernment we can have for ſuch or ſuch a Perſon on the Stage. Not but I confeſs, that Similitudes and Deſcriptions, when drawn into an unreaſonable length, muſt needs nauſeate the Reader. Once I remember, and but once; <hi>Virgil</hi> makes a Similitude of fourteen Lines; and his deſcription of Fame is about the ſame number. He is blam'd for both; and I doubt not but he would have contracted them, had he liv'd to have review'd his Work: But Faults are no Precedents. This I have obſerv'd of his Similitudes in general, that they are not plac'd, as our unobſerving Criticks tell us, in the heat of any Action: But commonly in its declining: When he has warm'd us in his Deſcription, as much as poſſibly he can; then, leſt that warmth ſhould languiſh, he renews it by ſome apt Similitude, which illuſtrates his Subject, and yet palls not his Audience. I need give your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb facs="tcp:43031:150"/>
but one Example of this kind, and leave the reſt to your Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, when next you review the whole <hi>Aeneis</hi> in the Original un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſh'd by my rude Tranſlation. 'Tis in the firſt Book, where the Poet deſcribes <hi>Neptune</hi> compoſing the Ocean, on which <hi>Eolus</hi> had rais'd a Tempeſt, without his permiſſion. He had already chidden the Rebellious Winds for obeying the Commands of their Uſurping Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: He had warn'd them from the Seas, He had beaten down the Billows with his Mace; diſpell'd the Clouds, reſtor'd the Sun-ſhine, while <hi>Triton</hi> and <hi>Cymothoe</hi> were heaving the Ships from off the Quick-Sands; before the Poet wou'd offer at a Similitude for illuſtration.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Ac, veluti magno in populo cùm ſaepe coorta eſt</l>
                     <l>Seditio, ſaevitque animis ignobile vulgus,</l>
                     <l>Jamque faces, &amp; ſaxa volant, furor arma miniſtrat;</l>
                     <l>Tum, pietate gravem, ac meritis ſi forte virum quem</l>
                     <l>Conſpexere, ſilent, arrectiſque auribus adſtant:</l>
                     <l>Ille regit dictis animos, &amp; pectora mulcet:</l>
                     <l>Sic cunctus pelagi cecidit fragor, aequora poſtquam</l>
                     <l>Proſpiciens genitor, caeloque invectus aperto</l>
                     <l>Flectit equos, currúque volans dat lora ſecundo.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>This is the firſt Similitude which <hi>Virgil</hi> makes in this Poem: And one of the longeſt in the whole; for which Reaſon I the rather cite it. While the Storm was in its fury, any Alluſion had been improper: For the Poet cou'd have compar'd it to nothing more impetuous than it ſelf; conſequently he could have made no Illuſtration. If he cou'd have illuſtrated, it had been an ambitious Ornament out of ſeaſon, and would have diverted our Concernment: <hi>Nunc, non erat hiſce locus;</hi> and therefore he deferr'd it to its proper place.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Criticiſms of moſt moment which have been made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> by the Ancients or Moderns. As for the particular Exceptions againſt this or that paſſage, <hi>Macrobius</hi> and <hi>Pontanus</hi> have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd them already. If I deſir'd to appear more Learned than I am, it had been as eaſie for me to have taken their Objections and Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as it is for a Country Parſon to take the Expoſitions of the Fathers out of <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius:</hi> Or not to have nam'd the Authors from whence I had them: For ſo <hi>Ruaeus,</hi> otherwiſe a moſt judicious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator on <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Works, has us'd <hi>Pontanus,</hi> his greateſt Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, of whom, he is very ſilent, and I do not remember that he once cites him.</p>
                  <p>What follows next, is no Objection; for that implies a Fault: And it had been none in <hi>Virgil,</hi> if he had extended the time of his Action beyond a Year. At leaſt <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has ſet no preciſe limits to it. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s, we know, was within two Months: <hi>Taſſo</hi> I am ſure exceeds not a Summer: And if I examin'd him, perhaps he might be reduc'd into a much leſs compaſs. <hi>Boſſu</hi> leaves it doubtful whether <hi>Virgil</hi>'s A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction were within the Year, or took up ſome Months beyond it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the whole Diſpute is of no more concernment to the common Reader, than it is to a Plough-man, whether <hi>February</hi> this Year had 28 or 29 Days in it. But for the ſatisfaction of the more Curious, of which number, I am ſure your Lordſhip is one; I will Tranſlate what I think convenient out of <hi>Segrais,</hi> whom perhaps you have not read: For he has made it highly probable, that the Action of the <hi>Aeneis</hi> began in the Spring, and was not extended beyond the <hi>Autumn.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:43031:151"/>
And we have known Campaigns that have begun ſooner, and have ended later.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ronſard</hi> and the reſt whom <hi>Segrais</hi> names, who are of Opinion that the Action of this Poem takes up almoſt a Year and half; ground their Calculation thus. <hi>Anchiſes</hi> dyed in <hi>Sicily</hi> at the end of Winter, or beginning of the Spring. <hi>Aeneas,</hi> immediately after the Interment of his Father, puts to Sea for <hi>Italy:</hi> He is ſurpriz'd by the Tempeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd in the beginning of the firſt Book; and there it is that the Scene of the Poem opens; and where the Action muſt Commence. He is driven by this Storm on the Coaſts of <hi>Affrick:</hi> He ſtays at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> all that Summer, and almoſt all the Winter following: Sets Sail again for <hi>Italy</hi> juſt before the beginning of the Spring; meets with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Winds, and makes <hi>Sicily</hi> the ſecond time: This part of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction compleats the Year. Then he celebrates the Aniverſary of his Father's Funerals, and ſhortly after arrives at <hi>Cumes,</hi> and from thence his time is taken up in his firſt Treaty with <hi>Latinus;</hi> the Overture of the War; the Siege of his Camp by <hi>Turnus;</hi> his going for Succours to relieve it: His return: The raiſing of the Siege by the firſt Battel: The twelve days Truce: The ſecond Battel: The Aſſault of <hi>Lauren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> and the ſingle Fight with <hi>Turnus;</hi> all which, they ſay, cannot take up leſs than four or five Months more; by which Account we cannot ſuppoſe the entire Action to be contain'd in a much leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs than a Year and half.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Segrais</hi> reckons another way; and his computation is not condemn'd by the learned <hi>Ruaeus,</hi> who compil'd and Publiſh'd the Commentaries on our Poet, which we call the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s Virgil.</p>
                  <p>He allows the time of Year when <hi>Anchiſes</hi> dyed; to be in the latter end of Winter, or the beginning of the Spring; he acknowledges that when <hi>Aeneas</hi> is firſt ſeen at Sea afterwards, and is driven by the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt on the Coaſt of <hi>Affrick,</hi> is the time when the Action is naturally to begin: He confeſſes farther, that <hi>Aeneas</hi> left <hi>Carthage</hi> in the latter end of Winter; for <hi>Dido</hi> tells him in expreſs terms, as an Argument for his longer ſtay,
<q>Quinetiam Hyberno moliris ſydere Claſſem.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whereas <hi>Ronſard</hi>'s Followers ſuppoſe that when <hi>Aeneas</hi> had buried his Father, he ſet Sail immediately for <hi>Italy,</hi> (tho' the Tempeſt drove him on the Coaſt of <hi>Carthage.) Segrais</hi> will by no means allow that Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; but thinks it much more probable that he remain'd in <hi>Sicily</hi> 'till the midſt of <hi>July</hi> or the beginning of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> at which time he places the firſt appearance of his Heroe on the Sea; and there opens the Action of the Poem. From which beginning, to the Death of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> which concludes the Action, there need not be ſuppos'd above ten Months of intermediate time: For arriving at <hi>Carthage</hi> in the latter end of Summer, ſtaying there the Winter following; departing thence in the very beginning of the Spring; making a ſhort abode in <hi>Sicily</hi> the ſecond time, landing in <hi>Italy,</hi> and making the War, may be reaſonably judg'd the buſineſs but of three Months. To this the <hi>Ronſardians</hi> reply, that having been for Seven Years before in queſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> and having no more to do in <hi>Sicily,</hi> than to interr his Father; after that Office was perform'd, what remain'd for him, but, without delay, to purſue his firſt Adventure? To which <hi>Segrais</hi> anſwers, that the Obſequies of his Father, according to the Rites of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:43031:151"/>
                     <hi>Romans,</hi> would detain him for many days: That a longer time muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in the refitting of his Ships, after ſo tedious a Voyage; and in refreſhing his Weather-beaten Souldiers on a friendly Coaſt. Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are but Suppoſitions on both ſides, yet thoſe of <hi>Segrais</hi> ſeem bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grounded. For the Feaſt of <hi>Dido,</hi> when ſhe entertain'd <hi>Aeneas</hi> firſt, has the appearance of a Summer's Night, which ſeems already almoſt ended, when he begins his Story: Therefore the Love was made in Autumn; the Hunting follow'd properly when the Heats of that ſcorching Country were declining: The Winter was paſs'd in jollity, as the Seaſon and their Love requir'd; and he left her in the latter end of Winter, as is already prov'd. This Opinion is fortify'd by the Arrival of <hi>Aeneas</hi> at the Mouth of <hi>Tyber;</hi> which marks the Seaſon of the Spring, that Seaſon being perfectly deſcrib'd by the ſinging of the Birds, ſaluting the dawn; and by the Beauty of the place, which the Poet ſeems to have painted expreſly in the Seventh <hi>Aeneid.</hi>

                  <p>The remainder of the Action requir'd but three Months more; for when <hi>Aeneas</hi> went for Succour to the <hi>Tuſcans,</hi> he found their Army in a readineſs to march; and wanting only a Commander: So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Calculation, the <hi>Aeneis</hi> takes not up above a Year com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and may be comprehended in leſs compaſs.</p>
                  <p>This, amongſt other Circumſtances, treated more at large by <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grais,</hi> agrees with the riſing of <hi>Orion,</hi> which caus'd the Tempeſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd in the beginning of the firſt Book. By ſome paſſages in the Paſtorals, but more particularly in the <hi>Georgicks,</hi> our Poet is found to be an exact Aſtronomer, according to the Knowledge of that Age. Now <hi>Ilioneus</hi> (whom <hi>Virgil</hi> twice employs in Embaſſies, as the beſt Speaker of the <hi>Trojans)</hi> attributes that Tempeſt to <hi>Orion</hi> in his Speech to <hi>Dido.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Cum ſubito, aſſurgens fluctu nimboſus Orion.</q>
                  <p>He muſt mean either the <hi>Heliacal</hi> or <hi>Achronical</hi> riſing of that Sign. The <hi>Heliacal</hi> riſing of a Conſtellation, is when it comes from under the Rays of the Sun, and begins to appear before Day-light. The <hi>Achro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi> riſing, on the contrary, is when it appears at the cloſe of Day, and in oppoſition of the Sun's diurnal Courſe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Heliacal</hi> riſing of <hi>Orion,</hi> is at preſent computed to be about the ſixth of <hi>July;</hi> and about that time it is, that he either cauſes, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages Tempeſts on the Seas.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Segrais</hi> has obſerv'd farther, that when <hi>Anna</hi> Counſels <hi>Dido</hi> to ſtay <hi>Aeneas</hi> during the Winter; ſhe ſpeaks alſo of <hi>Orion;</hi>
                     <q>Dum pelago deſaevit hyems, &amp; aquoſus Orion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If therefore <hi>Ilioneus,</hi> according to our Suppoſition, underſtand the <hi>Heliacal</hi> riſing of <hi>Orion: Anna</hi> muſt mean the <hi>Achronical,</hi> which the different Epithetes given to that Conſtellation, ſeem to manifeſt. <hi>Ilio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> calls him <hi>nimboſus, Anna aquoſus.</hi> He is tempeſtuous in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb facs="tcp:43031:152"/>
when he riſes <hi>Heliacally,</hi> and Rainy in the Winter when he riſes <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronically.</hi> Your Lordſhip will pardon me for the frequent repetition of theſe cant words; which I cou'd not avoid in this abbreviation of <hi>Segrais;</hi> who I think deſerves no little commendation in this new Criticiſm. I have yet a word or two to ſay of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Machines, from my own obſervation of them. He has imitated thoſe of <hi>Homer,</hi> but not Copied them. It was eſtabliſh'd long before this time, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion as well as in the <hi>Greek;</hi> that there were Gods; and both Nations, for the moſt part, worſhipp'd the ſame Deities; as did alſo the <hi>Trojans:</hi> From whom the <hi>Romans,</hi> I ſuppoſe, wou'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be thought to derive the Rites of their Religion, than from the <hi>Grecians;</hi> becauſe they thought themſelves deſcended from them. Each of thoſe Gods had his proper Office, and the chief of them their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Attendants. Thus <hi>Jupiter</hi> had in propriety, <hi>Ganimede</hi> and <hi>Mercury;</hi> and <hi>Juno</hi> had <hi>Iris.</hi> It was not then for <hi>Virgil</hi> to create new Miniſters; he muſt take what he found in his Religion. It cannot therefore be ſaid that he borrow'd them from <hi>Homer,</hi> any more than <hi>Apollo, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and the reſt, whom he uſes as he finds occaſion for them, as the <hi>Grecian</hi> Poet did: But he invents the occaſions for which he uſes them. <hi>Venus,</hi> after the deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> had gain'd <hi>Neptune</hi> entirely to her Party; therefore we find him buſie in the beginning of the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> to calm the Tempeſt rais'd by <hi>Aeolus,</hi> and afterwards conducting the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> Fleet to <hi>Cumes</hi> in ſafety, with the loſs only of their Pilot; for whom he Bargains. I name thoſe two Examples amongſt a hundred which I omit; to prove that <hi>Virgil,</hi> generally ſpeaking, employ'd his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines in performing thoſe things, which might poſſibly have been done without them. What more frequent then a Storm at Sea, upon the riſing of <hi>Orion?</hi> What wonder, if amongſt ſo many Ships there ſhou'd one be overſet, which was commanded by <hi>Orontes;</hi> though half the Winds had not been there, which <hi>Aeolus</hi> employ'd? Might not <hi>Palinurus,</hi> without a Miracle, fall aſleep, and drop into the Sea, having been over-wearied with watching, and ſecure of a quiet paſſage, by his obſervation of the Skies? At leaſt <hi>Aeneas,</hi> who knew nothing of the Machine of <hi>Somnus,</hi> takes it plainly in this Senſe.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>O nimium Coelo &amp; Pelago confiſe ſereno,</l>
                     <l>Nudus in ignotâ Palinure jacebis arenâ.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>But Machines ſometimes are ſpecious things to amuſe the Reader, and give a colour of probability to things otherwiſe incredible. And beſides, it ſooth'd the vanity of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to find the Gods ſo viſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in all the Actions of their Predeceſſors. We who are better taught by our Religion, yet own every wonderful Accident which befalls us for the beſt, to be brought to paſs by ſome ſpecial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Almighty God; and by the care of guardian Angels: And from hence I might infer, that no Heroick Poem can be writ on the <hi>Epicuraean</hi> Principles. Which I cou'd eaſily demonſtrate, if there were need to prove it, or I had leiſure.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Venus</hi> opens the Eyes of her Son <hi>Aeneas,</hi> to behold the Gods who Combated againſt <hi>Troy,</hi> in that fatal Night when it was ſurpriz'd; we ſhare the pleaſure of that glorious Viſion, (which <hi>Taſſo</hi> has not ill Copied in the ſacking of <hi>Jeruſalem.)</hi> But the <hi>Greeks</hi> had done their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; though neither <hi>Neptune, Juno,</hi> or <hi>Pallas,</hi> had given them their Divine aſſiſtance. The moſt crude Machine which <hi>Virgil</hi> uſes, is in
<pb facs="tcp:43031:152"/>
the <hi>Epiſode</hi> of <hi>Camilla,</hi> where <hi>Opis</hi> by the command of her Miſtreſs, kills <hi>Aruns.</hi> The next is in the Twelfth <hi>Aeneid,</hi> where <hi>Venus</hi> cures her Son <hi>Aeneas.</hi> But in the laſt of theſe, the Poet was driven to a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; for <hi>Turnus</hi> was to be ſlain that very day: And <hi>Aeneas,</hi> wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as he was, cou'd not have Engag'd him in ſingle Combat, unleſs his Hurt had been miraculouſly heal'd. And the Poet had conſider'd that the <hi>Dittany</hi> which ſhe brought from <hi>Crete,</hi> cou'd not have wrought ſo ſpeedy an effect, without the Juice of <hi>Ambroſia,</hi> which ſhe mingled with it. After all, that his Machine might not ſeem too violent, we ſee the Heroe limping after <hi>Turnus.</hi> The Wound was skin'd; but the ſtrength of his Thigh was not reſtor'd. But what Reaſon had our Author to wound <hi>Aeneas</hi> at ſo critical a time? And how came the Cuiſſes to be worſe temper'd than the reſt of his Armour, which was all wrought by <hi>Vulcan</hi> and his Journey-men? Theſe difficulties are not eaſily to be ſolv'd, without confeſſing that <hi>Virgil</hi> had not life enough to correct his Work: Tho' he had review'd it, and found thoſe Errours which he reſolv'd to mend: But being prevented by Death, and not willing to leave an imperfect work behind him, he ordain'd, by his laſt Teſtament, that his <hi>Aeneis</hi> ſhould be burn'd. As for the death of <hi>Aruns,</hi> who was ſhot by a Goddeſs, the Machine was not altogether ſo outragious, as the wounding <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> by the Sword of <hi>Diomede.</hi> Two Divinities, one wou'd have thought, might have pleaded their Prerogative of Impaſſibility, or, at leaſt not to have been wounded by any mortal Hand. Beſide that the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which they ſhed, was ſo very like our common Blood, that it was not to be diſtinguiſh'd from it, but only by the Name and Colour. As for what <hi>Horate</hi> ſays in his Art of Poetry; that no Machines are to be us'd, unleſs on ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occaſion,
<q>Nec Deus interſit, niſi dignus vindice nodus.</q>
That Rule is to be apply'd to the Theatre, of which he is then ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and means no more than this, that when the Knot of the Play is to be unty'd, and no other way is left, for making the diſcovery; then and not otherwiſe, let a God deſcend upon a Rope, and clear the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to the Audience: But this has no relation to the Machines which are us'd in an Epick Poem.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place, for the <hi>Dira,</hi> or Flying-Peſt, which flapping on the Shield of <hi>Turnus,</hi> and fluttering about his Head, diſhearten'd him in the Duel, and preſag'd to him his approaching Death, I might have plac'd it more properly amongſt the Objections. For the Criticks, who lay want of Courage to the Charge of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Heroe; quote this Paſſage as a main proof of their Aſſertion. They ſay our Author had not only ſecur'd him before the Duel, but alſo in the beginning of it, had given him the advantage in impenetrable Arms, and in his Sword: (for that of <hi>Turnus</hi> was not his own, which was forg'd by <hi>Vulcan</hi> for his Father) but a Weapon which he had ſnatch'd in haſte, and by miſtake, belonging to his Charioteer <hi>Metiſcus.</hi> That after all this, <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who was partial to the <hi>Trojan,</hi> and diſtruſtful of the Event, though he had hung the Ballance, and given it a jog of his hand to weigh down <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> thought convenient to give the Fates a collatteral Security, by ſending the Screech-Owl to diſcourage him. For which they quote theſe words of <hi>Virgil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <pb facs="tcp:43031:153"/>
                     <l>Non me tua turbida virtus,</l>
                     <l>Terret ait; Dii me terrent, &amp; Jupiter Hoſtis.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>In anſwer to which, I ſay, that this Machine is one of thoſe which the Poet uſes only for Ornament, and not out of Neceſſity. Nothing can be more Beautiful, or more Poetical than his deſcription of the three <hi>Dirae,</hi> or the ſetting of the Balance, which our <hi>Milton</hi> has bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd from him, but employ'd to a different end: For firſt he makes God Almighty ſet the Scales for St. <hi>Michael</hi> and <hi>Sathan,</hi> when he knew no Combat was to follow; then he makes the good Angel's Scale de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, and the Devils mount; quite contrary to <hi>Virgil,</hi> if I have Tranſlated the three Verſes, according to my Author's Senſe.
<q>
                        <l>Jupiter ipſe duas, aequato Examine lances</l>
                        <l>Suſtinet; &amp; fata imponit diverſa duorum:</l>
                        <l>Quem damnet labor, &amp; quo vergat pondere lethum.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For I have taken theſe words <hi>Quem damnet labor,</hi> in the Senſe which <hi>Virgil</hi> gives them in another place; <hi>Damnabis tu quoque votis;</hi> to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a proſperous Event. Yet I dare not condemn ſo great a Genius as <hi>Milton:</hi> For I am much miſtaken if he alludes not to the Text in <hi>Daniel,</hi> where <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> was put into the Balance, and found too light: This is digreſſion, and I return to my Subject. I ſaid above, that theſe two Machines of the Balance, and the <hi>Dira,</hi> were only Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, and that the ſucceſs of the Duel had been the ſame without them. For when <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Turnus</hi> ſtood fronting each other before the Altar, <hi>Turnus</hi> look'd dejected, and his Colour faded in his Face, as if he deſponded of the Victory before the Fight; and not only he, but all his Party, when the ſtrength of the two Champions was judg'd by the proportion of their Limbs, concluded it was <hi>impar pugna,</hi> and that their Chief was over-match'd: Whereupon <hi>Juturna</hi> (who was of the ſame Opinion) took his opportunity to break the Treaty and renew the War. <hi>Juno</hi> her ſelf had plainly told the Nymph beforehand, that her Brother was to Fight
<q>Imparibus fatis; nec Diis, nec viribus aequis;</q>
So that there was no need of an Apparition to fright <hi>Turnus.</hi> He had the preſage within himſelf of his impending Deſtiny. The <hi>Dirae</hi> only ſerv'd to confirm him in his firſt Opinion, that it was his Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to die in the enſuing Combat. And in this ſenſe are thoſe words of <hi>Virgil</hi> to be taken.
<q>
                        <l>Non me tua turbida virtus</l>
                        <l>Terret ait; Dii me terrent, &amp; Jupiter Hoſtis.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I doubt not but the Adverb <hi>(ſolùm)</hi> is to be underſtood; 'tis not your Valour only that gives me this concernment; but I find alſo, by this portent, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> is my Enemy. For <hi>Turnus</hi> fled before, when his firſt Sword was broken, 'till his Siſter ſupply'd him with a better; which indeed he cou'd not uſe; becauſe <hi>Aeneas</hi> kept him at a diſtance with his Spear. I wonder <hi>Ruaeus</hi> ſaw not this, where he charges his Author ſo unjuſtly, for giving <hi>Turnus</hi> a ſecond Sword, to
<pb facs="tcp:43031:153"/>
no purpoſe. How cou'd he faſten a blow, or make a thruſt, when he was not ſuffer'd to approach? Beſides, the chief Errand of the <hi>Dira,</hi> was to warn <hi>Juturna</hi> from the Field, for ſhe cou'd have brought the Chariot again, when ſhe ſaw her Brother worſted in the Duel. I might farther add, that <hi>Aeneas</hi> was ſo eager of the Fight, that he left the City, now almoſt in his Poſſeſſion, to decide his quarrel with <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> by the Sword: Whereas <hi>Turnus</hi> had manifeſtly declin'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and ſuffer'd his Siſter to convey him as far from the reach of his Enemy as ſhe cou'd. I ſay not only ſuffer'd her, but conſented to it; for 'tis plain, he knew her by theſe words;
<q>
                        <l>O ſoror, &amp; dudum agnovi, cùm prima per artem,</l>
                        <l>Faedera turbaſti, teque haec in bella dediſti;</l>
                        <l>Et nunc nequicquam fallis Dea.—</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have dwelt ſo long on this Subject, that I muſt contract what I have to ſay, in reference to my Tranſlation: Unleſs I wou'd ſwell my Preface into a Volume, and make it formidable to your Lordſhip, when you ſee ſo many Pages yet behind. And indeed what I have already written either in juſtification or praiſe of <hi>Virgil,</hi> is againſt my ſelf; for preſuming to Copy, in my courſe Engliſh, the Thoughts and Beautiful Expreſſions of this inimitable Poet: Who flouriſh'd in an Age when his Language was brought to its laſt perfection, for which it was particularly owing to him and <hi>Horace.</hi> I will give your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip my Opinion, that thoſe two Friends had conſulted each others Judgment, wherein they ſhould endeavour to excel; and they ſeem to have pitch'd on Propriety of Thought, Elegance of Words, and Harmony of Numbers. According to this Model, <hi>Horace</hi> writ his <hi>Odes</hi> and <hi>Epods:</hi> For his <hi>Satires</hi> and <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> being intended wholly for inſtruction, requir'd another Style:
<q>Ornari res ipſa negat, contenta doceri:</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore as he himſelf profeſſes, are <hi>Sermoni propiora,</hi> nearer Proſe than Verſe. But <hi>Virgil,</hi> who never attempted the Lyrick Verſe, is every where Elegant, ſweet and flowing in his <hi>Hexameters.</hi> His words are not only choſen, but the places in which he ranks them for the ſound; he who removes them from the Station wherein their Maſter ſets them, ſpoils the Harmony. What he ſays of the <hi>Sybill</hi>'s Prophecies, may be as properly apply'd to every word of his: They muſt be read, in order as they lie; the leaſt breath diſcompoſes them, and ſomewhat of their Divinity is loſt. I cannot boaſt that I have been thus exact in my Verſes, but I have endeavour'd to follow the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of my Maſter: And am the firſt <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> perhaps, who made it his deſign to copy him in his Numbers, his choice of Words, and his placing them for the ſweetneſs of the ſound. On this laſt Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, I have ſhun'd the <hi>Caeſura</hi> as much as poſſibly I cou'd. For wherever that is us'd, it gives a roughneſs to the Verſe, of which we can have little need, in a Language which is over-ſtock'd with Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants. Such is not the Latine, where the Vowels and Conſonants are mix'd in proportion to each other: yet <hi>Virgil</hi> judg'd the Vowels to have ſomewhat of an over-balance, and therefore tempers their ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with <hi>Caeſuras.</hi> Such difference there is in Tongues, that the ſame Figure which roughens one, gives Majeſty to another: and that
<pb facs="tcp:43031:154"/>
was it which <hi>Virgil</hi> ſtudied in his Verſes. <hi>Ovid</hi> uſes it but rarely; and hence it is that his Verſification cannot ſo properly be call'd ſweet, as luſcious. The <hi>Italians</hi> are forc'd upon it, once or twice in every line, becauſe they have a redundancy of Vowels in their Language. Their Metal is ſo ſoft, that it will not Coyn without Alloy to harden it. On the other ſide, for the Reaſon already nam'd, 'tis all we can do to give ſufficient ſweetneſs to our Language: We muſt not only chuſe our words for Elegance, but for ſound. To perform which, a Maſtery in the Language is requir'd; the Poet muſt have a Magazine of Words, and have the Art to mannage his few Vowels to the beſt advantage, that they may go the farther. He muſt alſo know the nature of the Vowels, which are more ſonorous, and which more ſoft and ſweet; and ſo diſpoſe them as his preſent occaſions require: All which, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſecrets of Verſification beſide, he may learn from <hi>Virgil,</hi> if he will take him for his Guide. If he be above <hi>Virgil,</hi> and is reſolv'd to follow his own <hi>Verve</hi> (as the <hi>French</hi> call it,) the Proverb will fall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily upon him; <hi>Who teaches himſelf, has a Fool for his Maſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> employ'd Eleven Years upon his <hi>Aeneis,</hi> yet he left it as he thought himſelf imperfect. Which when I ſeriouſly conſider, I wiſh, that inſtead of three years which I have ſpent in the Tranſlation of his Works, I had four years more allow'd me to correct my Errours, that I might make my Verſion ſomewhat more tolerable than it is. For a Poet cannot have too great a reverence for his Readers, if he expects his Labours ſhou'd ſurvive him. Yet I will neither plead my Age nor Sickneſs in excuſe of the faults which I have made: That I wanted time is all I have to ſay. For ſome of my Subſcribers grew ſo clamorous, that I cou'd no longer deferr the Publication. I hope from the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of your Lordſhip, and your often experienc'd goodneſs to me, that if the faults are not too many, you will make allowances with <hi>Horace.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </q>
                  <p>You may pleaſe alſo to obſerve, that there is not, to the beſt of my remembrance, one Vowel gaping on another for want of a <hi>Caeſura,</hi> in this whole Poem. But where a Vowel ends a word, the next begins either with a Conſonant, or what is its equivalent; for our <hi>W</hi> and <hi>H</hi> aſpirate, and our Dipthongues are plainly ſuch: The greateſt lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude I take, is in the Letter <hi>Y,</hi> when it concludes a word, and the firſt Syllable of the next begins with a Vowel. Neither need I have call'd this a latitude, which is only an explanation of this general Rule. That no Vowel can be cut off before another, when we cannot ſink the Pronunciation of it: As <hi>He, She, Me, I,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Virgil</hi> thinks it ſometimes a Beauty, to imitate the Licenſe of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and leave two Vowels opening on each other, as in that Verſe of the Third Paſtoral,
<q>Et ſuccus pecori &amp; lac ſubducitur Agnis.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>nobis non licet, eſſe tam diſertis.</hi> At leaſt if we ſtudy to refine our Numbers. I have long had by me the Materials of an Engliſh <hi>Proſodia,</hi> containing all the Mechanical Rules of Verſification, wherein
<pb facs="tcp:43031:154"/>
I have treated with ſome exactneſs of the Feet, the Quantities, and the Pauſes. The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> know nothing of the two firſt; at leaſt their beſt Poets have not practis'd them. As for the Pauſes, <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herb</hi> firſt brought them into <hi>France,</hi> within this laſt Century: And we ſee how they adorn their <hi>Alexandrins.</hi> But as <hi>Virgil</hi> propounds a Riddle which he leaves unſolv'd:
<q>
                        <l>Dic quibus in terris, inſcripti nomina Regum</l>

So I will give your Lordſhip another, and leave the Expoſition of it to your acute Judgment. I am ſure there are few who make Verſes, have obſerv'd the ſweetneſs of theſe two Lines in <hi>Coopers Hill.</hi>

And there are yet fewer who can find the Reaſon of that ſweetneſs. I have given it to ſome of my Friends in Converſation, and they have allow'd the Criticiſm to be juſt. But ſince the evil of falſe quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities is difficult to be cur'd in any Modern Language; ſince the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Italians</hi> as well as we, are yet ignorant what feet are to be us'd in Heroick Poetry; ſince I have not ſtrictly obſerv'd thoſe Rules my ſelf, which I can teach others; ſince I pretend to no Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip among my Fellow-Poets; ſince if I ſhou'd inſtruct ſome of them to make well-running Verſes, they want Genius to give them ſtrength as well as ſweetneſs; and above all, ſince your Lordſhip has advis'd me not to publiſh that little which I know, I look on your Counſel as your Command, which I ſhall obſerve inviolably, 'till you ſhall pleaſe to revoke it, and leave me at liberty to make my thoughts publick. In the mean time, that I may arrogate nothing to my ſelf, I muſt acknowledge that <hi>Virgil</hi> in Latine, and <hi>Spencer</hi> in Engliſh, have been my Maſters. <hi>Spencer</hi> has alſo given me the boldneſs to make uſe ſometimes of his <hi>Alexandrin</hi> Line, which we call, though improperly, the <hi>Pindarick;</hi> becauſe Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> has often employ'd it in his <hi>Odes.</hi> It adds a certain Majeſty to the Verſe, when 'tis us'd with Judgment, and ſtops the ſenſe from overflowing into another Line. Formerly the <hi>French,</hi> like us, and the <hi>Italians,</hi> had but five Feet, or ten Syllables in their Heroick Verſe: but ſince <hi>Ronſard</hi>'s time, as I ſuppoſe, they found their Tongue too weak to ſupport their Epick Poetry, without the addition of another Foot. That indeed has given it ſomewhat of the run, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a <hi>Trimeter;</hi> but it runs with more activity than ſtrength: Their Language is not ſtrung with Sinews like our Engliſh. It has the nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Greyhound, but not the bulk and body of a Maſtiff. Our Men and our Verſes over-bear them by their weight; and <hi>Pondere non Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero,</hi> is the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Motto. The <hi>French</hi> have ſet up Purity for the Standard of their Language; and a Maſculine Vigour is that of ours. Like their Tongue is the Genius of their Poets, light and trifling in compariſon of the Engliſh; more proper for Sonnets, Madrigals, and Elegies, than Heroick Poetry. The turn on Thoughts and Words is their chief Talent, but the Epick Poem is too ſtately to receive thoſe little Ornaments. The Painters draw their Nymphs in thin and airy Habits, but the weight of Gold and of Embroideries is reſerv'd for Queens
<pb facs="tcp:43031:155"/>
and Goddeſſes. <hi>Virgil</hi> is never frequent in thoſe Turns, like <hi>Ovid,</hi> but much more ſparing of them in his <hi>Aeneis,</hi> than in his <hi>Paſtorals</hi> and <hi>Georgicks.</hi>

The Poet found it before his Criticks, but it was a darling Sin which he wou'd not be perſwaded to reform. The want of Genius, of which I have accus'd the <hi>French,</hi> is laid to their Charge by one of their own great Authors, though I have forgotten his Name, and where I read it. If Rewards cou'd make good Poets, their great Maſter has not been wanting on his part in his bountiful Encouragements: For he is wiſe enough to imitate <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> if he had a <hi>Maro.</hi> The <hi>Triumvir</hi> and <hi>Proſcriber</hi> had deſcended to us in a more hideous form than they now appear, if the Emperour had not taken care to make Friends of him and <hi>Horace.</hi> I confeſs the Baniſhment of <hi>Ovid</hi> was a Blot in his Eſcutcheon, yet he was only Baniſh'd, and who knows but his Crime was Capital, and then his Exile was a Favour? <hi>Arioſto,</hi> who with all his faults, muſt be acknowledg'd a great Poet, has put theſe words into the mouth of an Evangeliſt, but whether they will paſs for Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel now, I cannot tell.</p>

                  <p>But Heroick Poetry is not of the growth of <hi>France,</hi> as it might be of <hi>England,</hi> if it were Cultivated. <hi>Spencer</hi> wanted only to have read the Rules of <hi>Boſſu:</hi> for no Man was ever Born with a greater Genius, or had more Knowledge to ſupport it. But the performance of the <hi>French</hi> is not equal to their Skill; and hitherto we have wanted Skill to perform better. <hi>Segrais,</hi> whoſe Preface is ſo wonderfully good, yet is wholly deſtitute of Elevation; though his Verſion is much better than that of the two Brothers, or any of the reſt who have attempted <hi>Virgil. Hannibal Caro</hi> is a great Name amongſt the <hi>Italians,</hi> yet his Tranſlation of the <hi>Aeneis</hi> is moſt ſcandalouſly mean, though he has taken the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of writing in Blank Verſe, and freed himſelf from the ſhackles of modern Rhime: (if it be modern, for <hi>Le Clerc</hi> has told us lately, and I believe has made it out, that <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms were written in as errant Rhime as they are Tranſlated.) Now if a Muſe cannot run when ſhe is unfetter'd, 'tis a ſign ſhe has but little ſpeed. I will not make a digreſſion here, though I am ſtrangely tempted to it; but will only ſay, that he who can write well in Rhime, may write better in Blank Verſe. Rhime is certainly a conſtraint even to the beſt Poets, and thoſe who make it with moſt eaſe; though perhaps I have as little reaſon to complain of that hardſhip as any Man, excepting

                     <hi>Quarles,</hi> and <hi>Withers.</hi> What it adds to ſweetneſs, it takes away from ſenſe; and he who loſes the leaſt by it, may be call'd a gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: it often makes us ſwerve from an Author's meaning. As if a Mark be ſet up for an Archer at a great diſtance, let him aim as exactly as he can, the leaſt wind will take his Arrow, and divert it from the White. I return to our <hi>Italian</hi> Tranſlatour of the <hi>Aeneis:</hi> He is a Foot-Poet, he Lacquies by the ſide of <hi>Virgil</hi> at the beſt, but never mounts behind him. Doctor <hi>Morelli,</hi> who is no mean Critick in our Poetry, and therefore may be preſum'd to be a better in his own Language, has confirm'd me in this Opinion by his Judgment, and thinks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that he has often miſtaken his Maſter's Senſe. I wou'd ſay ſo, if I durſt, but I am afraid I have committed the ſame fault more often, and more groſly: For I have forſaken <hi>Ruaeus,</hi> (whom generally I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) in many places, and made Expoſitions of my own in ſome, quite contrary to him. Of which I will give but two Examples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo near each other in the Tenth <hi>Aeneid.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <hi>—Sorti Pater aequus utrique.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <hi>Pallas</hi> ſays it to <hi>Turnus</hi> juſt before they Fight. <hi>Ruaeus</hi> thinks that the word <hi>Pater</hi> is to be referr'd to <hi>Evander</hi> the Father of <hi>Pallas.</hi> But how cou'd he imagine that it was the ſame thing to <hi>Evander,</hi> if his Son were ſlain, or if he overcame. The Poet certainly intended <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> the common Father of Mankind; who, as <hi>Pallas</hi> hop'd, wou'd ſtand an impartial Spectatour of the Combat, and not be more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>Turnus,</hi> than to him. The Second is not long after it, and both before the Duel is begun. They are the words of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who comforts <hi>Hercules</hi> for the death of <hi>Pallas,</hi> which was immediately to enſue, and which <hi>Hercules</hi> cou'd not hinder (though the young Heroe had addreſs'd his Prayers to him for his aſſiſtance:) Becauſe the Gods cannot controul Deſtiny—the Verſe follows.

Which the ſame <hi>Ruaeus</hi> thus conſtrues. <hi>Jupiter</hi> after he had ſaid this; immediately turns his eyes to the <hi>Rutulian</hi> Fields, and beholds the Duel. I have given this place another Expoſition, that he turn'd his Eyes from the Field of Combat, that he might not behold a ſight ſo unpleaſing to him. The word <hi>Rejicit</hi> I know will admit of both ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; but <hi>Jupiter</hi> having confeſs'd that he could not alter Fate, and being griev'd he cou'd not, in conſideration of <hi>Hercules,</hi> it ſeems to me that he ſhou'd avert his Eyes, rather than take pleaſure in the Spectacle. But of this I am not ſo conſident as the other, though I think I have follow'd <hi>Virgil</hi>'s ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>What I have ſaid, though it has the face of arrogance, yet is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the honour of my Country; and therefore I will boldly own, that this <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation has more of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Spirit in it, than either the <hi>French,</hi> or the <hi>Italian.</hi> Some of our Country-men have tranſlated Epiſodes, and other parts of <hi>Virgil,</hi> with great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. As particularly your Lordſhip, whoſe Verſion of <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Eurydice,</hi> is eminently good. Amongſt the dead Authors, the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenus</hi> of my Lord <hi>Roſcommon</hi> cannot be too much commended. I ſay nothing of Sir <hi>John Denham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Waller,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cowley;</hi> 'tis the utmoſt of my Ambition to be thought their Equal, or not to be much
<pb facs="tcp:43031:156"/>
inferiour to them, and ſome others of the Living. But 'tis one thing to take pains on a Fragment, and Tranſlate it perfectly; and another thing to have the weight of a whole Author on my ſhoulders. They who believe the burthen light, let them attempt the Fourth, Sixth or Eighth <hi>Paſtoral,</hi> the Firſt or Fourth <hi>Georgick;</hi> and amongſt the <hi>Aeneids,</hi> the Fourth, the Fifth, the Seventh, the Ninth, the Tenth, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, or the Twelfth; for in theſe I think I have ſucceeded beſt.</p>
                  <p>Long before I undertook this Work, I was no ſtranger to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. I had alſo ſtudied <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Deſign, his diſpoſition of it, his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, his judicious management of the Figures, the ſober retrenchments of his Senſe, which always leaves ſomewhat to gratifie our imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on which it may enlarge at pleaſure; but above all, the Elegance of his Expreſſions, and the harmony of his Numbers. For, as I have ſaid in a former Diſſertation, the words are in Poetry, what the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are in Painting. If the Deſign be good, and the Draught be true, the Colouring is the firſt Beauty that ſtrikes the Eye. <hi>Spencer</hi> and <hi>Milton</hi> are the neareſt in Engliſh to <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> in the Latine; and have endeavour'd to form my Stile by imitating their Maſters. I will farther own to you, my Lord, that my chief Ambition is to pleaſe thoſe Readers, who have diſcernment enough to prefer <hi>Virgil</hi> before any other Poet in the Latine Tongue. Such Spirits as he deſir'd to pleaſe, ſuch wou'd I chuſe for my Judges, and wou'd ſtand or fall by them alone. <hi>Segrais</hi> has diſtinguiſh'd the Readers of Poetry, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their capacity of judging, into three Claſſes: (He might have ſaid the ſame of Writers too if he had pleas'd.) In the loweſt Form he places thoſe whom he calls <hi>Les Petits Eſprits:</hi> ſuch things as are our Upper-Gallery Audience in a Play-Houſe; who like nothing but the Husk and Rhind of Wit; preferr a Quibble, a Conceit, an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram, before ſolid Senſe, and Elegant Expreſſion: Theſe are Mobb-Readers: If <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Martial</hi> ſtood for Parliament-Men, we know already who wou'd carry it. But though they make the greateſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the Field, and cry the loudeſt, the beſt on't is, they are but a ſort of <hi>French Hugonots,</hi> or <hi>Dutch Boors,</hi> brought over in Herds, but not Naturaliz'd: who have not Land of two Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſus,</hi> and therefore are not priviledg'd to Poll. Their Authors are of the ſame level; fit to repreſent them on a Mountebank's-Stage, or to be Maſters of the Ceremonies in a Bear-Garden. Yet theſe are they who have the moſt Admirers. But it often happens, to their mortification, that as their Readers improve their Stock of Senſe, (as they may by reading better Books, and by Converſation with Men of Judgment,) they ſoon forſake them: And when the Torrent from the Mountains falls no more, the ſwelling Writer is reduc'd into his ſhallow Bed, like the <hi>Mançanares</hi> at <hi>Madrid,</hi> with ſcarce water to moiſten his own Pebbles. There are a middle ſort of Readers (as we hold there is a middle ſtate of Souls) ſuch as have a farther inſight than the former; yet have not the capacity of judging right; (for I ſpeak not of thoſe who are brib'd by a Party, and know better if they were not corrupted;) but I mean a Company of warm young Men, who are not yet arriv'd ſo far as to diſcern the difference betwixt Fuſtian, or oſtentatious Sentences, and the true ſublime. Theſe are above liking <hi>Martial,</hi> or <hi>Owen</hi>'s Epigrams, but they wou'd certainly ſet <hi>Virgil</hi> below <hi>Statius,</hi> or <hi>Lucan.</hi> I need not ſay their Poets are of the ſame Paſte with their Admirers. They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect greatneſs in all they write, but 'tis a bladder'd greatneſs, like that of the vain Man whom <hi>Seneca</hi> deſcribes: An ill habit of Body, full of
<pb facs="tcp:43031:156"/>
Humours, and ſwell'd with Dropſie. Even theſe too deſert their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, as their Judgment ripens. The young Gentlemen themſelves are commonly miſs-led by their <hi>Pedagogue</hi> at School, their Tutor at the Univerſity, or their Governour in their Travels. And many of thoſe three ſorts are the moſt poſitive Blockheads in the World. How many of thoſe flatulent Writers have I known, who have ſunk in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, after Seven or Eight Editions of their Works? for indeed they are Poets only for young Men. They had great ſucceſs at their firſt appearance; but not being of God, as a Wit ſaid formerly, they cou'd not ſtand.</p>
                  <p>I have already nam'd two ſorts of Judges, but <hi>Virgil</hi> wrote for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them: and by his Example, I am not ambitious of pleaſing the loweſt, or the middle form of Readers.</p>
                  <p>He choſe to pleaſe the moſt Judicious: Souls of the higheſt Rank, and trueſt Underſtanding. Theſe are few in number; but whoever is ſo happy as to gain their approbation, can nover loſe it, becauſe they never give it blindly. Then they have a certain <hi>Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> in their Judgment, which attracts others to their Senſe. Every day they gain ſome new Proſelyte, and in time become the Church. For this Reaſon, a well-weigh'd Judicious Poem, which at its firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance gains no more upon the World than to be juſt receiv'd, and rather not blam'd, than much applauded, inſinuates it ſelf by inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degrees into the liking of the Reader: The more he ſtudies it, the more it grows upon him; every time he takes it up, he diſcovers ſome new Graces in it. And whereas Poems which are produc'd by the vigour of Imagination only, have a gloſs upon them at the firſt, which Time wears off; the Works of Judgment, are like the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, the more they are poliſh'd, the more luſtre they receive. Such is the difference betwixt <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Aeneis,</hi> and <hi>Marini</hi>'s <hi>Adone.</hi> And if I may be allow'd to change the Metaphor, I wou'd ſay, that <hi>Virgil</hi> is like the Fame which he deſcribes;

                  <p>Without this Ambition which I own, of deſiring to pleaſe the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices Natos,</hi> I cou'd never have been able to have done any thing at this Age, when the fire of Poetry is commonly extinguiſh'd in other Men. Yet <hi>Virgil</hi> has given me the Example of <hi>Entellus</hi> for my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement: When he was well heated, the younger Champion cou'd not ſtand before him. And we find the Elder contended not for the Gift, but for the Honour; <hi>Nec dona moror.</hi> For <hi>Dampier</hi> has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd us, in his Voyages, that the Air of the Country which produces Gold, is never wholſom.</p>
                  <p>I had long ſince conſider'd, that the way to pleaſe the beſt Judges, is not to Tranſlate a Poet literally; and <hi>Virgil</hi> leaſt of any other. For his peculiar Beauty lying in his choice of Words, I am excluded from it by the narrow compaſs of our Heroick Verſe, unleſs I wou'd make uſe of Monoſyllables only, and thoſe clog'd with Conſonants, which
<pb facs="tcp:43031:157"/>
are the dead weight of our Mother-Tongue. 'Tis poſſible, I confeſs, though it rarely happens, that a Verſe of Monoſyllables may ſound harmoniouſly; and ſome Examples of it I have ſeen. My firſt Line of the <hi>Aeneis</hi> is not harſh:
<q>
                        <hi>Arms, and the Man I Sing, who forc'd by Fate,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But a much better inſtance may be given from the laſt Line of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nilius,</hi> made Engliſh by our Learned and Judicious Mr. <hi>Creech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Nor could the World have born ſo fierce a Flame.</q>
                  <p>Where the many Liquid Conſonants are plac'd ſo Artfully, that they give a pleaſing ſound to the Words, though they are all of one Syllable.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, I have been ſometimes forc'd upon it in other places of this Work, but I never did it out of choice: I was either in haſte, or <hi>Virgil</hi> gave me no occaſion for the Ornament of Words; for it ſeldom happens but a Monoſyllable Line turns Verſe to Proſe, and even that Proſe is rugged, and unharmonious. <hi>Philarchus,</hi> I remember, taxes <hi>Balzac</hi> for placing Twenty Monoſyllables in file, without one diſſyllable betwixt them. The way I have taken, is not ſo ſtreight as Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, nor ſo looſe as Paraphraſe: Some things too I have omitted, and ſometimes have added of my own. Yet the omiſſions I hope, are but of Circumſtances, and ſuch as wou'd have no grace in Engliſh; and the Additions, I alſo hope, are eaſily deduc'd from <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Senſe. They will ſeem (at leaſt I have the Vanity to think ſo), not ſtuck into him, but growing out of him. He ſtudies brevity more than any other Poet, but he had the advantage of a Language wherein much may be comprehended in a little ſpace. We, and all the Modern Tongues, have more Articles and Pronouns, beſides ſigns of Tenſes and Caſes, and other Barbarities on which our Speech is built by the faults of our Forefathers. The <hi>Romans</hi> founded theirs upon the <hi>Greek:</hi> And the <hi>Greeks,</hi> we know, were labouring many hundred years upon their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, before they brought it to perfection. They rejected all thoſe Signs, and cut off as many Articles as they cou'd ſpare; comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one word, what we are conſtrain'd to expreſs in two; which is one Reaſon why we cannot write ſo conciſely as they have done. The word <hi>Pater,</hi> for Example, ſignifies not only a Father, but your Father, my Father, his or her Father, all included in a word.</p>
                  <p>This inconvenience is common to all Modern Tongues, and this alone conſtrains us to employ more words than the Ancients needed. But having before obſerv'd, that <hi>Virgil</hi> endeavours to be ſhort, and at the ſame time Elegant, I purſue the Excellence, and forſake the Brevity. For there he is like Ambergreace, a Rich Perfume, but of ſo cloſe and glutinous a Body, that it muſt be open'd with inferiour ſcents of Musk or Civet, or the ſweetneſs will not be drawn out into another Language.</p>
                  <p>On the whole Matter, I thought fit to ſteer betwixt the two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, of Paraphraſe, and literal Tranſlation: To keep as near my Author as I cou'd, without loſing all his Graces, the moſt Eminent of which, are in the Beauty of his words: And thoſe words, I muſt add, are always Figurative. Such of theſe as wou'd retain their Elegance in our Tongue, I have endeavour'd to graff on it; but moſt
<pb facs="tcp:43031:157"/>
of them are of neceſſity to be loſt, becauſe they will not ſhine in any but their own. <hi>Virgil</hi> has ſometimes two of them in a Line; but the ſcantineſs of our Heroick Verſe, is not capable of receiving more than one: And that too muſt expiate for many others which have none. Such is the difference of the Languages, or ſuch my want of skill in chuſing words. Yet I may preſume to ſay, and I hope with as much reaſon as the <hi>French</hi> Tranſlator, that taking all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of this divine Author, I have endeavour'd to make <hi>Virgil</hi> ſpeak ſuch Engliſh, as he wou'd himſelf have ſpoken, if he had been born in <hi>England,</hi> and in this preſent Age. I acknowledge, with <hi>Segrais,</hi> that I have not ſucceeded in this attempt, according to my deſire: yet I ſhall not be wholly without praiſe, if in ſome ſort I may be allow'd to have copied the Clearneſs, the Purity, the Eaſineſs and the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of his Stile. But I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak farther on this Subject, before I end the Preface.</p>
                  <p>When I mention'd the Pindarick Line, I ſhould have added, that I take another Licenſe in my Verſes: For I frequently make uſe of Triplet Rhymes, and for the ſame Reaſon: Becauſe they bound the Senſe. And therefore I generally join theſe two Licenſes together: And make the laſt Verſe of the Triplet a Pindarique: For beſides, the Majeſty which it gives, it confines the ſenſe within the barriers of three Lines, which wou'd languiſh if it were lengthen'd into four. <hi>Spencer</hi> is my Example for both theſe priviledges of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſes. And <hi>Chapman</hi> has follow'd him in his Tranſlation of <hi>Homer.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> has given in to them after both: And all ſucceeding Writers after him. I regard them now as the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of Heroick Poetry; and am too much an <hi>Engliſh-</hi>man to loſe what my Anceſtors have gain'd for me. Let the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> value themſelves on their Regularity: Strength and Elevation are our Standard. I ſaid before, and I repeat it, that the affected purity of the <hi>French,</hi> has unſinew'd their Heroick Verſe. The Language of an Epick Poem is almoſt wholly figurative: Yet they are ſo fearful of a Metaphor, that no Example of <hi>Virgil</hi> can encourage them to be bold with ſafety. Sure they might warm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by that ſprightly Blaze, without approaching it ſo cloſe as to ſinge their Wings; they may come as near it as their Maſter. Not that I wou'd diſcourage that purity of diction, in which he excels all other Poets. But he knows how far to extend his Franchiſes: And advances to the verge, without venturing a Foot beyond it. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, without being injurious to the Memory of our <hi>Engliſh Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar,</hi> I will preſume to ſay, that his Metaphors are ſometimes too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and his Language is not always pure. But at the ſame time, I muſt excuſe him. For through the Iniquity of the times, he was forc'd to Travel, at an Age, when, inſtead of Learning Foreign Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, he ſhou'd have ſtudied the Beauties of his Mother Tongue: Which like all other Speeches, is to be cultivated early, or we ſhall never Write it with any kind of Elegance. Thus by gaining abroad he loſt at home: Like the Painter in the <hi>Arcadia,</hi> who going to ſee a Skirmiſh, had his Arms lop'd off: and return'd, ſays Sir <hi>Philip Sydney,</hi> well inſtructed how to draw a Battel, but without a Hand to perform his Work.</p>
                  <p>There is another thing in which I have preſum'd to deviate from him and <hi>Spencer.</hi> They both make Hemyſticks (or half Verſes) breaking off in the middle of a Line. I confeſs there are not many ſuch in the <hi>Fairy Queen:</hi> And even thoſe few might be occaſion'd by his unhappy choice
<pb facs="tcp:43031:158"/>
of ſo long a Stanza. Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> had found out, that no kind of Staff is proper for an Heroick Poem; as being all too lirical: Yet though he wrote in Couplets, where Rhyme is freer from conſtraint, he frequently affects half Verſes: of which we find not one in <hi>Homer,</hi> and I think not in any of the <hi>Grcek</hi> Poets, or the Latin, excepting only <hi>Virgil;</hi> and there is no queſtion but he thought, he had <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for that Licenſe. But I am confident, our Poet never meant to leave him or any other ſuch a Precedent. And I ground my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion on theſe two Reaſons. Firſt, we find no Example of a Hemyſtick in any of his Paſtorals or <hi>Georgicks.</hi> For he had given the laſt finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Strokes to both theſe Poems: But his <hi>Aeneis</hi> he left ſo uncorrect, at leaſt ſo ſhort of that perfection at which he aim'd, that we know how hard a Sentence He paſs'd upon it: And in the ſecond place, I reaſonably preſume, that he intended to have fill'd up all thoſe <hi>Hemyſticks,</hi> becauſe in one of them we find the ſenſe imperfect:
<q>
                        <hi>Quem tibi jam Trojâ—</hi>
                     </q>
Which ſome fooliſh Gramarian, has ended for him, with a half Line of Nonſenſe.
<q>Peperit fumante Crëuſa.</q>
For <hi>Aſcanius</hi> muſt have been born ſome Years before the burning of that City; which I need not prove. On the other ſide we find alſo, that he himſelf fill'd up one Line in the ſixth <hi>Aeneid,</hi> the Enthuſiaſm ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, while he was reading to <hi>Auguſtus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Miſenum Aeolidem, quo non praeſtantior alter</l>
                     <l>Aere, ciere viros.—</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>To which he added in that tranſport. <hi>Martemque accendere Cantu.</hi> And never was any Line more nobly finiſh'd; for the reaſons which I have given in the Book of Painting. On theſe Conſiderations I have ſhun'd <hi>Hemyſticks:</hi> Not being willing to imitate <hi>Virgil</hi> to a Fault; like <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Courtiers, who affected to hold their Necks awry, becauſe he cou'd not help it: I am confident your Lordſhip is by this time of my Opinion; and that you will look on thoſe half lines hereafter, as the imperfect products of a haſty Muſe: Like the Frogs and Serpents in the <hi>Nile;</hi> part of them kindled into Life; and part a lump of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd unanimated Mudd.</p>
                  <p>I am ſenſible that many of my whole Verſes, are as imperfect as thoſe halves; for want of time to digeſt them better: But give me leave to make the Excuſe of <hi>Boccace:</hi> Who when he was upbraided, that ſome of his Novels had not the Spirit of the reſt, return'd this Anſwer, that <hi>Charlemain</hi> who made the <hi>Paladins;</hi> was never able to raiſe an Army of them. The Leaders may be Heroes, but the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude muſt conſiſt of Common Men.</p>
                  <p>I am alſo bound to tell your Lordſhip, in my own defence: That from the beginning of the firſt <hi>Georgick</hi> to the end of the laſt <hi>Aeneid;</hi> I found the difficulty of Tranſlation growing on me in every ſucceeding Book. For <hi>Virgil,</hi> above all Poets, had a ſtock, which I may call almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible of figurative, Elegant, and ſounding Words. I who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit but a ſmall portion of his Genius, and write in a Language ſo
<pb facs="tcp:43031:158"/>
much inferiour to the Latin, have found it very painful to vary Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, when the ſame ſenſe returns upon me. Even he himſelf, whether out of neceſſity or choice, has often expreſs'd the ſame thing in the ſame words; and often repeated two or three whole Verſes, which he had us'd before. Words are not ſo eaſily Coyn'd as Money: And yet we ſee that the Credit not only of Banks, but of Exchequers cracks, when little comes in, and much goes out. <hi>Virgil</hi> call'd upon me in every line for ſome new word: And I paid ſo long, that I was almoſt Banckrupt. So that the latter end muſt needs be more burdenſom than the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or the middle. And conſequently the Twelfth <hi>Aeneid</hi> coſt me double the time of the firſt and ſecond. What had become of me, if <hi>Virgil</hi> had tax'd me with another Book? I had certainly been reduc'd to pay the Publick in hammer'd Money for want of Mill'd; that is in the ſame old Words which I had us'd before: And the Receivers muſt have been forc'd to have taken any thing, where there was ſo little to be had.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this difficulty (with which I have ſtrugled, and made a ſhift to paſs it over) there is one remaining, which is inſuperable to all Tranſlators. We are bound to our Author's Senſe, though with the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes already mention'd (for I think it not ſo ſacred, as that one Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta muſt not be added or diminiſh'd on pain of an <hi>Anathema.)</hi> But Slaves we are; and labour on another Man's Plantation; we dreſs the Vine-yard, but the Wine is the Owners: If the Soil be ſometimes Barren, then we are ſure of being ſcourg'd: If it be fruitful, and our Care ſucceeds, we are not thank'd; for the proud Reader will only ſay, the poor drudge has done his duty. But this is nothing to what follows; for being oblig'd to make his Senſe intelligible, we are forc'd to untune our own Verſes, that we may give his meaning to the Reader. He who Invents is Maſter of his Thoughts and Words: He can turn and vary them as he pleaſes, 'till he renders them harmonious. But the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tranſlator has no ſuch priviledge: For being ty'd to the Thoughts, he muſt make what Muſick he can in the Expreſſion. And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it cannot always be ſo ſweet as that of the Original. There is a beauty of Sound, as <hi>Segrais</hi> has obſerv'd, in ſome Latin Words, which is wholly loſt in any Modern Language. He inſtances in that <hi>Mollis Amaracus,</hi> on which <hi>Venus</hi> lays <hi>Cupid</hi> in the Firſt <hi>Aeneid.</hi> If I ſhould Tranſlate it Sweet Marjoram, as the word ſignifies; the Reader would think I had miſtaken <hi>Virgil:</hi> For thoſe Village-words, as I may call them, gives us a mean Idea of the thing; but the Sound of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin is ſo much more pleaſing, by the juſt mixture of the Vowels with the Conſonants, that it raiſes our Fancies, to conceive ſomewhat more Noble than a common Herb; and to ſpread Roſes under him, and ſtrew Lillies over him; a Bed not unworthy the Grandſon of the Goddeſs.</p>
                  <p>If I cannot Copy his Harmonious Numbers, how ſhall I imitate his noble Flights; where his Thoughts and Words are equally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime?</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Quem quiſquis ſtudet aemulari,</l>
                     <l>—Caeratis ope Dedalaeâ</l>
                     <l>Nititur pennis, vitreo daturus</l>
                     <l>Nomina Ponto.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:43031:159"/>
What Modern Language, or what Poet can expreſs the Majeſtick Beauty of this one Verſe amongſt a thouſand others!
<q>
                        <l>Aude Hoſpes contemnere opes, &amp; te quoque dignum</l>
                        <l>Finge Deo.</l>
                     </q>
For my part I am loſt in the admiration of it: I contemn the World, when I think on it, and my ſelf when I Tranſlate it.</p>
                  <p>Lay by <hi>Virgil,</hi> I beſeech your Lordſhip, and all my better ſort of Judges, when you take up my Verſion, and it will appear a paſſable Beauty, when the Original Muſe is abſent: But like <hi>Spencer</hi>'s falſe <hi>Florimel</hi> made of Snow, it melts and vaniſhes, when the true one comes in ſight. I will not excuſe but juſtifie my ſelf for one pretended Crime, with which I am liable to be charg'd by falſe Criticks, not only in this Tranſlation, but in many of my Original Poems; that I latinize too much. 'Tis true, that when I find an <hi>Engliſh</hi> word, ſignificant and ſounding, I neither borrow from the Latin or any other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: But when I want at home, I muſt ſeek abroad.</p>
                  <p>If ſounding Words are not of our growth and Manufacture, who ſhall hinder me to Import them from a Foreign Country? I carry not out the Treaſure of the Nation, which is never to return: but what I bring from <hi>Italy,</hi> I ſpend in <hi>England:</hi> Here it remains, and here it cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culates; for if the Coyn be good, it will paſs from one hand to another. I Trade both with the Living and the Dead, for the enrichment of our Native Language. We have enough in <hi>England</hi> to ſupply our neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but if we will have things of Magnificence and Splendour, we muſt get them by Commerce. Poetry requires Ornament, and that is not to be had from our Old <hi>Teuton</hi> Monoſyllables; therefore if I find any Elegant Word in a Claſſick Author, I propoſe it to be Naturaliz'd, by uſing it my ſelf: and if the Publick approves of it, the Bill paſſes. But every Man cannot diſtinguiſh betwixt Pedantry and Poetry: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man therefore is not fit to innovate. Upon the whole matter, a Poet muſt firſt be certain that the Word he wou'd Introduce is Beautiful in the Latin; and is to conſider, in the next place, whether it will agree with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Idiom: After this, he ought to take the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of judicious Friends, ſuch as are Learned in both Languages: And laſtly, ſince no Man is infallible, let him uſe this Licenſe very ſparingly; for if too many Foreign Words are pour'd in upon us, it looks as if they were deſign'd not to aſſiſt the Natives, but to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer them.</p>
                  <p>I am now drawing towards a Concluſion, and ſuſpect your Lordſhip is very glad of it. But permit me firſt, to own what Helps I have had in this Undertaking. The late Earl of <hi>Lauderdail,</hi> ſent me over his new Tranſlation of the <hi>Aeneis;</hi> which he had ended before I ingag'd in the ſame Deſign. Neither did I then intend it: But ſome Propoſals being afterwards made me by my Bookſeller, I deſir'd his Lordſhip's leave, that I might accept them, which he freely granted; and I have his Letter yet to ſhew, for that permiſſion. He reſolv'd to have Printed his Work; which he might have done two Years before I cou'd Publiſh mine: and had perform'd it, if Death had not prevented him. But having his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript in my hands, I conſulted it as often as I doubted of my Author's ſenſe. For no Man underſtood <hi>Virgil</hi> better than that Learned Noble Man. His Friends, I hear, have yet another, and more Correct Copy of that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation
<pb facs="tcp:43031:159"/>
by them: which had they pleas'd to have given the Publick, the Judges muſt have been convinc'd, that I have not flatter'd him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this help, which was not inconſiderable, Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> has done me the Favour to review the <hi>Aeneis;</hi> and compare my Verſion with the Original. I ſhall never be aſham'd to own, that this Excellent Young Man, has ſhew'd me many Faults, which I have endeavour'd to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect. 'Tis true, he might have eaſily found more, and then my Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation had been more Perfect.</p>
                  <p>Two other Worthy Friends of mine, who deſire to have their Names conceal'd, ſeeing me ſtraitned in my time, took Pity on me, and gave me the Life of <hi>Virgil,</hi> the two Prefaces to the Paſtorals, and the <hi>Georgics,</hi> and all the Arguments in Profe to the whole Tranſlation. Which perhaps, has occaſion'd a Report that the two Firſt Poems are not mine. If it had been true, that I had taken their Verſes for my own, I might have glory'd in their Aid; and like <hi>Terence,</hi> have farther'd the Opinion, that <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius</hi> join'd with me. But the ſame Style being continu'd thro' the whole, and the ſame Laws of Verſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obſerv'd, are proofs ſufficient, that this is one Man's Work: And your Lordſhip is too well acquainted with my manner, to doubt that any part of it is anothers.</p>
                  <p>That your Lordſhip may ſee I was in earneſt, when I promis'd to haſten to an end, I will not give the Reaſons, why I Writ not always in the proper terms of Navigation, Land-Service, or in the Cant of any Profeſſion. I will only ſay, that <hi>Virgil</hi> has avoided thoſe proprieties, becauſe he Writ not to Mariners, Souldiers, Aſtronomers, Gardners, Peaſants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to all in general, and in particular to Men and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the firſt Quality: who have been better Bred than to be too nicely knowing in the Terms. In ſuch caſes, 'tis enough for a Poet to write ſo plainly, that he may be underſtood by his Readers: To avoid impropriety, and not affect to be thought Learn'd in all things.</p>
                  <p>I have omitted the Four Preliminary Lines of the Firſt <hi>Aeneid:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I think them inferiour to any Four others, in the whole Poem: and conſequently, believe they are not <hi>Virgil</hi>'s. There is too great a gap betwixt the Adjective <hi>vicina</hi> in the Second Line, and the Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Arva</hi> in the latter end of the Third, which keeps his meaning in obſcurity too long: And is contrary to the clearneſs of his Style.
<q>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t quamvis avidis</q>
Is too ambitious an Ornament to be his, and
<q>Gratum opus Agricolis,</q>
Are all words unneceſſary, and Independent of what he had ſaid before.
<q>Horrentia Martis Arma,</q>
Is worſe than any of the reſt. <hi>Horrentia</hi> is ſuch a flat Epithete, as <hi>Tully</hi> wou'd have given us in his Verſes. 'Tis a meer filler; to ſtop a vacancy in the Hexameter, and connect the Preface to the Work of <hi>Virgil.</hi> Our Author ſeems to ſound a Charge, and begins like the clangour of a Trumpet;
<q>
                        <pb facs="tcp:43031:160"/>
Arma, virumque cano; Trojae qui primus ab oris.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Scarce a word without an <hi>R.</hi> and the Vowels for the greater part ſonorous. The Prefacer began with <hi>Ille ego,</hi> which He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to patch up in the Fourth line with <hi>At nunc,</hi> to make the Senſe cohere. And if both thoſe words are not notorious botches, I am much deceiv'd, though the <hi>French</hi> Tranſlator thinks other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. For my own part, I am rather of Opinion, that they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Tucca</hi> and <hi>Varius,</hi> than Retrench'd.</p>
                  <p>I know it may be anſwer'd by ſuch as think <hi>Virgil</hi> the Author of the four Lines; that he aſſerts his Title to the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Work, as he did to the two former, in the laſt lines of the fourth <hi>Georgic.</hi> I will not reply otherwiſe to this, than by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring them to compare theſe four Lines with the four others; which we know are his, becauſe no Poet but he alone could write them. If they cannot diſtinguiſh Creeping from Flying, let them lay down <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> and take up <hi>Ovid de Ponto</hi> in his ſtead. My Maſter needed not the aſſiſtance of that Preliminary Poet to prove his Claim. His own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick Meen diſcovers him to be the King, amidſt a Thouſand Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers. It was a ſuperfluous Office, and therefore I wou'd not ſet thoſe Verſes in the Front of <hi>Virgil.</hi> But have rejected them to my own Preface.</p>

                  <p>If there be not a tolerable Line in all theſe ſix, the Prefacer, gave me no occaſion to write better. This is a juſt Apology in this place. But I have done great Wrong to <hi>Virgil</hi> in the whole Tranſlation: Want of Time, the Inferiority of our Language; the inconvenience of Rhyme, and all the other Excuſes I have made, may alleviate my Fault, but cannot juſtiſie the boldneſs of my Undertaking. What avails it me to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge freely, that I have not been able to do him right in any line? For even my own Confeſſion makes againſt me; and it will always be return'd upon me, Why then did you attempt it? To which, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Anſwer can be made, than that I have done him leſs Injury than any of his former Libellers.</p>
                  <p>What they call'd his Picture, had been drawn at length, ſo many times, by the Daubers of almoſt all Nations, and ſtill ſo unlike him, that I ſnatch'd up the Pencil with diſdain: being ſatisfi'd before hand, that I cou'd make ſome ſmall reſemblance of him, though I muſt be content with a worſe likeneſs. A Sixth Paſtoral, a <hi>Pharmaceutria,</hi> a ſingle <hi>Orpheus,</hi> and ſome other Features, have been exactly taken: But thoſe Holiday Authors writ for Pleaſure; and only ſhew'd us what they cou'd have done, if they wou'd have taken pains, to perform the whole.</p>
                  <p>Be pleas'd, My Lord, to accept, with your wonted goodneſs, this unworthy Preſent, which I make you. I have taken off one trouble from you, of defending it, by acknowledging its Imperfections: And though ſome part of them are cover'd in the Verſe; (as <hi>Erictho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:43031:160"/>
rode always in a Chariot, to hide his lameneſs.) Such of them as cannot be conceal'd, you will pleaſe to connive at, though in the ſtrictneſs of your Judgment, you cannot Pardon. If <hi>Homer</hi> was allow'd to nod ſometimes, in ſo long a Work, it will be no wonder if I often fall aſleep. You took my <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> into your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, with all his faults: And I hope here cannot be ſo many, becauſe I Tranſlate an Author, who gives me ſuch Examples of Correctneſs. What my Jury may be, I know not; but 'tis good for a Criminal to plead before a favourable Judge: If I had ſaid Partial, wou'd your Lordſhip have forgiven me? Or will you give me leave to acquaint the World, that I have many times been oblig'd to your Bounty ſince the Revolution. Though I never was reduc'd to beg a Charity, nor ever had the Impudence to ask one, either of your Lordſhip, or your Noble Kinſman the Earl of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> much leſs of any other, yet when I leaſt expected it, you have both remember'd me. So inherent it is in your Family not to forget an Old Servant. It looks rather like Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude on my part, that where I have been ſo often oblig'd, I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſo ſeldom to return my thanks: and where I was alſo ſo ſure of being well receiv'd. Somewhat of Lazineſs was in the caſe; and ſomewhat too of Modeſty: But nothing of Diſreſpect, or of Unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. I will not ſay that your Lordſhip has encourag'd me to this Preſumption, leſt if my Labours meet with no ſucceſs in Publick, I may expoſe your Judgment to be Cenſur'd. As for my own Enemies I ſhall never think them worth an Anſwer; and if your Lordſhip has any, they will not dare to Arraign you for your want of Knowledge in this Art, till they can produce ſomewhat betterof their own, than your <hi>Eſſay</hi> on Poetry. 'Twas on this Conſideration, that I have drawn out my Preface to ſo great a length. Had I not addreſs'd to a Poet, and a Critick of the firſt Magnitude, I had my ſelf been tax'd for want of Judgment, and ſham'd my Patron for want of Underſtanding. But neither will you, My Lord, ſo ſoon be tir'd as any other, becauſe the Diſcourſe is on your Art; Neither will the Learned Reader think it tedious, becauſe it is <hi>ad Clerum.</hi> At leaſt, when he begins to be weary, the Church Doors are open. That I may purſue the Allegory with a ſhort Prayer, after a long Sermon:</p>
                  <p>May you Live happily and long, for the Service of your Country, the Encouragement of good Letters and the Ornament of Poetry; which cannot be wiſh'd more earneſtly by any Man, than by</p>

                  <head>POSTSCRIPT TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>WHAT <hi>Virgil</hi> wrote in the vigour of his Age, in Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and at Eaſe, I have undertaken to <hi>Tranſlate</hi> in my Declining Years: ſtrugling with Wants, oppreſs'd with Sickneſs, curb'd in my Genius, lyable to be miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued in all I write; and my Judges, if they are not very equitable, already prejudic'd againſt me, by the <hi>Lying Character</hi> which has been given them of my Morals. Yet ſteady to my Principles, and not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirited with my Afflictions, I have, by the Bleſſing of God on my Endeavours, overcome all difficulties; and, in ſome meaſure, acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my ſelf of the Debt which I ow'd the Publick, when I undertook this Work. In the firſt place therefore, I thankfully acknowledge to the Almighty Power, the Aſſiſtance he has given me in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Proſecution, and <hi>Concluſion</hi> of my preſent Studies, which are more happily perform'd than I could have promis'd to my ſelf, when I labour'd under ſuch Diſcouragements. For, what I have done, Imperfect as it is, for want of Health and leiſure to Correct it, will be judg'd in after Ages, and poſſibly in the preſent, to be no diſhonour to my Native Country; whoſe Language and Poetry wou'd be more eſteem'd abroad, if they were better underſtood. Somewhat (give me leave to ſay) I have added to both of them in the choice of <hi>Words;</hi> and Harmony of Numbers which were wanting, eſpecially the laſt, in all our Poets, even in thoſe who being endu'd with Genius, yet have not Cultivated their Mother-Tongue with ſufficient Care; or rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Beauty of their Thoughts, have judg'd the Ornament of Words, and ſweetneſs of Sound unneceſſary. One is for raking in <hi>Chaucer</hi> (our <hi>Engliſh Ennius)</hi> for antiquated Words, which are never to be reviv'd, but when Sound or Significancy is wanting in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Language. But many of his deſerve not this Redemption, any more than the Crouds of Men who daily die, or are ſlain for Six-pence in a Battel, merit to be reſtor'd to Life, if a Wiſh cou'd revive them. Others have no Ear for Verſe, nor choice of Words; nor diſtinction of Thoughts; but mingle Farthings with their Gold to make up the Sum. Here is a Field of Satire open'd to me: But ſince the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I have wholly renounc'd that Talent. For who wou'd give Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick to the Great when he is uncall'd? To do his Patient no good, and indanger himſelf for his Preſcription? Neither am I ignorant, but I may juſtly be Condemn'd for many of thoſe Faults, of which I have too liberally Arraign'd others.</p>

'Tis enough for me, if the Government will let me paſs unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd. In the mean time, I am oblig'd in gratitude, to return my Thanks to many of them, who have not only diſtinguiſh'd me from others of the ſame Party, by a particular exception of Grace, but without conſidering the Man, have been Bountiful to the Poet: Have encourag'd <hi>Virgil</hi> to ſpeak ſuch <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as I could teach him, and rewarded his Interpreter, for the pains he has taken in bringing him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into <hi>Britain,</hi> by defraying the Charges of his Voyage. Even <hi>Cerberus,</hi> when he had receiv'd the Sop, permitted <hi>Aeneas</hi> to paſs free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Elyſium.</hi> Had it been offer'd me, and I had refus'd it, yet ſtill ſome gratitude is due to ſuch who were willing to oblige me. But how much more to thoſe from whom I have receiv'd the Favours which they have offer'd to one of a different Perſwaſion. Amongſt whom I cannot omit naming the Earls of <hi>Darby</hi> and of <hi>Peterborough.</hi> To the firſt of theſe, I have not the Honour to be known; and therefore his liberality as much unexpected, as it was undeſerv'd. The preſent Earl of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terborough</hi> has been pleas'd long ſince to accept the tenders of my Service: His Favours are ſo frequent to me, that I receive them almoſt by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. No difference of Intereſts or Opinion have been able to withdraw his Protection from me: And I might juſtly be condemn'd for the moſt unthankful of Mankind, if I did not always preſerve for him a moſt profound Reſpect and inviolable Gratitude. I muſt alſo add, that if the laſt <hi>Aeneid</hi> ſhine amongſt its Fellows, 'tis owing to the Commands of Sir <hi>William Trumball,</hi> one of the Principal Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of State, who recommended it, as his Favourite, to my Care: and for his ſake particularly I have made it mine.

                  <p>Neither am I to forget the Noble Preſent which was made me by <hi>Gilbert Dolben</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the worthy Son of the late Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York:</hi> who, when I began this Work, enrich'd me with all the ſeveral Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Virgil,</hi> and all the Commentaries of thoſe Editions in Latine. Amongſt which, I cou'd not but prefer the <hi>Dolphins;</hi> as the laſt, the ſhorteſt, and the moſt Judicious. <hi>Fabrini</hi> I had alſo ſent me from <hi>Italy;</hi> but either he underſtands <hi>Virgil</hi> very imperfectly, or I have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of my Author.</p>
                  <p>Being Invited by that worthy Gentleman, Sir <hi>William Bowyer,</hi> to <hi>Denham-Court,</hi> I Tranſlated the firſt <hi>Georgic</hi> at his Houſe, and the greateſt part of the laſt <hi>Aeneid.</hi> A more friendly Entertainment no Man ever found. No wonder therefore if both thoſe Verſions ſurpaſs the reſt, and own the ſatisfaction I receiv'd in his Converſe, with whom I had the honour to be bred in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and in the ſame Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege. The Seventh <hi>Aeneid</hi> was made Engliſh at <hi>Burleigh,</hi> the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Abode of the Earl of <hi>Exeter:</hi> In a Village belonging to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily I was born, and under his Roof I endeavour'd to make that <hi>Aeneid</hi> appear in Engliſh with as much luſtre as I cou'd: though my Author has not given the finiſhing ſtrokes either to it, or to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, as I perhaps cou'd prove in both, if I durſt preſume to Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſe my Maſter.</p>

                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> (who has ſo long honour'd me with his Friendſhip, and who, without flattery, is the beſt Critick of our Nation,) I have been inform'd that his Grace the
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:43031:447"/>
Duke of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> has procur'd a Printed Copy of the <hi>Paſtorals, Georgics,</hi> and ſix firſt <hi>Aeneids,</hi> from my Bookſeller, and has read them in the Country, together with my Friend. This Noble Perſon having been pleas'd to give them a Commendation, which I preſume not to inſert; has made me vain enough to boaſt of ſo great a favour, and to think I have ſucceeded beyond my hopes; the Character of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Judgment, the acuteneſs of his Wit, and his general Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good Letters, being known as well to all the World, as the ſweetneſs of his diſpoſition, his Humanity, his eaſineſs of acceſs, and deſire of obliging thoſe who ſtand in need of his protection, are known to all who have approach'd him; and to me in particular, who have formerly had the honour of his Converſation. Whoever has given the World the Tranſlation of part of the third <hi>Georgic,</hi> which he calls <hi>The Power of Love,</hi> has put me to ſufficient pains to make my own not inferiour to his: As my Lord <hi>Roſcommon</hi>'s <hi>Silenus</hi> had formerly given me the ſame trouble. The moſt Ingenious Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> has alſo been as troubleſome to me as the other two, and on the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. After his Bees, my latter Swarm is ſcarcely worth the hiving. Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi>'s praiſe of a Countrey Life is Excellent; but 'tis rather an imitation of <hi>Virgil,</hi> than a Verſion. That I have recover'd in ſome meaſure the health which I had loſt by too much application to this Work, is owing, next to God's Mercy, to the Skill and Care of Dr. <hi>Guibbons,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> the two Ornaments of their Profeſſion; whom I can only pay by this Acknowledgment. The whole Faculty has always been ready to oblige me: and the only one of them who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to defame me, had it not in his power. I deſire pardon from my Readers for ſaying ſo much in relation to my ſelf, which concerns not them: and with my acknowledgements to all my Subſcribers, have only to add, that the few Notes which follow, are <hi>par maniere d'acquit,</hi> becauſe I had oblig'd my ſelf by Articles, to do ſomewhat of that kind. Theſe ſcattering Obſervations are rather gueſſes at my Author's meaning in ſome paſſages, than proofs that ſo he meant. The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learn'd may have recourſe to any Poetical Dictionary in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for the Names of Perſons, Places, or Fables, which the Learned need not: But that little which I ſay, is either new or neceſſary. And the firſt of theſe qualifications never fails to invite a Reader, if not to pleaſe him.</p>

                  <p>PAſtoral 1. Line 6. <hi>There firſt the Youth of Heavenly Birth I view'd. Virgil</hi> means <hi>Octavius Caeſar:</hi> Heir to <hi>Julius:</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had not arriv'd to his Twentieth Year, when <hi>Virgil</hi> ſaw him firſt. <hi>Vide</hi> his Life. Of Heavenly Birth or Heavenly Blood; becauſe the <hi>Julian</hi> Family was deriv'd from <hi>Julus,</hi> Son to <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and Grand-Son to <hi>Venus.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Paſtoral <hi>3d.</hi> Line 95. <hi>For him, the God of Shepherds and their Sheep, Phoebus,</hi> not <hi>Pan,</hi> is here call'd the God of Shepherds: The Poet alludes to the ſame Story, which he touches in the beginning of the Second <hi>Georgic,</hi> where he calls <hi>Phoebus</hi> the <hi>Amphryſian</hi> Shepherd, becauſe he fed the Sheep and Oxen of <hi>Admetus</hi> (with whom he was in Love) on the Hill <hi>Amphryſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Paſtoral <hi>4th.</hi> Line 73. <hi>Begin Auſpicious Boy,</hi> &amp;c. In Latin thus. <hi>Incipe parve Puer, riſu cognoſcere Matrem,</hi> &amp;c. I have Tranſlated the Paſſage to this Senſe; that the Infant ſmiling on his Mother, ſingles her out from the reſt of the Company about him. <hi>Erythraeus, Bembus,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph Scaliger,</hi> are of this Opinion. Yet they and I may be miſtaken. For immediately after, we find theſe words, <hi>Cui non riſere Parentes,</hi> which imply another Senſe, as if the Parents ſmil'd on the New-born Infant: And that the Babe on whom they vouchſaf'd not to ſmile, was born to ill Fortune. For they tell a Story, that when <hi>Vulcan,</hi> the only Son of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno</hi> came into the World, he was ſo hard favour'd, that both his Parents frown'd on him: And <hi>Jupiter</hi> threw him out of Heaven; he fell on the Iſland <hi>Lemnos,</hi> and was Lame ever afterwards. The laſt Line of the Paſtoral ſeems to juſtify this Senſe, <hi>Nec Deus hunc Menſâ, Dea nec dignata Cubili eſt.</hi> For though he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Venus,</hi> yet his Mother <hi>Juno</hi> was not preſent at the Nuptials to bleſs them; as appears by his Wife's Incontinence. They ſay alſo, that he was baniſh'd from the Banquets of the Gods: If ſo, that Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could be of no long continuance, for <hi>Homer</hi> makes him preſent at their Feaſts; and compoſing a Quarrel betwixt his Parents, with a Bowl of Nectar. The matter is of no great Conſequence; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:43031:449"/>
I adhere to my Tranſlation, for theſe two Reaſons: Firſt, <hi>Virgil</hi> has this following Line. <hi>Matri long a docem tulerunt faſtidia Menſes,</hi> as if the Infants ſmiling on his Mother, was a Reward to her for bearing him ten Months in her Body, four Weeks longer than the uſual time. Secondly, <hi>Catullus</hi> is cited by <hi>Joſeph Scaliger,</hi> as favouring this Opinion, in his <hi>Epithalamium</hi> of <hi>Manlius Torquatus.</hi>

                  <p>What if I ſhou'd ſteer betwixt the two Extreams, and conclude, that the Infant, who was to be happy, muſt not only ſmile on his Parents, but alſo they on him? For <hi>Scaliger</hi> notes that the Infants who ſmil'd not at their Birth, were obſerv'd to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or ſullen (as I have Tranſlated it) during all their Life: And <hi>Servius,</hi> and almoſt all the Modern Commentators affirm, that no Child was thought Fortunate on whom his Parents ſmil'd not, at his Birth. I obſerve farther, that the Ancients thought the Infant who came into the World at the end of the Tenth Month, was Born to ſome extraordinary Fortune, good or Bad. Such was the Birth of the late Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> of whom his Mother was not brought to Bed, 'till almoſt Eleven Months were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd after his Fathers Death: Yet the College of <hi>Phyſicians</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> concluded he was Lawfully begotten. My Ingenious Friend, <hi>Anthony Henley</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> deſir'd me to make a Note on this Paſſage of <hi>Virgil:</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what I had not Read; that the <hi>Jews</hi> have been ſo Superſtitious, as to obſerve not only the firſt Look or Action of an Infant, but alſo the firſt Word which the Parent, or any of the Aſſiſtants ſpoke after the Birth: And from thence they gave a Name to the Child al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding to it.</p>
                  <p>Paſtoral 6. My Lord <hi>Roſcommon</hi>'s Notes on this Paſtoral, are equal to his excellent Tranſlation of it; and thither I refer the Reader.</p>
                  <p>The Eighth and Tenth Paſtorals are already Tranſlated to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of advantage, by my excellent Friend, Mr. <hi>Stafford.</hi> So is the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſode</hi> of <hi>Camilla,</hi> in the Eleventh <hi>Eneid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Eight Paſtoral is Copied by our Author from two <hi>Bucolicks</hi> of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus. Spencer</hi> has follow'd both <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Theocritus,</hi> in the Charms which he employs for Curing <hi>Britomartis</hi> of her Love. But he had alſo our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et's <hi>Ceiris</hi> in his Eye: For there not only the Inchantments are to be found; but alſo the very Name of <hi>Britomartis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Ninth Paſtoral, <hi>Virgil</hi> has made a Collection of many ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paſſages, which he had Tranſlated from <hi>Theocritus:</hi> And here he has bound them into a Noſegay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Georgic</hi> the Firſt. The Poetry of this Book is more ſublime than any part of <hi>Virgil,</hi> if I have any Taſte. And if ever I have Copied his Majeſtick Stile 'tis here. The Compliment he makes <hi>Auguſtus</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the beginning, is ill imitated by his Succeſſors <hi>Lucan</hi> and <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> They Dedicated to Tyrants; and their Flatteries are groſs and fulſome. <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Addreſs is both more lofty and more juſt. In the three laſt Lines of this <hi>Georgic,</hi> I think I have diſcover'd a ſecret Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Emperour, which none of the Commentators have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd. <hi>Virgil</hi> had juſt before deſcrib'd the Miſeries which <hi>Rome</hi> had undergone betwixt the <hi>Triumvirs</hi> and the Commonwealth-Party: In the cloſe of all, he ſeems to excuſe the Crimes committed by his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron

Fertur Equis Auriga, nec audit Currus habenas.</hi> They were the Head-ſtrong Horſes, who hurried <hi>Octavius,</hi> the trembling Charioteer along, and were deaf to his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reclaiming them. I obſerve farther; that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Wars, in which all <hi>Europe,</hi> and part of <hi>Aſia</hi> are ingag'd at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; are wag'd in the ſame places here deſcrib'd: <hi>Atque hinc</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates, <hi>illinc</hi> Germania <hi>Bellum,</hi> &amp;c.

But concerning Grafting, my Honour'd Friend Sir <hi>William Bowyer</hi> has aſſur'd me, that <hi>Virgil</hi> has ſhewn more of Poetry than Skill, at leaſt in relation to our more Northern Climates.

                     <hi>Virgil</hi> Tranſlated this Verſe from <hi>Homer: Homer</hi> had it from <hi>Orpheus;</hi> and <hi>Orpheus</hi> from an Ancient Oracle of <hi>Apollo.</hi> On this Account it is, that <hi>Virgil</hi> immediately Subjoins theſe Words, <hi>Haec Phoebus, &amp;c.

                  <p>This is certainly the Senſe of <hi>Virgil;</hi> on which I have paraphras'd, to make it plain. His Words are theſe; <hi>Moriemur Inultae?</hi>

For this procedure of <hi>Dido,</hi> does not only contain, that, <hi>dira Execratio, quae nullo expiatur Carmine</hi> (as <hi>Horace obſerves</hi> in his <hi>Canidia)</hi> but beſides that, <hi>Virgil,</hi> who is full of Alluſions to Hiſtory, under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Name, deſcribes the <hi>Decii,</hi> devoting themſelves to <hi>Death</hi> this way, though in a better Cauſe, in order to the Deſtruction of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.

That <hi>Virgil</hi> uſes in the word <hi>ſunto</hi> a <hi>verbum juris,</hi> a form of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Solemn and Religious Occaſions: <hi>Livy</hi> does the like.

So that upon the whole matter, <hi>Dido</hi> only doubts whether ſhe ſhou'd die before ſhe had taken her Revenge, which ſhe rather wiſh'd: But conſidering that this devoting her ſelf was the moſt certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible way of compaſſing her Vengeance, ſhe thus exclaims;

                  <p>Which in the Edition of <hi>Heinſius</hi> is thus Printed. <hi>Nunc te facta im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia tangunt?</hi> The word <hi>facta</hi> inſtead of <hi>fata,</hi> is reaſonably alter'd. For <hi>Virgil</hi> ſays afterwards, ſhe dy'd not by Fate, nor by any deſerv'd Death. <hi>Nec Fato, meritâ nec morte peribat,</hi> &amp;c. When I Tranſlated that Paſſage, I doubted of the Senſe: And therefore omitted that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſtic; Nunc te fata impia tangunt.</hi> But <hi>Heinſius</hi> is miſtaken only in making an Interrogation point, inſtead of a Period. The words <hi>facta impia,</hi> I ſuppoſe are genuine: For ſhe had perjur'd her ſelf in her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Marriage. Having firmly reſolv'd, as ſhe told her Siſter, in the beginning of this <hi>Aeneid,</hi> never to love again, after the Death of her firſt Husband; and had confirm'd this Reſolution, by a Curſe on her ſelf, if ſhe ſhou'd alter it.</p>

to thoſe words I have made my <hi>Tranſlation.</hi> 'Tis moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Sun ought not to be omitted; for he is frequently call'd the Life and Soul of all the World: And nothing bids ſo fair for a viſible Divinity to thoſe who know no better, than that glorious Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary. The <hi>Platoniſts</hi> call God the <hi>Archetypall</hi> Sun, and the Sun the viſible Deity, the inward vital Spirit in the Center of the Univerſe, or that Body to which that Spirit is united, and by which-it exerts it ſelf moſt powerfully. Now it was the receiv'd Hypotheſis amongſt the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> that the Sun was ſcituate in the Center of the World: <hi>Plato</hi> had it from them, and was himſelf of the ſame Opinion; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by a paſſage in the <hi>Timaeus:</hi> From which Noble Dialogue is this part of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Poem taken.</p>

                  <p>There is no Queſtion but <hi>Virgil</hi> here means <hi>Cato</hi> Major, or the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.</hi> But the Name of <hi>Cato being</hi> alſo mention'd in the Eighth <hi>Aeneid,</hi> I doubt whether he means the ſame Man in both places. I have ſaid in the Preface, that our Poet was of Republican Principles; and have given this for one Reaſon of my Opinion, that he prais'd <hi>Cato</hi> in that Line,
<q>
                        <hi>Secretiſque piis, his dantem jura</hi> Catonem.</q>
And accordingly plac'd him in the <hi>Elyſian</hi> Fields. <hi>Montaign</hi> thinks this was <hi>Cato</hi> the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tican,</hi> the great Enemy of Arbitrary Power, and a profeſs'd Foe to <hi>Julius Caeſar. Ruaeus</hi> wou'd perſwade us that <hi>Virgil</hi> meant the Cenſor. But why ſhou'd the Poet name <hi>Cato</hi> twice, if he intended the ſame perſon? Our Author is too frugal of his Words and Senſe, to commit Tautologies in either. His Memory was not likely to betray him into ſuch an Errour. Nevertheleſs I continue in the ſame Opinion, concerning the Principles of our Poet. He declares them ſufficiently in this Book: Where he praiſes the firſt <hi>Brutus</hi> for expelling the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> giving Liberty to <hi>Rome,</hi> and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Death his own Children, who conſpir'd to reſtore Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: He calls him only an unhappy Man, for being forc'd to that ſevere Action.</p>

                  <p>How unpoetically and baldly had this been tranſlated; <hi>Thou ſhalt</hi> Marcellus <hi>be!</hi> Yet ſome of my Friends were of Opinion, that I miſtook the Senſe of <hi>Virgil</hi> in my Tranſlation. The <hi>French</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, obſerves nothing on this place; but that it appears by it, the Mourning of <hi>Octavia</hi> was yet freſh, for the loſs of her Son <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi> whom ſhe had by her firſt Husband: And who dyed in the Year <hi>aburbe conditâ,</hi> 731. And collects from thence that <hi>Virgil,</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this <hi>Aeneid</hi> before her, in the ſame Year, had juſt finiſh'd it: That from this time to that of the Poet's Death, was little more than four Years. So that ſuppoſing him to have written the whole <hi>Aeneis</hi> in eleven Years; the firſt ſix Books muſt have taken up ſeven of thoſe Years: On which Account the ſix laſt, muſt of neceſſity be leſs correct.</p>
                  <p>Now for the falſe judgment of my Friends, there is but this little to be ſaid for them; the words of <hi>Virgil,</hi> in the Verſe preceding are theſe,
<q>
                        <hi>—Siqua fata aſpera rumpas.</hi>
                     </q>
As if the Poet had meant, if you break through your hard Deſtiny, ſo as to be born, you ſhall be call'd <hi>Marcellus:</hi> But this cannot be the Senſe: for though <hi>Marcellus</hi> was born, yet he broke not through thoſe hard Decrees, which doom'd him to ſo immature a death. Much leſs can <hi>Virgil</hi> mean, you ſhall be the ſame <hi>Marcellus</hi> by the Tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of his Soul. For according to the Syſtem of our Author, a Thouſand Years muſt be firſt elaps'd, before the Soul can return into a Humane Body; but the firſt <hi>Marcellus</hi> was ſlain in the ſecond <hi>Punick</hi> War. And how many hundred Years were yet wanting, to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing his penance, may with eaſe be gather'd, by computing the time betwixt <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> By which 'tis plain, that <hi>Virgil</hi> cannot mean the ſame <hi>Marcellus;</hi> but one of his Deſcendants; whom I call a new <hi>Marcellus;</hi> who ſo much reſembled his Anceſtor, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in his Features, and his Perſon, but certainly in his Military Vertues, that <hi>Virgil</hi> cries out, <hi>quantum inſtar in ipſo eſt!</hi> which I have tranſlated,

                  <p>What is pervious to the Sight is clear; and (alluding to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,) the Poet infers ſuch Dreams are of Divine Revelation. Such as paſs through the Iv'ry Gate, are of the contrary Nature; poliſh'd Lies. But there is a better Reaſon to be giv'n: For the Iv'ry alludes to the Teeth, the Horn to the Eyes. What we ſee is more credible, than what we only hear; that is, Words that paſs through the Portal of the Mouth, or, Hedge of the Teeth: (which is <hi>Homer</hi>'s expreſſion for ſpeaking.)</p>

                  <p>Smoky Flames, (or involv'd in Smoke) were of a mix'd Omen; ſuch were thoſe which are here deſcrib'd: For Smoke ſignifies Tears, becauſe it produces them, and Flames Happineſs.

                  <p>This has ſeem'd to ſome an odd Paſſage: That a King ſhou'd offer his Daughter and Heir, to a Stranger Prince, and a wanderer, before he had ſeen him, and when he had only heard of his arrival on his Coaſts: But theſe Criticks have not well conſider'd the Simplicity of former times; when the Heroines almoſt courted the Marriage of illuſtrious Men. Yet <hi>Virgil</hi> here obſerves the rule of Decency; <hi>Lavinia</hi> offers not her ſelf: 'Tis <hi>Latinus,</hi> who propounds the Match: And he had been

foretold, both by an Augur, and an Oracle, that he ſhould have a foreign Son-in-Law; who was alſo a Heroe.

Theſe new made Divinities, not only tell <hi>Aeneas</hi> what had paſs'd in his Camp during his abſence; and what was the preſent Diſtreſs of his Beſieg'd People; and that his Horſe-men whom he had ſent by Land, were ready to join him at his Deſcent; but warn him to provide for Battel the next day, and fore-tell him good ſucceſs: So that this <hi>Epiſodical</hi> Machine is properly a part of the great Poem; For beſides what I have ſaid, they puſh on his Navy with Celeſtial Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,

that it might reach the Port more ſpeedily, and take the Enemy more unprovided to reſiſt the Landing. Whereas the Machine rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>Camilla,</hi> is only Ornamental: For it has no effect, which I can find, but to pleaſe the Reader, who is concern'd, that her Death ſhou'd be reveng'd.</p>

I doubt not but as in the fifth Book, he gave us the Names of the Champions, who contended for the ſeveral Prizes, that he might oblige many of the moſt Ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Families, their Deſcendants; and as in the <hi>7th</hi> Book, he Muſter'd the Auxiliary Forces of the <hi>Latins,</hi> on the ſame Account; ſo here he gratifies his <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Friends, with the like remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their Anceſtors; and above the reſt, <hi>Mecaenas</hi> his great Patron: Who being of a Royal Family in <hi>Etruria,</hi> was probably repreſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one of the Names here mention'd, then known among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> though at ſo great a diſtance, unknown to us.

                     <hi>Amata,</hi> ever partial to the Cauſe of <hi>Turnus,</hi> had juſt before deſir'd him, with all manner of earneſtneſs, not to ingage his Rival in ſingle Fight; which was his preſent Reſolution. <hi>Virgil,</hi> though in favour of his Heroe, he never tells us directly, that <hi>Lavinia</hi> preferr'd <hi>Turnus</hi> to <hi>Aeneas,</hi> yet has inſinuated this preference twice before. For mark in the <hi>7th Aeneid,</hi> ſhe left her Father, who had promis'd her to <hi>Aeneas</hi> without asking her conſent: And follow'd her Mother into the Woods, with a Troop of <hi>Bacchanals,</hi> where <hi>Amata</hi> ſung the Marriage Song, in the Name of <hi>Turnus;</hi> which if ſhe had diſlik'd, ſhe might have oppos'd. Then in the <hi>11th. Aeneid,</hi> when her Mother went to the Temple of <hi>Pallas,</hi> to invoke her Aid againſt <hi>Aeneas;</hi> whom ſhe calls by no better Name than <hi>Phrygius Praedo, Lavinia</hi> ſits by her in the ſame Chair or Litter, <hi>juxtaque Comes Lavinia Virgo,—O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culos dejecta decoros.</hi> What greater ſign of Love, than Fear and Concernment for the Lover? In the lines which I have quoted ſhe not only ſheds Tears but changes Colour. She had been bred up with <hi>Turnus,</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> was wholly a Stranger to her. <hi>Turnus</hi> in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility was her firſt Love; and favour'd by her Mother, who had the Aſcendant over her Father. But I am much deceiv'd, if (beſides what I have ſaid) there be not a ſecret Satire againſt the Sex, which is lurking under this Deſcription of <hi>Virgil,</hi> who ſeldom ſpeaks well of Women: Better indeed of <hi>Camilla,</hi> than any other; for he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends her Beauty and Valour: Becauſe he wou'd concern the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for her Death. But Valour is no very proper Praiſe for Woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and Beauty is common to the Sex. He ſays alſo ſomewhat of <hi>Andromache,</hi> but tranſiently: And his <hi>Venus</hi> is a better Mother than a Wife, for ſhe owns to <hi>Vulcan</hi> ſhe had a Son by another Man. The reſt are <hi>Juno</hi>'s, <hi>Diana</hi>'s, <hi>Dido</hi>'s, <hi>Amata</hi>'s, two mad Propheteſſes, three Harpies on Earth, and as many Furies under ground. This Fable of <hi>Lavinia</hi> includes a ſecret Moral; that Women in their choice of Husbands, prefer the younger of their Suitors to the Elder; are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of Merit, fond of Handſomneſs; and generally ſpeaking, rather hurried away by their Appetite, than govern'd by their Reaſon.</p>

                        <l>
                           <hi>Deep in the diſmal Regions, void of Light,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Father of theſe, (not here mention'd) was <hi>Acheron:</hi> the Names of the three, were <hi>Alecto, Maegera,</hi> and <hi>Tyſiphone.</hi> They were call'd Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in Hell, on Earth Harpies, and in Heaven <hi>Dirae:</hi> Two of theſe aſſiſted at the Throne of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and were employed by him, to puniſh the wickedneſs of Mankind. Theſe two muſt be <hi>Megaera,</hi> and <hi>Tyſiphone:</hi> Not <hi>Alecto:</hi> For <hi>Juno</hi> expreſly commands her to return to Hell, from whence ſhe came; and gives this Reaſon.

                  <p>Probably this <hi>Dira,</hi> un-nam'd by the Poet in this Place; might be <hi>Tyſiphone,</hi> for though we find her in Hell, in the ſixth <hi>Aeneid,</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in the puniſhment of the damn'd,

As for the Names of the Harpies, (ſo call'd on Earth) <hi>Heſiod</hi> tells us they were <hi>Iris, Aello,</hi> and <hi>Ocypete. Virgil</hi> calls one of them <hi>Celaeno:</hi> This I doubt not was <hi>Alecto;</hi> whom <hi>Virgil</hi> calls in the third <hi>Aeneid, Furiarum maxima:</hi> And in the ſixth again, by the ſame Name<hi>—Furiarum max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ima, juxta accubat.</hi> That ſhe was the chief of the Furies, appears by her deſcription in the ſeventh <hi>Aeneid:</hi> To which, for haſte, I refer the Reader.</p>
