            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Writing, purporting to be the Bond of Sir <hi>Robert

that ſhe did publiſh this Writing as Sir <hi>Robert

Not Guilty. If we prove the Fact, I do not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
but you will find her guilty, that ſhe may have
her due Puniſhment.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I am of Council
for the King in this Cauſe. You hear what ſort of
Crime it is that is charged on the Priſoner. It is
for Forging a Bond of no leſs Penalty than Forty
Thouſand Pounds, for the Payment of Twenty
Thouſand Pounds. This is made in the Name of
Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> and the Twenty Thouſand Pounds
were to be paid a little after his own Death, by his
Executors or Adminiſtrators: And that in the mean
time, Twelve Hundred Pounds a Year were to be
paid for the Intereſt of this Summ. But, my Lord,
the Priſoner did not reſt here; (a Second Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
will be opened to you.) That which ſhe is
now charged with, is the Forging of a Bond of the
Penalty of Forty Thouſand Pound.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the Priſoner for ſome Years had a
great Intimacy with a Great Peer, the late Duke of
<hi>Buckingham</hi> And ſhe either had, or pretended to
have, a Bond from him for Five Thouſand Pounds,
payable to her ſelf after his Death, and an Annual
Intereſt in the mean time, till the Principal was paid.
Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> being a Truſtee of the Duke's
Eſtate for the Payment of his Debts, the Priſoner
came frequently to Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> to ſolicite
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37509:5"/>
his Favour and Intereſt for the Payment of this Debt.
On this account ſhe inſinuated her ſelf into his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
and into his Family. Sometimes ſhe pretended
to be a great Penitent, and that ſhe was ſorry for the
Converſation ſhe had with the Duke, that her own
Relations being Papiſts, and if ſhe ſhould go to them,
they would ſend her into a Nunnery. All which was
but counterfeit; and in order to win upon Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Clayton,</hi> and he finding ſhe was an ill Woman,
notwithſtanding all her Pretences, he at laſt, about
twelve Years ago, forbid her his Houſe, and ſince
that ſhe never was there.</p>
               <p>About the Year 1695. Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> had ſome
private Intimation given him, that the Priſoner had
a great Demand on him, no leſs than Twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds. Upon this, Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> took
the beſt Courſe he could to find it out, and exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
a Bill in <hi>Chancery</hi> againſt her, and ſome of her
Accomplices, to diſcover whether they had any
Pretences upon him or his Eſtate. To this Bill the
Priſoner put in an Anſwer, that ſhe had no Claim or
Demand againſt him upon any account whatſoever.
While this was in Agitation, the Priſoner came to
Mr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> an Attorney of this City, and
brought him a Writing, purporting a Bond, with
the Name <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> ſubſcribed to it, ſealed and
atteſted by four Witneſſes, as the Bond of Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Clayton;</hi> and told Mr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> 
                  <q>That
Bond was given to her by Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſome good Conſiderations; but it having taken
Air, ſome Uneaſineſs had ariſen about it in Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Clayton's</hi> Family; and (as ſhe pretended) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this account he had exhibited a Bill in <hi>Equity</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:37509:6"/>
againſt her, therefore this Bond muſt be delivered
up; and Sir <hi>Robert</hi> had promiſed, to give her a new
Bond for Twenty Thouſand Pounds, and that all
the Money in Arrears for Intereſt, was to be
turned to Principal, and put into the New Bond.
But this was to be done very privately, ſo as not
to be known by any of Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and therefore none of his Servants were to
be privy to it.</q> Thereupon ſhe gives to Mr. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Bond, deſiring him to make a new Bond
by it, and to turn all the Intereſt that was due into
Principal. Upon this Mr. <hi>Woodward</hi> made her a
Bond of the Penalty of Fifty Four Thouſand Pound
Conditioned, for Payment of Twenty Seven Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds after Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi>'s Death, and
Intereſt in the mean time. This Bond ſhe took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with her, and likewiſe the firſt Bond; but
what ſhe did with them ſince, we are not privy to.
And a great Charge ſhe laid upon Mr. <hi>Woodward,</hi>
to carry it with all poſſible Privacy, that no notice
might be taken in Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s Family.</p>
               <p>Some few Months ago there was another Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſent to Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> that this Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
pretended to have a great Claim upon him of
a great Sum of Money that was to be paid her,
either at preſent, or after his Death; and that
Mr. <hi>Woodward</hi> made the Bond, and he could give an
account of it. Upon this, Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> ſent
to Mr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> who like a very honeſt Man, told
the whole buſineſs, in what manner it was the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
came to him, and how he came to make the
Bond; and that he was deſired to be ſilent in it,
Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> having deſired this Bond ſhould
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37509:6"/>
be made out of his own Houſe, that none of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
might take notice of it.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> having this notice, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Mr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> the Priſoner had taken
this Courſe to carry on this Deſign to charge his
Eſtate, he got a Warrant from the Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
to have her before him, to be examined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Lordſhip. Where being brought, ſhe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her Examination, has confeſt the whole Matter,
her having the firſt Bond, and where it was made.
What is become of the latter Bond, we cannot get
out of her, nor whether ſhe ever affixed the Name
of Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> to that. But we will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Credible Witneſſes to prove her guilty of
Forging the firſt Bond for the Payment of Twenty
Thouſand Pounds; and that it had the Name and Seal
of Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> affixt to it, and that ſhe affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to be a good Bond, well executed by Sir <hi>Robert
Clayton,</hi> and that there was Intereſt due upon it
from Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> and that the Intereſt was
in the Second Bond to be turned into Principal.
We will call Witneſſes to prove this, and then I
hope ſhe ſhall have ſuch Puniſhment as ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.</p>

               <p>My Lord, What the Nature of our
Evidence will be, I ſhall inform you. It cannot be
expected from us to produce the Bond, for that
ſhe carried away from Mr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> ſo that we
cannot give the Writing it ſelf in Evidence; but if
ſhe inſiſt on it, we hope ſhe will produce the Bond.
We have the Copy (taken by Mr. <hi>Woodward</hi>) of
the firſt Bond, which he had from her, that he might
dr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w the Second Bond by it. But we can prove
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37509:7"/>
from that which agrees with our Record, that ſhe
affirmed, that the firſt Bond that ſhe produced was
Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi>'s; That that Bond which ſhe
produced, of which this is the Copy, ſhe affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi>'s Deed. We ſhall do
that, and afterwards prove her publiſhing it: For
our Indictment is againſt her for Forging a Bond,
and Publiſhing that Forged Bond, knowing it to
be ſuch; and cloſe all with her own Confeſſion.
And, My Lord, there is this to ſhow there could be
nothing in the Bond, that from the time ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have this Bond, when ſhe was to have
Twelve Hundred Pound a Year, ſhe remained a
Priſoner all that time, and got her ſelf out by
ſwearing ſhe was not worth Five Pounds in all the
World. Call Mr. <hi>Woodward</hi> (who appeared, and

               <p>My Lord, Mrs. <hi>Butler</hi> has been
my Client many Years. About two or three Years
ago, more or leſs, Mrs. <hi>Butler</hi> came to me, and
brought me a Bond; ſhe gave it me to peruſe, and
told me another muſt be drawn by it. When I had
peruſed the Bond, I found it was ſigned <hi>Robert
Clayton,</hi> and four Witneſſes Names ſet to the Bond.
It was a Bond of the Penalty, as I remember, of
Forty Thouſand Pounds, and I think it was in the
Year 1687. for to pay, I think, Twelve Hundred
Pounds a Year, by four Quarterly Payments Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
during Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi>'s Life. And Twenty
Thouſand Pounds within ſix Months after his Death.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37509:7"/>
There were ſome other things in that Bond, which
will appear by the Copy, which indeed I did take:
For Mrs. <hi>Butler</hi> deſired it might be a Secret, being
of a very great Concern. And I asked her why
ſuch a Bond ſhould be given, I thought it muſt be
great Generoſity, and not for Money lent. But ſhe
told me the Forty Thouſand Pound Bond was to be
delivered up to Sir <hi>Robert.</hi> I asked her, why, ſince
ſhe had it, ſhe did not keep it; ſhe ſaid, that he
would give her another Bond. She told me it had
taken Air, and my Lady <hi>Clayton</hi> had ſome Diſquiet
about it; and for my Lady's Satisfaction, a Bill in
<hi>Chancery</hi> was exhibited againſt her, to which ſhe
was to put in her Anſwer, and thereby diſclaim
any ſort of Bond, or Intereſt, or any pretence that
ſhe had upon Sir <hi>Robert Clayton.</hi>

               <p>Yes, and when ſhe gave me the
Bond, ſhe told me it was Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi>'s Bond,
or to that purpoſe. But there being about nine or
ten Years Arrears of Intereſt, ſhe deſired me to caſt
up the Intereſt that was in Arrear, and that it might
be put to the Principal in the new Bond; ſaying,
That Sir <hi>Robert</hi> would give her a Bond for the whole
together.</p>

               <p>She ſaid ſhe had received ſome
Money, and I computed the reſt, rather under than
over, and ſo made the Intereſt to come to Seven
Thouſand Pounds, (the Intereſt, payable by the
Bond, being Twelve Hundred Pounds a Year.)
Whereupon ſhe deſired I would draw a Bond for
it my ſelf; and accordingly ſhe left the firſt Bond
with me. I took ſome time, and drew it; and
made the Penalty thereof Fifty Four Thouſand
Pounds, conditioned for the Payment of Twenty
Seven Thouſand Pounds. And it was to be made
in the ſame Nature as the former was, in reſpect of
the Principal, and in the mean time to continue
the Payment of the Intereſt Yearly, by proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Quarterly payments.</p>

               <p>I did draw a Bond, and did take
notice, That whereas Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> had given
her this Bond of Forty Thouſand Pounds, and at
his Requeſt, ſhe had deliver'd it up to him; and
upon an Account ſtated, there did remain Seven
Thouſand Pounds in Arrears for Intereſt, which in
all, amounted to Seven and Twenty Thouſand
Pounds, or thereabouts; when I gave it her, I ſaid,
It is a very great Summ, it concerns you to have
Witneſſes of Credit, for no body will believe Sir
<hi>Robert Clayton</hi> did give you this Bond, eſpecially
after his Death, unleſs it be very well atteſted. I
told her, if ſhe pleaſed, I would go and be a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for her to ſee it executed. So ſhe went away.
And when ſhe came to me again, ſhe told me, that
Sir <hi>Robert</hi> knew me very well, but did not think fit
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37509:8"/>
to have me for a Witneſs. I anſwer'd, I do not
care; but it being a very great Sum, take care it
be well executed. I gave her both the Bonds, and
from that time heard no more of it till about two
Months ſince.</p>

occaſioned me to remember it, and I told him that
I did do ſome Buſineſs for her. He told me Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Clayton</hi> had ſome Information given him, that
there was ſuch a Bond drawn by me. Then I told
him, I did remember there was ſuch a Bond brought
to me, and that I had made a Bond for Mrs. <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi>

I had by me; and alſo of the ſecond Bond, in which
I had left out a material Word in the Obligation,

Twenty Thouſand Pounds. Now the Bond, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

               <p>This Bond is not in the Indictment.
The Bond of Forty Thouſand Pound is ſeveral Years
ſince. Now there are two Bonds. Now that of
Fifty Four Thouſand Pounds is not in this Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and this of Forty Thouſand Pounds is ſeveral
Years ſince that it was ſhown to him. It is ſtrange he
ſhould be ſo very exact, and yet did not examine it.
And probably he might miſtake in the Copy, and it
may not be the very Bond in the Indictment. Now
as to Mr. <hi>Baker,</hi> it is true, we have a Bond of Five
Thouſand Pounds from the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37509:13"/>
we are ſuing Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> for this Money, and
hope to have it, now after ſo many Years. And
Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> did prefer a Bill in <hi>Chancery</hi> againſt
us, and we in Anſwer did declaim having any ſuch
Bond. And now when we are like to have a Decree
for this Summ againſt this Truſtee of the Duke of
<hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Eſtate, he comes and would take off
our Credit in this Matter. We did in the Year
1695. diſclaim any ſuch Bond.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, This Mrs.
<hi>Butler,</hi> alias <hi>Strickland,</hi> ſtands Indicted for Forging
a Bond in the Name of Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> in the
Penalty of Forty Thouſand Pound, the Condition
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37509:15"/>
for the Payment of Twenty Thouſand Pound, among
other things, within Six Months after the Death of
Sir <hi>Robert Clayton.</hi> And alſo, That ſhe did publiſh
this Bond as the true Bond of Sir <hi>Robert Clayton.</hi>
You have heard what Evidence has been given, to
prove her guilty of this Forgery, and the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it.</p>
               <p>It ſeems, ſome time ſince, as is proved to you by
Mr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> this Gentlewoman came to him with
this Bond of Forty Thouſand Pounds. And it was
upon this account, as ſhe ſaid. To wit, Sir <hi>Robert
Clayton</hi> having given her this Bond, it had taken
Air, and was come to the Lady <hi>Clayton's</hi> Ear;
which occaſioned ſome Difference between Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Clayton</hi> and his Lady. She ſaid, That this
Bond, by Direction from Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
up to him to be Cancell'd; and that Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Clayton</hi> had engaged to enter into a New Bond in
the Penalty of Fifty Four Thouſand Pounds, for the
Payment of Twenty Six Thouſand Pound (there
being at that that time ſuppoſed an Arrear of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
for 20000 <hi>l.</hi>) payable after Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s Death,
and Intereſt in the mean time. She delivered this
Bond to Mr. <hi>Woodward.</hi> He takes a Copy of it,
which is produced and read. And ſo, according to
her Direction, Mr. <hi>Woodward</hi> does draw another
Bond, with the Penalty of Fifty Four Thouſand
Pound. And ſhe then told Mr. <hi>Woodward</hi> Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
would ſeal this Bond upon the Delivery up of
the Bond of Forty Thouſand Pound. Mr. <hi>Woodward</hi>
having conſidered, that it was an extraordinary
Summ for Sir <hi>Robert</hi> to engage himſelf in; and he
being a very conſiderable Man, he adviſed her to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37509:16"/>
have this New Bond well atteſted; and to be ſure
to get Witneſſes of unqueſtionable Credit to ſee it
executed. And thereupon he offered himſelf to go
with her to Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> to be a Witneſs to this New
Bond. No, ſays ſhe, Sir <hi>Robert</hi> is not willing that
this ſhould be known, you are not a proper Perſon
to be a Witneſs to it; therefore, ſays ſhe, I will get
ſome other Witneſſes to atteſt it. Whereupon he
gives her this firſt Bond for Forty Thouſand Pounds,
which ſhe brought to him, for the Payment of
Twenty Thouſand Pounds; and gave her alſo
the Draught of the New Bond. He ſays this Bond
that ſhe brought to him, was atteſted by Four
Witneſſes. Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> it ſeems, upon her Anſwer
in <hi>Chancery,</hi> not imagining any thing of this, ſhe
having diſclaimed in <hi>Chancery</hi> the having; only
ſome time after he had heard a Report as if ſhe was
ſetting up of a New Bond, and that Mr. <hi>Woodward</hi>
could give an account of it. Wherefore he ſends
Mr. <hi>Baker</hi> to Mr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> who gave him the
ſame account that he has done here. Then Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
makes a Complaint, and has her brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me; and there was Mr. <hi>Woodward</hi> with this
Copy. And this was objected to her, as if ſhe
had Forged this Bond. And it ſeems, when ſhe
was there under Examination, as is proved to you
by Mr. <hi>Baker,</hi> ſhe did plainly confeſs, that ſhe had
Forged this Bond of Forty Thouſand Pounds, and
that ſhe had procured one <hi>Lewkar</hi> to do it for her,
who ſet Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s Name to it; and ſaid, that the
Witneſſes, whoſe Names were ſet to it, were inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and knew nothing of the matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:37509:16"/>
Now what is ſaid for her on the other ſide?
They bring ſome Perſons for her, that ſay they
have known her. One, that ſays he belonged to
<hi>Lincolns-Inn,</hi> and been acquainted with her four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or fifteen Years, and did look upon her as a
Civil Woman; and for his part, he does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
ſhe would be guilty of ſuch a Forgery. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who is a Woman, ſays ſhe has known her
ſome time, and ſhe ſays ſhe has truſted her much,
and did never hear her ſay any thing of this Bond,
but ſhe behaved her ſelf civilly, and ſhe took her
to be a very ſober Perſon. Another Witneſs ſays,
ſhe look'd on her to be a very honeſt Perſon. This
is the Sum of the Evidence.</p>
               <p>There is a very ſtrong Evidence to induce you
to believe that ſhe did Forge the Bond. Such a
Bond ſhe had, that is plain. She does give
no Account what is become of it; and ſhe does
not ſhow any manner of Pretence of having ſo
much Money from Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> due to her,
ſhe does not make it appear why Sir <hi>Robert</hi> ſhould
give her a Bond upon any account. Now for any
to ſay that they knew her, and they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
ſhe would Forge a Bond, that is no Evidence;
no body ought to believe Ill of Mrs. <hi>Butler,</hi> or any
one elſe, unleſs it be made to appear. But the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
is not, what they do believe; but whether the
matter be not proved to you to your Satisfaction,
that ſhe has Forged this Bond. And if you are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
that ſhe did Forge it, you ought to find her
guilty; and if you do not believe the Evidence to
be ſatisfactory, you ought to acquit her.</p>

            <p>

Then the Jury withdrew, and being returned, gave
their Verdict as follows.</p>

            <p>The Judgment which the Court pronounced againſt
her was, That ſhe ſhould pay a Fine of 500 <hi>l.</hi> to the
