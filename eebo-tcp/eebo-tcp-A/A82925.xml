            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Ver ſince that Wonderful and unexpected Victory, which the Lord was pleaſed the laſt Summer to give unto a ſmall Party of the Parliaments Forces then in <hi>Dublin,</hi> againſt that numerous and potent Army under <hi>Ormond,</hi> which was a Door of Hope to the Parliament, and their Army then on their way for <hi>Ireland,</hi> That the Lord, who had made ſo open a way for them, would vouchſafe his Preſence with them, to carry on and perfect that Work which himſelf had ſo eminently begun in that admirable Providence, wherein he had, as it were, by a Worm threſhed the Mountains: The ſame gracious Hand hath gone along from time to time with his Servants there, vouchſafing them many Victories, giving in many ſtrong Cities, Towns, Caſtles and Gariſons into their hands, raiſing up their Spirits, overcoming great Difficulties, furniſhing ſeaſonable Supplies, and diſmaying the hearts of the Enemies, and that in ſuch a Series of continued Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, as is juſt matter of high Admiration, and perpetual Thankfulneſs in all that truly fear the Lord, and love his Cauſe and People. And ſeeing every Addition of Mercy, is a further Obligation to Thankfulneſs and Duty; and that the Lord hath been pleaſed, as a further Manifeſtation of his Goodneſs, to give up into the hands of the Parliament Forces there, <hi>Carlo,</hi> a Gariſon of much Strength and Importance; <hi>Waterford,</hi> a great and populous Town, and the moſt conſiderable Harbor in all <hi>Ireland,</hi> upon Saturday the Tenth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> inſtant; together with the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Duncannon,</hi> ſince likewiſe Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred upon Articles: The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> have thought fit not to let ſuch great Mercies paſs, without an eſpecial return of Thankfulneſs, but to publiſh the Narrative thereof, as it comes to us in a Letter from the Deputy General of <hi>Ireland; (viz.)</hi> The effect whereof is as followeth: The Deputy having received at the late Leaguer before <hi>Catherlagh,</hi> ſeveral Alarms of great Forces of the Enemies riſing and appearing within the Counties of <hi>Cork, Kerry, Limrick</hi> and <hi>Tipperary,</hi> to the diſtreſſing and endangering of our Parties and Gariſons in thoſe parts; where the Enemy threatned to deſtroy our Quarters, and probably deſigned a conjunction of their moſt conſiderable Forces, in order to the Relief of <hi>Waterford,</hi> and an Attempt upon that ſmall party that was left to Block it up; after he had diſpoſed divers of his Forces to ſecure <hi>Carrick,</hi> to repel and oppoſe the Enemy in <hi>Carbery,</hi> and the Weſtern parts, and to march to the Relief of our Forces in <hi>Kerry</hi> and <hi>Limrick,</hi> leaving Sir <hi>Hardreſs Waller</hi> with the Body of the Army, to carry on the buſineſs about <hi>Catherlagh,</hi> did himſelf draw down with a ſmall party of Foot towards <hi>Waterford,</hi> to Beleaguer it more ſtraitly: Coming before <hi>Waterford</hi> with thoſe Foot, and ſome ſmall parties left there before, to Block it up at a diſtance, applied himſelf to a cloſer Siege of it, making two Quarters within ſhot of their Walls, which with our Foot at the Abbey on the other ſide of the Water, kept them cloſe within the Town on every ſide; and then trying them with a Summons, the Enemy within ſo deſpiſed our ſmall Numbers, as that they made an offer, as if they durſt ſet open one of their Gates, and let in all our Foot to make the beſt of it: And to that being anſwered, It was but a vain Brag, and they durſt not make it good; they in Reply, for their Honors ſake, ſeemed to adhere to their former Vanity, but with ſuch conditions and cautions, as they might be ſure would not be accepted: But that the Power of God might appear in our deſpiſed Weakneſs againſt this Pride of Man, Theſe Sons of Honor, as they would be thought, did even in both the ſame Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, unequally ſubjoyn to theſe high Vapors, an offer of Treaty for Surrender: During which time, News came from <hi>Catherlagh,</hi> That it had pleaſed God, beyond, or much before Expectation, upon our Mens Battering, and then taking by Storm (without Loſs on our part) a ſmall Tower on their Bridge over the <hi>Barrow,</hi> to bring down the Enemies hearts to a Treaty, and Surrender of that ſtrong and important Place. Hereupon the Deputy conceiving <hi>Waterford</hi> to be attemptible by force in one or two places, though otherwiſe exceedingly fortified: while preparations were made for that Attempt, the Lord wrought upon the hearts of the Enemy to deſire a Treaty, without their terms of Honor, which formerly they inſiſted on; by which, after high Demands, rejected on our part with Indignation, they were on Tueſday the Sixth of this inſtant <hi>Auguſt,</hi> brought to Surrender upon Articles, which was performed on Saturday following; At which time there marched out about Seven hundred men well armed, the Townſmen more numerous then before was believed, and the Town better Fortified in all parts, and more difficult to be attempted then our Forces conceived, there being many private Stores, ſufficient to have maintained them a long time: whereby we may ſee the Hand of God, in over-powering the hearts of the Enemy, which was the onely cauſe of their preſent Surrender. By this of <hi>Waterford</hi> and <hi>Catherlagh,</hi> God was pleaſed to extend his Hand toward <hi>Duncannon,</hi> the Enemy there (though a Prieſt were Governor) having on the ſame Saturday, with Colonel <hi>Cooks</hi> leave, ſent one to <hi>Waterford,</hi> to ſee whether it were Surrendred, did on the Eleventh of this Moneth deſire a Treaty, which produced, through the ſame Divine Mercy, a Surrender of the ſame Caſtle of <hi>Duncannon,</hi> upon Articles, on Saturday the ſeventeenth of this Moneth; ſince which time, the ſtrong Gariſon and Caſtle of <hi>Charlemount</hi> is likewiſe Surrendred, whereby the whole Province of <hi>Ulſter</hi> is now intirely in the Power of the Parliament.</p>
