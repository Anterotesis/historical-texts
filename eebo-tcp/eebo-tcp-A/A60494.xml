            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE PRINTER TO THE READER,</hi> And all worthy Adventurers by Sea, and well-wishers to NAVIGATION.</head>
            <p>THere hath been much already written concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Art of War by Land, but nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the same at Sea; yet perceiving the present occasion to require something of that kind, I have adventured to bring again to remembrance, those excellent Precepts and Directions, long since published by Captain <hi>John Smith,</hi> which were almost worn out by time, and herein, if my desire to do good hath trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported me beyond my self, I intreat your excuse, and take for requital this bundle of many Ages Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: which although they be not so punctually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled as the Author could have wished, and it may be you expect, yet at present they cannot be much amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; If any will bestow that pains, I shall think him my friend, and honour his endeavours.</p>
            <p>And now (since it was the desire of the Experienced Author, to have this his Treatise amplified and made more useful,) I have, in this Edition, caused to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>An Alphabetical Table</hi> of the Names of all the Parts
<pb facs="tcp:105579:3"/>
or Members of a <hi>Ship,</hi> and its <hi>Apurtenances;</hi> with the number of the Page wherein they are at large Explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And also, another <hi>Alphabetical Table,</hi> wherein the principal <hi>Sea-Terms</hi> used in working of a <hi>Ship</hi> in all <hi>Winds</hi> and <hi>Weathers,</hi> and also in a <hi>Fight</hi> at Sea, are largely discoursed and explained.</p>
            <p>And to make this Treatise, yet more useful for Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service (especially in time of War) I have caused to be added also, an <hi>Abstract</hi> of the Art of <hi>Practical Gunnery;</hi> Wherein the Principles of that Art are plainly Taught both by <hi>Arithmetical Calculation,</hi> and by new <hi>Tables</hi> ready <hi>Calculated.</hi> Together with the manner of Shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Morter-Pieces;</hi> The making of <hi>Granados, Petards</hi> and other <hi>Fireworks</hi> useful in War, both at Sea and Land: And by way of <hi>Appendix,</hi> several <hi>Geometrical</hi> ways, to take <hi>Heights, Depths,</hi> and <hi>Distances,</hi> accessible or inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessible. All which are freely communicated for the benefit of his Country, and the good of Navigators and Gunners:</p>
            <p>And as I shall find these Essays of mine accepted, I shall be encouraged farther to accommodate them with the Mathematical part of <hi>Navigation.</hi>

                  <p>How to build a Ship, with the definitions of the names of every part of her <hi>Principal Timbers,</hi> and how they are fixed one to another, with the reasons of their use.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe first and lowest Timber in a ship is the <hi>Keel,</hi> to <note place="margin">The Keel.</note> which is fastened all the rest; this is a great tree or more, hewn to the proportion of her burden, laid by a right line in the bottom of the Dock, or Stocks. At the one end is Skarfed into it the <hi>Stem,</hi> which is a great timber wrought compassing, and all the butt-ends of the <note place="margin">The Stem.</note> planks forwards are fixed to it. The <hi>Stern post</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">The Stern.</note> great Timber, which is let into the Keel at the other end somewhat sloping, and from it doth rise the two <hi>fashion-pieces</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The fashion-pieces.</note> like a pair of great horns, to those are fastened all the planks that reach to the after end of the Ship, but before you use any planks, they lay the <hi>Rungs,</hi> called floor <note place="margin">The Rungs.</note> timbers, or ground timbers, thwart the keel: thro' those you cut your <hi>Limberholes</hi> to bring the water to the well for <note place="margin">The Limber-holes.</note> the pump, the use of them is when the Ship is built to draw in them a long hair rope, by pulling it from Stern to Stern, to scowre them, and keep them clean from choaking.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:105579:6"/>
Those ground timbers do give the <hi>Floor</hi> of the Ship, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The Floor.</note> straight, saving at the ends they begin to compass, and there they are called the <hi>Rungheads,</hi> and doth direct the <note place="margin">Rungheads. Sweep. Mould. Skarfing.</note> 
                  <hi>Sweep</hi> or <hi>Mould</hi> of the Foot-hooks and Navel timbers, for there doth begin the compass and bearing of the Ship, those are <hi>Skarfed</hi> into the ground Timbers, which is one piece of wood let into another, or so much wood cut away from the one as from the other, for when any of those Timbers are not long enough of themselves, they are skarfed in this manner, to make two or three as one: Those next the Keel are called the ground Foot-hooks, the other the upper Foot-hooks; but first lay your <hi>Keeleson.</hi> over your floor Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which is another long tree like the <hi>Keel,</hi> and this lying <note place="margin">Foot-hooks.

Sleepers.</note> in general are called the Ships <hi>Ribs,</hi> because they represent the carkass of any thing that hath Ribs. The <hi>Sleepers</hi> run before and after one each side the Keeleson, on the floor well bolted to the Foot-hooks, which being thus bound do streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <note place="margin">Spurkits.</note> each other. The <hi>Spurkits</hi> are the spaces betwixt the Timbers alongst the Ship side in all parts, but them in Howle below the Sleepers, are broad boards which they take up to clear the Spurkits, if any thing get betwixt the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Garbord</hi> is the first plank next the Keel on the out-side, <note place="margin">The Garbord Garbord-strak-Rising-timbers.</note> the <hi>Garbord-Strake</hi> is the first seam next the Keel, your <hi>Rising timbers</hi> are the hooks, or ground timbers and foot-hooks placed on the Keel, and as they rise by little and little, so doth the <hi>Run</hi> of the Ship from the floor, which <note place="margin">The Run.</note> is that part of the Ship under water, which comes narrower by degrees from the floor timbers along the stern post, called the Ships way aftward, for according to her run she will stear well or ill, by reason of the quickness or slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the water coming to the Rudder: Now all those

planks under water, as they rise and are joyned one end to <note place="margin">Planks.</note> another, the fore end is called the <hi>But-end</hi> in all Ships: but in great Ships they are commonly most carefully bolted, for <note place="margin">But-ends.</note> if one of those ends should spring, or give way, it would be a great troublesome danger to stop such a leak, the other parts of those planks are made fast with good <hi>Tree nails</hi> and <hi>Trunnions</hi> of well seasoned Timber, thorow the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <note place="margin">Tree-nails.

thing that breaks her Planks or Timbers to spring a Leak.</p>
               <p>When you have berthed or brought her up to the <hi>Planks,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Planks.</note> which are those thick Timbers which goeth fore and aft on each side, whereon doth lie the beams of the first <hi>Orlop,</hi>

Great Ships have a tire of Beams under the Orlop, whereon lies no Deck, and great posts and binders called <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Riders.</note> from them to the Keel in Howle only to strengthen all.

               <p>Lay the Orlop with good Plank, according to her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, so level as may be, is the best in a Man of War, because all the <hi>Ports</hi> may be of such equal height, so that <note place="margin">Ports.

               <p>The half Deck is from the main Mast to the Steerage, and the Quarter-Deck from that to the Masters Cabin called the Round House, which is the utmost of all, but you must understand all those Works are brought up together, as near equally as may be from <hi>bend</hi> to <hi>bend,</hi> or <hi>waile</hi> to <note place="margin">Bend, or waile.</note>

               <argument>
                  <p>How to proportion the <hi>Masts</hi> and <hi>Yards,</hi> for a Ship, by her <hi>Beam</hi> and <hi>Keel.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHen a Ship is built, she should be masted, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">A Ship over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masted.</note> is a great deal of experience to be used so well as art; for if you <hi>Over maste</hi> her, either in length or bigness, she will lie too much down by a wind, and labour too much a hull, and that is called a <hi>Taunt-mast,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Taunt-masted. Under-masted.</note> but if either too small or too short, she is <hi>Under-masted</hi> or low-masted, and cannot bear so great a sail as should give her her true way. For a man of war, a well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Taunt-mast is best, but for a long voyage, a short-mast will bear more Canvas, and is less subject to bear by the board: Their Rules are divers, because no Artist can build a Ship so truly to proportion, neither set her Masts, but by the trial of her condition, they may be impaired or amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <note place="margin">An example.</note> suppose a Ship of 300 Tuns be 29 foot at the Beam, if her main mast be 24 inches diameter, the length of it must be 24 yards, for every inch in thickness is allowed a yard in length, and the fore-mast 22 inches in thickness, must be 22 yards in length; your Bowle-spret both in length and thickness must be equal to the fore-mast, the Misen 17 yards in length, and 17 inches diameter.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Rule</hi> most used is to take the ⅘ parts of the <note place="margin">The rule most used.</note> breadth of the Ship, and multiply that by three, it will give you so many foot as your <hi>Main-mast</hi> should be in length, the bigness or thickness will bear it also, allowing an inch for a yard; but if it be <hi>A made-mast,</hi> or <hi>arme-mast,</hi> that is <note place="margin">A made Mast, or an arme Mast.</note> greater than one Tree, it must be more; for example, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Ships breadth 30 foot, four fifths of 30 foot are 24 foot, so you find the main Mast must be 24 yards long, for every yard is 3 foot 24 inches thorow, allowing an inch to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105579:13"/>
every yard. The fore-Mast is to be in length ⅘ of the main Mast, which will be 20 yards wanting one ⅘ part of a yard, and 20 inches thorow. The Boultspret must ever be equal with the fore-Mast. The Misen-Mast half the length of the Main-Mast, which will be 12 yards long, and 12 inches diameter. Now as you take the proportion of the Mast from the Beam or breadth of the Ship, so do you the length of the yards from the Keel.</p>
               <p>These Masts have each their <hi>Steps</hi> in the Ship, and their <note place="margin">The Steps. Partners.</note> 
                  <hi>Partners</hi> at every Dock where thorow they pass to the Keel, being strong Timbers bolted to the Beams in circling the Masts, to keep them steady in their steps fast wedged for rowing; yet some Ships will not sail so well as when it doth play a little, but that is very dangerous in foul weather. Their <hi>Cotes</hi> are pieces of tarred Canvas, or a <hi>Tarpawling</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cotes. Tarpawling.</note> put about them and the Rudder to keep the water out. At the top of the fore Mast and main-Mast are spliced <hi>Cheeks,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cheeks.</note> or thick clamps of wood, thorow which are in each two holes called the <hi>Hounds,</hi> wherein the Tyes do run to hoise <note place="margin">The Hounds.</note> the yards, but the Top-Mast hath but one hole or Hound, and one tye. Every Mast also hath a <hi>Cap</hi> if a top; which <note place="margin">The Cap.</note> is a piece of square Timber with a round hole in it to receive, the top Masts or Flag staffe, to keep them steady and strong, least they be born by the board in a stiffe-gale. The <hi>Crosse-trees</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Crosse-trees.</note> are also at the head of the Masts, one let into another cross, and strongly boulted with the <hi>Tressel-trees</hi> to keep <note place="margin">Tressel trees.</note> up the top-Masts which are fastened in them, and those are at the tops of each Masts; all the Masts stand upright but the Boultspret which lyeth along over the Beak-head, and that Timber it resteth on is called the <hi>Pillow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <note place="margin">Pillow. An example of the Yards by the Keel.</note> for the yards, suppose the Ship be 76 foot at the Keel, her main yard must be 21 yards in length, and in thickness but 17 inches. The fore-yard 19 yards long, and 15 inches diameter or thick. The spret-sail yard 16 yards long, and but 9 inches thick, and your Misen-yard so long as the Mast, the Top-yards bears half proportion to the main, and Fore-yard, and the Top-gallants, the half to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105579:13"/>
them, but this rule is not absolute, for if your Masts be taunt, your Yards must be the shorter; if a low Mast, the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: but this is supposed the best, to have the main Yard ⅚ parts of her Keel in length: the top-Yard ⅘ of the main-Yard; and the main-Yard for bigness ¼ parts of an inch, for a yard in length. The length of the fore-Yard ⅘ of the main Yard: the crossjack-Yard and Spretsail Yard to be of a length, but you must allow the Missen-Yard and Spret-sail Yard ½ inch of thickness to a yard in length. But to give a true Arithmetical and Geometrical proportion for the building of all sorts of Ships, were they all built after one mould, as also of their Masts, Yards, Cables, Gordage, and Sails, were all the stuff of like goodness, a methodical rule as you see might be projected; but their lengths, breadths, depths, rakes and burthens are so variable and different, that nothing but experience can possibly teach it.</p>

The greatest is the <hi>Sheet Anchor,</hi> and never used but in great necessity. They are commonly made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Burthen of the Ship by proportion, for that the Sheet-Anchor of a small Ship will not serve for a Kedger <note place="margin">An Anchors Shank. Flook. Shoulder. Beam or Nut. Eye. Ring. Stock.</note> to a great Ship. Also it beareth a proportion in it self, as the one flook, which is that doth stick in the ground, is but the third part of the <hi>Shank</hi> in length; at the head of the shank there is a hole called an <hi>Eye,</hi> and in it a <hi>Ring,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is the <hi>Nut</hi> to which there is fast fixed a <hi>Stock</hi> of wood crossing the <hi>Flooks,</hi> and the length is taken from the length of the Shank.

               <p>The <hi>Cables</hi> also carry a proportion to the Anchors, but if it be not three stroud, it is accounted but a Hawser, yet a <note place="margin">A Cable, the first, second, and third.</note> great Ships Hawser may be a Cable to the Sheet-anchor for a small Ship: and there is the first, second, and third Cable, besides the <hi>Sheet-Anchor Cable.</hi> If the Cable be well <note place="margin">Sheet-Anchor-Cable.

To <hi>Keckell</hi> or sarve the Cable, as is said, is but to bind some old clouts to keep it from gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Hawse or Ring. <hi>Splice</hi> a Cable, is to fasten <note place="margin">Splice.</note> two ends together, that it may be double in length, to make the Ship ride with more ease, and is called a <hi>shot of Cable.</hi>

                  <hi>Quoile</hi> a Cable, is to lay it up in a round Ring, or <hi>fake</hi> one above another. <hi>Pay more Cable,</hi> is when you carry an Anchor out in the Boat to turn over. <hi>Pay cheap,</hi> is when you over set it, or turns it over board faster. <hi>Veere more Cable,</hi> is when you ride at Anchor. And <hi>end for end</hi> is when the Cable runneth clear out of the Hawse, or any rope out of his shiver. A <hi>Bight</hi> is to hold by any part of a coile, that is, the upmost fake. A <hi>Bitter</hi> is but the turn of a Cable about the Bits, and veere it out by little and little. And the <hi>Bitters end</hi> is that part of the Cable doth stay within <note place="margin">A Bitter. A Bitters end.

               <p>To <hi>bend the Cable</hi> to the Anchor, is to make it fast to <note place="margin">To bend Unbend.</note> the Ring; <hi>unbend the Cable,</hi> is but to take it away, which we usually do when we are at Sea, and to tie two ropes or Cables together is called <hi>bending. Hitch,</hi> is to catch hold <note place="margin">Bending Hitch.</note> of any thing with a rope to hold it fast, or with a hook, as hitch the Fish-hook to the Anchors flook, or the Tackles into the Garnets of the Slings. <hi>Fenders</hi> are pieces of old <note place="margin">Fenders. Junkes.</note> Hausers called <hi>Iunkes</hi> hung over the Ship-sides to keep them from bruising. In Boats they use Poles or Boat-hooks to fend off the Boat from bruising. A <hi>Brest fast</hi> is a <note place="margin">Brest-fast.</note> rope which is fastened to some part of the Ship forward on, to hold her head to a Wharff or any thing, and a <hi>Stern fast</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Stern-fast.</note> is the same in the Stern. The use for the Hawser is to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105579:21"/>
warp the Ship by, which is laying out an Anchor, and wind her up to it by a Capstern. <hi>Rousing</hi> is but pulling the flack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <note place="margin">Rousing.</note> of any Cables with mens hands into the Ship. The <hi>Shank-panter</hi> is a short chain fastened under the Fore-masts <note place="margin">Shank-panter.</note> shrowds with a bolt to the Ships sides, and at the other end a rope to make fast the Anchor to the Bowe. To <hi>Stop</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Stop.</note> is when you come to an Anchor, and veeres out your Cable, but by degrees till the Ship ride well, then they say stop the Ship. To those Cables and Anchors belong short pieces of wood called <hi>Boys,</hi> or close hooped Barrels like Tankards <note place="margin">Boyes.</note> as is said, but much shorter, to shew you the Anchor and help to weigh it, there is another sort of Cans called <hi>Can Boys</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Main sail</hi> and the <hi>Fore sail</hi> is called the <hi>Fore-course,</hi> and the <hi>main course,</hi> or a pair of Courses. <hi>Bonits</hi> and <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers</hi>

Now the use of those Sails is thus, all <hi>Head-sails,</hi> which are <note place="margin">Head-Sails.</note> those belonging to the Fore mast and Bolt spret, do keep the Ship from the Wind or to fall off: All <hi>After-sails,</hi> that <note place="margin">After-Sails.</note> is, all the Sails belonging to the Main-mast and Misen, keeps her to Wind-ward, therefore few Ships will stear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Quarter-winds with one Sail, but must have one after Sail, and one Head-sail. The Sails are cut in proportion as the Masts and Yards are in breadth and length, but the Spret-sail is ¾ parts the depth of the Fore sail, and the Misen by the Leech twice so deep as the Mast is long from the Deck to the Hounds. The <hi>Leech</hi> of a Sail is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">Leech.</note> side or skirt of the Sail from the Earing to the Clew, the middle betwixt which we account the Leech. The <hi>Clew,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Clew.</note> is the lower corner of a Sail, to which you make fast your Sheets and Tacks, or that which comes goring out from the square of the Sail, for a Square-sail hath no Clew, but the Main sail must be cut <hi>Goring,</hi> because the Tacks will <note place="margin">Goring.</note> come closer aboard, and so cause the Sail to hold more-wind; now when the Sail is large and hath a good Clew, we say she spreads a large Clew, or spreads much Canvas. In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king those Sails they use two sorts of Seams down the Sails, which doth sew the breadth of the Canvas together, the one we call a <hi>Monk seam,</hi> which is flat, the other a <hi>Round seam,</hi> which is so called because it is round. <note place="margin">A Monk-seam.

Touch the wind, and <hi>war no more,</hi> is no more but to bid him at the Helm to keep her so near the wind as may be; <hi>no near, ease</hi> the Helm, or bear up, is to let her fall to Lee ward. <hi>Steady.</hi> that is, to keep her right upon that point you steer by; be <hi>yare</hi> at the Helm, or a fresh man to the Helm. But he that keeps the Ship most from yawing, doth commonly use the least motion with the Helm, and those steer the best.</p>
               <p>The Master and Company being aboard, he commands them to get the Sails to the Yards, and about your <hi>gear,</hi> or <note place="margin">Gear.</note> work on all hands, stretch forward your main Hallyards, hoise your Sails half Mast high. <hi>Predy,</hi> or make ready to <note place="margin">Predy.</note> set sail, cross your Yards, bring your Cable to the Capstern; Boatswain fetch an Anchor aboard, break ground or weigh Anchor.

                  <p>WHen this is done, the Captain or Master commands the Boatswain to call up the Company; the Master being chief of the Starboord watch, doth call one, and his right hand Mate on the Larboard doth call another, and so forward till they be divided into two parts, then each man is to chuse his Mate, Consort, or Comrade, and then divide them into squadrons according to your number and burthen of your Ship, as you see occasion; these are to take their turns at the Helm, trim sails, pump, and do all duties each half, or each squadron for eight Glasses, or four hours, which is a Watch; but care would be had, that there be not two Comrades upon one Watch, because they may have the more room in their Cabbins to rest. And as the Captain and Master's Mates, Gunners, Carpenters, Quartermasters, Trumpeters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to be abaft the Mast, so the Boatswain, and all the Yonkers or common Sailers under his command is to be before the Mast. The next is, to mess them four to a Mess, and then give every Mess a quarter Can of Beer, and a Bisket of Bread to stay their stomacks till the Kettle be boiled, that they may first go to Prayer, then to supper, and at six a Clock sing a Psalm, say a Prayer, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster with his side begins the Watch, then all the rest may do

what they will till midnight; and then his Mate with his Larboard men, with a Psalm and a Prayer, relieves them till four in the Morning, and so from eight to twelve each other, except some flaw of wind come, some storm, or gust, or some accident that requires the help of all hands which commonly after such good Cheer in most Voyages doth happen.</p>
                  <p>For now the <hi>wind veers,</hi> that is, it doth shift from point <note place="margin">The wind veers. Tally.</note> to point, get your Starboard-tackes aboard, and <hi>tally</hi> or hale off your Lee sheets. The Ship will not wayer, settle your main Top-sail, veere a fadome of your sheet. The wind comes fair again and a fresh gale, hale up the Slatch of the Lee-boling. By Slatch is meant the middle part of any Rope hangs over-board. Veere more sheet, or a <hi>flown</hi>

A Flown-sheet is when she goes before the wind, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a <hi>pair of sheets,</hi> or all Sails drawing. But the wind <note place="margin">A pair of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> shrinks, that is, when you must take in the Spret-sail, and get the Tacks aboard, hale close the main Boling, that is, when your Tacks are close aboard. If you would sail against the wind, or keep your own, that is, not to fall to Lee-ward, or go back again, by haling off close your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, you set your Sails so sharp as you can to lie close by a wind, thwarting it a League or two, or more or less, as you see cause, first on the one board, then on the other; this we call boarding or beating it up upon a Tack in the winds eye, or bolting to and again; but the longer your Boards are, the more you work or gather into the wind. If a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den flaw of wind should surprize you, when you would lower a Yard so fast as you can, they call <hi>Amain;</hi> but a cross sail cannot come nearer the wind than six points, but a Carvel, whose Sails stands like a pair of Tallers sheers, will go much nearer.</p>

                  <head>How to handle a Ship in a Storm.</head>
                  <p>IT overcasts, we shall have wind, foul weather, settle your Top-sails, take in the Spret-sail, in with your Top-sails, lower the Fore-sail, tallow under the Parrels, brade up close all them Sails, lash sure the Ordnance, strike your Top-masts to the Cap, make it sure with your Sheeps-feet. A storm, let us lie at <hi>Trie</hi> with our main-Course, that is, to <note place="margin">Try.</note> hale the Tack aboard, the Sheet close aft, the Boling set up, and the Helm tied close aboard. When that will not serve, then try the Misen, if that split, or the storm grow so great that she cannot bear it, then <hi>hull,</hi> which is to bear no <note place="margin">Hull.</note> sail, but to strike a hull is when they would lie obscurely in the Sea, or stay for some Consort, lash sure the Helm a lee, and so a good Ship will lie at ease <hi>under the Sea,</hi> as we <note place="margin">Under the Sea. Weather coil.</note> term it. If she will <hi>weather coil,</hi> and lay her head the other way without loosing a sail, that must be done by bearing up the Helm, and then she will drive nothing so far to Lee-ward. They call it hulling also in a calm swelling Sea, which is commonly before a storm, when they strike their Sails lest she should beat them in pieces against the Mast by <hi>Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rowling. Labour.</note> We say a Ship doth <hi>Labour</hi> much when she doth rowl much any way; but if she will neither Trie nor Hull, then <hi>spoon,</hi> that is, put her right before the wind, this way <note place="margin">Spoon.</note> although she will rowl more than the other, yet if she be weak, it will not strain her any thing so much in the <hi>Trough</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Trough.</note> of the Sea, which is the distance betwixt two Waves or Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. If none of this will do well, then she is in danger to <hi>founder,</hi> if not sink. <hi>Foundering</hi> is, she will neither veer <note place="margin">Founder.</note> nor steer, the Sea will so over-rake her, except you free out the water, she will lie like a Log, and so consequently sink. <hi>To spend a Mast</hi> or <hi>Yard</hi> is when they are broke <note place="margin">To spend a Mast. Spring a Mast.</note> by foul weather, and to <hi>spring a Mast</hi> is when it is cracked in any place.</p>
                  <p>In this extremity he that doth cun the Ship, cannot have too much judgment, nor experience to <hi>try her drift,</hi> or how
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105579:26"/>
she <hi>Caps,</hi> which are two terms also used in the Trials of the running or setting of currants. A <hi>yoke</hi> is when the Sea <note place="margin">A Yoke.</note> is so rough as that men cannot govern the Helm with their hands, and then they sease a block to the Helm on each side the end, and reeving two sals thorow them like Gunners Tackles, brings them to the Ship side, and so some being at the one side of the Tackle, some at the other, they steer her with much more ease then they can with a single rope with a double turn about the Helm.</p>
                  <p>When the Storm is past, though the wind may alter three or four points of the Compass, or more, yet the Sea for a good time will go the same way; then if your courle be right against it, you shall meet it right a head, so we call it <hi>a Head Sea.</hi> Somtimes when there is but little wind, <note place="margin">A head Sea.</note> there will come a contrary Sea, and presently the wind after it, whereby we may Judg that from whence it came was much wind, for commonly before any great Storm the Sea will come that way. Now if the Ship may run on shore in ose or mud she may escape, or Billage on a rock, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors flook, repair her leak, but if she split or sink, she is a wrack. But seeing the Storm decreaseth, let us try if she will endure the <hi>Hullock</hi> of a Sail, which somtimes is a peice of <note place="margin">Hullock.</note> the Misen-Sail or some other little Sail, part opened to keep her head to the Sea, but if yet she would weather coile, we will loose a Hullock of her fore-Sail, and put the Helm a weather, and it will bring her head where her stern is; cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage my hearts.</p>
                  <p>It clears up, set your fore Sail; Now it is fair weather out with all your Sails, go <hi>Larg</hi> or <hi>Lask,</hi> that is, when <note place="margin">Large. Laskes.</note> we have a fresh gale, or fair wind, and all Sails drawing. But for more haste unparrel the Misen-Yard and lanch it, and the Sail over her Lee-quarrter, and fit Gives at the further end to keep the Yard steady, and with a Boom, <note place="margin">Goosewing.</note> Boom it out; this we call a <hi>Goose wing.</hi> Who is at Helm there? Sirra, you must be amongst the Points; Well Master the Channel is broad enough; yet you cannot steer betwixt a pair of sheats; Those are words of mockery betwixt the Gunner and the Stearsman. But to proceed.</p>

Get your Larboard Tackes aboard, hale off your Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board sheats, keep your course upon the Point you are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.

Make ready to Tack about, is for every man to stand to handle the Sails and ropes they must hale. Tack about is to bear up the Helm and that brings her to stay all her Sails lying flat against the Shrowds, then as she turns we say she is payed, then let rise your Lee tacks, and hale off your Sheats, and trim all your Sails as they were before, which is cast off that Boling which was the weather-Boling, and hale up taue the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  <hi>Flood</hi> is when the water beginneth to rise, which is <hi>young Flood</hi> as we call it, then <hi>Quarter-flood, Half-flood, Full-Sea, Still water,</hi> or <hi>High-water.</hi> So when it <hi>Ebbs, Quarter-ebb; Half-ebb, three Quarter-ebb, Low-water,</hi> or <hi>Dead Low water,</hi> every one doth know; and also that as at a <hi>Spring tide</hi> the <hi>Sea</hi> or <hi>water</hi> is at the <hi>highest,</hi> so at a <hi>Neape tide</hi> it is at the <hi>lowest.</hi> This word <hi>Tide,</hi> is common both to <hi>Flood</hi> and <hi>Ebb;</hi> for you say as well <hi>Tide of Ebb,</hi> as <hi>Tide of Flood,</hi> or a <note place="margin">A Tide of Ebb A Tide of Flood.

               <p>As touching the reasons of Ebbs and Floods, and to know how far it is to the bottom of the deepest place of the Sea, I will not take upon me to discourse of; as knowing the same to be the secrets of God unrevealed to man: only I will set down a Philosophical speculation of divers mens opinions touching the depth of the Sea; which I hope will not be thought much impertinent to the subject of this Book by the Judicious Reader.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fabianus</hi> in <hi>Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Cleomides</hi> conceived the depth of <note place="margin">The heigth of Mountains perpendicular.</note> the Sea to be fifteen Furlongs, that is, a Mile and ⅞ parts. <hi>Plutarch</hi> compared it equal to the highest Mountains; <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> and others conceited the Hills far surpassed the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Sea, and that in few places it is more than a hundred paces in depth, it may be he meant in some narrow Seas, but in the main Ocean experience hath taught us it is much more than twice so much, for I have sounded 300 fathom, yet sound no ground. <hi>Eratosthenes</hi> in <hi>Theon</hi> that great Mathematician writeth the highest Mountain perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular is but ten Furlongs, that is, one Mile and a quarter. Also <hi>Dicaearcus</hi> affirmeth this to be the height of the Hill <hi>Pelius</hi> in <hi>Thessalia,</hi> but <hi>Xenagoras</hi> in <hi>Plutarch</hi> observed the height of <hi>Olympius</hi> in the same region to be twenty paces more, which is 1270. paces, but surely all those mean on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly those Mountains in or about <hi>Greece,</hi> where they lived and were best acquainted; but how these may compare with the <hi>Alpes,</hi> in <hi>Asia, Atlas</hi> in <hi>Africa, Caucasus</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> the <note place="margin">The height of the Hills com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the, Superficies of the Earth and depth of the  Sea.</note> 
                  <hi>Andes</hi> in <hi>Peru,</hi> and divers others hath not yet been exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
               <p>But whatsoever the Hills may be above the Superficies of the Earth, many hold opinion the Sea is much deeper, who
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105579:30"/>
suppose that the Earth at the first framing was in the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies regular and Spherical, as the Holy Scripture directs us to believe; because the water covered and compassed all the face of the Earth, also that the face of the Earth was equal to that of the Sea. <hi>Damascene</hi> noteth, that the unevenness and irregularity, which now is seen in the Earth's Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, was caused by taking some parts out of the upper face of the Earth in sundry places to make it more hollow, and lay them in other places to make it more convex, or by raising up some part, and depressing others to make room and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit for the Sea, that mutation being wrought by the power of the word of the Lord, <hi>Let the waters be gathered into one place, that the dry land may appear.</hi> As for <hi>Aquinas, Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, Catharianus,</hi> and some Divines that conceited there was no mutation, but a violent accumulation of the waters, or heaping them up on high is unreasonable; because it is against nature, that water being a flexible and a ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body, so to consist and stay it solf, and not fall to the lower parts about it; where in nature there is nothing to hinder it; or, if it be restrained supernaturally by the hand and bridle of Almighty God, lest it should overwhelm and drown all the Land, it must follow, that God even in the very institution of Nature imposed a perpetual violence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Nature. And this withal, that at the Deluge there was no necessity to break up the Springs of the Deep, and to open the Cataracts of Heaven, and pour down wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter continually so many days and nights together, seeing the only withdrawing of that hand, or leting go of that bridle which restraineth the water, would presently have overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <note place="margin">How all the Hills and dry land above the Superficies of the Sea hath made room for the Sea, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are in equal height and depth.</note> all.</p>
               <p>But both by Scriptures, the experience of Navigators, and reason, in making estimation of the depth of the Sea, reckon not only the height of the Hills above the common Superficies of the Earth, but the height of all the dry Land above the Superficies of the Sea, because the whole mass of Earth that now appeareth above the waters, being taken as it were out of the places which the waters now possess,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105579:31"/>
must be equal to the place out of which it was taken; so consequently it seemeth, that the height or elevation of the one should answer the descending or depth of the other; and therefore in estimating the depth of the Sea, we consider not only the erection of the Hills above the ordinary land, but the advantage of the dry land above the Sea; which latter, I mean the height of the ordinary main-land, excluding the Hills, which properly answer the extraordinary Deeps and Whirl-pools in the Sea. The rest is held more in large Continents above the Sea, than that of the Hills is above the land.</p>
               <p>For that the plain face of the dry land is not level, or equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">That there is small differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt the springs first rising out of the Earth, and their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the Sea.</note> distant from the Center, but hath a great descent towards the Sea, and a rising towards the midland parts, although it appear not plainly to the eye, yet to reason it is most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest; because we find that part of the Earth the Sea covereth descendeth lower and lower towards the Sea. For the Sea, which touching the upper face of it, is known by nature to be level, and evenly distant from the Center, is observed to wax deeper and deeper, the further one saileth from the shore to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the main Ocean: even so in that part which is unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, the streamings of Rivers on all sides from the Midland parts towards the Sea, sliding from the higher to the lower, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth so much; whose courses are some 1000. or 2000 miles, in which declination, <hi>Pliny</hi> in his derivation of water re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth one cubit of declining in 240 foot of proceeding. But <hi>Columella, Vitruvius, Paladius,</hi> and others, in their conducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of waters require somewhat less; namely, that in the proceeding of 200, foot forward, there should be allowed one foot of descending downward, which yet in the course of 1000. miles, as <hi>Danubius, Volgha,</hi> or <hi>Indus,</hi> &amp;c. have so much or more, which will make five miles of descent in perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account, and in the course of 2000. or more, as <hi>Nilus, Niger,</hi> and the River of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> have ten miles or more of the like descent.</p>
               <p>These are not taken as rules of necessity, as though water <note place="margin">The determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of these questions.</note> could not run without that advantage, for that respect the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105579:31"/>
conveyers of waters in these times content themselves with one Inch in 600. foot, as <hi>Philander</hi> and <hi>Vitruvius</hi> observed, but is rather under a rule of commodity for expedition and wholsomeness of water so conveyed, lest resting too long in Pipes it should contract some unwholsome condition, or else through the slackness of motion, or long closeness, or banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the air, gather some aptness and disposition to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie. Although I say, such excess of advantage as in the Artificial conveyance of Waters the forenamed Authors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, be not of necessity exacted in the natural derivation of them, yet certain it is, that the descent of Rivers being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and their course long, and in many places swift, and in some places headlong and furious; the differences of height <note place="margin">Note, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the springs of the Rivers, and their falling into the Sea is not great.</note> or advantage cannot be great betwixt the springs of the Rivers, and their outlets, betwixt the first rising out of the Earth, and their falling into the Sea: unto which declivity of land, seeing the deepness of the Sea in proportion answer, as I before declared, and not only to the height of the Hills: it is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the deepness to be much more than the Philosophers commonly reputed: and although the deepness of the <hi>Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Sea, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, was the deepest of the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean,</hi> recorded by <hi>Posidonius</hi> in <hi>Strabo,</hi> to have been found but 1000. fathom, which is but a mile and a fifth part, and the greatest breadth not past 600. miles: then seeing if in so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a Sea it be so deep, what may we esteem the main Ocean to be, that in many places is five times so broad, seeing the broader the Seas are, if they be intire and free from Islands, they are answerably observed to be the deeper. If you desire any further satisfaction, read the first part of <hi>Purchas</hi> his Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, where you may read how to find all those Authors at large. Now because he hath taken near 100. times as much from me, I have made bold to borrow this from him, seeing he hath sounded such deep Waters for this our Ship to sail in, being a Gentleman whose person I loved, and whose memory and vertues I will ever honour.</p>

                  <p>Proper Sea terms belonging to the <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad</hi> condition of Ships, how to find them and amend them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>A Ship that will try, hull, and ride well at Anchor, we <note place="margin">A wholsome Ship.</note> call a <hi>wholesome Ship.</hi> A long Ship that draws much water will do all this, but if she draw much water, and be short, she may Hull well, but neither try nor ride well; if she draw little water and be long, she may try and ride well, but never Hull well, which is called an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsome Ship.</hi> The <hi>Howsing</hi> in of a Ship is when she <note place="margin">An unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Ship. Howsing a Ship.</note> is past the breadth of her bearing she is brought in narrow to her upper works: it is certain this makes her wholsome in the Sea without rowling, because the weight of her Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance doth counterpoise her breadth under water, but it is not so good in a Man of War, because it taketh away a great deal of her room, nor will her Tacks ever so well come aboard as if she were laid out aloft, and not <hi>Flaring,</hi> which <note place="margin">Flaring.</note> is when she is a little Howsing in, near the water, and then the upper work doth hang over again, and is laid out broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der aloft, this makes a Ship more roomy aloft for men to use their arms in, but Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi>'s proportion, which is to be proportionably wrought to her other work is the best, because the counterpoise on each side doth make her swim perpendicular or straight, and consequently steady, which is the best.</p>
               <p>If a Ship be narrow, and her bearing either not laid out enough or too low, then you must make her broader and her bearing the higher by ripping off the Planks two or
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105579:32"/>
three strakes under water, and as much above, and put o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Timbers upon the first, and then put on the Planks upon those Timbers, this will make her bear a better Sail, but it is an hinderance to her Sailing, this is to be done when a Ship is <hi>Crank-sided,</hi> and will bear no Sail, and is called <note place="margin">Crank side. Furring.</note> 
                  <hi>Furring.</hi> Note also, that when a Ship hath a deep Keel it doth keep her from rowling. If she be floaty and her Keel shallow, put on another Keel under the first to make it deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for it will make her hold more in the water, this we call <hi>a false Keel.</hi> Likewise if her Stem be too flat to make <note place="margin">A false Keel.

Also <hi>the Run</hi> of a Ship is as much to be regarded, for if it be too short and too full be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, the water comes but slowly to the Rudder, because the force of it is broken by her breadth, and then to put a false Stem post to lengthen her is the next remedy, but to length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en her is better; for when a Ship comes off handsomely by degrees, and her Tuck doth not lie too low, which will hinder the water from coming swiftly to the Rudder, makes her she cannot steer well, and they are called as they are, <hi>a good run or a bad.</hi> When a Ship hath lost a piece of her <note place="margin">A good Run.

Her <hi>Rake</hi> also may be a defect, which is so much of the Hull, <note place="margin">Her Rake.</note> as by a perpendicular line the end of the Keel is from the setting on of the Stem, so much as is without that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on, and in like manner the setting in of her Stem-Post. Your <hi>Frenchmen</hi> gives great Rakes forwards on, which makes her give good way, and keep a good wind, but if she have not a full Bow, she will pitch her Head extreamly in the Sea. If she have but a small Rake, she is so bluff that the Seas meets her so suddenly upon the Pows she cannot cut the water much, but the longer a Ship is, the fuller should be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:105579:33"/>
her Bow, but the mean is the best. The <hi>Looming</hi> of a Ship <note place="margin">Loome.</note> is her prospective, that is, as she doth shew great or little: Her water-draught is so many foot as she goes in the water, but the Ships that draw most water are commonly the most wholsome, but the least draught goes best but rolls most, and we say a Ship doth <hi>Heeld</hi> on Starboard or Larboard, that is, to that side she doth lean most. <note place="margin">Heeld.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>Overset</hi> or <hi>overthrow</hi> a Ship, is by bearing too much Sail you bring her Keel upwards, or on shore overthrow her <note place="margin">Overset.

The Masting of a Ship is much to be considered, and will much cause her to sail well or ill, as I have related in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting a Ship. <hi>Iron-sick,</hi> is when the Bolts, Spikes, or Nails are so oaten with rust they stand hollow in the Planks, and so <note place="margin">Iron sick.</note> makes her Leak, the which to prevent, they use to put Lead over all the Bolt-heads under water. Lastly, the trimming of a Ship doth much amend or impair her sailing, and so alter her condition. To find her <hi>Trim,</hi> that is, how she will sail best; is by trying her sailing with another Ship, so many <note place="margin">Trim.</note> Glasses trimmed a head, and so many a stern, and so many upon an even Keel; also the easing of her Masts and Shrowds, for some Ships will sail much better when they are slack than when they are taut.</p>

                  <p>Considerations for a <hi>Sea Captain</hi> in the choice of his Ship, and in placing his <hi>Ordnance.</hi> In giving <hi>Chase, Board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and entring a <hi>Man of War</hi> like himself, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending <hi>Merchant-man.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN Land-service we call a Man of War a Souldier, either <note place="margin">How to chuse a Ship fit to make a Man of War.</note> on Foot or Horse, and at Sea a Ship, which if she be not, as well built, conditioned, and provided, as near fitting such an Imployment, as may be, she may prove (either) as a Horseman that knoweth not how to hold his Reins, keep his seat in his saddle and stirrups, carry his Body, nor how to help his Horse with leg and spur in a curvet, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, or stop; or as an excellent Horseman that knoweth all, this, mounted upon a Jade that will do nothing, which were he mounted according to his Experience, he would do more with that one, than half a dozen of the other, though as well provided as himself. But I confess, every Horseman can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mount himself alike, neither every Seaman ship him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as he would. I mean not for outward Ornament, which the better they are, the less to be disliked; for there cannot be a braver sight than a Ship in her Bravery, but of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent sufficiency, as the business requireth. But were I to chuse a Ship for my self, I would have her sail well, yet strongly built, her Decks flush and flat, and so roomy that men might pass with ease; her Bow and Chase so Gally like contrived, should bear as many Ordnance as with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency she could, for that always cometh most to fight, and so stiff, she should bear a stiff Sail, and bear out her lower Tier in any reasonable weather; neither should her Gun room be unprovided; not manned like a Merchant-man, which if
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105579:34"/>
they be double manned, that is, to have twice so many men as would fail her, they think it is too many, in regard of the charge, yet to speak true, there are few Merchant Ships in the World do any way exceed ours. And those men they entertain in good Voyages, have such good Pay, and such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance one with another in shipping themselves, that thirty or fourty of them would trouble a Man of War with three or four times their number manned with Prest Men, being half of them scarce hale-Boulings. Yea, and many times a Pirat, who are commonly the best manned, but they fight only for Wealth, not for Honour nor Revenge, except they be extremely constrained. But such a Ship as I have spoken of, well manned with rather too many than too few, with all sufficient Officers, Shot, Powder, Victual, and all their apurtenances, in my opinion, might well pass muster for a time of War.</p>
               <p>Now being at Sea, the Tops are seldom without one or <note place="margin">His Reward that first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scries a Ship, or enters a Prize.</note> other to look out for Purchase, because he that first descries a Sall, if she prove Prize, is to have a good Sute of Apparel, or so much Money as it set down by order, for his Reward; as also he that doth first enter a Ship, there is a certain Reward allowed him: When we see a Ship alter her course, and useth all the means she can to fetch you up, you are the Chase, and he the Chaser. In giving chase, or chasing, or to escape <note place="margin">How to give chase, and escape the Chaser.</note> being chased, there is required an infinite Judgment and Experience, for there is no Rule for it; but the shortest way to fetch up your Chase, is the best. If you be too Lee ward, get all your Tacks aboard, and shape your Course as he doth, to meet him at the nearest Angle you can, then he must either alter his Course, and Tack as you Tack as near the wind as he can lie, to keep his own till night, and then strike a Hull, that you may not descry him by his Sails, or do his best to lose you in the dark; for look how much he falls to Lee ward, he falls so much in your way. If he be right a-head of you, that is called a Stern-chase, if you weather him, for every man in chasing doth seek to get tlie Weather, because you cannot board him, except you weather him, he will las<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105579:34"/>
or go large, if you gather on him that way, he will try you before the Wind; then if your Ordnance cannot reach him, if he can out-strip you, he is gone. But suppose you are to Windward, if he clap close by a wind, and there goes a-head-Sea, and yours a Lee-ward Ship, if you do the like your Ship will so bear against the Sea, she will make no way; therefore you must go a little more large, though you chase under his Lee till you can run a head.</p>

                  <hi>Board</hi> and <hi>Board,</hi> is when two Ships lie together side by <note place="margin">Board and board.</note> side, but he that knoweth how to defend himself, and work well, will so cun his Ship, as force you to enter upon his quarter, which is the highest part of the Ship, and but the Misen Shrowds to enter by, from whence he may do you much hurt with little danger, except you fire him, which a Pirat will never do, neither sink you, if he can chuse, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you be able to force him to defend himself. But in a Sea-fight we call Boarding, in Boarding where we can; the greatest advantage for your Ordnance, is to board him thwart the Hawse, because you may use all the Ordnance you have on one side, and she only them in her Prow; but the best and safest <hi>boarding</hi> for <hi>entring,</hi> is on the Bow, but you <note place="margin">Boarding and entring a Ship</note> must be careful to clear the Decks with burning Granadoes, Fire-pots, Pouches of Powder, to which give fire by a Gun-powder Match, to prevent Trains to the <hi>Powder-chest;</hi> which <note place="margin">Powder-chests</note> are long Boards joyned like a Triangle, with divers broad ledges on either side, wherein lieth as many Pebble stones or Beatch as can there lie; those being fired, will make all clear before them. Besides, in an extremity a man would rather blow up the quarter-Deck, half-Deck, Fore-castle, or any thing, than be taken by him he knows a mortal Enemy; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly there are more men lost in entering, if the Chase stand to her defence, in an instant, than in a long Fight, board and board, if she be provided of her close Fights. I confess, the charging upon Trenches, and the entrances of a Breach in a Rampire, are Attempts as desperate as a man would think could be performed, but he that hath tried himself as oft in the entring a resting Ship as I have done both them and the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105579:35"/>
other, he would surely confess there is no such dangerous Service ashore, as a resolved resolute Fight at Sea. A Ships close Fights, are small ledges of Wood laid cross one another like the Grates of Iron in a Prisons-window, betwixt the main Mast, and the Fore-mast, and are called Gratings, or Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as is said, which are made of small Ropes, much in like manner, covered with a Sail; the which to undo, is to heave a Kedger, or fix a Grapling into them, tied in a Rope, but a Chain of Iron is better, and sheering off will tear it in pieces, if the Rope and Anchor hold; some have used Sheer-hooks, which are Hooks like Sickles fixed in the ends of the Yards-arms, that if a Ship under sail come to board her, those Sheers will cut her Shrowds, and spoil her Tackling; but they are so subject to break their own Yards, and cut all the Ropes comes from the Top-sails, they are out of request. To conclude, if a Ship be open, presently to board her, is the best way to take her. But if you see your Chase strip himself into fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Evident signs that a Chase will fight.</note> Sails, that is, to put out his Colours in the Poop, his Flag in the Main-top, his Streamers or Pendants at the ends of his Yards-arms, furl his Spret-sail, pike his Misen, and sling his Main yard, provide your self to fight.

Yea, yea. Try him once more, as before: Done, done: Keep your Loufe, and load your Ordnance again: Is all ready? Yea, yea; edg in with him again, begin with your Bow pieces, proceed with your Broad-side, and let her fall off with the wind, to give her also your full Chase, your Weather-Broadside, and bring her round that the Stern may also discharge, and your Tacks close aboard again: Done, done, the wind veers, the Sea goes too high to board her, and we are shot through and through, and between wind and water.

They use to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or order those Squadrons in ranks like Manaples, which is four square, if the Wind and Sea permits, a good berth of distance from each other, that they becalm not one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, nor come not foul of each other; the General com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the midst, his Vice Admiral in the front, and his Reer Admiral in the Reer; or otherwise like a half Moon,

which is two Squadrons like two Triangles for the two Horns, and so the rest of the Squadrons behind each other a good distance, and the General in the midst of the half Circle, from whence he seeth all his Fleet, and sendeth his directions, as he finds occasion to whom he pleaseth.</p>
               <p>Now between two Navies they use often, especially in a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or Road where they are at Anchor, to fill old Barks with Pitch, Tarr, Train-oyl, Lynseed-oyl, Brimstone, Rozin, Reeds, with dry Wood, and such Combustible things, sometimes they link three or four together in the night, and put them adrift as they find occasion. To pass a Fort some will make both Ships and Sails all black, but if the Fort keep but a fire on the other side, and all the pieces point blank with the fire, if they discharge what is betwixt them and the fire, the shot will hit, if the Rule be truly observed; for when a Ship is betwixt the fire and you she doth keep you from seeing it till she be past it. To conclude there is as many stratagems, advantages, and inventions to be used as you find occasions, and therefore experience must be the best Tutor.</p>

                  <p>Some it may be will say I would have men rather to feast than sight; But I say the want of those necessaries occasions the loss of more men than in any English Fleet hath been slain since 88. For when a man is ill, or at the point of death, I would know whether a dish of buttered Rice with a little <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon, Ginger,</hi> and <hi>Sugar,</hi> a little minced meet, or rost Beef, a few stew'd Prunes, a race of green <hi>Ginger,</hi> a <hi>Flapjack,</hi> a Can of fresh water brewed with a little <hi>Cynamon,</hi> and <hi>Sugar,</hi> be not better than a little <hi>Poor John,</hi> or <hi>Salt Fish</hi> with <hi>Oil</hi> and <hi>Mustard,</hi> or <hi>Bisket, Butter, Cheese,</hi> or <hi>Oatmeal-pottage</hi> on Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, or on Flesh days Salt Beef, Pork and Pease with six shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings beer, this is your ordinary Ships allowance, and good for them that are well if well conditioned which is not always, as Seamen can (too well) witness. And after a storm, when poor men are all wet, and some have not so much as a cloth to shift them, shaking with cold, few of those but will tell you, a little Sack or <hi>Brandy</hi> is much better to keep them in health, than a little small Beer or cold water although it be sweet. Now that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one should provide things for himself, few of them have either that providence or means, and there is neither Ale-house Tavern, nor Inn to burn a Faggot in, neither Grocer, Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, Apothecary, nor Butchers Shop, and therefore the use of this Petty Tally is necessary, and thus to be employed as there is occasion. To entertain Strangers, as they are in quality every Commander should shew himself as like himself as he can, as well for the credit of the Ship, and his Setters forth as himself; but in that herein every one may moderate themselves accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own pleasures, therefore I leave it to their own discretions, and this brief Discourse, and my self to their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly construction, and good opinion.</p>

the Bore of a Piece, and a <hi>Case-shot</hi> is any kind of small Bullets, Nails, old Iron, or the like to put into the Case to shoot out of the Ordnance or Murderers, these will do much mischief when we lie board and board: but for Spun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Rammers they use now a stiff Rope a little more than the length of the Piece, which you may turn and wind within board as you will, with much more ease and safety than the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Round-shot</hi> is a round Bullet for any Piece: <hi>Cross-bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot</hi> is also a Round-shot, but it hath a long spike of Iron cast <note place="margin">Round-shot. Cross-bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot.

There is also divers sorts of <hi>Granadoes,</hi> some to break and fly in abundance of pieces every way, as will your <hi>Brass-balls,</hi> and Earthen-pots, which when they are covered with Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Bullets stuck in Pitch, and the Pots filled with good Powder, in a crowd of people will make an incredible slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; some will burn under water, and never extinguish till the stuff be consumed; some only will burn and fume out a most stinking poyson smoke; some, being but only an Oil, being
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:105579:50"/>
anointed on any thing made of dry wood, will take fire by the heat of the Sun when the Sun shines hot. There is also a Powder, which being laid in like manner upon any thing subject to burn, will take fire if either any rain or water light upon it; but those inventions are bad on shore, but much worse at Sea, and are naught because so dangerous, and not easie to be quenched, and their practice worse, because they may do as much mischief to a friend as to an enemy, therefore I will leave them as they are.</p>
               <p>There are also divers sorts of <hi>Powder,</hi> the <hi>Serpentine</hi> is <note place="margin">Powder. Serpentine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder. Gross corned. Powder.

Your fine corned Powder for hand Guns is in goodness as your Salt-peter is often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and from ten pence a pound to eighteen pence a Pound.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Tomkin</hi> is a round piece of wood put into the Pieces <note place="margin">A Tomkin.

               <p n="2">2. That he give his Gun its due <hi>Charge</hi> of Powder, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> more. And if by trial (before he put in his Charge) he find that his Piece is not truly <hi>bored,</hi> he must then proportion his <hi>Charge</hi> according to the <hi>thinest</hi> side of the <hi>Metal,</hi> as shall be shewed in due place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He is to consider that a <hi>long Wad</hi> of Hay or untwisted Ropes, wil make the <hi>Shot</hi> shoot <hi>wide</hi> of the mark.</p>

               <p>ANno 1380 <hi>Gunpowder</hi> was made of Saltpetre, Brimstone, and Charcoal, of each a like quantity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1410 it was made of three parts Saltpetre, and two parts of Brimstone and Charcole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1480 it was made of Saltpetre eight parts, and of Brimstone and Charcoal each three parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1520 it was made of Saltpetre four parts, and of Brimstone and Charcoal each one part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gunpowder,</hi> as it is made in this Age, is compounded of Saltpetre six parts, and of Brimstone and Charcoal of each one part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Musket-powder</hi> is now made of Saltpetre five parts, one part of Brimstone, and one of Coal.</p>
               <p>And Cannon powder of four times as much Saltpetre, as of Coal and Brimstone, agreeable to that was made <hi>Anno</hi> 1520.</p>
               <p>A pound of Powder as it is now made, (as it was experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in five several sorts of Powder here, little differing from each other, but the large corned Powder was the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est) one pound will fill thirty one Cubical Inches, and six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred parts of an Inch.</p>

                  <p>Look for the length of the <hi>Diameter</hi> given, among the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures in the <hi>Table,</hi> and what number stands against it in the first <hi>Column,</hi> for they are the whole Inches in the <hi>Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;</hi> also see what Figure stands over them, at the head of the <hi>Table,</hi> for those are the tenths of Inches of the <hi>Circumference.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Example. Let the <hi>Diameter</hi> of a <hi>Shot</hi> be 7 Inches, and 7 tenths, or 70 hundreds, of an Inch. Look for this number 7. 70 in the <hi>Table,</hi> and against it in the first-Column you have 24 Inches, and 2 at the head of the <hi>Table;</hi> so that the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference</hi> is 24 Inches and 2 tenth parts of an Inch.</p>
                  <p>Again, if the <hi>Diameter</hi> given were 13 Inches 62 hundred parts of an Inch, I look in the <hi>Table</hi> for 13. 62 and I find that 42 stands against it, in the first Column, and 8 over head; wherefore I conclude the Circumference to be 42 Inches, and 8 tenth parts of an Inch.</p>

                  <p>The Proportion of the Diameter of any Circle, is to the Circumference therof (according to <hi>Archimedes)</hi> as 7 is to 22, and that was the reason that in the former ways you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Circumference into 22 equal parts, and took 7 of them for the Diameter. But since <hi>Archimedes,</hi> other numbers have been found nearer the truth, <hi>viz.</hi> 113 and 355. Wherefore,</p>

                  <head>The Description of the Table.</head>
                  <p>The <hi>Table</hi> is Calculated from one tenth part of an Inch <hi>Circumference,</hi> to 54 Inches <hi>Circumference,</hi> which is large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the <hi>Girt</hi> of the <hi>Base Ring</hi> of any <hi>Gun:</hi> Or for the <hi>Circumference</hi> of any <hi>Bullet</hi> or <hi>Granado Shell;</hi> for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses this <hi>Table</hi> will be serviceable, as shall be shewed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Table consisting of Eleven Columns,</hi> the first <hi>Column</hi> of the <hi>Table</hi> (beginning at 0 Inches, and ending at 53 Inches) shews the number of whole <hi>Inches</hi> that any <hi>Ring</hi> of a <hi>Piece,</hi> or <hi>Girt</hi> of a <hi>Bullet</hi> is in <hi>Circumference.</hi> The nine Figures at the Heads of the <hi>Table,</hi> which are 0. 1. 2. 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (and are larger than the rest) signifie tenth parts of Inches of the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference</hi> of any <hi>Ring</hi> or <hi>Bullet.</hi> And the Figures in the other <hi>Columns</hi> are the <hi>Diameters</hi> of <hi>Circles,</hi> the <hi>Girt</hi> of whose <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference</hi> are found in the <hi>Side</hi> and <hi>Head</hi> thereof.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>The Use of the Table.</head>
                  <p>The Uses of this Table are principally two, <hi>First,</hi> by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Circumference</hi> of any <hi>Circle</hi> given, to find the <hi>Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> or, <hi>Secondly,</hi> having the <hi>Diameter,</hi> to find the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Example 1. <hi>If the Circumference of a Circle be 18 Inches, and three tenth parts of an Inch, how much is the</hi> Diameter <hi>of that Circle?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Find 18 Inches in the first Column of the Table, and three tenths at the top of the Table; and right against 18, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 3, you shall find 5. 82, that is 5 Inches, and 82 hundred parts of an Inch, for the length of the <hi>Diameter</hi> of that Circle.</p>
                  <p>Example 2. <hi>If the</hi> Diameter <hi>of a</hi> Circle <hi>be 13 Inches and 75 hundred parts of an Inch, how much is the</hi> Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <hi>of that</hi> Circle?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:105579:57"/>
Look for 13. 75 among the Figures in some of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns of the Table, which number you will find to stand under the figure a in the head of the Table, and against 43 in the first Column of the Table, which shews the <hi>Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> of that <hi>Circle</hi> to be 43 Inches, and two tenth parts of an Inch.</p>

                  <p>Concerning the <hi>Disparting</hi> of any Piece of <hi>Ordnance,</hi> and how to find the length of the <hi>Dispart.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE <hi>Dispart</hi> of a Piece, is the difference between the thickness of the <hi>Metal</hi> at the <hi>Muzzle</hi> and <hi>Breech</hi> of the Piece: And to find it there are several ways.</p>

                     <hi>I.</hi> Mechanically.</head>
                  <p>Take your <hi>Priming Iron,</hi> and put it down right in the <hi>Touch-hole,</hi> till it touch the Metal at the bottom of the <hi>Bore,</hi> and upon the Iron make a mark level with the top of the <hi>Base Ring</hi> of the Piece: Then apply the <hi>Priming-Iron</hi> to the bottom of the Metal at the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the Piece; and upon it make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mark, equal with the top of the <hi>Muzzle Ring</hi> of the Piece; so shall the distance between these two Marks, be the true length of the <hi>Dispart</hi> proper for that Gun.</p>
                  <p>Another way not much differing from the former may be thus:</p>
                  <p>Take a small Stick or Straw that is strait, and put it into the Touch hole to the lower part of the <hi>Cylinder</hi> (or Concave) of the Gun, and cut it off close to the Metal at the top of the <hi>Base Ring</hi> of the Piece; then apply it in the same manner to the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the Piece, and cut it off level with the top of the <hi>Muzzle Ring,</hi> so shall the little piece cut off be the <hi>Dispart;</hi> which being set upright upon the top of the <hi>Muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:105579:58"/>
Ring</hi> of the Piece with Clay, Pitch or Wax, it shall be the true <hi>Dispart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are other Mechanick ways to perform this Work, but the best of them are uncertain; wherefore I shall shew how it may be performed other ways.</p>

                  <p>First, find the <hi>Dispart</hi> of the <hi>Piece,</hi> by the Priming-Iron or a Stick, also find it by the Table; and if you find them two ways to agree, take that for the true Dispart.

                  <p>How to know whether a <hi>Piece</hi> of <hi>Ordnance</hi> be <hi>truly bored</hi> or not, when it is in its Carriage: and lying <hi>Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontally.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>PRovide a <hi>Pike-staff,</hi> which let be about one foot longer than the Bore of the Piece from the Touch. hole; and at the end thereof, fasten a Rammer head, that will justly fill all the Bore under the Touch-hole; and at the other end of the Staff, bore a hole big enough to put through a Rod of Iron about 16 or 18 Inches long, and at the end of the <hi>Rod</hi> hang a <hi>Bullet</hi> or <hi>Weight</hi> of about 7 or 8 pound; for this Weight thus disposed will cause the same part of the <hi>Rammer-head</hi> to lye always with the same part uppermost. Put this Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus prepared into the <hi>Piece,</hi> letting the <hi>Iron Rod</hi> and Bullet hang perpendicularly; then putting your Priming-Iron in at the Touch-hole, make a mark upon the <hi>Rammer-head:</hi> This done, draw your <hi>Instrument</hi> out of the <hi>Gun,</hi> and lay it upon a long Form or <hi>Table,</hi> letting the <hi>Rod</hi> and <hi>Bullet</hi> hang over the end of the <hi>Table</hi> as it did before out of the mouth of the Piece. Then observe, whether the mark you made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of the Rammer when it was in the Piece, be just on the uppermost part of the same when it lyeth upon the <hi>Table;</hi> and if it be, the <hi>Bore</hi> of the Piece lyeth neither to the right or left hand: But if you find it to lie half or a quarter of an Inch either to the right or left hand, so much lyeth the <hi>Bore</hi> either to the right or left, and the Piece in shooting must be ordered and charged accordingly.</p>
               <p>By what is here said, may be found whether the Piece in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline towards the <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Left</hi> hand, but to know whether it lie also <hi>upwards</hi> or <hi>downwards,</hi> and not in the middle: Then,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:105579:59"/>
to find which way; Take the <hi>Diameter</hi> of the Piece at the <hi>Touch-hole,</hi> as is before taught: Then take a piece of <hi>Wyre,</hi> and bend it a little at the end that it may catch at the <hi>Mettal</hi> when it is drawing out at the Touch hole. This <hi>Wyre</hi> thus prepared, put it in at the Touch-hole, till it touch the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Metal in the Chamber, and holding it there, make a mark upon it, just even with the Touch hole; then pull up the Wyre till it catch at the <hi>Metal</hi> on the top of the <hi>Chamber,</hi> and make another mark upon it, the distance between these two marks, is the just <hi>Diameter</hi> of the <hi>Chamber:</hi> And the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance between the first mark, and the end of the Wyre (half the Diameter of the Chamber of the Piece being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted) will leave half the Diameter of the Piece, if the Piece be truly Bored: But if this number be more than half the Diameter of the Piece, before found, at the Touch hole; than the Bore lyeth too far from the Touch-hole, and the upper part of the Metal is the thickest: but if lesser, then the under part of the Piece hath the most Metal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example:</hi> Suppose I find the Diameter of my Gun to be at the Touch-hole 12 Inches; then with my <hi>Wyre,</hi> I find the Diameter of the <hi>Bore</hi> to be 4 Inches; and to the bottom of the Metal it is 7 Inches and an half; now half the Diameter of the Bore being 2 Inches, that added to the second mark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Wyre, or substracted from 7 Inches and a half, the first Mark, leaves 5 Inches and a half, which is less than half the Diameter of the Gun at the Touch-hole first found, by half an Inch; and therefore the greatest part of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal is under the Bore of the Piece, and the Gun likeliest to break above.</p>
               <p>And here note: If you were to make a <hi>Dispart</hi> for such a Gun as this, you are to make it half an Inch shorter then it will be found to be by taking the Circumference, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Diameters of the Rings at the Base and Muzzle: And the like is to be observed if the difference were greater, or the upper part of the Metal had been greater.</p>

                  <p>Concerning <hi>Guns</hi> that are not truly <hi>bored;</hi> How to know what quantity of <hi>Powder</hi> must be allowed for their Loading.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SUppose the Diameter of the Metal of a Piece at the Touch-hole, be 16 Inches, and the Diameter at the Bore 5 Inches and a quarter, the Weight of the Piece 4850 pound: Now such a Piece will require 11 pound of Powder for its Loading: But I find the Bore to be an Inch out of its place, thence I conclude the thinest part of the Metal is 4 Inches and half a quarter, and the thickest side 6 Inches and half a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by which it appears, that one side is two Inches thicker than the other.</p>
               <p>Now to find what quantity of <hi>Powder</hi> will be a sufficient <hi>Load</hi> for such a Piece, it must be computed from the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the Metal, which is here 4. 375 Inches, which doubled is 8. 75 Inches, to which add the Diameter at the Bore 5. 25 Inches, the sum is 14. 00 Inches, which call the lessor Diameter, and 16 the greater Diameter: And to find the quantity of Powder by Arithmetick, this is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion:</p>
               <p>As the Cube of 16 (the greater Diameter) 4096, Is to the Cube of 14 (the lesser Diameter) 2744;</p>
               <p>So is 11 pound (the Powder to be allowed if the Piece had been truly Bored)</p>
               <p>To 7. 36 pound (the Powder to be allowed to the false Bored Piece.)</p>
               <p>For, multiply 16 by 16, it produceth 256, and that again by 16, and it produceth 4096, which is the <hi>Cube</hi> of 16 the <hi>Greater Diameter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Also, multiply 14 by 14, it produceth 196, and that again
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:105579:60"/>
by 14, produceth 2744, which is the <hi>Cube</hi> of 14, the <hi>Lesser Diameter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Multiply 2744 (the <hi>Cube</hi> of the <hi>Lesser Diameter)</hi> by 11 (the <hi>Powder</hi> to be allowed, if the Piece had been truly bored) the product will be 30184: which number divided by 4096 (the <hi>Cube</hi> of the <hi>Greater Diameter)</hi> gives in the Quotient 7. 36 pounds of <hi>Powder,</hi> which will be a sufficient <hi>Charge</hi> for such a false bored <hi>Gun.</hi>

                  <p>How to discover what Cracks, Flaws, or Honeycombs are in any Piece of Ordnance.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS soon as ever you have discharged any Piece of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, let one be ready to cover the Mouth of the Piece close, and stop the Touch-hole at the same time; by which means you may know if any Cracks or Flaws do go through the Metal, for if any such be, a visible smoke will come through those <hi>Flaws</hi> or <hi>Cracks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Otherwise: In a clear Sun shine day, with a piece of <hi>polish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Steel</hi> (or plain <hi>Looking-Glass)</hi> reflect the Beams of the Sun into the hollow <hi>Cylinder</hi> of the Piece, so shall you have a clear shining light within the concave of the Piece, by which you may see all <hi>Flaws, Cracks,</hi> or <hi>Honeycombs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in case the Sun do not shine, get a Stick somewhat longer than the hollow of the Piece, and cut a notch at one end thereof, wherein to put a piece of a Candle; put this Stick with the Candle lighted into the Piece, by whose light observe (as well as you can) whether from one end to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you can discover any <hi>Flaws,</hi> &amp;c. in the Piece.</p>
               <p>Lastly, If upon the outside of the Metal of any Piece of Ordnance, you strike a smart blow with an Iron Hammer; If you then hear a hoarse sound, doubtless there are <hi>Honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs,</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:105579:61"/>
or such like <hi>Flaws:</hi> But if at any stroke you hear a clear sound, you may conclude that Piece to be <hi>sound,</hi> and free from <hi>Cracks,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>FOR, it hath been generally agreed upon, that a <hi>Cast Iron-Bullet</hi> of 4 Inches Diameter will weigh 9 Pound, and so make that a proportion for all other Diameters: If so, then</p>
                  <p>As the <hi>Cube</hi> of 4 Inches, which is 64.</p>
                  <p>Is to 9 pound weight:</p>

                  <p>To 17. 58 pound for the weight,</p>
                  <p>Which is 17 pound and a half and somewhat more.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>Another way to perform the same somewhat easier.</head>
                  <p>This way is done by Multiplication only, and so some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what easier than the former, and it is a way which was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by Mr. <hi>Valentine Pyne,</hi> late <hi>Fire-Master</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and for the effecting of it, this is the <hi>RULE:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Cube <hi>the</hi> Diameter <hi>of the</hi> Bullet <hi>given, then Multiply that</hi> Cube <hi>number by 14, and cut off two Figures to the right hand, the Figures to the left hand are</hi> pounds weight, <hi>and the other two hundred parts of a Pound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Example I. <hi>Let it be required to find the Weight of a</hi> Cast Iron Bullet, <hi>whose Diameter is five Inches, the same as in the other Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:105579:61"/>
The Cube of 5 Inches is 125, which multiplied by 14, produceth 1750, from which cut off the two figures towards the right hand, and it will be 17. 50, that is 17 pound, and 50 hundred parts of a pound, which is just 17 pound and a half; and that is the weight required.</p>
                  <p>And this way (as he found it by often experience) comes nearer to the truth than the former, of 9 Pound to 4 Inches Diameter.</p>
                  <p>Example 2. <hi>Let the Diameter of a Shot be 6 Inches and seven Tenths of an Inch; and let the Weight thereof be required.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Multiply 6. 7 by 6. 7, the Product will be 44. 89 for the <hi>Square,</hi> and that multiplied again by 6. 7 produceth 300. 863 for the <hi>Cube</hi> of the Diameter of the Shot. Which 300. 863 multiplied by 14, produceth 4212082, from which five figures to the right hand being cut off (that is three for the Decimal parts in the <hi>Multiplicand</hi> 300. 863, and two, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the <hi>Rule directs)</hi> the Remainder will be 42. 12082, that is 42 Pound, and 12 hundred parts of a Pound for the Weight of the Shot whose Diameter is 6 Inches and 7 tenths of an Inch.</p>
                  <p>According to this Rule is the following <hi>Table</hi> made, which sheweth the weight of any <hi>Iron Shot,</hi> whose Diameter is given in Inches and Tenth parts of Inches; from one Inch to 20 Inches Diameter: in Pounds and 100 parts of a Pound weight.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>The Use of the following Table.</head>
                  <p>Example 1. <hi>Let the</hi> Diameter <hi>of an</hi> Iron-shot <hi>be 13 Inches, what is its</hi> weight?</p>

Also against 2 and 1 quarter, you shall find 11. 39 which is the <hi>Cube</hi> of 2 and a quarter: And thus may you find that:</p>

As 7. 31 Pound (the <hi>weight</hi> of the <hi>Shot</hi> of 3 Inch. 3 Quar.) Is to 52. 73 (the <hi>Cube</hi> of 3 Inch. 3 Quarters:</p>
               <p>So is 16 Pound (the <hi>Weight</hi> of the <hi>Shot</hi> whose Diameter is sought.)</p>
               <p>To 115, Which Number being found in the second Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of the Table (or the nearest to it, which is 107. 17) the <hi>Root</hi> answering to this Number is 4 Inches 3 Quarters, for the <hi>Diameter</hi> of the <hi>Shot,</hi> whose <hi>Weight</hi> is 16 Pound.</p>
               <p>Quest. III. <hi>If a</hi> Saker <hi>whose greatest thickness is 11 Inches and a half, do weigh 1900 Pound: What will the Weight of another</hi> Saker <hi>be, whose greatest thickness is eight Inches and three Quarters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the <hi>Table</hi> I find the <hi>Cube</hi> of 8 Inches 3 Quarters to be 669. 92, and the <hi>Cube</hi> of 11 Inches and a half to be 1520. 85:</p>
               <p>Then say by Proportion:</p>
               <p>As 1520. 85 (the <hi>Cube</hi> of the <hi>Diameter</hi> of the Piece whose <hi>Weight</hi> is known)</p>
               <p>Is to 1900, (the <hi>Weight</hi> of the Piece:)</p>
               <p>So is 669. 92 (the <hi>Cube</hi> of the <hi>Diameter</hi> of the Piece whose <hi>Weight</hi> you would know),</p>
               <p>To 837 Pound almost.</p>
               <p>Multiply 669. 92 (the <hi>Cube</hi> of 8 <hi>Inch. 3 Q.)</hi> by 1900 (the <hi>Weight)</hi> the Product will be 1272848. 00) which divided by 1520. 85, the <hi>Cube</hi> of 11 <hi>Inch. 3 Qu.)</hi> the Quotient will be 837 Pound almost, for the <hi>Weight</hi> of the Piece (or <hi>Saker)</hi> whose greatest thickness is 8 <hi>Inch. 3 Quar.</hi>

               <p>This is, if the two Pieces were of the same <hi>Metal,</hi> (as both <hi>Brass:)</hi> But if the Piece whose Weight you seek had been <hi>Iron:</hi> then having performed all the former work, as if they had been both Brass; you must then work another Proportion: For, the Proportion of the <hi>Weight</hi> between <hi>Brass</hi> and <hi>Iron</hi> being as 16 to 18 (as I have shewed in the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter XVI. of this Book) <hi>Brass</hi> being the heavier: Then say, As 18 (the Weight of <hi>Brass)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is to 16 (the Weight of <hi>Iron),</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So is 837 (the <hi>Weight</hi> of the <hi>Piece</hi> if it had been <hi>Brass),</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Is to 274. 62 (the <hi>Cube</hi> of 6 <hi>Inch.</hi> and a half),</p>

               <p>You are here to Note, That the Demi-Cannon should be fortified so well as the Saker: The <hi>Cube</hi> of the Diameter of the Demi-Cannon is. 274, of the <hi>Saker</hi> 52; the <hi>Weight</hi> of the <hi>Saker</hi> 1600: What should the <hi>Weight</hi> of the Demi-Cannon be?</p>

               <p>If (according to these Dimensions) you would build a Ship whose Burthen should be 200 Tun, the several Dimensions of the Members may be found as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Keel, it being 44 foot, the Cube thereof is 85184, double this Number (because the Ship you are to build is double the Burthen of the other, <hi>viz.</hi> 200 Tun), and it makes 170368, the Cube-Root whereof is 55, 441 foot; which is 55 foot, 4 Inches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of an Inch, for the length of the <hi>Keel.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This is the natural way of working of these and the like Proportions, but when you have many Lengths to find, you may ease your self of extracting so many Cube Roots, for having found out one of them by the Cube-Root, you may find out all the rest-by the Golden Rule of Proportion: Thus, having found the Length by the Keel to be 55. 44, and you would find the length of the Midship-beam proportionable to this, which in the Ship of 100 Tun was 20 foot: Say,</p>
               <p>As 44 the length by the Keel of the Ship of 100 Tuns,</p>
               <p>Is to 55. 44 the length by the Keel of the Ship of 200 Tuns,</p>
               <p>So is 9 foot, the depth in the Hold of the Ship of 100 Tuns,</p>
               <p>To 11. 34, the depth in the Hold of the Ship of 200 Tuns.</p>
               <p>And so of all the Members, as in this Synopsis,</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Midship beam:</p>
               <p>As 44 is to 55. 44, so is 20 to 25. 20:</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Depth in Hold:</p>
               <p>As 44 is to 55. 44, so is 9 to 11. 34:</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the Rack forward:</p>
               <p>As 44 is to 55. 44, so is 13 to 16. 38:</p>

               <p>As 44 is to 55. 44, so is 7 to 8. 82:</p>
               <p>Or thus, having the proportion of one <hi>Cube</hi> to another <hi>Cube,</hi> you may work by that in this manner.</p>

               <p>By this Table you may see, That if a <hi>Gun</hi> carry a <hi>Shot</hi> of 5 Inches and a half Diameter, that <hi>Shot,</hi> if of <hi>Lead,</hi> will weigh 34 Pound 11 Ounces.—If of <hi>Iron</hi> 23 Pound 2 Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: If of <hi>Stone</hi> but 8 Po. 11 Ounces, and so of any other, as in the Table.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> The <hi>Stone</hi> here meant is <hi>Marble, Peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and such like, other Stone being more soft and porous; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently <hi>lighter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Also <hi>Note,</hi> That in load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Gun for a <hi>Stone-shot</hi> you are not to give her the same <hi>Charge</hi> of Powder as for one of <hi>Lead</hi> or <hi>Iron,</hi> but abate according as the Proportions of the <hi>Metals</hi> are.</p>
               <p>If you compare this <hi>Table</hi> with the former <hi>Table</hi> of <hi>Cube Roots,</hi> you shall find the <hi>Cube</hi> of each Number bear the like proportion one to another, as the <hi>Weight</hi> of each <hi>Bullet</hi> is one to another of the same <hi>Metal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example.</hi> The <hi>Cube</hi> of 3 and 3 Quarters is 52. 73:</p>
               <p>The <hi>Weight</hi> of an Iron-Shot, which is 3 Inch. 3 Quart. is 7 Pound 5 Ounces, (or Decimally) 7. 31:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:105579:69"/>
The <hi>Cube</hi> of 4 Inch. 3 Qu. is 107. 17:</p>
               <p>The <hi>Weight</hi> of an Iron Shot of that Diameter is 14 Pound 14 Ounces (or Decimally 14. 87) which is 4 Ounces more than double 7. 31, for 7. 31 doubled is 14. 62.</p>
               <p>So likewise 52. 73 doubled is 105. 46, which does not exceed 107. 17 (the <hi>Cube</hi> of 3 Inch. 3 Quart.) being so doubled.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Concerning Gunpowder, and to find what quantity will fill any Granado Shell or Cartridge.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT hath been often Experimented in the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> that one Pound of Powder will fill 31 <hi>Cubical Inches,</hi> and 600 parts, which is, a little above half one tenth part of an Inch: This being allowed, it will be no hard matter to know what quantity of <hi>Powder</hi> will fill any <hi>Granado shell,</hi> or <hi>Cartridge.</hi> For the Proportion will be,</p>
               <p>As 33. 06 <hi>Cubical Inches,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is to <hi>One Pound</hi> of <hi>Powder;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So is any other Number of <hi>Cubical Inches,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the Number of <hi>Pounds</hi> of <hi>Powder</hi> that will fill those <hi>Inches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether it be <hi>Granado shell</hi> or <hi>Gartridge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this work being something troublesome, I shall here exhibit a <hi>Table,</hi> which by inspection only, will tell you what quantity of <hi>Powder</hi> will fill any <hi>Granado-shell,</hi> whose true Diameter is known, provided the <hi>Shell</hi> be perfectly Round.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>A well <hi>Fortified</hi> Gun, hath her <hi>Metal</hi> at the <hi>Vent</hi> or <hi>Touch-hole</hi> as thick as her Diameter at the <hi>Bore:</hi> Now <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> do allow three Ounces of Powder for every hundred Weight of Metal in <hi>Iron Guns:</hi> and <hi>Four Ounees</hi> for every hundred Weight of <hi>Metal</hi> in <hi>Brass Guns:</hi> According to this Allowance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How much Powder must be allowed for the Charge of an Iron Gun, whose Weight is 22 hundred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Allowance for <hi>Iron Guns</hi> being 3 Ounces, Multiply 22 (the hundred Weights) by 3 (the allowance for Iron Guns) the Product will be 66, which divide by 16 (the Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in one Pound) the Quotient will be 4 and 2 remaining, which is 4 Pound and 2 Ounces; So that 4 Pound and 2 Ounces of Powder, will load such an Iron Gun.</p>

               <p>WHEN you have made one <hi>Shot,</hi> which doth not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer your expectation, it must be either <hi>Higher, Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> or <hi>Wide</hi> of the <hi>Mark,</hi> or <hi>both:</hi> To remedy any of which observe these following <hi>Rules:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> If at the <hi>first Shot</hi> you find the Piece to shoot directly over the Mark; Then so much make your <hi>Dispart</hi> longer, that the top of it may be just seen from the top of the Base Ring to the stroke of the Shot; and with this new <hi>Dispart</hi> level your Piece and give Fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:105579:74"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the <hi>first Shot</hi> had strook just under the Mark, then bring the Piece to its former position, and mark how much the <hi>Dispart</hi> is over the stroke of the Shot, and cut off of it just so much as being at the Breech of the Piece, you may discern the <hi>top</hi> of it, the <hi>Mark</hi> on the <hi>Base Ring,</hi> and the <hi>stroke</hi> of the Shot, in a right Line; and when you have brought it to such a length, level the Piece as before; Prime and give Fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the first Shot had strook on the <hi>right hand</hi> of the <hi>Mark;</hi> to mend it, you must level the Piece as before; then standing at the Breech of the Piece, observe the stroke of the Shot over the <hi>Dispart,</hi> and on that part of the Base Ring which you then look over in a right line towards the Dispart and stroke of the Shot, set up a Pin with a little soft Wax: Then level your Piece to the Mark by this Pin and the Dispart, and then doubtless you will make a good Shot.—For when you level by the Metal of the Base Ring, where the Pin is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and the Mark, the Piece standing at that direction, look over the top of the Dispart, from the mark in the Base Ring, and you shall find the Piece to lie so much to the <hi>Left,</hi> as the former Shot strook to the <hi>Right</hi> of the Mark; and should now in all probability hit the <hi>Mark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If the <hi>first shot</hi> be both <hi>wide,</hi> and too <hi>high,</hi> or too <hi>low;</hi> then use both the foregoing <hi>Directions:</hi>—First, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the <hi>Dispart</hi> by making it <hi>longer,</hi> or cutting of it <hi>shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> by the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Second Directions</hi> hereof, the <hi>Shot</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Lower</hi> or <hi>Higher,</hi> and then make Use of this <hi>Third Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> for Shooting Wide: Which things being done with care and diligence, will doubtless mend a bad Shot.</p>

                  <head>The Description of the RULER.</head>
                  <p>The <hi>Ruler</hi> may be of any length, with a large <hi>Slit</hi> in the middle for a <hi>Slider</hi> to move in, and in the <hi>Slider</hi> a <hi>Hole</hi> to look through: The <hi>Ruler</hi> must be slit quite through at the bottom, and a piece of Brass fastned over it; but at the top it may be left whole for half an Inch or more; in which whole part, a <hi>Nut</hi> may be fastned, through which a <hi>Screw</hi> must pass, to <hi>raise</hi> or <hi>depress</hi> the <hi>Slider</hi> as occasion requires: On both sides of the <hi>Slit,</hi> the Ruler must be divided into Feet and tenth parts of a Foot; and every one of those parts into 10 more, so then every Foot will be divided into 100 parts.—Through the Center of the little Hole, a small Line must be drawn quite thro' the <hi>Slider,</hi> which will shew at what height the <hi>Sight-hole</hi> standeth from the <hi>Base Ring</hi> of the Gun.—Also there must be an <hi>Index</hi> to hang on the edge of the <hi>Ruler,</hi> and under it a small <hi>Pin,</hi> perpendicular to the <hi>Pin</hi> on which the <hi>Index</hi> hangeth; which is to set the <hi>Ruler</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular or upright.</p>

Forasmuch as the Gun is to be elevated 2 degrees and 6 Tenth parts of a degree; Look for 2 degrees in the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum of the Table, and for 6 parts of a degree in the head thereof; And against 2, and under 6, you shall find this Number, 04536, which multiply by 8. 7 (the length of the Gun in Feet and decimal parts of a Foot) the Product will be, 0394632. from which cut off (towards the right hand) five Figures for the Number taken out of the Table, and one for the 7 Tenths in length of the Gun, in all six Figures, then will the Product stand thus 0. 394632, which 0 to the left hand is no Feet, but the 3 following is 3 Tenth parts of a Foot, and the 9 following is 9 Tenths of a Tenth part of a Foot, which is neer 4 Tenth parts of a Foot, and to that Number on the sides of the Ruler, must the stroke (and hole) in the Slider be brought, and then the Ruler is rectified for that <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>

                  <p>Exam. 1. <hi>Suppose you have a</hi> Gun <hi>whose length is 9 Foot and half, and you would elevate it to 5 degrees of</hi> Mounture.</p>
                  <p>Look in the Table for the length of the Gun, 9 Foot and a half, in the first Columb of the Table, and in that Line under 5 deg. you shall find 10. 0, which is just 10 Inches, wherefore take any strait stick, and cut it off at that length, which set perpendicularly upon the top of the <hi>Base Ring,</hi> and level over the top of the <hi>Stick,</hi> as if it were the hole in the Slider of the <hi>Ruler,</hi> and the top of the dispart upon the <hi>Muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle Ring,</hi> and you will make a good Shot.</p>
                  <p>Exam. 2. <hi>Suppose your Gun were 12 Foot long, and you would</hi> Mount <hi>her to 7 degrees of Elevation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Look for 12 Foot long in the first Columb, and for 7 deg. in the head of the Table, and against 12 Foot, and under 7 deg. you shall find 17. 71, which is 17 Inches and 71 hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred parts of an Inch (which is almost 3 quarters of an Inch) a <hi>Stick</hi> of that length set perpendicularly upon the <hi>Base Ring,</hi> you may level over it by the top of the Dispart on the <hi>Muzzle Ring,</hi> as if it were through the hole in the <hi>Slider.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if you would Level without a <hi>Dispart,</hi> then take the <hi>Dispart</hi> off, and lay it to the foresaid <hi>Stick,</hi> cutting so much of it off, as was the length of the <hi>Dispart;</hi> then set the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the <hi>Stick</hi> upon the <hi>Base Ring,</hi> and bring the top of the <hi>Stick,</hi> the <hi>Metal</hi> of the <hi>Muzzle Ring,</hi> and the <hi>Mark</hi> in one Right line, then Prime and give Fire, and doubtless you will make a good Shot.</p>

               <p>HE that would learn perfectly to <hi>Shoot</hi> ot <hi>Randon,</hi> ought, to draw his <hi>Piece</hi> into a <hi>level ground;</hi> Where, <hi>First,</hi> Shooting <hi>level,</hi> let him observe the distance in Feet or Paces, from the Gun to the <hi>Graze</hi> of the <hi>Bullet:</hi> Then mount his <hi>Pieee</hi> to one degree, and mark where that doth graze, noting the distance as before; Then, to 2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> degrees, to Ten degrees, and by these <hi>Elevations</hi> and <hi>Distances</hi> make a <hi>Table,</hi> by which <hi>Table,</hi> you may, by the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Proportion,</hi> find how far another <hi>Piece</hi> will carry her Shot from degree to degree of <hi>Elevation:</hi>—But, because, it is probable, that every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Gunner</hi> cannot have leave or opportunity (the charge being great) to make such <hi>Experiment,</hi> I shall here exhibit to your View, a short Table of Mr. <hi>N. N.</hi>  by him made out of a <hi>Saker</hi> 8 Foot long, Loaded with 3 Pound of Powder; At the first Shot (at one deg. of Mounture) she conveyed her Shot 1125 Feet, or 225 Paces: The second Shot, at 5 deg. of Mounture she conveyed her Shot 2180 Feet or 416 Paces: At the third Shot, at 7 deg. of Mounture, 505 Paces: And the last at 10 deg. 630 Paces: In which <hi>Experiment,</hi> he loaded his Piece with loose Powder exactly Weighed, also he weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Wad, and beat down the same with the like (or equal) strength; and let the <hi>Piece</hi> cool half an hour between each Shot: <table>

               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:105579:78"/>
Exam. <hi>Suppose I find by my first Shot, that the Bullet grazed from my Gun 704 Paces, the Mounture of the Peece being 4 deg: How much must I Monnt her, so that she may convey her Shot 900 Paces?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These distances of <hi>Randons</hi> are to be proportioned to those in the Table, by this Anology.</p>
               <p>Saying</p>
               <p>As 704 Paces, (the <hi>Graze</hi> of the Bullet at 4 deg. of Mounture,) Is to 370 (the Paces against 4 deg. of Mounture)</p>
               <p>So is 900, (the number of Paces to be Shot) To 473, the Number to be found in the Table answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Degrees</hi> of <hi>Mounture</hi> required.</p>
               <p>Therefore, multiply 370 (the number against 4 deg.) by 900, (the number of Paces to be Shot,) the Product will be 333000, which divided by 704 (the <hi>Graze</hi> of the <hi>Bullet</hi> at the first Shot) and the Quotient will be 473; which number I should seek in the Table, but finding it not there, I take 461 the next less, against which stands 6 degrees, and 505 the next greater, against which stands 7 deg. the difference between these two numbers is 44, which shews the Piece must be Mounted to 6 deg. and on third part of a degree for to reach the distance of 900 Paces: For 461 is less by 12 then 473, which is neer one third part of 44 the difference.</p>
               <p>This Table beforegoing was deduced from an experiment made by Mr. <hi>Nat Nye</hi> the Master Gunner of <hi>Wortester</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1647. But this Table being very short, and the use of it so absolutely necessary for Gunners (especially in Land Service) I shall exhibit to their view Two other Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles tending to the same purpose, long since calculated by an able Mathematician, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Henry Bond,</hi> which with their <hi>Uses</hi> take as followeth.</p>

                  <p>Look in the first Columb of the first Table, for 13 the degrees of <hi>Mounture,</hi> against which you shall find 3889, Multiply this number by 763, the Paces that the Gun car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at 13 <hi>deg.</hi> of <hi>Mounture,</hi> the Product will be 2967307, from which cut off four Figures towards the right hand and it will be 296. 7307: So that the Gun will carry at the <hi>Horiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontal Rainge</hi> 296 Paces, and 7 Tenths of a Pace.</p>
                  <p>Also, If a Piece carries her Shot, at 16 deg. of <hi>Mounture</hi> 1074 Paces, the <hi>Horizontal Rainge</hi> of that Peece will be found to be 374 Paces:</p>
                  <p>Question 2. <hi>If a</hi> Gun <hi>carries a Shot 296 Paces and 7 Tenths of a Pace at the</hi> Horizontal Rainge, <hi>how many Paces will she carry at 13 deg. of</hi> Mounture:</p>
                  <p>Look in the first Columb of the Second Table for 13 (the degrees of Mounture) against which stands 2. 572, this number multiplyed by 296. 7 (the <hi>Horizontal Rainge</hi> of the Piece) the Product will be 7631124, from which cut off 4 Figures, and it will be 763. 1124, that is 763 Paces, and so far will that <hi>Gun</hi> carry its Shot at 13 deg. of <hi>Mounture,</hi> which is answerable, and proves the foregoing <hi>Question.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner you may find, That if a Gun at its <hi>Horizontal Rainge</hi> carry her Shot 374 Paces, at 16 deg. of <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> it will convey her Shot 174 Paces.</p>
                  <p>Question 3. <hi>If a Piece carry her Shot 543 Paces at 11 degrees of</hi> Mounture, <hi>how far will she convey her Shot at 19 deg. of</hi> Mounture?</p>
                  <p>Multiply the number standing against 11 in the first Table,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105579:79"/>
which is 4237, by 543 (the <hi>Rainge</hi> at 11 deg. of <hi>Mounture)</hi> the product will be 2300691. Then multiply this product by 3: 156 (the number standing against 19 in the second Table) and this second product will be 726. 0980796, from, which seven figures being cut off towards the right hand, the remainder will be 726, and so many Paceswill she <hi>Rainge</hi> at 19 deg. of <hi>Mounture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus, If a Peece at 6 deg: of <hi>Mounture</hi> convey her Bullet 132 Paces, you shall find that at 12 deg. of <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> she will convey it 181: 75 Paces:</p>

               <p>So that the greatest difference from the first Shot was about 24 Paces.</p>
               <p>The Reason of these things is this. At the First Shot, the Bullet found the Aire quiet.—And at the Second Shot, it did not only find the Aire stirred with the first Shot, but also tending towards the place at which it Shot, and because it is more easie to move and penetrate that which is already mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and open, then that which is close and quiet, it followeth that the Second Shot, finding in its Rainge a lesser resistance then the first did, it did out Shoot the first.</p>
               <p>A Second Reason is, At the first Shot the Powder being put into the Piece, doth oftentimes find the same somewhat moist, by which means the Powder will not fire quickly, as when the Piece is dry, and temperately warm, for this warmth, will somewhat dry up the moisture which is in the Powder, and cause it to fire sooner, wherefore the Powder doth not work so forcibly in the first Shot, as it doth in the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:105579:81"/>
second.—The Third and Fourth Shots will be much like the Second. And now I will give you the reason, why as the Piece grows hotter, one Shot will not exceed the last before it, but every time come shorter and shorter.</p>
               <p>The Piece waxing hotter, and by how much the hotter, by so much the more attractive is the concavity of the Piece made; and because the Shot is driven forth, or expelled, with no other thing then by the airy exhalation, or wind caused through the Salt-Peter; therefore, by making such a Piece the more attractive with the more heat, which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth and retaineth continually more and more of that Wind which should serve to expel the Bullet; the vertue expulsive in that Piece, doth continually, more and more decrease, and the Shot flyeth not with that swiftness as it did before, although the two first things; that is, the breaking of the Aire, and the drying of the Powder every time more and more doth help much the Rainge of the Shot; which aid and help, as it is to be believed, that somtimes it supplyeth, and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, gives advantage to that expulsive virtue which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually the Piece doth diminish or sup in, according as it heateth: So that the Third and Fourth Shots, will not be much differing from the Second Shot; nevertheless, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time, the said two accidents (that is, the opening of the Aire, and drying of the Powder by the heat of the Piece,) cannot supply the Third accident; that is, the virtue attractive, by reason, the attraction is augmented as the Piece heateth. And this caused my Sixth and Seventh Shots to convey the Bullet 22 Paces shorter then the First.</p>

                  <p>Provide small <hi>Fuses,</hi> of about one quarter of an Inch bore, three quarters of an Inch in thickness; and eight Inches long. Fill these with good Powder dust, moistned with <hi>Oyle</hi> of <hi>Salt-Peter,</hi> moisten it but a little, and put it in with an Iron

                  <p>All things being thus ready, Thrust the Pike of your <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stock</hi> in at one end of the Fuse, you intend to give fire at; and bid one of your Assistants come on one side of the Mouth of the <hi>Morter,</hi> and give fire to your Fuse, wherewith fire the Fuse in the <hi>Morter,</hi> and then with speed give fire to the Touch-hole. It is far more certain to fire a <hi>Morter piece</hi> with Fuses then with <hi>Match,</hi> which doth often fail.</p>

                  <p>You ought (as in finding the Rainges of other Pieces of Ordnance) to get leave to try One, Two or Three Shots for practice, without breaking of the <hi>Shell,</hi> which you may thus effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Fill the Shell with powder, then put it out again, and Weigh it exactly, and fill the Shell again with the like weight of Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take a <hi>Fuse,</hi> and at the end of it tie 3 or 4 ounces of powder, which put down with the <hi>Fuse</hi> amongst the earth first making way for it by thrusting in a Staffe,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Level your <hi>Morter</hi> by help of a <hi>Square</hi> or <hi>Quadrant</hi> to (always) above 45 degrees, and what degrees you mount it to note down carefully.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> All things being ready, and the <hi>Shell</hi> in and prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; cause One or Two to go and observe whether the Fuse burn all the while the <hi>Granado</hi> is flying, and when the 3 or 4 Ounces of powder takes fire, for hereby you may mend your Fuse, and try whether it will keep fire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> These things observed, Measure that distance, and note it down under the degrees of mounture, as also the Weight of the powder the Morter used to convey the Shell that distance. And when you have thus done two or three

                  <p>Sixthly, Take the distance to the Town, Fort, or other thing you are to shoot at, by which (and your former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment) you may find at what degree of <hi>Mounture</hi> your <hi>Morter</hi> is to be <hi>elevated</hi> to reach such a <hi>Town,</hi> or the like; and that by the <hi>Reverse Rule of Proportion:</hi> Thus:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>So is the distance to your designed Place,</p>
                  <p>To the degrees to which the <hi>Morter</hi> must be elevated to reach that designed Place:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Imagin that you made your Experimental Shot at 46 deg of <hi>Mounture,</hi> and the Shell flew 320 Paces; how many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees must the <hi>Morter</hi> be elevated, to cast its <hi>Shell</hi> 280 Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the distance that the place you are to shoot at, is distant from the Morter?</p>
                  <p>Multiply 320, by 46, the Product will be 14720, which divide by 280, the Quotient will be 52 Paces, and almost a half, and to so many degrees of <hi>Mounture</hi> must the <hi>Morter</hi> be <hi>mounted</hi> to convey its Shell 280 Paces.</p>

                  <head>Some Cautions relating to the foregoing Section, concerning the Morter Piece.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Let your <hi>Powder</hi> (when you are to shoot often to the same place) be all of the same strength and goodness.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Use not <hi>Tampions</hi> of <hi>Wood,</hi> but a <hi>Wad</hi> of <hi>Hay</hi> and a <hi>Turf</hi> of <hi>Earth,</hi> both rammed in with the like strength.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Try your <hi>Shells</hi> before you fill them, by putting in a little Powder, and firing it, immediately stopping the <hi>Fuse-hole</hi> with <hi>Clay,</hi> for if any Smoke come out, the <hi>Shell</hi> is defective.</p>

                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:105579:83"/>
4. Weigh every <hi>Shell</hi> before you fill it, and make them all of one Weight, by putting in thereto so many Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket Bullets as will make their Weight even.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Fill your <hi>heaviest Shell</hi> with Powder (for that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain least Powder) which done, pour it cut again, and weigh it very exactly; for such a quantity (and no more) will serve all your <hi>Shells.</hi>
