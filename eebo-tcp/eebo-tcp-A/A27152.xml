            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>AS for the <hi>Perſon</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> I formerly writ of, there is ſuch a full Concurrence of Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies concerning the truth of this Relation about him, that it admits of no further doubt or ſcruple with us, in reference to the matter of fact; neither do I ſee any reaſon (the firſt being proved) to queſtion, but that the things are wrought by the power of a Divine hand, in which there can be no juggle or deluſion as to the truth of the matter it ſelf. Beſides the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny before mentioned in my laſt, we have receiv'd a full confirmation thereof by Captain <hi>Haſtell</hi> of <hi>Plymouth</hi> which he had from his Son in <hi>Waterford</hi>: As alſo from one Captain <hi>Lancaſter</hi> living near this place and being partner with <hi>Gertrux</hi> and Captain <hi>Pley</hi> of this Town in a parcel of Land about <hi>Cornedy</hi>: who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that they have received it under the hands of many men of note in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that no diſeaſe ſtands before him. To which may be added the incloſed Relation from one Mr. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eacher</hi> living in <hi>Youghall</hi> who was both an eye and ear witneſs, containing a very ſober and rational account of the matter.</p>
            <p>Upon the whol, the thing is wonderful, and ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous, and aſtoniſhing, and makes us as men in a dream, when we think or ſpeak of it: And we cannot but conclude, that God is about to do ſome great work in the World, and that this is but the forerunner
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40709:3"/>
of ſome great things which we may ſhortly ſee, unto which we deſire to ſtand prepared. It is clear, that theſe 1500. years at leaſt, we cannot hear of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the like nature. And that the Devil ſhould have ſuch power it cannot enter into me to imagine; elſe the Miracles wrought by Chriſt and his Apoſtles were no ſealing evidence (as they were) of the truth of the Goſpel, and of the Divine ſtamp and authority of the ſame; in aſ much as neither Man nor Devil could do the like with their utmoſt art and induſtry.</p>
            <p>What the preſent inſtrument, is we cannot certainly ſay, onely that all that were of his acquaintance in theſe parts while he lived here, do give the character of a very ſober, diſcreet, civil Gentleman; what is his preſent frame and poſture we are not fully infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, more then what the incloſed Relation ſignifieth: Onely that great and marvellous things are done by him cannot be denyed.—The particular deſign of God therein we muſt leave undetermined till time ſhall make it manifeſt.</p>

               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Having heard of many diſeaſes healed and cured by <hi>Valentine Gertrux</hi> of <hi>Affans,</hi> divers of them ſeemed ſo ſtrange to mee, that I could not give credit to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports; nor could I be ſatisfied till I went up thither my ſelf, which I did on White-munday, purpoſing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40709:4"/>
to have returned by water in the ſame boat: But he being gone from home with intention to be back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain on Tueſday morning early (that being one of the three dayes in the week that he hath appointed for touching diſeaſed and diſtemper'd perſons of all ages and Sexes) I ſtayed above at <hi>Capo Coyne</hi> that night, and went early in the morning to <hi>Affans,</hi> to a certain houſe about a flight ſhot off his own; whether he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the people to come, becauſe of the multitude flocking about his own dwelling houſe: So I went in, and ſtood cloſe by him, and ſaw him to ſtroak them, cauſing them to ſtrip off their Cloaths, where their paines and griefs were: I ſaw him touch many of the Kings Evil while I was there, and many alſo whom he had cured of that Diſtemper, came to acknowledge it, which is the utmoſt reward he accepts from any: I ſaw him heal eight perſons of the dead Palſey in their Armes and Legs; whom, after he had touched and ſtroaked them, he cauſed to be lifted up, and they had inſtantly the right uſe of their Limbs: The ſame day I ſaw him touch 60. and odd perſons, divers of them troubled with the falling ſickneſs, and of them, ſome ſurprized and taken by it in the ſame Room: He being called to their help, left other Patients and went to them, and while they were foaming at the mouth, and wallowing on the ground, he ſtroaked their breaſt with his hand, and immediately their pain ceaſed, and they ſtood up and ſaid, that they were very well. — I alſo ſaw him reſtore many deaf perſons to their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſently, not failing any one therein, and this only by ſtroaking, and putting his fingers into the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40709:4"/>
holes of their Eares. He likewiſe cures the Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion fits only by ſtroaking the perſons afflicted with his hand: I ſaw divers poor Cripples came in halting on their Crutches, whom when he had ſtroaked on their Legs, or Armes, (as their paines lay) they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently not onely walked, but leaped and skipped about the room: One of them not minding his crutches, left them behinde him in the room, but he called him back again, ſaying, Friend take away thy cruches, for I hope here will be no need of them; ſo the poor man went forth merrily with them in his hand.</p>
            <p>He takes away all ſorts of pain, and old Aches, though of twelve, ſixteen, or twenty years continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or longer, onely with ſtroaking and ſmoothing the part greived with his hand: immediately upon laying his hand upon the part, the pain removes ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly into another part of the body; as, from the back to the breaſt, from thence into the legs and arms, or other extream parts, and when the party telleth him where it is removed, he followeth it with his hand, which driveth it out, ſometimes at the fingers ends, ſometimes at the toes, other times at the crown of the head, and ſometimes at the mouth, and when the perſon ſaith, it is gone, and he feeleth no more pain, he biddeth him be gone and glorify God, and forſake his ſins: He doth it freely unto all, and is ſo far from taking any reward, that he doth not allow them to give him thanks, but bids them praiſe and thank the Lord, for that he hath vouchſafed to make uſe of ſuch a poor ſimple Creature, as he doth, to doe them good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:40709:5"/>People of all ſorts of diſeaſes and diſtempers doe daily ſo flock about his houſe, that if he had not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them three dayes in the week, as I formerly mentioned, he muſt have forſaken his own dwelling to have gotten reſt. Some out of prejudice ſay, that he hath an univerſal charme againg all diſeaſes; but this is onely a detraction, he onely calleth upon the name of God whileſt he is doing of it, and though breifly yet divinely: Thus have I given you a true account of that, whereof I was both an Ear and an Eye witneſs, which had I not been, I think I ſhould not have believed, though all the People in <hi>Youghall</hi> had told me of it.</p>
