            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Horſe, Horſe, away, and let's us no longer ſtay,</l>
               <l>For they doe vow and ſweare they wil us ſtay,</l>
               <l>And rob us, which is worſe then death;</l>
               <l>With this they ranne till they were out of breath.</l>
               <l>Old <hi>Iack</hi> being better mounted, ſpur'd away,</l>
               <l>Left <hi>Taffie</hi> and his * Goate to goe aſtray.<note place="margin">The young mans horſe not much big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then a Welſh Goate.</note>
               </l>
               <l>And wanting ayde, was then compel'd to cry</l>
               <l>Helpe Plowmen now (I pray) or elſe I die.</l>
               <l>The heartleſſe Clowns would not afford their ayde</l>
               <l>To this poore Brittaine, ſorely now affrayd:</l>
               <l>And, wanting helpe, among the Thieves he fell;</l>
               <l>O what a dolfull ſtory it is to tell!</l>
               <l>He groan'd and ſaid, (Brave hearts) O give me breath,</l>
               <l>Delight not in an ancient Brittaines death.</l>
               <l>All that I have is yours, ſo that you be</l>
               <l>Preſervers of my life and liberty.</l>
               <l>Quoth they, true Brittaine, rouſe, rouſe up thy heart,</l>
               <l>Thinke not wee'l ayme to act a wicked part;</l>
               <l>'Tis not thy life nor blood wil us content,</l>
               <l>Yeeld up thy purſe, for that's our chiefeſt bent.</l>
               <l>To this reply'd poore <hi>Taffie,</hi> in a faint ſtraine,</l>
               <l>Here is the ſtore which doth with me remaine;</l>
               <l>Content I am to part, ſo you wil ſpare</l>
               <l>My life that's deare and then I doe not care.</l>
               <l>Farewel the Purſe with eight odde pounds in money,</l>
               <l>For want of which, Ile ceaſe to court or coney.</l>
               <l>And after they bereav'd this youth of all,</l>
               <l>They ſpur'd and cry'd, and gave to <hi>Iohn</hi> a call.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> with his gallant <hi>Polimero</hi> ſteere,</l>
               <l>Scorn'd to turne backe, but did them flout and jeere,</l>
               <l>Swore a big Oath that he would never yeeld,</l>
               <l>Reſolv'd he was to die within the field;</l>
               <l>So long my horſe, or ſelfe, can act it out,</l>
               <l>Let me alone, Ile put the Rogues to rout.</l>
               <l>Forth came his Sword, his Piſtol charg'd, let flie,</l>
               <l>Routed the Rebels wing that Northward lie.</l>
               <l>

               <l>Encountered with theſe Cutters face to face.</l>
               <l>At laſt his horſe grew weak, his ſpirit fayle,</l>
               <l>Such gallant ſoule who would not much bewaile?</l>
               <l>Helpe, helpe (quoth he) to <hi>Taffie,</hi> villaine come,</l>

               <l>How now old Fox, could you not chuſe to fall?</l>

               <l>With fainting hearts in this unhappy plight,</l>
               <l>Up to the Hill they went, and there did light,</l>
               <l>Condoling their miſchance, and curſt the day</l>
               <l>That ever brought them to that curſed way.</l>
               <l>In this ſame ſad condition both did ſtrive</l>

               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:117436:6"/>In this ſame conflict, both of them fell out,</l>
               <l>Which prov'd moſt coward, which moſt ſtout.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Tewdyr</hi> began to ſweare and brag, that he</l>

               <l>Kil'd ſix and more with his great Trojan hand,</l>
               <l>If <hi>Taffie</hi> durſt (not fight) but onely ſtand.</l>
               <l>Curſed be the wombe which brought forth ſuch an Aſſe,</l>

               <l>Inſtead of fight he wil but runne away.</l>
               <l>Hold there my friend (quoth Noble <hi>Taffie</hi>)</l>
               <l>I cannot thinke on this, but I muſt laugh;</l>
               <l>You fight, you ſhite, what ayl'd your pocky noſe,</l>

               <l>My proper perſon promis'd nothing leſſe;</l>
               <l>Merit of worth, as all men by me gueſſe.</l>
               <l>A Coward Raſcall that nere drew a Sword</l>
               <l>In anger all his life, take't on my word!</l>
               <l>I fought moſt gallantly, he ſpurr'd away,</l>
               <l>Left to the hazzard of that gloomy day.</l>
               <l>Concluding this diſcourſe, they did agree,</l>
               <l>To <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to goe, there for to ſee</l>
               <l>If they could finde the Blades that them did rob;</l>
               <l>Poore men for want they did both ſigh and ſob.</l>
               <l>Ne're a man that wore a Sword, but they</l>

               <l>Often to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> they came in vaine,</l>
               <l>As wiſe as fooles they did returne againe.</l>
               <l>But on a morne <hi>Jack Tewdyr</hi> did behold</l>
               <l>One of the ſparkes that was ſo raſh and bold</l>
               <l>As to demand his Purſe, but truely he</l>
               <l>For want of <hi>Taffies</hi> preſence, had no certainty.</l>
               <l>The next day met with his Comradoe <hi>Gwyn,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Told him the ſtory; next he did begin</l>
               <l>His feature, face, and body to diſcry,</l>
               <l>His terrible looks and ſterne Phiſiognomy.</l>
               <l>Which much amaz'd the youngſter on my word,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:117436:7"/>And ſtruck him dumbe to heare he had a Sword.</l>
               <l>Reſolv'd they were to trie another way,</l>

               <l>Brave <hi>Twedyr</hi> to the Countrey doth retire,</l>
               <l>Relates his fate, and makes his friends admire</l>
               <l>At his eſcape, and what to him befel,</l>
               <l>Which for a Chriſtmas tale ſerves for to tel.</l>
               <l>Some at him laugh, others great pity take;</l>
               <l>Some jeere and flout, ſome lamentation make,</l>

               <l>The crafty Fox ſits ſilent, lets them curſe;</l>
               <l>Out of their Treaſure he wil cram his purſe,</l>

               <l>Big in his Countrey, but an arrant Clowne.</l>
               <l>His Clients Caſh was all that he did looſe,</l>

               <l>Rub up his noſe, and like a Goblyn ſtand.</l>
               <l>And being no later then the other day</l>
               <l>Fortune did preſent him in his way</l>
               <l>With a rare purchaſe, had he but the wit,</l>
               <l>And money to, t'improve the beſt of it,</l>
               <l>Might have regain'd his credit and loſt fame,</l>
               <l>Made himſelfe rich and famous in his name.</l>
               <l>Wanting both wit and Caſh, nay breeding to,</l>
