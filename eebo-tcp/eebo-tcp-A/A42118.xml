            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Reaſon of my publiſhing this Book in <hi>Engliſh</hi> is, the general Uſe I obſerve to be made of the <hi>Bitter Purging Salt</hi> in this Town and elſewhere, by all ſorts of Perſons, and that promiſcuouſly, in all Caſes, as Peoples Fancies or Humours prompt 'em, without any Advice beyond Publick Fame, or the good Woman that laſt viſited.</p>
            <p>The Sellers of this <hi>Salt</hi> are likewiſe ſuch as uſe to diſpoſe of other Catholick or Univerſal Medicines, who neither know how to direct the Buyer, nor care what becomes of the Taker, ſo as they attain their End, their part of the Profit. There is indeed this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; That other Medicines that have grown Popular were always uſher'd out with prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Directions, or Certificates of it's Virtues and numberleſs Cures, as <hi>Daffy</hi>'s <hi>Elixir, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Scurvy-Graſs,</hi> Atkins<hi>'s Oil for the Gout,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, the very Diſciples of
<pb facs="tcp:44220:3"/>
               <hi>Ponteus</hi> afford for publick Benefit a printed Encomium for a Voucher to the Twelve-Penny Packet. This I thought ſufficient to Vindicate my Tranſlation of Dr. <hi>Grew</hi>'s <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp; Uſe of the Bitter Purging Salt,</hi> which I intend to give to thoſe who buy any quantities of the <hi>Salt.</hi> And I'd have the Reader take notice, That this is no Quack-Bill, no boaſting Rhodomontado of any Ignorant Pretender, no guilded Buſh to ſet off bad Wine, but the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of an Ingenious Phyſician, Fellow of both Societies, and publiſh'd by him in <hi>Latin,</hi> for the Information of the Practicers of Phyſick, and for no Private Intereſt or Profit. But, I can ſcarce believe the Doctor ever foreſaw the Conſequence of his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations wou'd be the puſhing every Body up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Uſe of it Hand over Head; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I doubt not his Pardon for my Tranſlating it without his Knowledge, my Deſign being not to diſcover the ſecret Method of its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, but to prevent by theſe Directions the Miſchiefs he tells us may enſue the Abuſe of ſo good a Medicine. <hi>Farewell.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> How the bitter Purging Waters were firſt Diſcovered.</head>
               <p>THE Mineral Waters ariſing near <hi>Epſom</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> the chief of all the bitter Purging Waters, were found out by a Country Man, in or about the Year 1620.</p>
               <p>For near, the firſt Ten Years, none but the Country People made uſe of them, and they only to waſh External Ulcers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:44220:4"/>Afterwards the Lord <hi>Dudley North,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Francis</hi> the late Lord-Keeper, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under a Melancholy Diſpoſition, for which he had formerly Drank the <hi>Spaw-Waters</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> was reſolv'd to try the Vertue of theſe <hi>Epſom Waters</hi> flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering himſelf (I ſuppoſe) that he had found <hi>Chalybeate-Waters</hi> at his own Door.</p>
               <p>However, tho' they anſwer'd not his deſire and expectation as to their Nature, yet he did not repent of his Experiment, but from that time drank theſe Purging Waters, as a Medicine ſent from Heaven, with abundance of ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>Many others, encouraged by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, try'd the operation of theſe Waters; and amongſt the firſt, <hi>Maria de Medicis,</hi> Mother to the Wife of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. the Right Honourable <hi>George</hi> Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and many other Perſons of Quality.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and all others, who drank the <hi>Epſom-Waters,</hi> came not for Pleaſure but Health, and therefore always conſulted their own, or ſome Neighboring Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, for the Rules they were to obſerve.</p>
               <p>In a little while Phyſicians came of their own accord to theſe Waters by whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority they acquir'd ſo great a Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that 2000 Perſons have been there
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44220:4"/>
in one Day, to drink or divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>About 30 Years ſince, many of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>London,</hi> whoſe Buſineſs or Poverty obſtructed their going to <hi>Epſom,</hi> had the Waters ſent to them.</p>
               <p>Thus the Ice being broke, others brought great quantities to Town, which they ſold as well to Sick Perſons as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries, and continue ſtill to do ſo.</p>
               <p>No wonder then that ſo few ſick People go to theſe Waters, 'tis not that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Phyſicians eſteem them leſs, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Numbers of ſuch as Drink at home, and at other Wells of the ſame Nature, do every Day mightily encreaſe.</p>
               <p>For a few Years after the Diſcovery of the <hi>Epſom-Waters</hi> was publiſh'd, others of the ſame ſort (found out by Enquiry or Chance) grew into tolerable Repute and Uſe. The Names of the Principal are,

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Nature of the Bitter Purging Waters.</head>
               <p>THeſe Waters have no taſte, but a moderate bitterneſs, which is very ſenſible.</p>
               <p>Some that have Travelled into <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> mention bitter Waters in thoſe Countries; and St. <hi>James,</hi> in his Epiſtle, takes notice of ſweet and bitter Waters, as very common things in the Eaſtern Parts; all which bitter Waters, 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, are of this ſort.</p>
               <p>Theſe Fountains are not of an equal Strength nor Vertue, but ſome are much ſtronger than others; with the ſtrongeſt <hi>Dullidge</hi> is juſtly reckon'd with the gentler <hi>Epſom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Waters in their Springs are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſmell, but kept ſome Days or Weeks in Veſſels cloſe ſtopp'd, they putrifie and ſtink, eſpecially in Summer time; which will happen to all Waters, and ſometimes alſo to the cleareſt Spring Water, as we
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44220:5"/>
are told by thoſe that Sail near the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
               <p>Pour a little of this Water to Sirrup of Violets, and 'twill remain blue and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd, as if 'twere mix'd with common Spring-water.</p>
               <p>By the adding Lime water, it gives a whitiſh Muddy colour, as if ſome drops of Milk were mix'd with it, and the white parts will, in about an hours time, ſubſide in the form of a cloudy curdling, produc'd from the Union of the chalky Lexivial, and the acidity of the Cathartick Salts.</p>
               <p>All theſe Waters will curdle Milk, if it be added to them when they are hot, or boiling, but not at all if mix'd when they are cold.</p>
               <p>The Waters of any of theſe Wells, eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated in a glazed Earthen, or any other proper Veſſel, will yield a kind of a Cream a top, and a ſediment at the bottom of the Veſſel, of both together, 6, 8, or 10 Drams from a Gallon.</p>
               <p>This Cream is of an Aſh colour, Stony ſubſtance, and reſembles Plaiſter, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly not at all Lixivial, for every one knows that the <hi>Lapis Calcarius,</hi> or Lime-Stone, calcin'd, altho' actually cold, will grow very hot by pouring Water upon them, and emit a very great and thick
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44220:6"/>
fume, and that apply'd to any part of the Body 'twill burn. Therefore Chirurgeons uſe it for a Potential Cautery; but the fore-mentioned Cream calcin'd in a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Water pour'd upon it, cauſes neither ſmoak nor heat, nor does it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any the leaſt Pungency.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, as in <hi>Acton-Waters,</hi> the thin Minute Particles of which it conſiſts Will be very reſplendent and brittle, and wholly inſipid, tho' Calcin'd as aforeſaid, yet by the pouring on any acid Liquor, chiefly by Spirit of Nitre, an Ebullition, with a ſenſible heat, will be excited.</p>
               <p>The leſſer part of this Sediment is like in ſubſtance to the before-deſcrib'd Cream; the remainder is purely Saline, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of two kinds of Salts, one a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatick or Sea-Salt, the other a Salt proper or ſpecial to theſe Waters, whoſe Nature and Vertues I here deſign to treat of.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Epſom-Waters,</hi> the Muriatick Salt is about the 20th part of the whole Saline Compoſition; it is ſomething more in <hi>Dullidge,</hi> and in moſt of the fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Springs.</p>
               <p>In its biting Taſt, as well as in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of its Chryſtals, 'tis not unlike Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salt; whence it is that Waters, in which there is leſs of this Muriatick Salt, purge not ſo ſtrongly as others.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Nature of the Bitter Salt, peculiar to the Purging Waters.</head>
               <p>THis Salt, if it be rightly prepar'd, is of a delicate whiteneſs equal to new fall'n Snow.</p>
               <p>This bitter Salt is much more evident in the Salt it ſelf, in a dry Form, than in the Water, and ſmites the Tongue with a very penetrating Pungency, but without any Acrimony.</p>
               <p>If you diſſolve a Dram of this Salt in a Pint of Common Water, which is its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural proportion, 'twill have the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of curdling Milk, and be ennobled with the ſame bitter Taſt and Purging Vertue peculiar to its Mineral Water.</p>
               <p>And therefore 'tis not improperly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44220:7"/>
from the <hi>Sal Mirabilis,</hi> (made of Oil of Vitriol, and Common Salt) and from all other Salts, by the Name of the <hi>Bitter Purging Salt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This bitter Purging Salt, from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner of evaporating its Water, or degree of Cold, to which 'tis afterwards expoſed, and other circumſtances, will ſhoot into Cryſtals of a greater or leſſer Magnitude. But let the Dimenſions be what they will, the Figure is the ſame; for moſt of their Cryſtals, if they ſhoot not too thick, are ſmall rectangular Priſms, with four parallel ſides; the two oppoſite ſides ſomething flatter than the other. Sometimes they have two more ſides, and are Sexangular; but theſe are ſo ſmall that the naked Eye can hardly diſcover 'em.</p>
               <p>Their length is about half an Inch, but their thickneſs not above a fith, ſixth or ſeventh part of their length; their Baſis, a lump of the ſame; the Summit very different, having ſometimes three, but for the moſt part four ſloping Plains, and with the fore-mention'd parallel ſides make obtuſe Angles, or pointed, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener ſharpned, like a Pen Knife: One of the ſloping Plains is generally bigger than the other three taken together, and of a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44220:7"/>
Pentangular or Sexangular Figure; the oppoſite to this Quadrangular or Pentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular; the other two Triangular and leſs; the laſt, ſometimes inviſible, without a Microſcope.</p>
               <p>Theſe Criſtals, in their Oblong Figure, do moſt reſemble Salt-Petre; in their Rectangular they come neareſt to Sea-Salt.</p>
               <p>This bitter Salt, diſſolv'd in common Water, and ſtanding ſome Days in a Glaſs Veſſel, ſhoots into Branches like little Trees round the ſides of the Glaſs: To the producing this Figure, the before-deſcrib'd Criſtals of this Salt and of <hi>Sal Nitre</hi> (the points of which are terminated ſometimes into Right, ſometimes into Acute Angles) are very proper; the ſloping Plain of one Criſtal joyning to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel Plain of the others. Which I have alſo demonſtrated to be done in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Leaves, by the Figure of their proper Salts. <hi>Plant. Ang.</hi> 9. lib. 4. p. 1. c. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where note by the way, That in that Diſcourſe I have ſet down the Figures of <hi>Sal Nitri</hi> and other Salts, not altogether as they appear to us, but, probably, as they do exiſt in the Plants themſelves.</p>
               <p>Five Drams of this bitter Purging Salt, mixt in a Vial with half an Ounce of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44220:8"/>
common Water; and ſhaken together, by that Agitation only and the gentle Heat of the Hand in Winter, will all preſently diſſolve, except a few Grains; by which you obſerve it to be more diſſolvable than any other Salt.</p>
               <p>'Tis diſtinguiſh'd alſo by its Specifick Gravity from all other Salts; 'tis heavier than Allom, lighter than common Salt, and than Nitre, as we ſhall hereafter prove in the fifth <hi>Chapter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A diſſolution of this Salt, and Salt of Tartar, and any other Urinous or Lixivial Salt, will generate a white Coagulum, or a Nuetral Salt, of the taſte of neither, but ſomething Styptick.</p>
               <p>Strong and new Oil of Vitriol, poured upon this Salt, will cauſe a moderate Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition; from whence we may conclude it to be of an Alkaline Principle, and in ſome manner Lixivial.</p>
               <p>But if you add any other Liquor that I know of, either Acid or Alkali, to this Salt, 'twill neither ferment nor grow hot.</p>
               <p>This Salt in a Crucible, with a ſtrong fire, will melt and ſwell like Allom into a white Porous and boiling Calx.</p>
               <p>But this Calx will (except about a 40th part of the whole) diſſolve in a ſufficient quantity of common Water, which the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44220:8"/>
                  <hi>Lapis Calcarius,</hi> or Lime-Stone, will not.</p>
               <p>This Calx, in a Crucible, with a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fire for an hour, will be as hard as Alabaſter, nor will it afterwards be ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Air: Much otherwiſe 'tis with the Lime-Stone, which Calcin'd, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Air, falls to Powder.</p>
               <p>Altho' by this Calcination it loſes ſome part of its weight, yet its bitterneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, and is rather increas'd.</p>
               <p>The Calx of the bitter Purging Salt, by the affuſion of Spirit of Salt, or any other Acid, will preſently ferment, which is more or leſs conſpicuous according to the ſtrength of the aforeſaid Spirit; from whence alſo we may allow it to be in ſome ſort Lixivial.</p>
               <p>From a Pound of this Salt Diſtill'd in a Glaſs Retort well Luted, with a Rever-beratory Fire, you'll have in the Receiver a little above half a pound of an Acid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in ſmell and taſt, every way equal to common Spirit of Salt.</p>
               <p>Oil of Vitriol pour'd upon common Spirit of Salt, yields a dark and ſmoaky Vapour, which will likewiſe happen, if you drop the ſame Oil very ſtrong into the Spirit of the Purging Salt.</p>
               <p>'Tis very well known, that all the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeate
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44220:9"/>
Waters will change to a Purple, by the addition of Galls, as will White-wine Vinegar, tho' more obſcurely; but the infuſion of Galls will be in no wiſe alter'd by the Spirit of the Purging Salt, tho' an Acid, nor by the Spirit of 🜍, or Oil of Vitriol, from whence, as well as many other ways, the different Nature of theſe, and other Acids, may be ſhown.</p>
               <p>I took 8 Glaſs Bottles of River-Water, and with ſome drops of Sirrup of Violets colour'd them all blue alike; one of which I let ſtand without any thing elſe added to it. To a 2d I put a little <hi>Sal Nitri;</hi> to a third ſome of the bitter Purging Salt; to a fourth a little Lime-Water; to the fifth a diſſolution of the Calx of the Purging Salt; to the ſixth an infuſion of white Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; to the ſeventh the Diſtill'd Spirit of the Purging Salt; to the laſt, a little of both Lime-Water and the Purging Salt.</p>
               <p>In the three firſt, the Cerulous colour remain'd only a little faded.</p>
               <p>In the 4th and 5th, the Cerulous co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour was converted to a manifeſt Green; in the former turbid and paler, in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter like a Smarag'd, very deep and clear.</p>
               <p>In the 6th and 7th it turn'd purple; in the firſt obſcure, but the latter was like a true Amethyſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:44220:9"/>The green colour, in the 4th and 5th, vaniſh'd in about 3 hours, but the 5th was much deeper, and more durable.</p>
               <p>From this manifold Experiment we may obſerve, that as Nitre, although by accenſion it will yield a fix'd Lixivial Salt, and by Diſtillation an Acid Spirit, yet has neither a Lixivial, nor Acid taſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gives neither green nor purple colour to the Sirrup; ſo we may conclude the <hi>Purging bitter Salt</hi> to conſiſt of like princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that is not ſolely Acid, but alſo Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalious, and a little Lixivial.</p>
               <p>But it may be evidently demonſtrated, that its principles do partake of both, by the acidity of its Spirit, and the green co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; its Calx gives Sirrup of Violets like <hi>Aqua Calcis,</hi> and other Lixivial Liquors.</p>
               <p>In the laſt Bottle the colour was deeper and more durable, by the combination or union of the twofold Alkalious Salt, the bitter Purging Salt, and the Calcarious, as Ink is made by the union of two Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.</p>
               <p>And 'tis very plain, that the exiſtence of theſe Salts, and their efficacy in altering Colours, depends not on the fire, becauſe the infuſion of white Tartar will, like the Spirit of the Purging Salt, die the Sirrup of a purple colour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:44220:10"/>Laſtly, Take notice that I call the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaline Principle in this Purging Salt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially, and after a ſort Lixivial.</p>
               <p>For, as we have obſerv'd in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you can perceive no Lixivial taſt even in the Calx of this Salt, which does not hinder, but that an Alkaline Principle may be in this Salt, as appears from the fore cited Experiments, tho' it has never endured the fire, but after Calcination it is prov'd to be I know not how Lixivial.</p>
               <p>I call it Lixivial, tho that, nor any other Name in Uſe that I know of, is juſtly adapted to its Nature, for there is a want of proper Words to expreſs our meanings in nothing ſo much as in Philoſophy, ſuch as ſhould lead us through the Footſteps of Nature, and Intelligibly expreſs its admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable variety.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the difference between the bitter Purging Salt, Allom, and the Muriatick Salt.</head>
               <p>FRom the fore-cited Experiments, and thoſe we ſhall now mention rightly underſtood and compar'd, 'twill evidently appear that the Purging bitter Salt, tho' it may have ſome Qualities common to other Salts, does differ in its Nature and Species from all other Salts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:44220:10"/>Very many have confidently affirm'd it to proceed from an Aluminous <hi>Minera,</hi> but inconſiderately, for from whence is it they prove it, but becauſe they coagulate Milk, which is no reaſon at all, for by the ſame ridiculous Argument, Vinegar, Wine, Beer, and whatever curdles Milk, muſt be Aluminous.</p>
               <p>Nor does it appear from hence, that like Allom, when melting, it ſwells and riſes in bubbles, for Borax melted will have the ſame Elevation, but Borax does not curdle Milk, therefore is not Aluminous, nor from thence can the bitter Purging Salt be ſo.</p>
               <p>Moreover, from an Ounce of Allom cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd half an hour in a Crucible, there will remain half an Ounce of Calx. To this pour a ſufficient quantity of common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to diſſolve the Saline parts, and there will remain about 52 Grains of an inſipid and ſimple Earth at the bottom of the Veſſel, which is ſix times as much as the like quantity of the Calx of the bitter Salt will leave behind it.</p>
               <p>Nor is the Spirit of Allom Diſtill'd with a ſtrong Fire any thing like the Spirit of this Salt, for the firſt has a greater acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and much leſs grateful taſt; and which is worth Obſervation, a Fetid
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44220:11"/>
ſmell very like to the Spirit or Gaſs of Sulphure.</p>
               <p>The taſt likewiſe of this bitter Purging Salt and Allom is ſo different, that nothing can be more; for that of Allom is auſtere and has no bitterneſs, the other no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of auſterity but wholly bitter.</p>
               <p>Beſides, they are evidently diſtinguiſh'd by their Natural Figures for the Chryſtals of Allom, the Factitious at leaſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Altitude are ſomething flattiſh, and conſiſt of 8 Planes; two, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe at top and bottom, Sexangular and Parallel: The greater and leſs ſides of theſe Planes are ſo placed alternately, that the 3 great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er anſwer to the 3 leſs. About theſe are plac'd 6 Quadrangular Planes with une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual ſides and angles, the greater bending towards the Centre of the Chryſtal, and the leſs accordingly</p>
               <p>How very unlike this is to the before-deſcrib'd Figure of the Purging Salt, may eaſily appear by compariſon.</p>
               <p>Nor can this bitter Purging Salt with more Juſtice be reckon'd amongſt the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatick or common Salts, which well pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd has a very different taſt from the Purging Salt, and alſo from Allom; its Figure is likewiſe as different, for it ſhoots not long ways, but contracted almoſt in the form of a Cube.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:44220:11"/>Beſides, the Purging Salt calcin'd in a Crucible, with a ſtrong Fire, emits no viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vapour, nor loſes more than half of its weight; but common Salt thus calcin'd, as 'tis much more fluid, ſo it aſcends in thick ſmoaky vapours, leaving ſcarce an 18th part of the whole in the Crucible.</p>
               <p>Neither (which may ſeem ſtrange) does the Spirit of common Salt Diſtill'd, as the Spirit of the Purging Salt, coagulate Milk, unleſs added to it when 'tis Boiled.</p>
               <p>To be certain of this, I try'd the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Experiment.</p>
               <p>To a Pint of River Water, impregnated with a Dram of the bitter Purging Salt, and boiling, I threw in 3 or 4 Spoonfuls of Milk, and let it boil again; preſently the curdled Milk ſwam upon the Water.</p>
               <p>It did the ſame with as much of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the bitter Purging Salt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Inſtead of the Spirit of the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Salt, I us'd the Spirit of common Salt, and that much ſtronger than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Spirit, in the ſame proportion and method, but the Milk remained fluid in its Natural ſtate without any coagulation.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The difference of the bitter Purging Salt from Nitrous and Calcarious Salts.</head>
               <p>NOR does this Salt differ leſs from all kinds of Nitrous Salts; from which, by its bitter taſt alone, its enough diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd.</p>
               <p>Nor leſs by its Figure, for the Chryſtals of Nitre ſhoot not into four corner'd Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel Planes, but always into ſix; nor into right Angles, but obtuſe, and their tops ſeldom terminate in 4 ſloping Planes, but moſtly in 2, and ſometimes in 6, and thoſe more equal than in the Purging bitter Salt.</p>
               <p>The Purging bitter Salt thrown into the Fire is not at all inflamable but Nitre burns with a bright flame and roaring noiſe, till the moſt part of it evaporates.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid the moſt part of it, nor do I retract my aſſertion, for in the 3d Chapter we have obſerv'd about a 20th part to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main after the deflagration, which is in no wiſe Nitrous, but Lixivial, from Wood-Aſhes mix'd with it by the Nitre-Makers.</p>
               <p>But further, the bitter Salt in a Spoon, held over the flame of a Candle, will melt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44220:12"/>
in a moment, and bubble up as if thrown in to the fire; but Nitre, with ſuch a heat; will ſcarcely melt, but take up at leaſt 8 times the ſpace of the other, and emits a moſt reſplendent flame.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, tho' Nitre melts with difficulty, 'tis when melted much more fluid, for in a Crucible, in a ſtrong fire, it boils not like Allom, or the bitter Salt, but flows like Roſin or melted Metals.</p>
               <p>From Nitre melted in a Crucible ariſe thick Exhalations, which you never ſee from the bitter Salt, tho' in the ſtrongeſt Fire.</p>
               <p>Add likewiſe, that they differ from one another in their power of coagulating Milk.</p>
               <p>For half a Dram of the Purging Salt, thrown into half a Pint of Milk, will turn it very gray; but Nitre mix'd after the ſame manner, tho' in much greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, has no ſuch effect.</p>
               <p>The ſolubility of Nitre, as we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prov'd, is two parts in three leſs than the Purging Salt, for half an Ounce of common Water will, in the Winter, by agitation and a warm hand, diſſolve not above a Dram and half of Nitre.</p>
               <p>Its gravity is likewiſe very different, which appears by the following Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:44220:13"/>I put Oil of Turpentine into a Cylindar to the height of 3 Fingers; I then put in two Ounces of the Purging Salt, which rais'd the Oil a Finger higher, but from an equal weight of depurated Nitre, the Oil was elevated not higher than 3 fourths of a Finger; therefore the bitter Purging Salt is a 4th part lighter than Nitre.</p>
               <p>But Water impregnated with the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Salt occupies a leſs ſpace, its bulk conſidered, than the ſame quantity with as much <hi>Sal Nitri</hi> diſſolved in it.</p>
               <p>That is, Water inſtead of Oil mix'd with the Salts in a Vial; when they are diſſolv'd, the former ſubſides lower than the latter.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I Diſtill'd <hi>Dantzick Vitriol, Sal Armoniack,</hi> and a like quantity of the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Salt, inſtead of Nitre, in order to make the <hi>Aqua Regia.</hi> Now if this had been a Nitrous Salt, this Water wou'd, like <hi>Aqua Regia,</hi> have diſſolv'd Gold, but we could find no ſuch power in this Water.</p>
               <p>Nor is it the Nitre of the Ancients, for 'tis nothing like that of the Egyptians ſo often mention'd by <hi>Hypocrates;</hi> ſomething like which is deſcrib'd by <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> to be of a purple colour and biting; nor that of <hi>Etius,</hi> like Earth calcin'd and quench'd with Wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:44220:13"/>Nor, laſtly, can it be reckon'd with the <hi>Sal Calcarius;</hi> for the Purging Salt, or Water only, coagulates Milk with a much harder Curd, and greater plenty of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, than the Lime Water will.</p>
               <p>And, if that Power of Coagulation were equal, how many Liquors have we mention'd that curdle Milk, which are neither Calcarious nor Aluminous.</p>
               <p>Spirit of Nitre, dropt into the Cream that ſwims atop of the Lime-Water, or upon Lime it ſelf, will cauſe a viſible Ebullition; but the ſame Spirit will have no ſuch Effect upon the Purging Salt.</p>
               <p>There can be no where more diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the taſte of Things, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Purging Salt and the Calcari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for the one is Lixivial and Sweet; the other, as it were Cold and Bitter.</p>
               <p>Lime will, by pouring a little Water upon it, preſently fall to Powder. On the contrary, the Calx of the Purging Salt powder'd, will, by the ſame means, run immediately into a hard Subſtance, and in a few Moments be like a Stone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lamb's-Conduit</hi> Water, mixt with Lime-Water, will in a very little time grow white, with a dark clowdy Curd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; as it will with the Purging Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44220:14"/>
But, if you mix it with Water im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with the Calx of the Purging Salt, no Muddineſs nor Colour will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>Common Water impregnated with this Salt, and afterwards evaporated, will reſtore you the whole quantity you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, without any waſte; but Lime-Water evaporated, the Salt is for the moſt part tranſmuted into a ſtony and taſtleſs Subſtance: The Cauſe of which is, that the Saline Parts of the <hi>Aqu. Calcis</hi> do ſo intimately imbrace and unite with any other Aerial Salt, that they make a third Nurtral Salt; as in Oil of Aniſſeeds and Vitriol, ſhaken together, you have a Refine, properly ſo call'd, which, if you waſh, will yield you no manner of taſte.</p>
               <p>This may be illuſtrated by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Experiment. I kept Lime-Water in a Glaſs cloſe ſtopt with a Cork, and as much in an open Veſſel, for a Week or longer; that in the ſtopt Vial had no Cream upon it; but that in the open Veſſel where the Air could freely arrive at the Water, was cover'd with an inſipid and ſtony Cream.</p>
               <p>But Water, in which the Purging Salt is diſſolv'd, kept in an open Veſſel, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44220:14"/>
many Days expos'd to the Air, will have no Cream at all on its ſurface: And that which appears in boiling the Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Waters, is not in the leaſt Calcarious, as we have formerly prov'd.</p>
               <p>Add alſo the very different ſolubility of theſe Salts; for half an Ounce of the Bitter Purging Salt will be eaſily, and without Heat or much Agitation preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſolv'd in ſix times its quantity of Water. But to the diſſolution of ſo much of the Calcarious Salt, is required two Gallons and a half of Water, which is 640 times its weight. For ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water is neceſſary to edulcorate an Ounce of <hi>Calx Vivens;</hi> which done, there remains in the bottom of the Veſſel about half an Ounce of pure white and Inſipid Calx.</p>
               <p>But the Bitter Purging Salt is eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſh'd from the fore-mention'd (if there were no other way) by its Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Virtues, as we ſhall evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, in the latter Part of this Tract, where we ſpeak of its Uſe.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, we do not deny a ſmall Portion, as well of Nitre and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salt, as of a ſtony Subſtance, may be contained, not only in the Purging Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but even in the Salt it ſelf. And,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44220:15"/>
indeed, 'tis probable that no Body, exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent in Nature, is purely ſimple. Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, every one knows, is mixt with Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or Lead; Gold, with Silver in the ſame Mine Vein; nay, and Metallick Maſs: But it does not follow, that Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Copper, or Gold and Silver, do hereby conſtitute a third Species; but the two, or more, ſeparable Metals exiſt together.</p>
               <p>Nor, can we inferr an Identity of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies from their agreement in ſome quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for Lead and Gold do ſo agree; both are ſolid, opacque, ductile, fuſible, heavy Bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore are both Metals; but nothing is Gold, that has not all the qualities of Gold.</p>
               <p>For Gold does not differ more ways, nor in a more eminent manner from Lead, than the Bitter Purging Salt is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd from all other Salts; and therefore is in its own Nature the moſt Noble.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Some additional Obſervations of the Nature of the Bitter Purging Salt.</head>
               <p>THE moſt ſpecial Qualities of this Salt, that we have already deſcrib'd, are a taſte gently and almoſt ſimply Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and of all ſorts, that we know, moſt reſembling the Cryſtals of Silver in ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of Taſte. For theſe, indeed, are bitter, but very much ſo, and not without ſome Auſterity joined with it.</p>
               <p>I have in another place obſerv'd the <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> to have ſome Qualities common with Silver, therefore I dropp'd into the Powder of this Stone ſome drops of Spirit of Nitre; and the fermentation over, I waſh'd the mixture with common Water. This Water, like the Chryſtals of Silver, is not only very ſtyptick but bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and is the only bitter Mineral that I know of, except the Salt of <hi>Luna,</hi> and the Purging Salt. But whether the Purging Salt do ariſe from any Silver Minera, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or in part ſo, or from the <hi>Lapis Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naris,</hi> or rather from any other, I leave undetermined, being never able to get any of the true Minera of this Salt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:44220:16"/>But this is very plain from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Experiments, that the Bitter Purging Salt is compounded of ſome parts in their nature Acid, and others Alkaline, and a little Lixivial.</p>
               <p>In Salts compounded of various Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the Proportion, the Nature and the Union of thoſe Principles are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd.</p>
               <p>Some Acid Particles are frequently found in Lixivial Salts, but in a ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
               <p>But in Tartar, which is the Salt of Wine, the Saline Parts are much leſſer than the Acid, which exiſt in a much greater proportion.</p>
               <p>And 'tis almoſt the ſame in the Bitter Purging Salt, with this difference only, That in the former the Acids are actually mix'd with the Alkaline, but in the latter Potentially.</p>
               <p>Moreover, all Lixivial Salts are Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious, but thoſe commonly call'd Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous are not without reaſon accounted the more gentle.</p>
               <p>As likewiſe are ſome Acid Liquors, ſuch as the Juice of Wood-Sorrel, a Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Cream of Tartar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the Purging Salt is gentler than any of theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:44220:16"/>Indeed, by Diſtillation it gives an Acid Spirit, but this Acid Taſte is not percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible till its Principles are intimately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd and divided by a moſt violent Fire.</p>
               <p>For the Salt it ſelf has neither Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nor Acidity.</p>
               <p>Nor is it Taſtleſs, but very ſubtle and biting, and therefore a moſt Efficacious Medicine.</p>
               <p>Its Admirable Subtilty will appear by its penetrating any Earthen Veſſel, if not very well Glaz'd about the bottom; of which, on the outſide, there will be a woolly or hoary Concretion in colour like an Amethyſt.</p>
               <p>The Principles of this Salt are alſo more cloſely united than in Tartar, and afford many other Remedies. For the Union is ſo firm, that one of its parts, <hi>viz.</hi> its Acid, cannot be above the one half of it ſeparated from the other, and that not without a reverberatory Fire. Whence 'tis, that when other gentle Purges frequently elude the Phyſicians expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this does very ſeldom or never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him.</p>
               <p>For ſuch Medicines do work moſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Humours of the Body, which are leaſt alterable by thoſe Humours: In
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44220:17"/>
the number of which this Salt, and other Minerals, are to be accounted.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all; This Salt, tho' it does conſiſt of different Principles, is very pure, if rightly and diligently prepar'd; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it does not retain the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth part of any extraneous Body with it ſelf.</p>
               <p>For, if you evaporate deſtill'd Water, impregnated with an Ounce of this Salt, 'twill yield not a Particle of any Heterogeneous Salt, ſtony Sediment, or Cremor, but the very ſame Ounce of moſt pure Salt.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the more General Uſe of the Bitter Purging Salt.</head>
               <p>THE Uſe of the Purging Waters of <hi>Epſom,</hi> &amp;c. is ſo excellent and manifold, and ſo very well known to <hi>London</hi> Phyſicians, that no Body can doubt of it.</p>
               <p>For in many grievous Diſeaſes, Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has prov'd 'em a moſt efficacious Remedy, endued with no unwholſom Quality; which, rationally preſcrib'd, I
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44220:18"/>
never knew attended with any unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ill Effect.</p>
               <p>One Objection there is brought againſt theſe Waters, with ſome ſhew of Reaſon; 'tis, That the Waters in boiling ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a ſtony Cremor: From whence we may fear a Matter may be ſupply'd, fit to generate the Stone in the Body.</p>
               <p>This Objection is anſwer'd by two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments; one before-mention'd; and the Second drawn from Phyſical Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations. For 'tis plain, from what we have before prov'd, That this ſtony Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor does not ariſe upon the Purging Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor upon <hi>Aqua Calcis,</hi> unleſs expos'd to the Air, and in an open Veſſel; and therefore no ſtony Subſtance can be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by the Waters in the Body.</p>
               <p>But, ſay they, the Air is mixt with the Humours of the Body. We grant it; and likewiſe with Waters; as may be demonſtrated by the Air Pump. But Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cannot petrifie without the free and open influx of the Air. Add likewiſe, That the Air cannot enter the Body, but as it were through a Strainer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Practice contradicts this, for 'tis notoriouſly known, not only to me, but to many other Phyſicians, That after drinking theſe Purging Waters plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44220:18"/>
by intervals, for 20 to 30 Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Perſons have been always free from the Gout or Stone in the Kidneys or Bladder, and enjoy'd a perfect Health. And the fore-mention'd Lord <hi>North,</hi> who drank both <hi>Epſom</hi> and <hi>Barnet</hi> Waters, live'd free from thoſe Diſtempers to 85 Years of Age.</p>
               <p>And this Lime-Waterm, which ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly proceduces a stony Subſtance by the admiſſion of the Air, is frequently and ſafely given by phyſicians. And our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-Refiner uſe it in the purifying their Sugar; by which means the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is better ſeperated from the concreſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part; and it acquires a greater fineneſs and whilteneſs.</p>
               <p>But, if the Purging Water is a good Medicine, how much more is the Salt to be accounted ſo? For, if we ſhould, for Arguments ſake, grant what is objected againſt the Waters; yet that will make not at all againſt the Salt, depurated from its ſtony Subſtance.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if the Water you take do abound with plenty of the Muriatick Salt, ſometimes it may Purge too violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but the purified Salt, which is freed from it, is of all Purging Medicines the moſt gentle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:44220:19"/>'Tis likewiſe totally free from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Quality of moſt Catharticks; it does never violently agitate the Humours, nor cauſe Sickneſs, Faintings, or Pains in the Bowels. It never fails a Phyſicians deſign in Purging the Patient; nor ever puts him in fear of a <hi>Hypercatharſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, the ſtrength of the Waters is not at all times alike; for 'tis either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd by a dry Seaſon, or diminiſh'd by a wet; 'tis ſtronger in Summer, weaker in Winter; and 'tis common for thoſe that fell them, upon occaſion, to mix 'em with common Water: From whence the Phyſician, preſcribing the uſual Doſe, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently fails of ſucceſs. But the Salt of this Water, purely and rightly prepar'd, is every Particle alike, and endued with the ſame Purging Virtue.</p>
               <p>Add to this, That the <hi>London</hi> Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do not preſcribe the Waters crude, but, for the moſt part, boiled: For taken this way, the Doſe being leſſen'd, and the Strength increas'd, they ſlip eaſier through the Stomach and Guts. In Summer you boil to the conſumption of a third, but in Winter to half the quantity; which will require two or three Hours. But the Purging Salt of the Water, diſſolv'd in any convenient Liquor, and once
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44220:19"/>
boil'd, is a Medicine always in a readineſs; accommodated to Apothecaries, chiefly to ſick Perſons, who, in urgent Caſes, ſuffer much Pain and Uneaſineſs while the Waters are ſo long a boiling, and may often times be in danger.</p>
               <p>The laſt, tho' not the leaſt, conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is, That the Water kept a little too long, eſpecially in Summer or hot Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will ſtink; but the Salt of this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, neither Age nor Place can cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt.</p>
               <p>But ſome, I foreſee, will Queſtion the wholſomneſs of this Salt, from the Acid Spirit it yields in Diſtillation; but this Objection does as much oppoſe the Uſe of the Water, as of the Salt contained in them: For the ſame Reaſon, we may as well pretend to leave off the Uſe of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Sugar, or White-Bread; every one of which, by the help of Fire, will yield a Diſtill'd Spirit violently Acid and Biting.</p>
               <p>Wine alſo, and the wholſomeſt Food, when its Principles are let looſe by Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, or any other way, do obtain Noxious, and ſometimes Poyſonous Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. Nay, even the Food of Infants, their Mothers Milk, will in a warm place preſently turn Acid; but by diſſolving the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44220:20"/>
Purging Salt in a proper Vehicle, its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are neither deprav'd nor divided, but 'tis given in its compact Body, or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Eſſence, as we are fed with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Eatables. For as the Salt it ſelf, ſo alſo the Water we drink, from which this Salt is prepar'd, is ſenſibly, tho' moderately bitter, and without any mixture of Acidity.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Method of preſcribing the Bitter Purging Salt.</head>
               <p>THis Salt may be taken Diſſolv'd in any Vehicle agreeable to the Palate, or grateful to the Taſte of the Patient; ſuch as Spring-Waters, Barley-Water, Water-Gruel, Poſſet-Drink, Whey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I do moſt commonly preſcribe common Water Boil'd, and Aromatiz'd with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Mace, to two, three, or four Pints; of which I add half an Ounce, or an Ounce, or a greater Doſe of the Salt. As for Example:</p>
               <p>Take of Spring-Water two Quarts, Mace a Dram, boil a little and ſtrain
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44220:20"/>
it; then diſſolve in the ſtrain'd Liquor an Ounce or 10 Drams of the Salt for an Apozem, to be taken in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſpace of two hours, hot, warm, and ſometimes cold, with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Exerciſe.</p>
               <p>This Apozem you may give by it ſelf, or during the Working of other Purging Phyſick. It is proper alſo, when there is occaſion, to add <hi>Senna, Manna,</hi> or both, to the Mace, to promote the efficacy of the Salt, in this or the like Form:</p>
               <p>Take Spring-Water four Pints, Mace a Dram, Senna three Drams, boil them gently, and add of the Bitter Purging Salt an Ounce, Flakey-Manna an Ounce and half, or two Ounces, and ſtrain it.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Dudley North</hi> was the firſt that drank the Purging-Waters with Milk, which did not at all agree with his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, becauſe he mix'd them cold; but Phyſicians afterwards altered the Waters, by adding Milk when they were boiling, which way, if you pleaſe, you may alſo moſt ſafely take the Salt it ſelf. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:44220:21"/>Take of the Salt an Ounce or 10 Drams, diſſolve it in 3 Pints and half, or 4, of common Water, and when it boils pour in half a Pint of Milk, and ſtrain the Curd from it.</p>
               <p>In the Summer, when Medicinal Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are every where frequented, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeate, or the Purging-Waters, taken immediately from their Springs, is the beſt Vehicle.</p>
               <p>A Dram, or a Dram and half of this Salt, taken in 3 or 4 of the firſt Glaſſes of <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> or any other Chalybeate Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the three or four firſt days, will render the Humours and firſt Paſſages better prepared for the deſign of Drinking.</p>
               <p>Chalybeate-Waters do frequently bind, which will be prevented by a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of this Salt diſſolv'd in the firſt and laſt Glaſs.</p>
               <p>But 'tis beſt of all taken in its own Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for a Dram of it, diſſolv'd in every Draught, does Purge with more certainty and a leſs quantity of Water, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is leſs burdenſom to the Stomach; 'tis ſometimes alſo very proper in Gliſters, to mix 3 or 4 Drams of it inſtead of <hi>Sal Gem.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the more particular Uſe of this Salt, and firſt of all of its Uſe in Diſeaſes of the Ventricle.</head>
               <p>WHat I ſhall now inſert of the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging-Waters and their Salt, is not from uncertain conjectures, but is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable by the daily Experience of other Learned Men as well as my own; all whom have us'd both the Salt and the Water, in the following Diſeaſes, with happy ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>And firſt of all, this Purging-Water, or its Salt, is a moſt Amicable Medicine to the Stomach, exciting an Appetite, and promoting a good Digeſtion; which it does partly by its Acid Principle, partly by the bitterneſs of the whole, or its Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaline Mixture.</p>
               <p>But chiefly from the former, becauſe it affords a Spirit in ſome ſort Analagous to the Spirit of the Salt, with which all Meats are ſeaſon'd; and alſo from the latter, for we do every day Experience the Stomach to be ſtrengthned by this, and moſt other Bitters. 'Tis alſo well known, that the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44220:22"/>
Appetite is chiefly ſtrengthned by the Uſe of Compound Salts, for almoſt all Pickles are prepar'd not with Salts alone, but with Salt and Vinegar. French Red-Wine we allow to be very wholſom with our Food, becauſe of its Tartarous Salt, of all others, the moſt Compound; and Salt of Steel, a very Compound Salt, is as Famous among Stomach-Medicines.</p>
               <p>The two Univerſal Digeſtives, Bread and Spittle, do one of them contain an Acid, and the other an Alkaline Salt, and mix'd ſupply the place of a Compound Salt.</p>
               <p>And the Natural ferment of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach conſiſts of Acid and Alkaline Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; the firſt from the Arteries, or the Blood, the latter from the Nerves, or the Excrement of the Animal Spirits, which may be prov'd by very many Arguments not here to be inſiſted upon.</p>
               <p>Therefore while there is the Natural proportion of either Salt in the Stomach, Concoction is duly performed, but when either prevail, ſometimes the Acid, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Alkaline, are neceſſary to reſtore it to its Office.</p>
               <p>When the Concoction of the Stomach is Vitiated by too much, or improper Meat and Drink, Vomiting often follows;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44220:22"/>
for the quieting which, the Bitter Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Salt, or Waters, is a moſt excellent Remedy, for the ſame reaſon that the Salt of Wormwood, and Juice of Lemons, is ſo Famous, tho' this Salt is highly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrable to it, with one ſtroke deſtroying and carrying off the Peccant Salts.</p>
               <p>Alſo in the <hi>Cardialgia,</hi> or Heart-burning, and other pains of that kind, no Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines can be more ſafe and efficacious, nor in a hot Hypocondriack Diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>In the fore-mentioned Caſes, I have ſometimes preſcribed the Purging Waters, or Salt, without any other Medicine, but more often with the aſſiſtance of other Remedies, as Bleeding, Vomiting, and the like; for 'tis not the part of a prudent Phyſician, in dangerous Diſeaſes, to truſt his Patients Health, and his own Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to one only Medicine, tho' never ſo Famous.</p>
               <p>Remedies of this kind may be infinitely varied according to the Indications. Some Forms of which I ſhall here add.</p>

But the moſt Noble, of all Remedies, is the Purging Water, or the Salt taken in this, or the like manner.</p>

                  <p>For this ſeiſes the Muſcular Parts only, and that none but the Joynts. 'Tis a ſtubborn Diſeaſe, and frequently eludes the force of many Medicines.</p>
                  <p>Bleeding muſt begin, and be repeated at leaſt every other day, to four times; and, if occaſion, to five or ſix.</p>
                  <p>After the firſt or ſecond time, a Vomit is very proper; for, as long as the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is diſordered, it daily tranſmits a new ſupply of Morbifick Matter to the Blood and Joynts.</p>
                  <p>But Catharticks, and of the ſtrongeſt, ſometimes for ſeveral days together are never to be omitted; for one ſtrong purge does often weaken this Diſeaſe, more than bleeding 3 or 4 times repeated.</p>
                  <p>But the operation of the Purging Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by the help of their Salt, when the Patient is Feveriſh, (as they almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways are) is much more gentle, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without any fermentation of the Humours, if taken in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:44220:31"/>Of the Powder of Reſinous Jallap half a Dram, Scammony prepar'd ſix Grains, Calamelany half a Scruple, with Syrup of Buckthorn; make a Bolus to be taken at five in the morning, ſleeping after it two or three Hours; and then drink the following Apozem. Of Pearl-Barley an Ounce and half, Currance three Ounces; boil in Spring-water to a Quart or 3 Pints, adding towards the latter end Mace half a Dram, and when it is ſtrain'd, of the bitter Salt an Ounce, Flakey-Manna an Ounce, or an Ounce and half. If the Patient be difficultly wrought upon, and other Indications require it, add to the firſt Draught ſix Drams, or an Ounce of the Syrup of Buckthorn, and repeat the Bolus and Apozem every 3d or 4th day, as the Phyſician ſhall Adviſe, or with longer Intervals, till the Patient be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly recovered.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning and increaſe of the Diſeaſe, at leaſt every other Night, and always after a Purge, let a proper Opiate be given to prevent any new Ebullitions of the Humours, and their Influx upon the joynts. When Purging muſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, becauſe of a Fever, or the weakneſs of the Patient, Veſicatories are apply'd above or below the Joynt with very great benefit.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Abuſe of the Bitter Waters and their Salt.</head>
               <p>'TIS the Duty of a Phyſician, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhew the Uſe of Remedies, but alſo to Admoniſh the Reader of their Abuſe, by which he prevents a treble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to himſelf, to the Patient, and the Medicine; therefore this Salt muſt not at all be us'd in ſome Diſeaſes, and in others with particular reſpect had to the Cauſes and Symptoms.</p>
               <p>In all Hydropicks 'tis hurtful doubtleſs, becauſe the Natural heat of the Blood is decayed, and the Spirits contain'd in the Grumous part of it are very poor.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in ſuch perſons, the Uſe of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44220:32"/>
moiſt things, tho' in their Food, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Influx of the Serum of the blood into the Morbid parts.</p>
               <p>'Tis alſo improper in a Synochus, where tho' the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſſen'd by Purges, yet ſuch muſt be moderately hot, as the bitter Potion, <hi>Pill Ruffi,</hi> and the like, by which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the Humours may, at the ſame time, be promoted; and therefore all things that cool too much ought to be avoided.</p>
               <p>Nor is it good for ſuch as labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Intermittent Fevers.</p>
               <p>Nor in a Chloroſis, or Green-ſickneſs, where warm Fermentations muſt be exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and becauſe the Humours are too Acid, they muſt be alter'd with ſtronger Alkalies.</p>
               <p>This Salt is alſo forbidden to all that ſpit Blood, leſt by its exquiſite Subtilty, and penetrative Force, it ſhould tear open the Mouths of the Arteries.</p>
               <p>And in the <hi>Cholera Morbus,</hi> where vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent waſtings of the Spirits do attend, as ſudden Evacuations.</p>
               <p>To the quieting ſuch turbulent and over-haſty Motions of Nature, Cordials and Opiates are to be given by intervals; but, after the Diſeaſe is tamed, if Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44220:33"/>
be needful, the Patient of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Conſtitution, whether Natural or Accidental, he may take this Salt with a good proſpect of ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>'Tis not proper for Paralyticks , leſt it more enervate the Muſcles, already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of their native Heat and Vigour. But, if the Diſeaſe ariſe from a hot Cauſe, as Wine, or Vinous Liquors, this Salt may be given ſafely and profitably to the Patient.</p>
               <p>'Tis not to be given Women with Child, without a great deal of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Nor in a ſuppreſſion of Urine, before you certainly know it does not proceed from an Ulcer of the Bladder, or a large Stone; for in both Caſes the Patient ought to abſtain from all Diureticks. Otherwiſe we have given it with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſucceſs; I mean, for the forcing away of Urine and Stones of no little magnitude.</p>
