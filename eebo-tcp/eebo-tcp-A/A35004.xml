            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis is written to go abroad amongſt the Pariſh
Teachers and their Flocks, and is ſerviceable for
them to conſider of; for the Lord God of heaven and earth
is ariſing in his mighty power to plead the caſe of the
poor and needy, and to deliver the Lambs from the teeth
of the Wolves and the Lyons who catch for the prey, and
to make a ſeparation in the flocks of the Idol Shepherds,
and behold his voyce is uttered from Zion, and his word
goeth forth from his holy habitation, who dwels in the
light, and in it is his voyce heard, which ſhakes the
earth, and makes its inhabitants to tremble.</p>
            <p>Therefore all people feare the Lord, and mind that of
him that reproves ſin &amp; evill in the ſecret of your hearts
which is the grace which hath appeared unto all of you;
but hath not yet taught all of you to deny ungodlineſſe
and worldly luſts; but in the luſts of ignorance do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
looking at a man without you to be your Teacher,
and ſo knows not the Lord to be your Teacher: And for
your ſakes who are ſimple, in whom there is any honeſt
deſires, is this given forth, that you may ſee your Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
tryed by their own rule, and found too light and too
narrow: Therefore all be warned for time to come, and

            <head>A word of
REPROOF
TO THE
Teachers of the World.</head>
            <p>THIS word is unto you, oh ye Prieſts, in vain is all
your coverings: For the light of our God is riſen,
and hath diſcovered you; and his power hath rent,
and is rending your coverings, and his contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
is proclaimed againſt you; and he hath brought forth
his little Army, which is little in your eyes, but is a mighty
hoſt in the power of his Spirit, upon whom he is fulfilling his
promiſe; that <hi>one ſhall chaſe an hundred, and ten ſhall put a
thouſand to flight:</hi> And as our fore-fathers did, ſo do we (in
this day of our God) <hi>by faith turn to flight the armies of the
aliens, and ſtop the mouths of Lyons, and obtain promiſes,</hi> &amp;c.
and you your ſelves are witneſſes in your practices; who are
not able to ſtand, but flee when ever the life of God ariſeth
in any to ſpeak to you, though in never ſo contemptible an
inſtrument in your eyes, and ſo have many hundreds of you
been put to flight without ſword or ſpear; and then you run
from your God and from your worſhip to the houſe of your
Armory, where you are fitted with the weapons of the
Beaſts warfare (as whips, ſtocks, priſons, and ſuch like) in
whoſe Army you are found fighting againſt the Lamb and
his Army; by whom you ſhall be overcome, and your carkaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
caſt into the open field. And now is your works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and great ſwelling words of vanity brought to the light,
and there tryed and judged, which is our rule to try and
judge withal: And ſeeing you ſay the Scripture is your rule
whereby things ought to be tryed and judged; you and your
works ſhall be tryed by the Scriptures alſo, that ſo you may
be condemned by both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:45480:3"/>
Firſt, ye ſay ye are Minſters of Chriſt! Nay, but ye are
his Miniſters whom ye ſerve and obey, and whoſe work ye
do; now ſin is the work of the Devill, and to deſtroy it in
the fleſh was Chriſt made manifeſt in fleſh: and you that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the deſtruction of ſin in this life, you deny it in fleſh; for
he that departeth this life, goeth out of the fleſh, and leaveth
it, and ſo you deny the work of Chriſt, whoſe Miniſters you
ſay you are; and he is no ſervant nor Miniſter of Chriſt, who
denies his work. Now read and conſider, ſin and the man of it
is againſt Chriſt; and the Miniſters of him who is againſt
Chriſt, always ſtrives to keep up, and to uphold that which
Chriſt and his Miniſters ſtrives to deſtroy and throw down,
which is ſin in the fleſh; and ſo here it is plain that you who
ſtrive to uphold ſin, uphold Anti-chriſt, whoſe Miniſters ye
are.</p>
            <p>Again, Chriſt ſaid to his Miniſters, <hi>Goe yee forth,</hi> &amp;c. But
where is your going forth? when ſome of you have purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to your ſelves places, and ſome have gained by flattery,
and ſome do hold by force &amp; tyranny a certain place, circuit,
or quarter from whence ye ſeek your gain, and there are not
aſhamed to ſue by title, as Rector, Incumbent, or Lecturer
of ſuch a place. Oh horrible! that ever ſuch ſhould ſay they
were Miniſters of Chriſt: Yea, and ſome of you can boaſt
and glory in your ſhame, ſaying in your Declarations, you
have been there in ſuch a place ſome 20. ſome 30. ſome 40,
years. Was ever ſuch a thing heard of concerning any of the
Miniſters of Chriſt? were not they approved in their Miniſtry
by tryals, by travellings, by hardſhips and dangers both by
Sea and Land, in want, in heavineſſe, &amp;c. But you have
choſen the pleaſures of ſin, and to live at eaſe in the fleſh;
but deſtruction and miſery ſhall overtake you in a day when
you are not aware, who will not be warned.</p>
            <p>Again, Chriſt ſaid to his Miniſters, <hi>All power is given unto
me, and I am with you:</hi> He did not ſay, all power is given unto
me, and I will give it to the Magiſtrates: and if any come to
oppoſe you or your Doctrine, go to him, he ſhall defend
you; but they had the witneſſe in themſelves, and the power
was with them, and is with them to the end of the world;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45480:3"/>
which ſtops the mouths of gainſayers; which power is the
power of Chriſt, which the Miniſters of Chriſt have accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to promiſe; and the power of Anti-chriſt, the Miniſters
of Anti-chriſt have, which is manifeſt in perſecuting, in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,
in tumults, and ſuch like; which power is your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
who ſay, ye are Miniſters of Chriſt, and are not; but
are Miniſters of Antichriſt, and ſo proved lyars and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and witneſſed againſt, both in the light, and by the
Scriptures.</p>
            <p>2ly. You ſay you preach the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Nay, that is not the Goſpel of Chriſt you preach, <hi>but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other</hi>
which he that bringeth is accurſed: For, <hi>the Goſpell of
Chriſt is the power of God unto ſalvation to them that believe;</hi>
but what you preach is not ſo, no not to them that believes it,
who preach that they cannot be ſaved: So if they believe
what you declare, they muſt believe they cannot be ſaved
while in this life: And ſo it is not the power nor Goſpel of
Chriſt which you preach; but the power of darkneſs to keep
all in death out of the faith, which gives victory, and
through which the creature comes to know the Goſpel, and
the power which ſaves and redeems up to God.</p>
            <p>Again, the Goſpel is everlaſting, and none can preach it
but they who have received it; but you whoſe knowledge
ſtands in carnall Arts and Sciences, and Inventions, which
came in time, and muſt periſh in time; your knowledge can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
receive the everlaſting Goſpel when it is preached unto
you, much leſſe preach it unto others: and in that knowledg
do you corrupt your ſelves and others, and are like to periſh
in your corruption together, except ye turn to the light which
was before corruption, that it may ſhew you corruption, and
lead you out of corruption, that ye periſh not; for to ſuch as
are in the periſhing way which is corrupt, the Goſpel ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
is hid.</p>
            <p>Again, that which you preach is not free nor without
charge; but the Goſpel was ſo, and is ſo &amp; as long as the force
and violence, and pride, and covetouſneſſe is found amongſt
you, which makes that which you preach burthenſome and
chargeable to the people, ceaſe calling it the Goſpel of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45480:4"/>
Chriſt; for if you do call it ſo, the light in all conſciences
condemns you, and the practice of Chriſts Apoſtles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
you, and the Scripture declares againſt you, and your
condemnation is juſt, and ſhall abide for ever.</p>
            <p>3ly. You ſay you preach the Truth.</p>
            <p>Nay, that is not the Truth you preach, for it ſets none
free; for many have abode in your doctrine and worſhip a
long time, ſome 20. ſome 40. and ſome 60. years, and yet
are not ſet free; but you have brought them to believe that
they cannot be freed, and ſo have cauſed them to erre from
the right path, and ſuch may dye in their iniquities; but
their blood will be required at your hands who have beguiled
and deceived them.</p>
            <p>But Chriſt Jeſus the light of the world, <hi>who lighteth every
man that cometh into the world, that all men through him might
beleve.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>If ye abide in the truth, the truth ſhall ſet you
free.</hi> He is the light, the true light, and the truth that ſets
free; and you who deny the light <hi>that lighteth every man that
cometh into the world,</hi> and yet ſay you preach the truth, you are
lyars, and the lake is your portion except you repent.</p>
            <p>Again, what you preach you ſell, and ſo are declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
expreſly in Scripture, ſeeing you ſay you preach the
truth: For what ſaith it? buy the truth, and ſell it not. Read
your condemnation all you who make bargains for that
which you call truth; and let the light in your own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
judge, whether you doe not deny Scripture, yea or
nay.</p>
            <p>4ly. You ſay, he that preacheth the Goſpel ought to live
of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, He unto whom the Goſpel of Chriſt is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to preach, none can hinder him of living of it, for it is
his life, and he needeth not an outward law to hold up his
livelyhood. Neither did any that ever preached the Goſpel
make uſe of any ſuch power; but their power they had, and
they have alone from Chriſt Jeſus, both from the inward and
outward ſupport: Have we not power to eat? have we not
power to drink, ſaith the Apoſtle, who was a Miniſter of
Chriſt? but he had not power to make bargains with any
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45480:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
people for a certain eſtabliſhment of a ſum of money, and
then to ſeek for an Augmentation beſides, as ſome of you do,
and then to ſue at law for default of payment; and if it were
payd, then to ſpend it in voluptuoſneſs upon his luſt as
you do: Some in the luſt of drunkenneſſe and gluttony, and
ſome in pride in ſatisfying your luſts in cloaths and in
building, and ſome in covetouſneſſe, making a god of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:
So you have choſen to your ſelves gods which ſhall
periſh with you, and they ſhall not ſave you; but your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe
and your ſhame the light hath diſcovered, who
have refuſed to be covered by it: and while ye live in pride
and gluttony, in envy and covetouſneſs, in ſtrife and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
this is not to live of the Goſpel; but this is the fruit of
the corrupt tree which is for the fire.</p>
            <p>5ly. You ſay, the Labourer is worthy of his hire.</p>
            <p>Yea, but he muſt have it of him that ſets him to work, and
hath profit by his work. Now he that worketh for one man,
and would have hire of another, who ſet him not on work,
this is unreaſonable; and ſo is it for a man to exact wages
for his work, when none hath profit by his work, as is ſeen
at this day among you Prieſts, who are out of the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and good order which moſt men beſides your ſelves are
in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>Therefore be aſhamed and amend your ways, and <hi>labour
with your hands the thing that is good, that you may come to eate
of the fruit of your labour, and be ſatisfied,</hi> and be not always
like the greedy dumb dogs that can never have enough; For
now is the day come which hath declared your work, and
you are comprehended and fathomed, and meaſured with
an equall line, and your coverings are too narrow, and the
feet of your image is ſmitten, and the ſtone is increaſing to
fill the whole earth; and then ſhall not your place be found,
and the recompence of your labor will be deſtruction, wo and
