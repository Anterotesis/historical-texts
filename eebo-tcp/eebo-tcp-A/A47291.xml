            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THough by God's Providence, which most wisely Orders all Things, I now live at a great distance from you; yet I still retain a Pastoral Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for you, and ordinarily remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you in my Prayers, and have an Heart that is truly desirous to serve you in the great Work of your Souls, and is glad when any pains of mine can prove serviceable to you therein.</p>
            <p>I remember the Labours which I have spent among you, with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sincere and good Will, tho' alass! with much weakness, in my great
<pb facs="tcp:95793:3"/>
Lord and Masters Service; and I hope also that you will not forget them. And if by tract of time, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which I have taught you have sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In those labours of my Ministry, which I took among you for a course of several years, I thank God I endeavoured to lay before you his whole Counsel, according to the best my Skill. And suited my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, to the needs of the place, and to Times and Seasons, to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess you with such Thoughts and Tempers, as I judged needfull to support your Spirits, and to direct
<pb facs="tcp:95793:3"/>
your Practice under them. And I was not silent, but warned you, yea, sometimes till I even wearied some of you with warnings, against your Spiritual Dangers, when I thought any great Danger to your Souls drew near. For you your selves know, Brethren, that I have not kept back the Truths of God from you, nor suppressed them at the times when you had most need to be put in mind thereof; tho' I found some were like to be displeased therewith, and as <hi>St.</hi> Paul says, <hi>to count me</hi>

               <hi>their Enemy for telling them these Truths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there must be a strict Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given one day, both how I have discharged my part in that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and how you have discharged yours. And my Hearts desire, and earnest Prayer for you all is, that you may, both bear in Mind all the faithful Warnings and Instructions, which according to the best of my
<pb facs="tcp:95793:4"/>
understanding, I was continually pressing upon you, and left with you; and may likewise willingly, and carefully follow them. That so, when both you and I are brought before our ever Blesled and Great Master, (as most certainly we shall be,) we may both rejoyce together; I for having been your affectionate and Faithful Monitor, and you for having afforded a willing, a mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and an obedient Ear.</p>
            <p>And now, since I am out of the may of serving you otherwise, I have sent this Companion among you, to minister to your most Serious and Holy Thoughts, and to direct and go before you, both in your Prayers, and in your Practice. And I desire, that by your frequent and considerate use thereof, you wouldturn the Hymns and Prayers contained therein, to become the familiar and genuine Sense and Language of your Hearts. Learn habtually to breathe these
<pb facs="tcp:95793:4"/>
Thoughts, and daily to live by them. And by this means you may both perfect the work of your Repentance, and preserve the Peace of your Consciences, which are the greatest and most concerning things you have to mind, and the chief things, which I earnestly pray you that you would, and hope that you will mind, all the days of your Lives. And this <hi>I</hi> shall look on, as the best, and the most obliging Return, that you can make to me for this <hi>Labour of Love;</hi> which <hi>I</hi> desire you to receive, not only as a Token of my Respect and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to you, but also as a proper means, which, by God's Blessing, may do you good, if you please.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> humbly commend it to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and Blessing of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, without which it will be of no force, either among you, or among any others. And <hi>I</hi> heartily commend you all, to the Protection
<pb facs="tcp:95793:5"/>
of his Good Providence, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the Guidance of his Grace, that he would deliver you from all dangerous Errors and Wickedness, and both make you perfect in the doing of his Will, and give you Comfort in the same. I remain, my Beloved Friends and Brethren,</p>

            <head>THE Introduction.</head>
            <p>DIrections and Helps for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, can never come out of Season. For Repentance is <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 42.</note> 
               <hi>the one thing necessary,</hi> and the chief Business of all Men in this World, and will be so whilst they live in it. The best do daily need it, to make up their daily Failures, their Defects and Forgetfulness. And the bad, have no time to delay it for one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, having deferred a great deal too long already, to shake off their sinful Habits, aud to set themselves with all their might to please God, and to secure their Everlasting Peace.</p>
            <p>Especially this time of Lent, is a Season, wherein great numbers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to make this their Business. For from the early usage and practice of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95793:6"/>
the Church, this has still been made a solemn time for Sinners to call their Sins to Remembrance, and to seek Gods Mercy and Forgiveness of the same, by earnest Prayers, and amendment of Life, and by afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themselves, and bringing forth Fruits worthy of Repentance.</p>
            <p>And to help them in so necessary and beneficial a Work, I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and published the following Offices, hoping that they may prove acceptable to my Heavenly Master, and serviceable to direct and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the Repentance, and to settle the Comfort and Peace of some of his beloved Servants, into whose Hands his Providence shall bring them.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Office for the Penitent,</hi> I have endeavoured to mark out distinctly the several Steps, and full compass of a Sinners Restauration, or Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God. Wherein I have all along interwoven instructions with their Devotions, and set their Work before them, that they may see what they have to amend, and what they are to doe to work out
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95793:6"/>
their Pardon, as well as how they are to petition for it.</p>
            <p>I have sought to make the Soul acquainted with its Disease, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it would neither know what it has for God to forgive, or for his Grace and its own Care to Remedy. And I have been very particular in some Forms of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, to affect it with a more distinct and effectual Sense of the several maladys which it lyes sick of, and which, as it must beg Mercy for, so in the Course of its Daily Care, it must both diligently and designedly set its self by God's help to Cure.</p>
            <p>Where Sin is the Disease, the great Gospel way of Cure, is true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And this I endeavour to set out, in all the necessary parts, and great and worthy Fruits thereof. I lead the Penitent to express the same in such Acts, as through the Merits of <hi>Christ,</hi> are the truest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for Sins, and have the most express promises of Mercy and Forgiveness made to them. And then I instruct him to comfort up
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95793:7"/>
himself, with an humble claim and application of those Expressions of the Divine Mercy and Condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are given to us for our Confidence and Consolation in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of those Acts, And if he takes care to say all that I have here put into his Mouth, with Sincerity, and is really affected as these forms express, he is a true Penitent, and may be a comfortable one; he has thereby secured his Everlasting Peace, and may quiet and revive his Spirit, with the joyful Sence thereof.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Tryal</hi> or <hi>Judgment of the Soul,</hi> for discovering the safety of their Spiritual Estate, I have given them as clear, and full, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all as brief a view as I can, of the final account which will be exac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of them. I have run through the several Heads of Tryal and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, and raised such questions upon them, as I take to be most perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and decisive of their future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and fittest to settle their present Peace and then give them the Benefit thereof, by setting their Answers and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95793:7"/>
God's Promises together, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all to themselves. My Desire is, so far as my Skill would reach, to omit no question which is necessary to their Safety: and my care has been, as I am able, so to word all, as that they may serve to clear their doubts and uncertainties, upon the several parts of their account, but beget none in them.</p>
            <p>And this part will be of chief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and use, to both the other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. For it is the truest Tryal of Penitents, and the truest Direction for them in carrying on and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating their Repentance. And it is the surest Ground of Peace of Conscience. For, containing the full Draught of settling our Peace with God, it must give the best Light and Direction for Peace in our Selves, which lyes in seeing that God is at peace with us.</p>
            <p>Tho' the business of these Papers is not to prove and argue, but brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly to Direct; yet to the several Heads, which I have made the <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Penitents Tryal,</hi> I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed <hi>Texts of Scripture,</hi> to shew that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95793:8"/>
God has made them the <hi>Terms of his Mercy.</hi> But 'tis not unlikely, that some who will not be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be so good as they should, will think that I am stricter about this account than I need. And if they doe, I cannot help it, but they may. My Part is to deal faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, both by my Blessed Lord, and by them; and to represent things to them, as he has left them, and as in the end they will find them. So that if my Discourse has more strictness, than they could wish to hear from it, it is because I look not how to suit their carnal wishes, but how to serve their Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting happiness. And because I would rather have them offended with me for telling them unpleasing Truths, whilst they may serve themselves by them; than flatter them with pleasing Errors, till it is too late for them to rectifie the same, and prevent their own ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Ruine and Destruction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>

In the <hi>Office for Persons troubled in Mind,</hi> I am careful to have them fully sensible of that Holy Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is needfull to keep them safe; as well as to free them from those unnecessary mistrusts and Fears, which render them uneasie. I seek to give them a just sense of the Things which trouble them, and to keep them from over-valuing them. And to make them acquainted with the true allowances of Favour, which God is ready to make to their Infirmityes, and with the several Grounds which they have to hope and look for them; and lead them on in their Devotions, both hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to plead with God, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort up their own Hearts with the same.</p>
            <p>To the Offices, I have prefixed <hi>Collections of Pertinent</hi> and <hi>proper Scriptures.</hi> And these will serve the devout Minds, to express their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in, or to support their Spirits withall; yea, and to guide and direct their Practice too. For they mark out their Duty upon the several Points which they refer to, and teach them,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95793:9"/>
not only how they may address to God, but how they ought to imploy themselves, and what the Work and Business is, which Gods Favour and their own Eternal wellfare, or which his Peace and their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at their Hands.</p>

                     <q>O! Blessed Lord, the Father of Mercys, and the God of all Comforts, I beseech thee look down in pity, and compassion upon me thy afflicted Servant.

But O! merciful God, who hast written thy Holy word for our Learning that we through Patience and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of thy Holy Scriptures might have hope; give me a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of my Self, and of thy Threats and Promises, that I may

neither cast away my Confidence in thee, nor place it any where but in thee. Give me Strength against all my Temptations, and Heal all my Distempers.

Deliver me from fear of the Enemy, and lift up the light of thy Countenance upon me, and give me Peace through the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ our Lord, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>Never suffer them, O!

                     <p>And Oh! that during this tryal, I may learn to depend intirely upon thee without whom I can do nothing. That as often as these prophane thoughts are thrown into my mind, I may find Grace to overcome them, and without the least allowance or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, to throw them out again.
