            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE Citizens and Freeholders of this City, hold our ſelves obliged to return you our hearty thanks for your exemplary Loyalty to the King, and preſent eſtabliſhment in Church and State, notwithſtanding all the Deſigns, here or elſewhere, to vilifie or ſubvert them under the ſpecious pretences of <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> hoping you will act with all expreſſions of Duty and Allegiance to the King, of whoſe good affections to his people and the eſtabliſhed Religion, we have no doubt, though ill men have indeavoured to ſuggeſt other opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to his Subjects. And, as you are our Repreſentatives, we lay before you theſe ſeverals.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That ſome expedient by Law may be endeavoured to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſuch as ſhall inſinuate into the people any deſigns in our King or Government to ſet up Arbitrary Power, or ſhall calumniate the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (His Majeſties moſt Dutiful and Loyal Subjects) as Papiſts, and men of Arbitrary Principles.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That no Laws be Repealed whereby the Church or State may be leſs ſecured againſt their Enemies, but ſuch new Laws may be added to thoſe now in force that may effectually defend them from the Horrid and Helliſh Plots of the Papiſts, and from a ſecond Ruin and Deſolation by the underhand-contrivances, and reſtleſs endeavours, of ambitious and Fanatical Parties.</p>

            <!-- PDF PAGE 24 -->
            <p n="3">III. That you preſerve the Prerogatives of the Crown, and the Propety of the People: That the King and His Succeſſors may be aſſured of our Duty and Allegiance, and we receive from them Mercy and Juſtice: Then will God bleſs us whilſt we ſerve him and his Anointed, <hi>and Righteouſneſs and Peace ſhall kiſs each other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. That you endeavour to preſerve us from illegal Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments and exactions of Fees by our Fellow-Subjects, leſt we be enſlaved under Arbitrary Power (as in the late Rebellion) contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and other good Laws; but if any ſhall offend let them be puniſhed in ſuch ſort as the Law directs.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That the King be ſupplied with money to ſecure us from the power of <hi>France</hi> at Land and Sea, that what Alliances the King hath or ſhall make for defence of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may be performed; and our Merchants encouraged to ſend forth thoſe large Adventures they are inclined unto, if they could be ſecured by good Fleets in the four Seas and remoter parts: They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at preſent greatly apprehenſive that the <hi>French</hi> may poſſeſs their Eſtates at pleaſure at Sea, as he doth thoſe of the Subjects to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire on Land, from whence cometh a Diminution of Trade in the Kingdom.</p>
