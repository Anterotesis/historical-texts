            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is a common demand, which the patrons of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Grace and free will vse to make, how God can be excused from hypocrisie, collusion and deceit, if he hath not seriously purposed and determined to conuert and call all such to whom the Gospel is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, but only to the elect?</p>
            <p>To giue a full, a cleare and satisfactory answer vnto this demand, which stumbles many: We must consider in the first place; that the glad tidings and promises of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> are proper and peculiar to the elect and chosen Saints of God, and not common to the elect and reprobates as the law is, which binds all men alike: Hence is it, that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect onely are said, <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 9. 7, 8.

               <hi>the faith of Gods elect,</hi> as being proper and peculiar vnto them alone: Christ le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus hath <note n="c" place="margin">Iohn. 17. 6, 8, 14, 17, 20, 26. Iude 3.</note> 
               <hi>bequeathed his Gospell as a peculiar legacie to his Saints and chosen ones, and deliuered and committed it to them.</hi> Wherefore the Apostles did alwaies dedicate and direct their <hi>Epistles</hi>

               <hi>preach the Gospell to euery creature,</hi> yet it is not with an intent to conuert all those that heare it vnto God, but onely the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: <hi>Paul</hi> did preach and <note n="e" place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 10.</note>

               <hi>to feede the Church, the lambes, the sheepe and flocke of Christ;</hi> who are onely the elect, as the Scriptures and the Fathers haue defined it: therefore the milke and foode of the word and Gospell is proper and peculiar vnto them. Thirdly, you must take notice, that though the Gospell be to be preached vnto euery creature, yet it is not with an intent to conuert &amp; saue all those that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> heare it preached, but only true belieuers: this is euident by that commission which Christ gaue vnto his Apostles: <note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 16, 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>Goe yee</hi> (saith he) <hi>into all the world, and preach the Gospell to euery creature, he that belieueth, and is baptized shall bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but hee that belieueth not shall bee damned:</hi> By which conditionall clause and limitation, its most apparant: that God did neuer intend that his Gospell should conuert and saue all such as heare it preached, (as is further warranted by <hi>ler.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. 26, 27, 28. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 2. 3. to 9, 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16) where God commanded his word to be preached to some that should not heare it nor obey it, nor reape any profit or conuersion from it:) but onely such as should belieue and imbrace it in their hearts. Now these are only the elect, and no others; for <note n="m" place="margin">Acts. 13 48. Iohn 10. 26. Rom 8. 30.</note> 
               <hi>they onely doe belieue:</hi> Therefore the Gospell is intended vnto them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
            <p>If this then be granted and yeelded vnto me, that the promises and glad tidings of the Gospell are proper and peculiar to the elect alone; that the ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell are sent out only to call and gather together the elect: and that the preaching of the Gospell vnto euery creature,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:27901:3"/>
is not with an intent to conuert and saue all such as heare it, but onely such as doe belieue it, who are alwaies the lesser number, and onely such as are elected: then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes ineuitably, that there is no repugnancy nor contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction betweene the secret and the reuealed will of God; and that God deludes and cozens none to whom the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is preached, though they are not conuerted: because he did neuer intend to conuert all those that should be the heaters, but only such as are the true embracers and belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of his Gospell, who are only the elect, in whom alone he workes this grace of faith.</p>
            <p>Yea but you will now obiect; that God doth seriously <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> exhort and intreate euen reprobates and wicked men to repent and beleiue, though he hath determined to giue no faith, nor yet repentance to them: therefore if they cannot repert and beleiue of themselues (as we affirme) God cannot but mocke and dissemble with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he exhorts them vnto that which they of themselues (without Gods ayde) can neuer doe: and which himselfe hath decreed irreuocably that they shall neuer doe.</p>
            <p>To this I answere, that it is true; that if God himselfe <note place="margin">Answ.</note> who knowes the hearts and estates of all men, should tell any man from heauen that he was a reprobate, and that he had irreuocably decreed it, that he would neuer worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faith or repentance in him, and should come to such a man in particular, and seriously exhort him to beleiue and repent that so he might be saued: that then there were some shew of mockery, falshood and double dealing in God: and this objection might stand good. But here the case stands otherwise: For though God doth oft times se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously exhort and intreate euen such to beleiue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, as he hath reprobated and for euer rejected in his secret purpose and decree, yet here is no delusion nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit at all. First, because the minister who is Gods agent and embassadour vnto this reprobate, can neuer deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> whether he be a reprobate yea orno: so that he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders grace and mercy to him, not as to a reprebate or cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:27901:4"/>
but as to a chosen Saint of God for ought he knowes. Secondly, because this reprobate to whom this exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and tender of grace is made, can neuer fully satisfy not yet resolue himselfe that he is a reprobate, because he was neuer priuy to Gods counsell, and because his whole life is a time of grace to him for ought he knowes. Since then it is neither reuealed to the minister that offers grace, not yet to him to whom this grace is tendred, that he is a reprobate, and that God hath determined to bestow no grace vpon him; neither the minister, nor yet himselfe can truly say that God doth mocke him or delude him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that vnto them, and to all other men, there is a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, yea and a probability, that this very reprobate may be saued, because he is no reprobate as vnto them, nor yet as to himselfe.</p>
            <p>Yea, but you will object; that God himselfe doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> know that this very reprobate neither will, no<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> can repent, because he hath decreed to worke no faith nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in him: therefore God must needes delude and mocke him, though man cannot discerne it.</p>
            <p>To this I answere; that if man cannot discerne, that <note place="margin">Answer. 1.</note> God deludes men in this his dealing; then how doth it come to passe, that you who prosecute this objection can charge God with delusion, and cousenage in his dealing, when as man cannot discerne it? what are you now tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated into Gods or Angells, that you can fathom and find out this mistery, which all the Saints and reprobates in the world cannot espie. Doubtlesse if there be neuer a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate in the world, that can say God deales falsely with him, in desiring his conuersion when as he neuer did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, because he could not satisfie himselfe whether he were a reprobate yea or no: then it is certaine, that you who make this mysticall and strange objection, must cease to charge God with collusion and double dealing, till you are able for to taxe him of, or trace him in it. Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> though God doth certainly know, that reprobates neither can nor will repent, yet he doth not mocke nor delude
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:27901:4"/>
them, by inuiting, exhorting and perswading them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, because that as God doth not inuite them to faith and repentance as they are reprobates, so his decree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation is not the immediat cause of their infidelity and impenitency, but their owne corrupt and sinfull natures, which God is not bound to heale and cure. Indeed if God himselfe should purposely bind them hand and foote in the chaines and fetters of sinne, and then should bid them go, or walke, and run on towards him in a serious and earnest manner, he might then be thought for to delude them: but this God doth not doe, he casts no rubbes nor blockes into our way, but what we cast our selues: if we come not in when as he inuites vs, it is not because God himselfe doth not inable vs, but because we haue insnared our selues in sinnes and trespasses, and disabled our selues to come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> vnto him as we ought: so that here wee must accuse our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> selues, not God. Thirdly, when God doth offer grace vnto vs, we must know, that he doth not immediately infuse this grace into vs, but he workes it in vs by the vse of meanes: now God when as he offers grace to repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, they alwaies slight, neglect and vilify the meaues by which God offers and conueyes his grace; so that if they misse of grace (as they alwaies doe) they cannot lay the blame on God, or lay, that hee did not intend for to conuert them; but they must take the blame vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; because if they had vsed the meanes with care and conscience as they ought, and done that which was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site on their parts, God would haue wrought effectually by his spirit in their hearts for ought that they could tell, or thinke to the contrary. Fourthly, when God doth seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and earnestly inuite vs to repentance and true sauing faith; he doth not alwaies promise and resolue to worke this faith and repentance in our hearts, (for then they should be alwaies wrought effectually in vs, because Gods purposed and resolued will is <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 18. 14, c. 17. 1. c. 35. 11 1 Chron 29 11, 12. 2 Chro. 20. 6, 7.

wish and desire that such a subject of his were a rich, a great and honourable person, but yet he may not purpose and resolue to make him such a one: God doth earnestly command and desire that all men (but especially his Saints) should not offend nor sinne against him; but yet he doth not purpose to cause them not to sinne: for <note n="*" place="margin">Iames 3. 2. 2 Chron, 6. 36.</note> 
               <hi>in many things wee offend all; and there is no man that liueth, and sinneth not:</hi> God may desire something in his reuealed will, which he hath not purposed nor decreed to effect and worke in his secret will: he <note n="n" place="margin">Eccch. 18. 23, 32.</note> 
               <hi>desires not the death of a sinner;</hi> and yet sinners alwaies die in sinne, without repentance: since therefore God may desire and require something in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed will, which he hath not purposed nor decreed to effect in his secret will; it followes not, that God doth therefore intend and purpose to worke effectually by his grace in hypocrites and reprobates, when as hee offers grace and mercy by his word: and so he moekes them not. Fifthly: the Gospell in which God offers grace to men, though it bee propounded in a common and vniuersall manner in respect of the hearing of it, from which none are excluded; yet it is alwaies propounded distributiuely, restrictiuely and conditionally in respect of the benefit and comfort of it; not to men as they are men; nor to all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers or reprobates, as they are hearers and reprobates; but to all those, and to those onely that shall belieue it, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, and obey it in the syncerity of their hearts. If then the Gospell be thus preached and propounded to a whole congregation, can any man say that God deludes him? If he will belieue and apply the Gospell, he shall be sure to reape the fruite and comfort of it; and so he cannot accuse God of collusion, because he hath made good his Gospell vnto him: If he beleiue and receiue it not at all, he cannot say that God deludes him, or that he did not offer it seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously vnto him; because he propounded it with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiso, if he would beleiue and apply it to his owne eternall good; which prouiso and condition he hath not yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled: and therefore he cannot blame the Lord, who did
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:27901:5"/>
not promise to fulfill it for him.</p>
            <p>Yea but say you, a reprobate may thus object: I cannot <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> receiue nor beleiue the Gospell vnlesse God giue mee an heart and will to doe it, which heart and will he hath not determined to giue me; therefore he doth but delude and cozen me in profering grace vnto me vpon such impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tearmes and conditions as these, which I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</p>
            <p>I answere, that it is true, that God must giue men hearts to imbrace and vse the meanes of grace in an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <note place="margin">Answer. 7.</note> manner, or else they cannot doe it: yet this I say with all; that euen reprobates themselues might haue done more, then now they doe, and beene more diligent in the outward meanes, had they put their whole might and strength vnto it, and prayed earnestly to God for his assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: so that they cannot truly say, that God was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto them in altering of their hearts; but that they were wanting to themselues, in being negligent in the vse of meanes, and in blocking vp their hearts against the Lord by daily sinnes. Secondly, that inability to beleiue; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and vse the meanes of grace which is in reprobates, proceedes not from any decree or act of God, but from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probatsthemselues. God made man able at the first to do his will, and to vse the means of grace; which liberty mankind hath wholly and justly lost in <hi>Adams</hi> fall: since therefore that impotency and impossibility of getting and receiuing grace which is in reprobates, proceeds not from any fatall or necessitating decree of God, but onely from that origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall deprauation and naturall imbecillity which is in them; from which God is not pleased for to free them: these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates cannot say, that God deludes and mocks them in tendring grace vnto them, though he denies them hearts and wills for to imbrace it; which he is not bound in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice for to giue them: but they must rather magnify his mercy towards them in offering grace vnto them, when as they haue made themselues vn worthy of it, and vnable to receiue it. Thirdly, what reprobate is there that when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:27901:6"/>
God doth offer grace vnto him by his ministers, can truly say that God hath positiuely resolued not to giue him an heart or will for to imbrace it? Is any reprobate priuy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods decrees, to know what he hath purposed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him? if not, then he can neuer say that God deludes him, or that he decrees to giue him no heart nor will to imbrace the grace which is thus tendred to him; because for ought he knowes, he may belong to Gods election: and if so, then God will surely change his heart, and giue him power to imbrace his grace. Fourthly, if God should offer grace to reprobates in a serious manner, yet he should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> not delude them, though he giues them no power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it: because there is in reprobates such a loue of sinne, and such an hatred, and violent antipathie against grace and holinesse, that they would be <note n="o" place="margin">See Ioh. 18. 40.

               <hi>vtterly vnwilling to receiue this grace vpon those termes that God doth offer it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had power to imbrace it:</hi> Reprobates though they might haue grace for the very taking of it, yet they would not take it though they might vpon Gods conditions: therefore God doth not delude them in tendring grace vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, though they cannot take it; because they would not take it though they might. Fifthly, God doth not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> mocke nor yet delude these reprobates in offering grace vnto them by the ministrie of the Gospell, though he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer inclines their hearts and wills to imbrace it in a sauing manner: because they haue many priuiledges, benefits, and aduantages by the Gospell, though their hearts are not conuerted nor reformed by it. For first by this profer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of the Gospell to them, they haue alwayes something to support their soules from sinking in despaire; they haue alwaies a possibility, a hope and probability of their true conuersion and saluation, which those who are depriued of the Gospell want; whence they are said to be <note n="p" place="margin">Ephes. 2. 12.</note> 
               <hi>aliens from the common-wealth of Israell, strangers from the couenant of promise, hauing no hope:</hi> Reprobates who liue vnder the Gospell haue alwaies hope till their dying day, because they know not whether they are reprobates yea or no till
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:27901:6"/>
then; which hope and comfort all such as are depriued of the Gospell want: therefore the preaching of the Gospell to them is not meerely vaine. Secondly, Reprobates who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> injoy the Gospell, haue a more cleere distinct and full ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of God, both in his essence and his glorious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, then those who are depriued of the Gospell haue: they know the will and workes of God, the worth, the nature, dignity and excellency of Christ and of his merits, and of the gifts and graces of his spirit: yea they <note n="q" place="margin">Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>tast a sweetnesse in the word and promises, and in the powers of the world to come:</hi> they know more then all the world besides, which is depriued of the Gospell: now the very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and Christ, and of their attributes, promises, word and will, and of all those things which the Scriptures doe reueale vnto reprobates, is an vnualuable and match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse blessing; it is a greater good and happinesse then man by all the light of art and nature (without the Scriptures) can attaine vnto: therefore no reprobates can say that God deales hardly or falsly with them though his word doth not conuert them. Thirdly, Reprobates though they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not conuerted by the Gospell, haue alwaies as <note n="r" place="margin">Iob. 21. 7. to 17. Psal. 73. 3. to 13.</note> 
               <hi>great, (nay sometimes a greater) share and portion in those outward bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and priuiledges</hi> which the Gospell brings (which are great and many) as the Saints themselues: The Gospell commonly brings peace and plenty, health and safety, and all outward happinesse and tranquillity with it: it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies accompanied with many great and excellent bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of which reprobates drinke as deepe as any others: therefore it is not altogether in vaine vnto them, though it conuert them not. Fourthly, Reprobates though they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> are not truly sanctified not called by the Gospell, yet many of them haue oft times many morrall, outward and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable vertues, gifts and graces wrought within them by it: Againe, many of them are oft times ciuilized, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, rectified and reformed by it, so that they runne not into the same excesse of sinne and wickednesse as else they would; by which it comes to passe that their eternall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:27901:7"/>
in hell fire are much extenuated and abated: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot truly say, that the Gospell is ineffectuall and fruitlesse to them, because their very soules reape much aduantage by it. Fifthly, Reprobates haue oft times many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> sodaine, transitory and flashy joyes, and many good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, purposes and resolutions wrought within them by the word; yea the word of God is sometimes so preualent and powerfull in their soules, that it makes them to doe <note n="s" place="margin">Mark. 6. 10. Matth. 7. 22. See Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> how far a repro bate may goe.</note> 
               <hi>many things</hi> for God, and to goe very farre in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward practise and profession of religion; insomuch that they seeme to many to be the elect of God, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted members of Iesus Christ: so that the Gospell is not altogether in vaine vnto them, because it workes some good vpon them, though it conuert them not. Sixthly, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> by meanes and vertue of the Gospell which is preached to them, doe injoy the society and company of Gods elect and chosen Saints, by meanes of whom their soules and bodies doe oft times fare the better. Its no small benefit or blessing to injoy the company of Gods elect: for as their company is louely, comfortable, sweete, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, innocent, mild and harmelesse; so it is a meanes of keeping many judgements from, and pulling downe many blessings vpon reprobates and cast-awayes: It is common in the Scriptures, and ordinary in experience, that God sometimes <note n="t" place="margin">Gen 30. 30. c. 39. 5. 21, 23.</note> blesseth reprobates, and <note n="v" place="margin">Gen. 18. 23. 10 33.</note> keeps of judgements from them for the godly mens sake that liue among them: wherefore though the Gospell doth not conuert them to the Lord, yet it is not in vaine vnto them euen in this respect. Seuenthly, Reprobates who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> liue vnder the Gospell are sometimes made the instruments and meanes of good to others, and the furtherers of Gods glory, though they doe no good to themselues: Kings, ministers, magistrates, schollers of all sorts, artificers, and the like, though they are such as God hath rejected, are oft times made the instruments of much good vnto the Saints, the executioners of Gods will, and the aduancers of his glory; which brings much joy and comfort to them
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:27901:7"/>
for the present, and gaines respect and honour to them in the sight of men: since therefore reprobates injoy so many blessings, priuiledges and comforts by the Gospell as these here mentioned, they haue no cause to say that God deludes and mockes them, when as he sends the Gospell to them; because though he giues no inward efficacy nor power to it, to conuert and saue their soules, yet he deriues many outward blessings, comforts, priuiledges and fauors to them by it, for which their soules and bodies fare the better.</p>
            <p>If you now object, that the Gospell aggrauates the sins <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> of reprobates, and makes their condemnation greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it leaues them without excuse: therefore they are no gainers, but losers by the Gospell.</p>
            <p>I answere, that it is true, that it had bin better for some <note place="margin">Answ.</note> reprobates, yea for all those reprobates that goe on in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and rebellious courses without restraint, that they had neuer injoyd the Gospell by reason of their disobedience to it: but as for others who are reclaimed by it, though it aggrauates their condemnation one way, in adding to the greatnesse of their sins; yet it extenuates it another way, in detracting from the multitude and number of their sinnes, which they would haue doubled and trebled, had not the ministry and preaching of the word restrained them: so that they are farre greater gainers in this last respect, then losers by the first: All reprobates fare the better for the Gospell here, in regard of those many outward blessings and priuiledges that accompany it; many of them speede the better for it not onely here but hereafter to: those that fare the worser for it, it is from their owne defaults, they might haue vsed it better if they would themselues, in hauing more care and conscience to practise and obey it: so that the Gospell is a blessing to them all, though it proues a curse and condemnation vnto them through their own defaults. Lastly, though God doth not giue men power <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> to beleiue and receiue his Gospell, yet he doth not delude them though he offers it vnto them with a desire that they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:27901:8"/>
should receiue it: for as God doth not delude men in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning them not to sinne, and to obserue his law in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point, though he giues them no power nor strength to doe it, and though it be <hi>impossible for them to fulfill it;</hi> no more can he be said to delude or mocke men in offering grace vnto them by the Gospell, though he giues them no power to receiue it: because hee commands them no more then they had strength at first to doe, which strength and power they lost through their owne defaults: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the end of this command is to no other purpose but to cause men for to see their owne disability, and so to fly to him for strength, for grace and mercy.</p>
            <p>But you will now demand of me, if the Gospell doth truly and of right belong to none but the elect, if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerts <note place="margin">Quest.</note> and saues none else but they, why then is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded so generally to all, to reprobates as well as others? If it were proper and peculiar to the elect alone, it should be preached to none else but they.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, that the Gospell is thus generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <note place="margin">Answer.</note> vnto all, not because it belongs alike to all, or because God intends that it should be alike effectuall vnto all; but because it is the will, the pleasure and command of God, that it should be thus propounded: as is euident by <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 5, 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. 47. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 3. to 24. <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 6. 21. Now the reasons wherefore the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is thus generally propounded vnto all, though it be principally intended for the conuersion and saluation of the elect alone, are these. First, because reprobates are <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 13. 24. to the end.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <hi>intermixed</hi> and mingled with the elect, as the weedes and tares are with the corne and grasse, as the chaffe is with the wheate, and as the stones are with the mellow ground: now as the rain doth oftimes fall vpon the tares, the weeds and stones, as well as on the corne, the grasse, and mellow ground, not because it is principally intended vnto them, but because they are intermixed with the grasse, the corne, and fertile ground: and as the <note n="*" place="margin">Mute. 3. 12.</note> 
               <hi>fanue</hi> doth blow vpon the chaffe as well as on the wheat, because its mixed with the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:27901:8"/>
wheate, though <hi>it seatters the one, and purgeth the other:</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so the pleasant showers and breathings of the Gospell doe oft times <note n="b" place="margin">Heb 6. 4 to 9. Alat. 13. 3. to 24</note> 
               <hi>fall on reprobates and wicked men,</hi> (who are compared to weedes, to tares, to rockes, and chaffe throughout the Scripture) not with a determinate purpose to conuert and saue them; but because they are mingled with the elect and chosen Saints of God, (who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to wheat, to corne, to good and mellow ground,) for whose effectuall calling and conuersion they are only sent. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Gospell is thus generally propounded to all that will imbrace it, and not to the elect alone; because the ministers of the Gospell being but fraile and silly men as others are, and not able to discerne into the secret counsell and decree or God, cannot distinguish betweene the elect and reprobates: <note n="*" place="margin">August, dc Ciu. Dei lib. 21. e. 24. Si de aliquibus i. ta Ecclesia certa esset, vt qui sunt illi etiam noscet, qui licet adhuc in vita sine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituti, tamen predestinati sane in aeternum igne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ir e cum Diabolo: twn pro tis non ordret, quam nec pro ipso &amp;c.</note> If the ministers could discerne betweene the elect and reprobates, betweene those that would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and willingly receiue the Gospell, and such as would reject it, they might then propound the Gospell to the elect alone; but because they know not who are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen and elected, nor who are reprobated: therefore they must preach the Gospell vnto all, that so those who are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected may be effectually called and conuerted out of all. Thirdly, the Gospell must be thus propounded, because else it would be vaine and ineffectuall vnto all; for if the Gospell should be pronounced to the elect alone, (as he that is elected shall be saued;) then no man could apply it to his owne soule; for before a mans conuersion vnto God, he can neuer truly say that he is elected: yea the very elect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> themselues can neuer say that they are elected, till they find the blessed fruites of election in their hearts, which are wrought by the preaching of the word: so that if the Gospell should be preached to the elect alone, it would be ineffectuall, vaine and idle; because no man could then <note n="c" place="margin">Hebr. 4. 2. 3.</note> apply it to himselfe: therefore it is propounded generally vnto all, that so men might be able to apply it. Fourthly, the Gospell must be thus propounded, that so no man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> whiles he liueth here might haue cause to despaire of Gods <note n="d" place="margin">1 Pet. 1, 13.</note>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:27901:9"/>
mercy: If God should cull out his elect from among the reprobates, and make an open diuision and seperation of them here, preaching the Gospell vnto them alone, then all these reprobates must needes despaire of his grace, and runne into some desperate course, knowing that they are designed and marked out for hell: but now when as the Gospell is thus generally propounded vnto all, it alwaies nourisheth some hope in reprobates, and keepes them from despaire. Fifthly, the Gospell is thus generally preached <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> vnto all, that so reprobates who wilfully disobey, reject, and slight it, <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 1. 20 E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zech 2. 3. Iohn 15. 22. Math. 10 18. cap. 24. 14. 2 Cor. 2. 15, 16.</note> may be left without excuse, laying all the blame vpon themselues, and not on God, who was not wanting to them in the meanes. Sixthly, the Gospell is thus generally propounded vnto all, though it becomes not effectuall vnto all, because the Saints of God who are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> conuerted by it, may haue greater cause to loue, to blesse <note n="f" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9. Eph. 1. 5, 6, 11, 12.</note> and praise the Lord for making it effectuall vnto them, when as he hath not made it so to others. Seuenthly, it is thus propounded vnto all, because it is a <note n="g" place="margin">Gal 6. 16. Ro. 3. 27. cap. 7. 25. Psal. 119. 9.</note> 
               <hi>rule of life</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> to reprobates as well as others, though it be no salue nor plaister to them for to heale their soules: the Gospell though it workes not grace in all, yet it is a square and rule of life to all that heare it; and it is that by which they shall * <hi>be iudged at the last:</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Iohn. 12. 48.

Eighthly, it is thus propounded vnto all, <note n="i" place="margin">See Ephes. 7. 5. to 11. Phil 2. 9, 10, 11. 2 Cor. 2. 14, 15, 16.</note> that so the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> riches of Gods loue and mercy to mankind in Iesus Christ his sonne, and all <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

reuerence and adoration in the hearts of men: there ore it is thus preached vnto all. Ninthly, it is propounded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> all because it workes effectually on many reprobates, though not to turne them wholly and fully to the Lord, yet to conuert them from their <note n="l" place="margin">1 Thess. 1. 9. 10</note> 
               <hi>atheisme, their paganis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, idolatries,</hi> prophane and dissolete courses, and from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other sins, into which they would haue plunged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, had not the Gospell pulled them backe: we know it by experience, that the Gospell works very far on many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates; it makes them <note n="m" place="margin">Marke 6. 20.</note> 
               <hi>doe much, and part with many sins:</hi> and though it neuer workes so rarre as thorowly to change and saue their soules, yet it brings them nearer to saluation then else they could haue come: it makes their condemnation lesse by lessening of the number of their sins. Tenthly, the Gospell must be thus propounded, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> so those reprobates that heare it might <note n="n" place="margin">Matth 5 25.</note> 
               <hi>inioy the outward blessings</hi> and priuiledges which it brings, as well as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: which they could neuer do, if it were propounded to the elect alone Eleuenthly, the Gospell is thus propounded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> vnto all, that so reprobates as well as others might <note n="o" place="margin">Matth. 24. 14.</note>

Matth. 24. 14.</note> acknowledge God and Iesus Christ as well as others: If the Gospell had bin preached to the elect alone, then many who professe the Gospell acknowledging the deity of God and Christ, and the truth and holinesse of the Gospell, had layen still in darknesse, and in their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish rites, and superstitious worshipping of Diuells, stockes, stones, and other creatures for Gods, and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing fabulous, blasph mous, absurd and idle poems and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories of their Idoll-Gods, for sound diuinity; by which the glory of God and Christ, and the truth and testimony of the Gospell should haue bin much ecclipsed: God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commands the Gospell to be propounded vnto all, and not to the elect alone, that so all <hi>men might come to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of his truth</hi> and deity, for the greater manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> of his glory.

deales justly in rejecting them, and in inflicting vengeance on them for their sins: when a reprobate by the light of Gods holy word shall see what he hath lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> and what corruption he hath drawne from his Ioynes; when he shall discouer by the brightnesse of the word, the greatnesse bulke and infinite multitude of his sins; then he is euen for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <note n="r" place="margin">Ps. 64. 8. 9.

               <hi>speachlesse,</hi> so that he hath nothing to reply against God; but willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly submits vnto his doome, as being scarce proportionable to his sinne: so that there is great reason why the Gospell should be thus propounded vnto all, though it conuerts not all that heare it. Thirteenthly, the Sacraments are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> vnto all, to <note n="t" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 27. 28, 29, 30.</note> reprobates as well as to the elect: reprobates are baptized, and receiue the Sacrament of the Lords supper as well as any of Gods chosen ones: it is fit therefore that the Gospell should be extended vnto all as well as the Sacraments, because they are both of the same extent and latitude, and goe hand in hand together, like twins that cannot be diuided. Lastly, the Gospel is thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> vnto all, because it hath a seuerall effect in all; though not to saue &amp; conuert all those that heare it: To the elect, it is the <note n="v" place="margin">Rom. 1 16.

               <hi>oftimes of their obduration &amp; greater condemnation,</hi> by reason of their contempt and neglect of it. Since therfore the Gospell hath a work in reprobats as well as in the elect, it is propounded to them both; yet not as vnto elect and reprobates, nor in absolute &amp; posiciue terms, but as to men who are capable of grace &amp; saluation, if they repent, &amp; belieue that Gospell which is preached to them, and of damnation if they do reject it: And thus you see this grand objection cleared, That God is no deluder nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor, though he hath not purposed nor decreed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert and call all such to whom the Gospell is preached.</p>
