            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN <hi>Page</hi> 154. after an <hi>Appendex</hi> annexed by the <hi>Publiſher,</hi> read thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judicious Reader,</hi> It appears in the firſt impreſſion of Mr. <hi>Lilburnes</hi> Tryall, that in the <hi>Appendix</hi> the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man profeſſeth, he hath been very indifferent in tranſcribing his notes, without maliciouſly wronging either the Court or the Priſoner; yet if any thing be amiſſe, he hopes the ſecond Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may mend it, if more exacter Copies then his can be got, deſiring that ſome man that underſtands the Law, will take ſome paines to write ſome Obſervations in Law upon it, and truly being at that Tryall, I have done ſomething in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars deſired, and here muſt adde a little more (leaving the abſolute compleating of it to abler pens and heads) in caſe Mr. <hi>Lilburn</hi> had been found guilty by the <hi>Jury</hi> as to matter of fact; and thereupon they had delivered up to the <hi>Judges</hi> a ſpeciall Verdict; this or the like at the Barre, might have been a good Plea for him, after the Court had asked him what he would ſay for himſelf, why Judgement ſhould not have paſt upon him, he might have anſwered <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

            <p n="1">1. That Sheriffe <hi>Wilſon</hi> is a Member of the Parliament and Councell of State, and thereby a party, in which regard the return of his Grand-Jury by him or his dependant Officers is null and void in Law, and ſo by conſequence is alſo their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.</p>

            <p n="3">3. He ought to enquire whether any one of the <hi>Jury</hi> be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed, and if any one of them were; it totally nulls and makes void the Indictment and all things depending upon, as is clear by 13. <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He might alleadge, that he conceived the Indictment was inſufficient in Law, and that he never heard nor ſaw it, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Lattine,</hi> and whether that he heard read to him in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> be rightly tranſlated he knowes not, for that he knowes the <hi>Lattine</hi> tongue cannot be rendred word for word in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>; and therefore in Arreſt or ſtop of Judgement he might preſſe, that Councell learned in the Law might be aſſigned him, and a Copy of the Indictment given them to peruſe; for that firſt there doth to him further appeare theſe errors in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he was Indicted in <hi>London,</hi> for pretended crimes done in <hi>Surrey</hi> and <hi>Middleſex</hi>; and therefore the Tryall or <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> not coming out of the right place, the Indictment is void in Law. <hi>See Arundels Caſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He might alledge, that he was Indicted upon a miſtaken Statute, which bears date after the pretended facts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore void in Law.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He might alleadge, that the offence in the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not certainly alleadged as to matter, time, and place, and that he had not a right addition or title, all which in Law ought to be.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Alledge that the Statute whereupon the Indictment of treaſon is grounded, is inſufficient in Law to ground a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon, for that it ſaith, that whoſoever doth ſuch an act ſhall ſuffer the paines of death, &amp;c. as in caſe of High Treaſon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48226:2"/>
hath been uſed, now the paines of death were not uſed in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of treaſon at the making of that act, nor for divers yeares before, read the margent before in <hi>page</hi> 91.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Alleadge that in the Indictment it is not alleadged againſt whom this Treaſon is committed, onely againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (and there may be ſeverall ſorts of Governments) or the Keepers of the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> but who they are, or where they are to be found, is not named, and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible he can owe Allegiance to thoſe unknown <hi>individua vaga,</hi> and where there is no Allegiance due, there no Treaſon can be committed in Law; for no man can owe Allegiance to an unknown man, or unknown number of men, or to an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topian</hi> Common-wealth.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He might alleadge, that there was not two plain and evident Teſtimonies to each of thoſe facts, upon which the Grand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt found the Bill, and therefore their Verdict is void in Law.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He might alleadge, the Inqueſt in Law could not return <hi>billa vera,</hi> a true Bill, unleſſe they had found all the parts of the Bill to be true; which they never did, nor poſſibly could do, in regard there was not one amongſt all the Grand Inqueſt, that could exactly read and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or underſtand the Bill: ſo there was errors enough in the finding of it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He might alleadge that in the body of the Indictment it is ſaid, fight no more for the men in preſent Power (and the next words ſaith) meaning the preſent Government; this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be good in Law, for that men are Governours and not Government, neither doth he name the men in preſent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and there are ſeverall kinds of Powers; yea, the Army as properly as the Parliament may be called preſent Power.</p>
            <p n="9">9. He might alleadge, that Treaſon ſignifies a breach of Truſt, and comes from <hi>Trahit,</hi> which is treacherouſly to betray, now his truſt, which was his liberty, his freedom and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection by the Law, was by his impriſonment (in <hi>March</hi> laſt for treaſon) taken off or taken away from him; and therefore having then no truſt upon him (as in his impriſonment he had not) he could not in that condition commit Treaſon, but all the things laid unto his charge by Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> the Attourney Generall in the Indictment, are facts done, or pretended to be done after his commitment to priſon for Treaſon; which facts
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48226:3"/>
or actions are all void in Law, and cannot in the leaſt in the eye of the Law, come within the compaſſe of Treaſon, which is treacherouſly to betray, which cannot be done where there is no truſt; but in Mr. <hi>Lilburnes</hi> impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there was no truſt upon him, and therefore in that condition he could commit no Treaſon, and the higheſt agravation of the Attourney Generalls ignorance and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice it was, in that he in his Proſecution of Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> evads, or paſſeth by all thoſe things pretended to be done by him, for which Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> was firſt committed; yea, and ſends for him about ſeven or eight Moneths after his firſt impriſonment, to come to him in order to his Tryall for Treaſon, and then friendly in ſhew diſcourſeth with him; and afterwards at his Arraignment for his life, brings that diſcourſe or ſome part of it, as the principall Facts of Treaſon, or evidence for Treaſon that he had againſt him; therefore can there be greater ignorance in any man that profeſſeth the knowledge and underſtanding of the Law, thus to do, or greater malice in the moſt maliciouſt of men then in this (empty Tub) <hi>Prideaux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the more clearer confirmation of my foregoing obſervations, or the moſt of them, I ſhall deſire the Reader to caſt his eye upon the third part of <hi>Cookes Inſtitutes, Chapters</hi> high Treaſon &amp; petty Treaſon (which book is publiſhed by the houſe of Commons this Parliament for good Law) but I ſhall ſpeciall recommend to the Reader as his ſpeciall guide, in caſe he come into Mr. <hi>Lilburnes</hi> ſtraits, his Chapter of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell learned in Pleas of the Crown, <hi>follio</hi> 137. where he ſpeaks expreſly thus.</p>
            <p>Where any perſon is Indicted of Treaſon or Fellony, and Pleadeth to the Treaſon or Fellony, not Guilty; which goeth to the Fact beſt known to the Party. It is holden that the Party in that Caſe ſhall have no Counſell to give in evidence or alleadge any matter for him: but for as much as <hi>Ex facto Jus Oritur,</hi> it is neceſſary to be explained,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48226:3"/>
what matters upon his Arraignment, or after not Guilty Pleaded, he may alleadge for his Defence, and pray Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell Learned in the Law, to utter the ſame in forme of Law.</p>
            <p>And firſt, upon the Arraignment what advantage he may take, in caſe of High Treaſon by the Common Law; if it be for compaſſing the death of the KING, he may alleadge, that in the Indictment there is no ſuch overt act ſet down in particular, as is ſufficient in Law, or the like. For it is to be obſerved, that in no caſe the party Arraigned of Treaſon or Fellony, can pray Counſell learned generally, but muſt ſhew ſome cauſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In caſe of High Treaſon by force of any Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, he may alleadge, that the Indictment being ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a Statute; the Statute is either miſtaken or not purſued.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Of what matters he may take advantage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually concerning them both. He may alleadge, that there was not at the time of the Indictment of High Treaſon, two lawfull Accuſers, that is two lawfull Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Of what matters he may generally take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in all caſes of Treaſon and Fellony. He may alleadge, that the offence is not certainly alleadged in reſpect of the matter, time, and place, or that he is not rightly named, or have not a right addition, or that the offences were done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt generall pardon.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, After he hath Pleaded Not Guilty, what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he may take upon the evidence. He may alleadge, that he ought to have two lawfull Witneſſes in caſe of High Treaſon, to prove the fact againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48226:4"/>Sixthly, He may take advantage in Arreſt of Iudgement, if the verdict be found againſt him; That the triall came not out of the right place, as it fell out in <hi>Arundels</hi> caſe, convicted by a Jury of wilfull murder; he informed the Court, that the Iury that tried him came out of a wrong place, and thereupon he had counſell learned aſſigned him; who indeed found, that the <hi>Venire facias</hi> was miſ-awarded, and the Court thereof by the Councell being informed, judgement was ſtayed. And that the priſoner may alleadge theſe or the like matters, it is evident; becauſe for every matter in law ariſing upon the fact, the priſoner ſhall have Councell learned aſſigned him. Alſo it is lawfull for any man that is in Court, to informe the Court of any of theſe matters, leſt the Court ſhould erre, and the priſoner unjuſtly for his life proceeded with. And the reaſon wherefore regularly, in caſe of treaſon and felony, when the party pleads not guilty, he was to have no councell, was for two cauſes. Firſt, for that in caſe of life, the evidence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict him ſhould be ſo manifeſt, as it could not be contradicted. Secondly, the Court ought to ſee that the Indictment, Triall, and other proceedings, be good, and ſufficient in law, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ſhould by their erronious judgement attaint the priſoner unjuſtly. So far Sir <hi>Edward Cook.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now if any ſhould ſay, all this availes nothing, in caſe the Parliament takes away Juries, and ſets up Arbitrary high Court of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> as already in their Act for the Earle of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> drayning of the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> and they have done.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, It's true, it avails nothing, indeed if they ſo do, but it is impoſſible they ſhould; my reaſons are firſt, becauſe it is the moſt equalleſt and juſteſt way of triall in it ſelfe, ſimple conſidered, that is, in the whole World, and hath been of ſo long continuance in this Nation, that all the changes of turning the Nation upſide down, could never alter it, either by the Conqueſt of the <hi>Romans, Saxons, Danes,</hi> or the late <hi>Normans:</hi> and though ſince <hi>William</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours time, ſome Princes, and their Fathers have attempted the Alteration, and overthrow of that juſt way of triall, by twelve men as the Neighbour-hood, yet it hath proved very fatall &amp; deſtructive to thoſe that were buſied in it, witnes <hi>Empſon, Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's</hi> loſing their heads, as Traitours, therefore although they had an Act of Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>chap.</hi> 3. to bear
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48226:4"/>
them out in what they ſo did, and therefore it is un-imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in meer policy the Parliament will run the hazard of ſuch an attempt, the which, when it is executed, the people are as abſolute ſlaves, as poſſible can be, and have no probable cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty either for their lives, liberties, or eſtates; of which caſe Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> in his expoſition of the twenty ninth <hi>chapter</hi> of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> in his ſecond part Inſtitutes from 51. thus ſaith upon the words, <hi>by the Law of the Land,</hi> that is to ſay, ſaith he, by the Law of <hi>England</hi>; and hereupon all Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are grounded, wherein is this clauſe, To do what is juſt according to the Law and Cuſtome of <hi>England,</hi> and it is not ſaid, the Law and Cuſtome of the King of <hi>England,</hi> left it might be thought to bind the King onely; nor the People of <hi>England,</hi> left it might be thought to bind them onely; but that the Law might extend to all, it is ſaid, <hi>by the Law of the Land,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>England.</hi> And a little below he expreſly ſaith, againſt this ancient and fundamentall Law, and in the face thereof, I finde an Act of Parliament made <hi>(viz.</hi> 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>chap.</hi> 3.) that as well Juſtices of Aſſize, as Juſtices of Peace (without any finding or preſentment, by the verdict of twelve men) upon a bare information for the King, before them made, ſhould have full power, and authority, by their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions to hear, and determine all offences, and contempts committed, or done by any perſon, or perſons, againſt the former ordinance, and effect, of any Statute made, and not repealed, &amp;c: by colour of which Act, ſhaking this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Law, it is not credible what horrible oppreſſions, and exactions, to the undoing of infinite numbers of people, were committed by Sir <hi>Richard Empſon,</hi> and <hi>Edmund Dudley,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juſtices of Peace, throughout <hi>England.</hi> And upon this unjuſt and injurious Act (mark that well) (as commonly in like caſes it falleth out) a new office was erected, and they made Maſters of the Kings forfeitters.</p>
            <p>But at the Parliament holden in the firſt year of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. This Act of 11. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. is recited, and made void, and repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and the reaſon thereof is yielded, for that by force of the ſaid Act, it was manifeſtly known, that many ſiniſter, and crafty, feigned, and forged informations, had been purſued againſt divers of the Kings Subjects, to their great damage, and wrongfull vexation: and the ill ſucceſſe hereof, and the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48226:5"/>
fearfull ends of theſe two oppreſſours, ſhould deter others from committing the like, and ſhould admoniſh Parliaments, that inſtead of this ordinary and pretious triall, <hi>by the Law of the Land,</hi> they bring not in abſolute and partiall trialls by diſcretion; whoſe Indictment for high Treaſon you may read in his third part Inſtitutes <hi>Fol.</hi> 208. and fourth part. <hi>Fol.</hi> 198, 199.</p>
            <p>And in the fourth part of his Inſtitutes <hi>Fol.</hi> 37. <hi>Chapter,</hi> high Court of Parliament, ſpeaking of the manner of ſome proceedings of Parliament, in ſome caſes of Attainder, let for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe take it away if it can, if not, however, let it be buried in ſilence, for the more high and abſolute the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Court is, the more juſt and honourable it ought to be in the proceeding, and to give example of juſtice to inferiour Courts.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>Fol.</hi> 39.40. <hi>ibid.</hi> he further ſaith, and where by order of Law, a man cannot be attainted of high Treaſon, unleſſe the offence be in Law high Treaſon by Authority of Parliament, (as ſometime hath been uſed) but the high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ought to be ſpecially expreſſed, ſeeing that the Court of Parliament is the higheſt and moſt honourable Court of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> and ought (as hath been ſaid) to give example to inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Courts.</p>
            <p>There was an Act of Parliament (ſaith he) in the eleventh year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, which had a fair flattering preamble, pretending to avoid divers miſchiefs, which were. Firſt, To the high diſpleaſure of Almighty God. Secondly, The great let of the Common Law. And thirdly, The great let of the wealth of this Land, as hereafter (he ſaith) ſhall manifeſtly appear; which Act he there at large recites, after which in <hi>Fol.</hi> 41. he further thus ſaith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By Pretext of this Law</hi> Empſon <hi>and</hi> Dudley <hi>did commit upon the Subject unſufferable preſſures and oppreſſions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Statute was juſtly ſoon after the deceaſe of</hi> Henry <hi>the ſeventh, repealed at the next Parliament, after his deceaſe, by the Statute of</hi> 1. Hen. 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>A good Caveat (ſaith he) to Parliaments to leave all cauſes to be meaſured by the golden and ſtraight met-wand of the Law, and not to the uncertain and crooked Cord of diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for, it is not almoſt credible to fore-ſee, when any maxime,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48226:5"/>
or fundamentall Law of this Realm is altered (as elſe-where hath been obſerved) what dangerous inconveniences do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, which moſt expreſly appeareth by this moſt unjuſt and ſtrange <hi>Act</hi> of 11. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. For hereby not onely <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> themſelves, but ſuch Juſtices of Peace (corrupt men) as they cauſed to be authorized, committed moſt grievous and heavy oppreſſions, and exactions, grinding of the face of the poore Subjects by penall Lawes (be they never ſo abſolute or unfit for the time) by information onely without any preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or triall by Iury, being the ancient birth-right of the Subject, but to hear and determine the ſame by their diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inflicting ſuch penalty, as the Statutes not repealed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Theſe and other like oppreſſions and exactions by, or by the means of <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley,</hi> and their Inſtruments brought infinite Treaſures to the Kings Cofers, whereof the King himſelfe in the end, with great griefe and compunction repented, as in another place we have obſerved.</p>
            <p>This Statute of 11. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. (ſaith the Lord <hi>Cooke</hi>) we have rented and ſhewed the juſt inconveniences thereof, to the end, that the like ſhould never hereafter be attempted in any Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and that others might avoid the fearfull end of thoſe two time-ſervers, <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley. Qui eorum veſtigia inſistunt, eorum exitus perhorreſcant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My ſecond Reaſon why its impoſſible the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould overthrow Tryals by Juries, is becauſe then they ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the chief declared end of all the late Warres, and of the whole ſtream of all the chiefeſt Declarations; now the main and principall end of all the Warres they pretended, was for the Peoples Liberties and Freedoms, amongſt all which they reckon Tryalls by Juries one of the chiefeſt, as clearly in their firſt grand <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> &amp;c. appeareth, and therefore it was that in their 7<hi>th.</hi> Article, they impeached the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> as a Traytor, for ſubverting the fundamentall Lawes of the Land, in giving judgement upon mens Eſtates, without Tryalls of Juries, yea, and they ſhould not onely deſtroy their chiefeſt <hi>Declarations,</hi> but alſo the chiefeſt and beſt Lawes of the Land, <hi>viz.</hi> the 29. Chapter of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and that excellent Law of the <hi>Petition</hi> of <hi>Right,</hi> as they themſelves call it in their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> of the 17. of <hi>March</hi> 1648. page 7. And if ſo, <hi>query,</hi> whether their ſo doing would not be as high a breach of truſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48226:6"/>
in them as ever they charged the <hi>King</hi> with, and deſerved as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a puniſhment to be inflicted upon them, as ever they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon the King, for the breach of his truſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They cannot overthrow Tryals by Juries, without an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and evident ruine and deſtruction to themſelves and the whole Nation, by a freſh imbroyling it again in Warres, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſince they took off the <hi>Kings</hi> head, for breach of his truſt, they have ſolemnly declared in two ſeverall <hi>Declarations, viz.</hi> the 9. of <hi>February,</hi> 1648. and the 17. of <hi>March</hi> 1648. that they are fully reſolved, and ſhall and will uphold, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and keep the fundamental Lawes of this Nation; for, and concerning the preſervation of the lives, proſperities and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the people, with all things incident thereunto, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that excellent Law of the <hi>Petition</hi> of <hi>Right,</hi> which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently eſtabliſheth <hi>Juries,</hi> which good old Lawes they call page 23. the badges of our freedoms which they there ſay, our Anceſtors injoyed long before the Conqueſt, and ſpent much of their bloud to have confirmed by the great Charter, and which have continued in all former changes, and being duly executed, are the moſt unjuſt, free, and equall of any other Lawes in the world; but if in a yeares time they ſhould deſtroy both theſe <hi>Declarations</hi> by deſtroying <hi>Juries,</hi> the univerſality of the People would took upon them as the moſt faithleſſe perſideous men that ever breathed, and watch all oppertunities utterly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and exterpate them, as Monſters rather then men, ſo ſoone to degenerate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> I but put the caſe the <hi>Prince</hi> ſhould endeavour to ſet on foot a new Warre, and ſo put the <hi>Parliament</hi> into unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable neceſſity, may they not for terrour then ſet up a high Court of Juſtice as well as for the tryal of the late <hi>King.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, for theſe Reaſons, firſt, becauſe before the late <hi>Kings</hi> death, all the Lawes and proceſs of the Lawes, run in his name, therefore it was not poſſible in the old forme to try him; but now the Lawes and proceſs of the Law, run in the name of the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> or the Keepers of the Liberties of <hi>England.</hi>

Authority, and ſo declared by their Repreſentatives, at leaſt by thoſe that ſo judge themſelves, and by two ſpecial Acts made by them, upon which Mr. <hi>Lilburn</hi> was arraigned for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and printed in his Tryal, page 87.88.89. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> dated the 14. of <hi>May</hi> 1649. and the 17. of <hi>June</hi> 1649. they declare it to be treaſon in any perſon that ſhall maliciouſly, or adviſed pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, by writing, printing, or openly declaring, that the ſaid Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is tyrannicall, uſurped, or unlawfull; or that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in <hi>Parliament</hi> aſſembled, are not the ſupream Authority of this Nation, or ſhall plot, contrive, or endeavour to ſtir up, or raiſe force againſt the preſent <hi>Government,</hi> or for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion or alteration of the ſame, or ſhall plot, contrive, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſtir up any mutiny in the Army, or ſhall withdraw any Souldiers or Officers from their obedience, to their ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Officers, or from the preſent Government, or ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, invite, aide, or aſſiſt any forraigners or ſtrangers, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or ſhall adhere to any forces raiſed by the Enemies of the Parliament, or Common-wealth of <hi>England</hi>; now it is impoſſible any Law can be more ſevere then to make words treaſon; and therefore no neceſſity now can be pleaded to ſet up a high Court of <hi>Juſtice</hi> to try the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranteſt Cavalier in the world, who can be reputed at worſt, no more then a Traitor, for which the Lawes declared by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves already provides a puniſhment, and a Cavalier is an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> man, and thereby by Law ought to have the priviledge of any other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Traitour, and little doth men know the danger of breaking down banks, or pulling up univerſall Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, though it be in caſes of higheſt and greateſt enemies, which the people of <hi>Athens</hi> (as Sir <hi>Walter Rawly</hi> fully declares) felt ſufficiently under their thirty Tyrants, who had no way to introduce their tyranny upon the people, but in the ſubverſion of their Lawes, and Freedoms, by making examples firſt, upon thoſe offenders the people moſt hated, but then a little ſpace the Tyrant pleaded thoſe preſidents, and by little and little made the people taſte of the ſame ſauce, but it is hoped that now after the full alteration of the Common-wealth, and Acts of Treaſon declared thereupon, if any ſhall dare, though authorized by Parliament, to be Judges in an High Court of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> now to take away any mans life, or eſtate, but ſhortly they ſhall loſe their heads as Traitors; therefore as <hi>Empſon,</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Ruth and Juſtice, are two of the main attributes of God, with the practiſes of whom, he hath declared himſelf to be well pleaſed, and which he will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and ſet up in his own time, maugre the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of all that do oppoſe them. <hi>Sir,</hi> I know you would be thought a lover of them, and out of that conſideration, I now write unto you: So it is Sir, that I am an Engliſh-man born, bred, and brought up, and I hope ſo to live, and ſo to dye; and by vertue of being an Engliſhman, I am entai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to all the Liberties and Freedomes, that the Lawes and good cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of <hi>England,</hi> will afford to any of her children whomſoever; and beſides, the ſeries of all my actions, from my childhood to this very day, have been conſtant demonſtrations, that I love and honour all thoſe her juſt boundaries, that diſtinguiſh <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports juſt Magiſtracy, and teaches ſubjection her due bounds, and that most equally diſpenſeth juſticte indifferently unto all; and that I hate and abhor, all ſubverting and Levelling, of the juſt Lawes, Liberties, and Freedomes thereof, to any mans will whatſoever, never coveting, in my own private thoughts or reaſon, any other rule to judge or bee judged by, but that righteous one of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, to do as you would be done to;</hi> And becauſe (by reaſon of mans corruptions) there is more difficulties, and niceties, in the Laws of the Land of my

nativity and abode, then there is in the plain, and eaſie to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood law, of civill behaviour, that the wife and righteous God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, hath given and diſpenſed in the volumn of truth (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi>) to the ſons of men, but eſpecially to all thoſe that deſire to approve their hearts unto him; therefore I ſay in regard of the intricacie, of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick part of them, I have heartily laboured in my ſphere, and private condition, as much as I could, to attain unto the knowledg of ſo much of it, as might be a ſafe guide unto me, in my converſings with my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, country-men, and brethren; and truly, it hath been my maxim, that amongst men, there was no ſafety for me, but in walking in a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall conformity, to the dictates of the just and good old plain Laws of <hi>England;</hi> but of late many men ſuppoſed I was miſtaken, and I confeſſe I was in great hazard of bodily deſtruction, for doing my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in walking in conformity, to the clearest dictates, that either the law of Reaſon (which is the ſoveraign law of God) or the clearest and most highly priz'd Laws of this Nation, could dictate, to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious, inquiſitive, and ingenious ſoul, who holds it for the most indiſpenſable maxim, that ever the wiſe God of heaven and earth eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed amongst the ſons of men; <hi>That evill muſt not, nor ought not, to be done by any, that good may come thereby:</hi> But the greatest good that I can do, is to be readily obedient to the pleaſure, will, or command of him, that is abſolutely ſoveraign, over both my ſoul and body, although my body ſhould periſh in the conformity to my duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> I ſay I thought I had been ſafe enough, when I walked by the dictates of the best of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> I mean the <hi>Petition of Right</hi> and others conſonant to it, and I thought I had a pretty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of knowledge, to preſerve my own ſelf; But yet at my late <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all at Guild-Hall,</hi> I found my ignorance was very great, in divers eſſentiall things I ought to have known for my full and clear preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to the formalities or practick part of the Law; but my good God, by his ſpeciall or miraculous over-ruling providence, [ſo judged by me] having graciouſly delivered me, out of that tranſcendent ſnare, and ſetting my body as well as my ſoul at liberty, I had immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately two things in my eye; First, whether it were better for me, and more conducing to my own peace and happineſſe, to depart the nation, ſeeing in the first year of <hi>Englands Liberty,</hi> words and ſpeeches are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48226:8"/>
become Treaſon; that thereby no man knowes well, how to behave himſelf: Or that I ſhould reſolve, with all the underſtanding I could enjoy from God, to rub it as wiſely out in the land of my nativity, as I could? And truly Sir, as for the first, there was an impoſſibility upon me, at the preſent, in that I have now been above nine years, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit from your Houſe, for my <hi>Star-chamber reparations,</hi> in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of which, I do with ſafety aver it, I have really ſpent almost <hi>2000.l.</hi> and yet am not much the nearer then I was the first day I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, becauſe that which was in part first and most juſtly aſſigned me, out of the Lord <hi>Cottrington</hi>'s and Sir <hi>Francis Windebank</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, the two Houſes gave away to the Lord <hi>Sey,</hi> and otherwayes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed of; and then by ſeverall Votes and an Ordinance, fixed my repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, totally upon the Lord <hi>Coventry</hi>'s eſtate, which in my eye, was very just, in regard he was my chiefest unjust Judge, in both my <hi>Star-chamber bloudy Sentences:</hi> But truly Sir, to deal ingeniouſly with you, I was then informed by a Member of your Houſe, that your ſelf was then, one of the principall inſtruments, to get it (after my Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance had past once or twice in your Houſe) off from my Lord <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry,</hi> out of fear of the future danger of the preſident of it; and yet I must confeſſe, that the ſame party, and my own knowledge, told me, you were not a little active, to get it fixed, upon ſome Delinquents eſtates as the States debt, where I might be ſure (in the eye of reaſon) in a very ſhort time to have it; and accordingly it was fixed upon the Eſtates, of Sir <hi>Henry Bellingham,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Gibbs,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Bowes,</hi> lying in the County of <hi>Durham;</hi> whoſe eſtates in Land (in good times) at wrack'd Rent, amounted to about <hi>900.l. per annum;</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Gibbs</hi> his Wood in <hi>Bransburth</hi> Park, whcih was commonly in that County accounted his, and much of it ſold by his appointment, and for his uſe, and which Wood was the principall ſecurity, that I had in my eye for my <hi>3000. l.</hi> without which I ſhould never freely have given my conſent, to have left my Lord <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry,</hi> and acquieſced in that ſecurity of Delinquents Lands, and which I was enabled by your Houſe to fell and ſell, to make up my mony ſpeedily; though the Houſe of Lords were pleaſed to reſtrain me from felling any more Timber-trees, and only tyed me, to make my best of that which was already felled, which at my first journey to <hi>Durham,</hi> upon the place was told me to be worth betwixt <hi>1000</hi> and <hi>2000 l.</hi> but before the ſecond time I could get down into the Counry, to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion

of it, old Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> (one of my <hi>Star-Chamber-Judges,</hi> who in Law and equity ought to be one of my repairers) had by an Order out of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> ſeized upon it all, as his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended right, ſo that thereby I was deprived of the greatest part of my ſecurity, that I reſted upon for my <hi>3000. l.</hi> And afterwards the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of <hi>Durham,</hi> ſold for me as many of Sir <hi>Thomas Bowes</hi> his Coals, and Iron to Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigge,</hi> as he paid me <hi>400.l.</hi> for, and put me in poſſeſſion of the Land, and by vertue thereof I received in rents, above <hi>100.l.</hi> more, ſo that there remained about <hi>24</hi> or <hi>2500 l.</hi> behinde; and upon my last impriſonment in March last, Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> as alſo Colonell <hi>George Fenwick</hi> told my father, &amp;c.

            <p>And then <hi>Sir,</hi> in the ſecond place; being I am thereby <hi>nolens vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi> compelled to live in <hi>England,</hi> I confeſſe in reaſon and prudence, it is not ſafe for me here to abide, having ſo many potent and malicious adverſaries as I have, without the attaining to the knowledge of all the formalities, punctillioes, and niceties of the practick part of the Law, that ſtudy and unwearied induſtry can furniſh me with, that ſo if ever malice lay hold of me again, I may be my own <hi>Counſellour</hi> and <hi>Lawyer,</hi> and ſtand in need of the help of no others; eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, at my late Triall at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> I was denied all thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges that are an <hi>Engliſhmans</hi> right, and ought to be the means of his preſervation, in the day of his triall; and which priviledges of the help of <hi>Counſell,</hi> &amp;c. was granted to the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Lord <hi>Macguire,</hi> called the grand <hi>Iriſh-Rebel,</hi> and Duke <hi>Hammilton;</hi> and which was granted to my ſelf by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier Judges at <hi>Oxford,</hi> as my right by Law, and which was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome of the preſent Judges, to Major <hi>Rolph,</hi> the last year in a most eminent manner, when he was accuſed of the highest Treaſon
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48226:9"/>
that the letter of the Law of <hi>England</hi> ever knew: And Sir, knowing my own ignorance in the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>French</hi> tongue, without the knowledge of which, I cannot reade the practick part of the Law of <hi>England</hi> (more is the pity and miſery of the plain men of <hi>England)</hi> I repaired to the <hi>Temple</hi> to ſome of my acquaintance, and ſpoke with your ſelf and ſeverall other learned in the Law of <hi>England,</hi> who all unanimiuſly told me, that neither I nor any other free <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> could be denied admittance into the <hi>Temple,</hi> if we deſired to ſtudy the Law; upon which I went to the Butler to enter my name, and paid my entranoe money, that being the inſtructions I received, from thoſe that for many years have been Students of that Houſe, and the Butler told me your Attourney-Generoll Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> was the Treaſurer, and I must go to him for my admittance; and to his chamber I went, and he being abroad, I acquainted Mr. <hi>Raddon</hi> his ſervant with my buſineſſe, and paid <hi>3l. 6s. 8d.</hi> to him, who deſired me in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon to call, and I ſhould have my admittance under his Maſters hand, who it ſeems refuſed it, and thereupon I waited upon Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> himſelf the next morning, and found him ſomething waſpiſh, and did at preſent poſitively deny me admittance; making thereby the quarrell perſonall betwixt him and me, in denying me (a free and legall man of <hi>England)</hi> liberty to ſtudy the <hi>Law of the Land of my Nativity,</hi> in the place appointed for that end, although if I tranſgreſſe it (and that through ignorance) Mr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> in all likelihood, will be as he hath been already, the <hi>irrationall malicious proſecutor of me to take away my life;</hi> Oh Sir, will not rationall and unbyaſſed men bluſh, at the knowledge of the irrationality of this malicious man, whom I could eaſily ſtrip and whip to the purpoſe with my pen, but I have no deſire to do it, if by this Epiſtle I can avoid it and enjoy my right: And therefore Sir, I entreat you to oblige me ſo far unto you, as effectually perſwade Mr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> not further unavoidably to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate me, to that which I am ſure, will be neither honourable for him, nor much profitable for my ſelf. For the Law by Gods aſſiſtance I am reſolved to ſtudy; unleſſe Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> will get an Act made, that I ſhall not be hanged for tranſgreſſing of it: And truly Sir, I ſhall further proffer this to Mr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> that he may clearly ſee I have no minde to quarrell with him, unleſſe he force me to it; that if he pleaſe to be an effectuall inſtrument, ſpeedily to help me to my mony, which is really my propriety, now detained from me, and deſtroyed by

Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigge,</hi> I will trouble Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> no more for my Admiſſion at the <hi>Temple,</hi> or if he will not do that, then in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of my acquaintance there, which I hope will much help and teach me, and the conveniency of the place in the nighneſſe of it to my fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I deſire he will let me for my money, peaceably enjoy a chamber, from thoſe I can take it of, or buy it from, to ſtudy the Law in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate way, for my own content and recreation, and I will neither trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him nor any of his Aſſociates any more for my admiſſion into their Society of the <hi>Temple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the first place, I earneſtly beſeech you, to let me enjoy your utmost aſſiſtance for the procuring of my money down upon the nayl, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigge,</hi> or from the eſtate of the late Lord <hi>Coventry,</hi> my chiefest unjust Judge, upon whom it was once decreed and ordered to be fixed upon: And truly Sir, in pure juſtice, I know not ſo clearly elſewhere, to ſeek it, as from one of their two hands. Sir, I beſeech you ſeriouſly ponder and conſider of my condition, which truly and unfeignedly is this, I must either ſit down in peace and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſo I and mine must unavoidably periſh, for want of my mony which is my earthly all, or elſe I must <hi>nolens volens,</hi> be compelled to busſle again for it, though I apparently run the hazard of being hanged thereby, judging it more righteous <hi>Naboth</hi>-like to periſh in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of my own right, then be my own Executioner, in ſuffering my ſelf to ſtarve. <hi>Sir,</hi> for your promiſed ſpeedy, and hearty aſſiſtance in theſe particulars, I ſhall be very much obliged to remain, <hi>Sir,</hi>
