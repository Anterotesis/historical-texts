            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IT is an Eminent Text. <hi>Search the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
for in them ye</hi> think <hi>ye have E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
life, and they are they which te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
of ME,</hi> And <hi>Ye will</hi> not come <hi>unto
ME that ye might have Life,</hi> Joh. 5.
39. 40. which are the words of our Lord and, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Jeſus Chriſt to the Jewes at Jeruſalem, in
the days of this Converſation upon Earth in Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<hi>Fleſh:</hi> They thought to have Eternal life in the
Scriptures, and were <hi>preſent</hi> with Chriſt <hi>outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
yet would not come unto Him, though the
Scriptures are they that teſtifie of Him: by which
it may appear, that the Coming to Chriſt muſt
needs be <hi>inwardly,</hi> in Coming to be like him in
their Hearts, in becoming Meek and lowly of
Heart: ſuch onely and no other do <hi>come</hi> unto
him in any Age or Place of this world or in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
nor can any other poſſibly have life.</p>
                  <p>Though the Holy Scriptures of the Old and
New Teſtament are indeed the <hi>written</hi> word of
God; Penned by the Holy Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb facs="tcp:61375:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who ſpeak as they were <hi>inſpired</hi> by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt, whoſe words are ſome of them record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Holy writings the Bible.</p>
                  <p>Yet if we conſider it ſeriouſly, can we think that
the Eternal Ever-living word, CHRIST
JESUS, by which all things were Created,
and which is God himſelf; who hath ſpoken by
his Word, in all his Holy Ones, that have ſpoken
forth the <hi>Things</hi> mentioned in the Scriptures,
and there recorded by the Command of the <hi>ſame
word:</hi> I ſay this being weighed, can it enter into
our Hearts to think, that this powerful word
which is God, would <hi>onely</hi> have the Scriptures,
to be <hi>called</hi> the word of God, and the living po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to be ſlightly paſſed by as <hi>not obſerved,</hi> or
thoſe Texts that ſpeak of it, to be interpreted of
the Holy Scriptures onely; as if there were no
ſuch Thing beſides; whereas, for the ſake of <hi>that,</hi>
they were written, the holy Men ſpake, and God
hath wrought, all things, and that by, and for,
<hi>it,</hi> to his own Glory.</p>
                  <p>Alſo, that the writing, ſhould be <hi>preferred,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Thing that is written of, therein, and
which cauſed the writing and dictated it, as it is, by
thoſe, that <hi>think,</hi> the word <hi>is not that,</hi> which fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
all Things, calling in the Hearts of All,
though not regarded.</p>
                  <p>Further; that this Holy Scripture doth ſay: the
word is in the Heart; and yet is <hi>not</hi> by ſome, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi>
to be there, before the word was known to
be written by any Man, or ſpoken by humane
<pb facs="tcp:61375:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
voyce, neither of which, could be, or act, unleſs
firſt <hi>directed</hi> by the ſame Eternal Word.</p>
                  <p>And then; that the Word is in the Hearts of
<hi>thoſe</hi> onely that have heard or read the Scriptures,
or the Word vocally pronounced by Man.</p>
                  <p>And at length to think, the Word, is onely the
Scriptures of the <hi>Bible,</hi> in their Hearts, by and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>hearing or reading</hi> it, and remembring what
it mentions in Words, according to their own
Notions or apprehenſions of the Things in their
Minds, though perhaps not underſtood, by thoſe
Perſons, nor indeed can be, but by the Spirit of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi>
awakened and revived in Man, by the
power of the Living Word in the Heart, filling
the ſoul with underſtanding and believing; in
thoſe who are obedient, to the Movings and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
thereof in the <hi>Mind,</hi> though they never
read or learned it from any outward word or
writing at all; of which, there are many <hi>Examples</hi>
in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>And ſo now, That the Scriptures, which men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the word of Life, ſhould be taken to be that
very word of Life <hi>it ſelf,</hi> and that thereby the
Thing which is ſo called in the Scriptures, ſhould
be thought to be the Scriptures only, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſearch or inquiry made, what that Thing is,
or where it is, and how to find the very Thing it
ſelfe; <hi>as if,</hi> that were impoſſible, or <hi>not the Maine</hi>
Matter to be looked after; whereas God himſelf
ſaith, <hi>Am not I he that filleth all things, and in him
are all Things:</hi> Can not <hi>HE</hi> then be found, and
<pb facs="tcp:61375:4"/>
whoſoever findeth him, <hi>can</hi> he <hi>miſs</hi> of finding
<hi>ALL THINGS?</hi> This ſeemeth ſtrange that it
ſhould enter into the Heart of any Man: and that
we ſhould be ſo tyed up to former apprehenſions
and Concluſions fixed in our Minds, that <hi>further
conſideration</hi> of it cannot eaſily take place, and
ſink into us, it may make us ſtand a while, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
what may be the <hi>cauſe</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <p>And then we may obſerve, that commonly our
<hi>diſpoſition</hi> is ſuch, that we love not to hear oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
or a different apprehenſion of others, leaſt
we ſhould thereby be led to think &amp; Believe, that
which is contrary to our former once <hi>framed</hi>
Ground of Opinion, abſtracted from outward
ſenſe onely: and this becauſe all Concluſions rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon it, when that is once removed, do <hi>fall</hi> to
the ground, and ſo we looſe that Great Labour,
and muſt be put to work a freſh upon that new
Foundation, and then a fear if that ſhould again
be ſhaken, there muſt be another labour, with the
like <hi>hazard</hi> of unprofitable Succeſs, which is ſo
huge a diſcourgement to any Mind, that it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it at length to be <hi>languiſhing</hi> and as it were
dead, epecially if an aſſured infallible immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
internal Ground be not preſented to it, that
it may go on cheerfully to build, with hope to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
fruit, in beholding the <hi>beauty</hi> of its Superſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture;
and when it is thus dead in it ſelf, it is moſt
capable to be taught by the quickening Spirit of
Truth, that lyeth hidden in it, under its former
but <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> Truths.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:61375:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Yet, to deny, that the Holy Scriptures, are the
written word of God, or the Word of God Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in writing, is, beſides the oppoſing of <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent</hi>
Truth, to undervalue, that precious help to
the knowing and underſtanding, what <hi>that Word
was,</hi> by which it was written, which is the very
End for which it was committed to writing and
continued to us, and is, one of the moſt Excellent
fruits of the wiſdom <hi>remaining</hi> in Letters, which
that Eternal Word hath produced in this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
viſible tranſitory World.</p>
                  <p>But, the Eſteeming that fruit, and looking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it <hi>more</hi> then the Roor, and ſetting it up inſtead
of, and <hi>above,</hi> the hidden Word in all things; is
that which hath been attempted in the Hearts of
Men, by the ſuggeſtion of the Arch-Enemy of all
Man-kind: who knoweth well enough, that if the
inward Word be once <hi>Choaked</hi> and killed at the
Root, ſo that it groweth not to be felt known and
obeyed; he will ſoon cauſe in Evil Minds, that
<hi>Most precious</hi> literal Word, to be uſed onely as
a pretence, thereby to cover all Sin in Hypocriſie,
cauſing the Word in the Heart, not to be ſo much
as <hi>thought on</hi> or obſerved: whereas, on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
he that highly eſteemeth of the Word, the
Commandment, Chriſt in the Heart, that word
of Faith, by which the heart it ſelf cometh origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to have its very <hi>being:</hi> cannot in the leaſt fail
of Eſteeming, the powerfull working thereof in
the inexpreſſible <hi>various</hi> wiſdom, dwelling in the
Heart and appearing from the Mouth or Pen of
any Man whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:61375:5"/>
Therefore peruſe this Book, which will inform

the Man <hi>JESUS CHRIST,</hi> who was born of the

<hi>without</hi> the Created inward and outward world
<hi>as well</hi> as in them? And had it not been ſo, though
the Angels world and ours had never been created?
And were not all the Things without them and

ſpoken of in the Scriptures? were not, the Word,
<hi>God;</hi> though <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle had <hi>not</hi> ſaid ſo?
were not the Pure in <hi>Heart</hi> Bleſſed? ſhould we not

take up the Croſs of Chriſt, that is, tribulation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
afflictions adverſities and Croſſes, and follow
him in Meekneſs and wel-doing, loving thoſe that
<hi>hurt</hi> us, returning Good for Evil to every one, and
bleſſing for Curſing, and this unfeignedly from a
ſincere Heart: are we not his true <hi>Diſciples?
will not</hi> Heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to
them that deſire it? though certain Diſciples, that
believed and had been baptized in the Time of the
Apoſtles, had <hi>not</hi> ſo much as <hi>heard</hi> whether there
was any holy Ghoſt, yet being baptized in the
Name of the Lord JESUS, and having the hands
of <hi>Paul</hi> laid on them, <hi>they received</hi> the holy Ghoſt
and Spake with Tongues and propheſied. Do not
<pb facs="tcp:61375:6"/>
they receive the Seed into Good Ground, that heare
the <hi>Inward</hi> Word, and receive, conſent to, or obey it,
and ſo, underſtand it, &amp; alſo bring forth fruit? Doth
not Faith come by <hi>inward Hearing,</hi> and that Hearing
by the <hi>ſame</hi> word of God? And can thoſe that have
not Ears to hear, that is, Spiritual Ears, hear, though
his voyce his <hi>Spiritual</hi> Tongue and voyce is gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all the Earth, that Word ingrafted in every thing
by which all doth <hi>ſubſist? Can</hi> the Natural Man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Things of God, ſeeing they are ſpiritually
to be diſcerned: or can any teach them rightly, that
is Spiritually, but by the <hi>Spirit?</hi> And if the word of

in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> by Gods putting Enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

all Mankind <hi>have in them,</hi> the Spiritual Man, the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Man of the Heart, in whom, even <hi>Cain</hi> was able
to do well, and ſo doing ſhould have been accepted,
and in whom, they are not only able to diſcern but
to do all things; but if they love themſelves, <hi>more</hi>

Hath not God <hi>ſhed</hi> abroad his Love in our

Spirit which bear record in Heaven <hi>One?</hi> And do not
the Spirit the Water and the Bloud which bear record
on the Earth <hi>agree in One?</hi> Alſo, is not the Kingdom
<pb facs="tcp:61375:7"/>
of Heaven within us? And doth it not conſiſt in Peace
Righteouſneſs, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt? and then

and underſtand it rightly, though yet we
know it not nor ever read it, or though it had not

                  <p>How many Thouſand Endleſs Myſteries, are Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
up in the hidden wiſdom of God in Chriſt, and
in him in us? when <hi>we find him</hi> and partake of him,
in him we have them all, and from his fulneſs receive
Grace for Grace: how narrowly therefore ſhould we
ſearch and obſerve, the <hi>exact words of the Scripture,</hi>
which ſo ſurely as an Index, point us to theſe invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
things; and uſe that powerful word in our
Hearts, by which <hi>hearing</hi> Comes, and direction and
<hi>power</hi> of underſtanding thoſe things, not onely which
are expreſſed inwardly or outwardly, but even what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
is <hi>hidden</hi> in Chriſt, in whom all fulneſs dwels:
and then can any thing be impoſſible to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
or known by a Soul, that hath the very Thing in
it ſelf, where nothing <hi>can be hid</hi> from its inward Eyes?</p>
                  <p>And ſince God worketh in us both to wil and to do,
why <hi>refuſe we</hi> to will and to do? by hearkening and
yeelding to the Luſts of our own Hearts, being Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
in Obedience to the Evil, and not of God, who
is likewiſe in us with his Grace &amp; fulneſs: <hi>we thinking</hi>
nevertheleſs, that we can neither will nor do, <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring</hi>
to bring Scripture to prove it; to the quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to every one to profit withal: and this is effected in
thoſe that underſtand not, how to ſatsfie themſelves,
<pb facs="tcp:61375:7"/>
in the meaning of thoſe Scripture Arguments that are
alledged for <hi>proofs;</hi> not conſidering that God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in us to be able through <hi>him in us,</hi> ſo that there is
himſelf his power and ability in our Selves, though
<hi>not</hi> Self-ability, as of our ſelves: for, the Moſt Holy
Man born of the fleſhly Seed of Father and Mother,
of himſelf <hi>as of himſelf, is not able</hi> to think a Good
Thought, but there is none ſo wicked, except he be
altogether uncapable to deſire Converſion, and ſo is
a Devil, but <hi>doth</hi> at ſome time or other in this life,
think a Good Thought; which teſtifies the good work
of God in his-heart and ſoul, and is the ſtirring of the
Divine Word <hi>therein,</hi> in which is Light, but Men
love darkneſs rather then Light, though it Ever Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
ſhone in the Darkneſs, and is the very light of
their life in them; and that <hi>becauſe</hi> their Deeds are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;
and they will not follow to will and do accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it, which is the Obedience to the divine. Light
in them; though God hath given even his whole ſelf
unto them to <hi>Convert</hi> them, wherein they are able to
do all things <hi>through Christ</hi> that ſtrengtheneth them;
and yet will not, but neglect ſo great Salvation. And
theſe Comfortable words expreſſed in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
are faithful and the Things certain and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably
true though the Scriptures had never made

                  <p>The Conſideration whereof, ſhould move us, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly

unto the Truth of the Holy Scriptures, by the

ſeeing the Scripture directs to that which is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<hi>no way but</hi> in the Things themſelves, as all
that is written of is to be known Experimentally,
whether it be Natural or Divine, ſolely by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the writing by and with the <hi>Things,</hi> elſe all is but
a Notional and Imaginary Suppoſition or Opinion
without underſtanding, but by the knowing of Things
we ſhould by degrees ceaſe from Contention, and
rightly certainly and infallibly know God, and the
<hi>Wonders</hi> he hath wrought and can and will work in
all things, eſpecially in the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>Holy</hi> Men, ſome
of whom, out of the good hidden treaſure of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
word in the Heart, have committed to writing
thoſe few things conteined in the Scriptures, being
few in reſpect of the Infinite <hi>Depths of the Deity;</hi> and
ſo proceeding forward from Grace to Grace, from
Knowledge to knowledg, we may attain to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the fulneſs of the ſtature of a Man in Chriſt
and not be alwaies <hi>children in underſtanding,</hi> but even
ſtrong Men in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Johns</hi> words. <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin,
we deceive our Selves;</hi> May they be taken as meant
ſpeaking of others, and <hi>not himſelf</hi> included? what
then ſhall we think was become of his <hi>Earthly</hi> Old <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
of his outward Fleſh and Bloud, wherein he was
Mortal? had he not that when he ſaid ſo, that he
<pb facs="tcp:61375:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might juſtly <hi>exclude</hi> himſelf from having any ſinne?
as having laid of this life and body he might have
done, having the new heavenly Body, and not the
old Earthly one <hi>about him</hi> at all: in which Mortal fleſh
and Bloud onely, which Chriſt himſelf took of the
<hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> he became, Sinne, for us, and
could die; elſe it had <hi>not</hi> been <hi>poſsible,</hi> as is largely
cleared in this Treatiſe: Though if there be no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the Soul, it may truly be ſaid by any one, with
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, It is no more I, that do the Evil which
I would not, but Sinne that dwelleth in me:</hi> Yet of this
Mortal Corruptible Fleſh, which dyeth and remains
in <hi>Corruption</hi> in the Grave, and will not be changed
till the General Reſurrection of <hi>all the Dead</hi> at the laſt
day, of that it may be always ſaid, as he likewiſe ſaies
of himſelf, after he was rapt into the Third Heaven,
and not of others onely: <hi>I know that in me, that is, in
my Fleſh, dwelleth no Good thing.</hi> And that is it, in which
Evil was preſent vvith him, vvhen he vvould do
Good; for vvith his Fleſh he ſerved the Lavv of
Sinne: <hi>Can any ſerve God with his Fleſh?</hi> but vvith the
Mind he can, and <hi>doth</hi> vvhen he vvilleth the Good.</p>
                  <p>Yet vvhy are the Myſteries of the Bible, ſo little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
but becauſe <hi>we apprehend not,</hi> that God and

Sinne, are invvardly in Every ſoul; <hi>the fleſh luſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Spirit and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh</hi> in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

things either hidden or manifeſted; and that all the
things vvhich vve perceive in this corruptible vvorld
to be tranſitory, are in the ſpiritual invvard <hi>uncreated</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:61375:9"/>
world, Eternal in Subſtance, and cannot but endure
for evermore, which if it were conſidered we ſhould
find what all things are, for they are to be found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
our Souls, and with our <hi>Inward Eyes,</hi> and may be
plainly ſeen diſcerned and known; and ſo the holy
Scriptures, as we come to a greater meaſure of the
knowledge of the <hi>Things,</hi> not only that they are, but
what and <hi>how</hi> they are, as this <hi>Author</hi> teacheth, would
come to be underſtood, as to all thoſe Myſteries of
the Goſpel of Chriſts <hi>Eternal</hi> Redemption and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
which he hath purchaſed for all Man-kind:
then which there is not any thing comparably <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirably</hi>
to be known, by any of the Sons of Men, which
are here fundamentally and particularly explained
more then in any other Book of the Authors, wherein
thou wilt find ſuch Myſteries <hi>diſcovered</hi> as formerly
thou couldſt not have believed, though one had told
thee of them, and which thou haſt not <hi>ſo clearly</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
though thou haſt often read of them in the
Scriptures: And if all Jews Turks Heathens and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
not yet true Chriſtians, ſhould perceive the
<hi>Things</hi> therein written, they would inſtantly with wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and ready Hearts believe in God aright, &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the Father in Spirit and in Truth; and know the
Only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent,
and then be filled with Joy in the Holy Ghoſt; and
love <hi>Embrace</hi> and highly eſteem the <hi>underſtanding</hi> of
the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament, which
nnot many yet care to be aſſured they underſtand them
aright by the true knowledg of the <hi>Things</hi> written of
therein. Though alſo the <hi>Ground</hi> of all Myſteries are
<pb facs="tcp:61375:9"/>
in this Book laid open, which being apprehended, may
bring us at length to the full underſtanding of all that
the Scriptures do contein, <hi>except</hi> in what the ſpirit of
God wil conceal, as what the <hi>ſeven Thunders</hi> in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,
ſounded forth, which yet wil be made known
to that ſoul, what thoſe things are, that the Spirit wil <hi>not
yet</hi> reveal, but that the Father will reſerve in his own
power, till the thing be neer to be accompliſhed, though
it may be underſtood by one or other holy ſoul <hi>in the
Nature of the Thing,</hi> with a Command not to make it
known to others; yet though we underſtand things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo perfectly in our Spirits ſouls &amp; heavenly Bodys
in our <hi>Inward Man,</hi> we enjoy them inwardly onely, in
<hi>aſſured hope,</hi> but not as we ſhall do, neither do we ſee
them as we ſhall do, when we ſo enjoy them as we do
now this world with this <hi>outward</hi> Body, <hi>both</hi> which, wil
be changed together at the End, and though this body

<hi>ſuch</hi> as have been partakers of him in this life, this will

by our Outward Man in this life: and them alſo, all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
being done away, as at the change of this world
and <hi>reſurrection</hi> of the Body that will be alſo releaſed
from thoſe Clogs of imperfection which now hang on
us Outwardly; and on this whole now <hi>viſible</hi> world,
and will do till all Things are ſeparated by the Fire at
the laſt day and every thing ſhall go to its own Place,
the wicked into everlaſting Torment, the Righteous to

Eternal Bliſs; <hi>then Corruption ſhall put on Incorruption,
and God ſhall be all in all;</hi> yet all things will remain to be
what they then are, though God will be all in Every

                  <p>In the mean time, <hi>we may attain</hi> Perfection, in our
ſouls, ſpirits, and new heavenly Bodys, being therein
truly members of Chriſt in us, yet we ſhould bring

are on the Earth, and learn to know how every one of
us, may <hi>juſtly</hi> account our ſelves even the Chief of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,

ſhould <hi>not</hi> let it reign in our Mortal Bodys, to obey it
in the Luſts thereof, and if by the ſpirit we thus mortifie
the deeds of the Body, we ſhall live, for then we bring

made known unto them his Suffering. Dying and Reſurrection</p>
                  <p>5. To ſignifie, that ſelf Reaſon in the wit and wiſdome of this world,
could not in its <hi>own</hi> Reaſon know nor apprehend this Perſon, who was both

that God's Kingdom is <hi>not</hi> of this world, and that Fleſh and Blood
cannot know or apprehend it.</p>
                  <p>12. Therefore now it concerns every one, that will <hi>ſpeak</hi> or teach of the
Divine Myſteries, that he have the ſpirit of God, and know in the Light of
God, thoſe Matters which he will give forth for true; and not ſuck or draw
them from his own Reaſon; and ſo <hi>without</hi> divine knowledg, run upon
the bare Letter in his opinion, and drag the Scripture by the Hair of the
Head, to prove it, as is <hi>uſualy</hi> done by Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>13. From this, ſo exceeding many errors are ariſen, in that the divine
knowledg hath been ſought in mens own wit and Art; and ſo men
are drawn from the truth of God, to their own Reaſon; ſo that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Man of Incarnation of Chriſt, hath been accounted a <hi>ſtrange</hi>
work and thing.</p>
                  <p>14. Whereas yet we muſt all, in that Becoming Man or Incarnation,
be born of God again, if we will ever eſcape the wrath of the Eternal
Torment or <hi>Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. But ſeeing it is a familiar intimate and native innate work to the
children of God, wherewith they ſhould exerciſe themſelves daily and <hi>hourly;</hi>
and ſhould alwaies enter into the Becoming Man or Incarnation of Chriſt,
and go forth from the <hi>earthly</hi> Reaſon; and ſo, in this miſerable life, muſt
be born in the birth and Becoming man or Incarnation of Chriſt, if they

                  <p>16. I have therefore undertaken to write this high myſtery, according to

                  <p>19. And that not with wiſe and high eloquence of Art, or from the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

20. And though I ſearch ſublimely and <hi>deep,</hi> and ſhall ſet it down very
clearly; yet this muſt be ſaid to the Reader; that <hi>without</hi> the Spirit of God
it will be a Myſtery to him, and hidden from him.</p>
                  <p>21. Therefore let every one take <hi>heed</hi> how he judgeth, that he fall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the judgment of God, and be captivated by his own <hi>Turba,</hi> and that
his own Reaſon caſt him not down headlong. This I ſay out of good will,
and give it to the Reader to ponder of.</p>
                  <p>22. When we will write of the Becoming Man or Incarnation, and birth
of JESUS CHRIST the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God, and ſpeak rightly thereof,
then we muſt conſider the <hi>cauſe,</hi> and what it is that moved God to becom
Man, ſeeing he needed not that to the accompliſhment or perfection of his
Being or Subſtance.</p>
                  <p>23. <hi>Neither</hi> can we by any means ſay, that his own Being or Subſtance
hath <hi>altered</hi> it ſelf in the Becoming-Man or Incarnation.</p>
                  <p>24. For God is unchangeable, and yet is become what he was not,
though his <hi>property</hi> for all that remaineth unaltered; that which was only
aimed at, was the ſalvation of <hi>fallen</hi> Man, that he might bring him into
Paradiſe again.</p>
                  <p>25. And here we are to cnoſider of the firſt Man, how he was before his
fall, for whoſe ſake the Deity hath moved it ſelf; which ought highly to
be conſidered by US Men.</p>
                  <p>26. VVe know what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, That<note n="*" place="margin">Geneſ. 1. 26, 27. 5. &amp; 1. 9. &amp; 6</note>

That God, who is a Spirit, beheld himſelf in an Image, as in a Similitude.</p>

that all this might be a Similitude and out-birth or expreſſe Image,
out of the Eternal Nature of the firſt Principle.</p>
                  <p>28. VVhich Similitude, before the time of the world, ſtood in the
wiſdom of God as a hidden<note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>Deſire.</hi>

                     <hi>Magia,</hi> and was beheld in the wiſdom by the
Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>29. VVho in the time of the beginning of this world, <hi>moved</hi> the Eternal
Nature, and opened and brought forth the ſimilitude of the hidden divine
world.</p>
                  <p>30. For the Fiery world ſtood as it were ſwallowed up or <hi>hidden</hi> in the light
of God; in that the light of the Majeſty ruled alone in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>31. And yet we muſt <hi>not think</hi>
that the Fiery World was not then;
It was then; but it ſevered it ſelf in or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61375:12"/>
into its own Principle, and was not
<hi>manifeſted</hi> in the Light of God's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
                  <p>32. As we may obſerve in the <hi>Fire &amp; Light,</hi> that the Fre is indeed a cauſe
of the Light, and yet the light dwelleth in the Fire, un-apprehended by the
Fire, and beareth or hath another ſource or quality then the Fire.</p>
                  <p>33. For the fire is fierceneſs and conſumeth, and the light is meekneſs,
and out of its virtue or power, cometh Subſtantiality <hi>viz: Water,</hi> or the
<hi>Sulphur</hi> of a thing, which the Fire attracteth into it ſelf, and uſeth it to its
ſtrength and life, and ſo is an eternal <hi>Band.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>34. This Fire and divine Light, have each ſtood ſtill in it ſelf from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
each ſtanding in its order, in its own Principle, and having neither
Ground nor Beginning.</p>
                  <p>35. For the Fire hath in it ſelf for its ſource or quality, its own Form
<hi>viz:</hi> the Deſiring; out of which, and in which, all Forms of Nature are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated;
one being continually a cauſe of the other, as is mentioned <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly</hi>
at large in the other writings.</p>
                  <p>36. And we find in the Light of Nature, that the Fire in its own Eſſence,
hath been as in an aſtringent deſirous ſource or quality, a <hi>darkneſs</hi> in it ſelf,
which in the Meekneſs of God hath ſtood as it were ſwallowed up; ſo that
it hath not been qualifying or producing its Quality, but Eſſentially in it
ſelf, and <hi>not kindled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>37. And though it hath as it were burned, yet that hath been as a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of its <hi>own,</hi> in it ſelf <hi>only</hi> perceptible.</p>
                  <p>38. For there have been only <hi>two</hi> Principles from Eternity; the one in
it ſelf, the <hi>Fiery</hi> world; the other alſo in it ſelf, the <hi>Light</hi>-flaming world.</p>
                  <p>39. And yet they were not parted aſunder, as the Fire and Light are <hi>not</hi>
parted aſunder, and the Light dwelleth in the Fire, unapprehended by the
Fire.</p>
                  <p>40. And thus we are to underſtand <hi>two Spirits</hi> one in another <hi>viz:</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> One
fiery, according to the Eſſence of the Aſtringent and ſtearn Nature out of the
hot and cold ſtearn Eſſential Fire, which is underſtood to be God's <hi>wrath-ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
and ſource or quality, and belongeth to the Fathers property; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to which he calleth himſelf, <hi>an angry</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Exod. 20. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>jealous God,</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 12. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>a conſuming
fire,</hi> in which the firſt Principle is underſtood.</p>
                  <p>41. And 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi> The other a <hi>Meek Light-flaming Spirit,</hi> which from Eternity
conceiveth its variation or tranſmutation in the Cnter of the Light; for it
is in the firſt Principle, in the Fathers Property, a Fiery Spirit; and in the
ſecond Principle, in the light, a meek light-flaming ſpirit, and is only <hi>one,</hi> and
not two; but is underſtood to be in <hi>two</hi> ſources or <hi>qualities, viz:</hi> in Fire
and Light, according to the property of each ſource or quality.</p>
                  <p>42. As is ſufficiently to be underſtood by us, in every outward Fire, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61375:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Fire ſource or quality, giveth a wrathful fierce ſpirit, which is <hi>conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming;</hi>
and the ſource or quality of the light, giveth a meek amiable <hi>Air</hi>-Spirit,
and yet is Originally, but one Spirit.</p>
                  <p>43. In like manner we are to conceive of the Being or Subſtance of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<hi>viz:</hi> the holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> which in the Light, we apprehend to be the
<hi>Deity;</hi> and in the Fire, to be the <hi>Eternal Nature;</hi> as is ſufficiently cleared
in the other writings.</p>
                  <p>44. For the Omnipotent Spirit of God with both the Principles, hath
been from Eternity <hi>All</hi> itſelf, there is nothing before it; It is it ſelf the
Ground or <hi>Byſſe,</hi> and the <hi>Abyſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>45. And yet the Holy Divine Being or Subſtance, is eſpecially obſerved to
be a Being or Subſtance of its <hi>own,</hi> in it ſelf, and dwelleth without or beyond
the fiery or fiering Nature and property, in the lights property, and is called
<note n="*" place="margin">GOTT.</note>GOD, not from the Fires property but from the Lights property.</p>
                  <p>46. Though indeed <hi>both</hi> properties are unſevered, as we may underſtand
by this world, wherein there lieth a hidden Fire in the Deep of Nature, and
hidden in all beings or ſubſtances and Things, elſe <hi>no outward</hi> fire could
be brought forth.</p>
                  <p>47. And we ſee that the Meekneſs of the water holdeth that hidden fire
<hi>captive</hi> in it ſelf, that it cannot manifeſt it ſelf; for it is as it were ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up in the water, and yet <hi>is,</hi> though not ſubſtantially, yet Eſſentially; and
in the awakening is made known, and <hi>Operative</hi> or qualifying; and all
were a Nullity or Nothing and an <hi>Abyſſe,</hi> without the Fire.</p>
                  <p>48. Thus we underſtand alſo, that the Third Principle, <hi>viz:</hi> the ſource
or <hi>quality,</hi> and the Spirit of this world, ſtood from Eternity, <hi>hidden</hi>
in the Nature of the Fathers property, and was known by the Light-flaming
Holy Spirit, in the <hi>Holy Magia,</hi> viz: in the <hi>divine wiſdome,</hi> in the Divine
Tincture.</p>
                  <p>49. For the ſake of <hi>which,</hi> the Deity hath moved it ſelf, according to
the Nature of the <hi>Genetri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> and generated the great Myſtery, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
then <hi>ALL</hi> lay, whatſoever the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Nature was able to do.</p>
                  <p>50. And it hath been only a <hi>Myſtery;</hi> and hath <hi>not</hi> been as a Creature,
but as a <hi>Chaos,</hi> Quintiſſence, Miſt, or Mixture together.</p>
                  <p>51. VVherein the wrathful or fierce Nature, hath generated a Dark Miſt
or <hi>Cloud;</hi> and the light flaming Nature in its property, hath generated the
<hi>Flame</hi> in the Majeſty, and the Meekneſs; which hath been the VVater ſource
or Quality, and the cauſe of the Divine <hi>ſubſtantiality,</hi> from Eternity.</p>
                  <p>52. And it is only virtue or Power, and Spirit, which hath been of <hi>no</hi> Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude;
and there is no footſteps of any thing therein; but the Spirit of
God in a two-fold ſource quality and form, <hi>viz:</hi> a hot and a cold ſtearn
<hi>fire</hi>-ſource or quality; and then a Meek <hi>love</hi>-ſource or quality, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the kind of the Fire, and of the Light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61375:13"/>
53. Theſe have as a Myſtery, gone one into another, and yet the one hath
<hi>not</hi> comprehended the other, but have ſtood as it were in two Principles.</p>
                  <p>54. VVherein then the Aſtringency, <hi>viz:</hi> the Father of Nature hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinualy
comprehended or <hi>compacted</hi> the Subſtantiality in the Myſtery; where
then it hath formed it ſelf as it were into an <hi>Image,</hi> and yet hath been <hi>no</hi>
Image, but as a <hi>Shaddow</hi> of an Image.</p>
                  <p>55. All this in the myſtery hath indeed thus continually had an <hi>Eternal
beginning,</hi> of which a man cannot ſay, that there is any thing which hath
not had its figuree, as a Shadow in the Eternal Great <hi>Magia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>56. But it hath been no Beeing or <hi>Subſtance;</hi> but a ſpiritual or divine
<hi>Scene</hi> or ſport one in another, and is the <hi>Magia</hi> of the great Wonders of God,
where there is continually what was <hi>not,</hi> or where there was nothing but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an <hi>Abyſſe;</hi> and that is now in the Nature of the Fire and Light, come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Ground.</p>
                  <p>57. And yet it is out of or from Nothing, but only out of the Spirit of
the ſource or quality, which is <hi>alſo</hi> no Being or <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> but a ſource or
quality, which generateth it ſelf in it ſelf in or into <hi>two</hi> Properties, and
alſo ſevereth it ſelf into <hi>two</hi> Principles.</p>
                  <p>58. It hath no<note n="*" place="margin">Framer <hi>or</hi> Faſhioner.</note> 
                     <hi>ſeperater</hi> or maker, but is it ſelf the <hi>cauſe,</hi> as is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
mentioned at large in the other writings, that the <hi>Abyſſe</hi> introduceth
and generateth it felf into a Ground.</p>
                  <p>59. Thus now we may <hi>coneeive</hi> of the Creation of this World, as alſo of
the Creation of Angels, alſo of Man, and all other creatures. All is Created
out of the great Myſtery.</p>
                  <p>60. For the third. Principle hath ſtood before God, <hi>as a Magia;</hi> and
was not or hath not been <hi>wholly</hi> manifeſted or revealed.</p>
                  <p>61. Alſo God hath had no ſimilitude, wherein he could diſcover his own
Being or Subſtance, but only the <hi>wiſdom,</hi> that hath been his longing delight,
and hath ſtood in his will with his Being or Subſtance, as a great <hi>wonder,</hi>
in the light flaming divine <hi>Magia</hi> of the ſpirit of God.</p>
                  <p>62. For it hath been the habitation of the ſpirit of God, and is no <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,</hi>
but the manifeſtation or <hi>revelation</hi> of God, a Virgin, and a <hi>cauſe</hi> of
the divine ſubſtantiality.</p>
                  <p>63. For in it ſtood the light flaming divine <hi>Tincture</hi> to the heart of God,
<hi>viz:</hi> to the word of life of the Deity; and it hath been the revelation or
manifeſtation of the Holy <hi>Trinity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>64. Not that, from its own ability and production, it manifeſteth or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth
God; but the divine Center out of God's heart or being and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
manifeſteth it ſelf <hi>in it:</hi> It is a <hi>Looking-Glaſs</hi> of the Deity.</p>
                  <p>65. For every Looking-Glaſs ſtandeth ſtill, or quiet and <hi>ſteady,</hi> and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerateth
no Image, but receiveth the Image: and thus the Virgin of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is a Looking-Glaſs of the Deity, wherein the ſpirit of God <hi>ſeeth</hi> it
ſelf, as alſo all wonders of the <hi>Magia,</hi> which with the creation of the Third

66. And this Virgin of the wiſdome of God, ſtood in the Myſtery; and
in it the ſpirit of God hath diſcovered the <hi>formation</hi> of the Creatures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
it is the <hi>out-ſpoken</hi> or expreſs Image of whatſoever God the Father hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

                  </p>
                  <p>67. Itſtandeth before the Deity as a glance or Looking-Glaſs, wherein the

                  <p>1. SEeing then thus there hath been
a Myſtery from Eternity; therefore
now its manifeſtation or <hi>Revelation</hi> is to be conſidered: for we can ſpeak
no otherwiſe of the Eternity, then as of a Spirit.</p>
                  <p>2. For it hath <hi>all</hi> been only a Spirit, and yet from Eternity hath gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
it ſelf into Being or <hi>Substance,</hi> and that through Deſiring and Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>3. Neither can it be ſaid at all, that in the Eternity there hath <hi>not</hi> been

for the Fire cannot comprehend it; and it dwelleth Free in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>10. And yet it is perceptible and known to Us, that the light of the
Love is deſirous, viz: of the wonders and <hi>figures</hi> in the wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>11. In which deſiring; this world,

                  <p>12. Therein hath <hi>alſo</hi> from Eternity, the deſire of the fierce wrath and

                  <p>17. And now we are to conceive or apprehend of the Word <hi>Fiat,</hi> that

as a deſirous <hi>will</hi> to the <hi>Creature,</hi> and to the Manifeſtation of the
Deity.</p>
                  <p>18. But being it had not moved it ſelf from Eternity, till at the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation

                  <p>19. But the Ground and <hi>Cauſe</hi> thereof, we are not to know, and God
hath reſerved it to his own Power and Might, how it came to paſs, that
God hath once moved himſelf; ſeeing, or notwithſtanding, he is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
God: and we ſhall here ſearch <hi>no</hi> further, for this troubleth
us.</p>
                  <p>20. Only of the Creation we have ability to ſpeak, for it is a <hi>Work</hi>
in the Being or Subſtance of God: and we underſtand, that the Will of

                  </p>
                  <p>21 Where then the harſh <hi>Fiat,</hi> ſtood <hi>not</hi> as a Maker, but as a Creator
in the property of Each Eſſence,<note n="*" place="margin">As or viz:</note> All in the Great Wonders of the

                  <p>22. As the <hi>Figures</hi> were from Eternity diſcovered in the<note n="†" place="margin">Or Nature.</note> Wiſdome,
ſo they now became comprehended by the <hi>Fiat,</hi> in the Will-Spirit of

                  <p>23. <hi>Not</hi> out of ſtrange Matter, but out of Gods Eſſences, out of
the Fathers Nature, and became introduced by Gods Will-Spirit into
the light of the Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>24. VVhere then they were <hi>Children,</hi> and not ſtrange gueſts: genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and <hi>Created</hi> out of the Fathers Nature and property, and their will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirit
was inclined or directed into the Sonnes Nature and property.</p>
                  <p>25. They <hi>could</hi> and <hi>ſhould</hi> Eat of Gods love-ſubſtantiality, in the
Light of the Majeſty: where then their fierce wrathful property out of the
Fathers Nature became <hi>changed</hi> into Love and Joy.</p>
                  <p>26. And that they <hi>all</hi> did, beſides or except <hi>one</hi> Throne and
Kingdom, and that turned it ſelf away from the light of Love; and
would rule and domineer in the <hi>ſtern</hi> Nature of the Fire, above Gods

                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:61375:15"/>
27 And was therefore, driven out from the Fathers Property, from its
own <hi>Creaturely</hi> Place, into the Eternal Darkneſs, into the Abyſs of the
ſtern <hi>Fiat;</hi> and there muſt ſtand in its <hi>own</hi> Eternity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thus the
fierce wrath of the Eternal Nature is here alſo filled.</p>
                  <p>28. But yet we are not to think; that King <hi>Lucifer</hi> alſo could <hi>not</hi>
have ſtood: He had the light of the Majeſty<note n="†" place="margin">Or belonging to him.</note> for himſelf as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Thrones of Angels: If he had Imagined thereinto, or according to
it, He <hi>had</hi> continued an Angel.</p>
                  <p>29. But he <hi>drew</hi> himſelf out of Gods Love into the Anger, and ſo he
is now an <hi>Enemy</hi> of the love of God and of all Holy Angels.</p>
                  <p>30. VVe are here to conſider further: Of the Enimicitious kindling of
the <hi>Extruded Spirits:</hi> while they were yet in the Fathers property: How
they with their Imagination kindled the Nature of the ſubſtantiality; ſo
that out of the Heavenly Subſtantiality, <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> are come to
Bee: and the Meek Spirit of the water is come to be a burning Firmament
in the fires ſource or quality: whereupon the Creation of this World, <hi>viz:</hi>
of the Third Principle, <hi>followed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>31. And for the Place of this World there was an other Light awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
viz. the <hi>SUN:</hi> that ſo the Devils Pomp might be withdrawn from
him, and he was thruſt out and ſhut up as a Priſoner in the Darkneſs
<hi>between</hi> the Kingdom of God and of this world.</p>
                  <p>32. VVhere then in this world, he hath no further to Rule, but only
in the <hi>Turba,</hi> in the fierce wrath and <hi>Anger</hi> of God; where that is awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
there he is <hi>Executioner:</hi> and is a continual <hi>Lyer,</hi> Miſchiefer and
betrayer and Cheater of the Creatures.</p>
                  <p>33. He turneth all Good into Evill, ſo far as he is permitted <hi>room</hi> to
do ſo; whatſoever is Terrible and Pompous, there he ſheweth his might,
and <hi>willeth</hi> continually to be above God.</p>
                  <p>34. But the Heaven which is Created out of the midſt of the Waters,
as a Meek Firmament, <hi>allayeth</hi> his Pomp, ſo that he is not Chief Great
Prince in this world; but<note n="*" place="margin">Or Anger-Prince.</note> Prince of <hi>wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>35. Now when the Devil was thruſt <hi>out</hi> of his Place, this Place or
Throne thereupon ſtood <hi>without</hi> its Angelical Hoaſt, in great deſire and
longing after its Prince; but he was thruſt out.</p>
                  <p>36. So now God Created <hi>for it</hi> another Prince, <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt Man,
who was alſo a Throne-Prince before God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and here we are rightly to
conſider <hi>his</hi> Creation, as alſo his Fall; for the ſake of <hi>whom,</hi> the Heart of
God moved it ſelf, and became Man.</p>
                  <p>37. It is not ſo ſlight or trivial a thing or Matter, about the Creation
of Man, for whoſe Fall ſake, God became Man, that he might <hi>Help</hi> him
again.</p>
                  <p>38. So alſo his Fall was not the <hi>meere</hi> Biting of an Apple; alſo his
Creation was not in that manner, as outward Reaſon ſuppoſeth, which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61375:16"/>
underſtandeth the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in his Creation, to be onely a <hi>meere Clod</hi> of
Earth.</p>
                  <p>39. No, my Dear Mind, God is not become man for the ſake of a
Clod of Earth: neither was the matter meerly <hi>one</hi> diſobedient Act for
which God was ſo enraged that his wrath could not be pacified, except
it be <hi>revenged</hi> on the Sonne of God and ſlay him.</p>
                  <p>40. To Us Men indeed, ſince the <hi>looſing</hi> of our Paradiſical Image,
this Myſtery hath continued hidden, except to <hi>ſome</hi> who have attained
the Heavenly Myſtery again: to them ſomewhat thereof hath been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
according to the <hi>Inward</hi> Man.</p>
                  <p>41. For in <hi>Adam</hi> we are Dead as to Paradiſe, and muſt Sprout and
Grow again through Death and the <hi>Corruption</hi> of the Body, into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
as into another world, in the life of God, into the Heavenly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality
and Corporeity.</p>
                  <p>42. And though it be ſo in <hi>ſome,</hi> that they attain the Subſtantiality of
God, viz: Chriſts Body, again, on to the ſoul; yet the Periſhed Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Adam hath <hi>covered</hi> the Holy and pure Myſtery, ſo that the Great ſecret
Myſtery hath continued <hi>hidden</hi> to Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>43. For God dwelleth not in this world in the Outward Principle,
but in the <hi>Inward:</hi> he dwelleth indeed, in the Place of this world, but
this world apprehendeth him not: how then will the Earthly Man appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the ſecret Myſteries of God.</p>
                  <p>44. And if a Man do apprehend them, he apprehendeth them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Inward Man,</hi> which is born of God again.</p>
                  <p>45. But ſeeing the Divine Myſtery will now more and more hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,
be laid ſo wholly open, and be ſo very <hi>apprehenſibly</hi> given to Man,
that he will very clearly apprehend the hidden ſecret: therefore it ought
by him to be well conſidered what it ſignifieth: Even the <hi>Harveſt</hi> of this
world, for the beginning hath found the End: and the Middle is ſet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſeparation.</p>
                  <p>46, Let this be told to you ye Children, who would inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God: there is a time of Great Earneſtneſs or <hi>ſeverity</hi> at Hand:
the Floar ſhall be purged, Evil and Good ſhall be ſevered one from another:
The Day <hi>Dawneth,</hi> this is highly known.</p>
                  <p>47. When we will ſpeak of Man, and rightly underſtand, out of what he
is made; we muſt Conſider of the Deity, together with the Being of All
Beings or Subſtance of all Subſtances; for Man was Created according
to the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of God, out of all the Three Principles; a totall Image
and Similitude, according to all Beings or Subſtances.</p>
                  <p>48. He muſt not be an Image of this world only; for this worlds
Image is <hi>Beastial;</hi> and for the ſake of <hi>no</hi> Beaſtiall Image, is God become
Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:61375:16"/>
49. For neither did God create Man to live thus in a Beaſtial Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as we now live in <hi>after</hi> the Fall, but in the Paradiſicall, in the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Life.</p>
                  <p>50. Man had no ſuch beaſtial Fleſh, but heavenly Fleſh, but in the Fall
<note n="*" place="margin">His Fleſh:</note>it <hi>became</hi> earthly and beaſtiall.</p>
                  <p>51. Neither are we to underſtand it in ſuch a ſence, that he had nothing
of this world in him: He had the Kingdom and <hi>Dominion</hi> of this world
in him; but the Four Elements ruled <hi>not</hi> in him; but the Four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were in One, and the Earthly Dominion lay hidden in him.</p>
                  <p>52. He ſhould live in the Heavenly ſource or Quality; and though all
was <hi>ſtirring</hi> in him, yet he ſhould rule with the Heavenly ſource or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the ſecond Principle over the Earthly; and the Kingdom and
the ſource or Quality of the Stars and Elements ſhould be <hi>under</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſical
ſource or Quality.</p>
                  <p>53. No Heat nor Froſt, no Sickneſs nor Miſhap or Miſchief, alſo no
fear ſhould touch him or terrifie him, <hi>his body</hi> could go through Earth
and Stone, uninterrupted by any thing.</p>
                  <p>54. For that would be <hi>no</hi> Eternal Man, which earthlineſs could limit,
which were thus fragile.</p>
                  <p>55. Therefore we ſhould rightly conſider of Man: It is not
Sophiſtry or Opinion that will do it, but knowing and <hi>Underſtanding</hi>
in the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>56. It is of neceſſity you muſt be born again, if you will <hi>ſee</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God again, out of which you are departed.</p>
                  <p>57. <hi>Art will not</hi> do it; but Gods <hi>Spirit,</hi> which ſets open <hi>the</hi> Doors
of Heaven to the Image of man, ſo that he can ſee
with Three Eyes.</p>
                  <p>58. For Man ſtandeth in a <hi>Threefold life,</hi> if ſo be he be Gods Child;
if not, he ſtandeth onely in a <hi>Two-fold</hi> life.</p>
                  <p>59. And it is ſufficiently known to us, that <hi>Adam</hi> is, with the right
<hi>Holy</hi> Image, which was the ſimilitude according to the holy Trinity,
gone forth out of the Divine Being or Subſtance, aud hath Imagined in
or according to the Earthlineſs, and hath brought the earthly Kingdom
into the divine Image, and <hi>darkned</hi> or obſcured it, and made it periſh,
whereupon alſo we then loſt our Paradiſical Seeing.</p>
                  <p>60. Alſo God hath <hi>withdrawn</hi> Paradiſe from <hi>Us,</hi> whereupon we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
then weak faint and feeble; and inſtantly, the Four Elements, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Conſtellations or <hi>Aſtrum</hi> in us became ſtrong and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſo that we are with <hi>Adam</hi> fallen home to them.</p>
                  <p>61. Which alſo is the Cauſe of the <hi>Woman,</hi> that God <hi>divided</hi> Adam,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61375:17"/>
when he could not ſtand, and parted him into <hi>two</hi> Tinctures, viz. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Fire and Water, as ſhall be mentioned here following; the
one affording ſoul, the other Spirit.</p>
                  <p>62. And <hi>after</hi> the fall Man became a beaſtial Being or Subſtance, who
muſt propagate after a Beaſtial property or kind; and then the Heaven
and Paradiſe as alſo the Deity, became a Myſtery to <hi>Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>63. VVhereas yet the Eternal continued <hi>in</hi> Man, viz: the Noble ſoul,
but <hi>covered</hi> with an Earthly Garment, and darkned, and infected with
the earthly ſource or quality, and poyſoned by the falſe or Evil Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
ſo that <hi>it</hi> was no more known to be Gods Child.</p>
                  <p>64. For the ſake of which, God became Man, that he might deliver
it from the Dark Earthlineſs again, and bring it again into Heavenly
<hi>Subſtantiality,</hi> in Chriſts Fleſh and Blood, which filleth the Heaven.</p>

                  <p>4. And, into the Man which the word <hi>Fiat Created,</hi> was the <hi>Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Spirit,</hi> out of the Three Principles and ſources or qualities breathed
in to be his life; viz: he was Created by a Threefold <hi>Fiat;</hi> underſtand the
Corporeity or Subſtantiality; and the will of the Heart of God, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the Spirit into him, according to all the <hi>Three</hi> Priuci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
underſtand it, as followeth.</p>
                  <p>5. Man was created totally after the ſimilitude of God, God manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61375:17"/>
himſelf in the Humanity in an <hi>Image,</hi> which ſhould be as himſelf.</p>
                  <p>6, For, God is ALL; and All is proceeded from him; and yet all is
not called God, therefore, <hi>becauſe</hi> all is <hi>not</hi>
Good.</p>
                  <p>7. For, as far as concernes the Pure Deity, God is a light-flaming
Spirit, and dwelleth in Nothing but onely <hi>in himſelf;</hi> Nothing is like
him.</p>
                  <p>8. But as far as concerns the property of Fire, out of which the light
is generated; we apprehend that the property of the Fire is <hi>Nature,</hi> which
is a Cauſe of the Life, Moving, and of the Spirit; elſe there would
be no Spirit, alſo no Light nor Being or Subſtance, but an Eternal<note n="*" place="margin">Vacuum void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ceſſation privation or Negation.</note> 
                     <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
neither Colour nor virtue, but all would be an Abyſs wſthout Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Subſtance.</p>
                  <p>9. Although yet the light of the Majeſty dwelleth in the Abyſs, and
is <hi>not</hi> apprehended by the fiery Nature and property; For as to the Fire,
and Light, we are to Underſtand as followeth.</p>
                  <p>10. The Fire hath and maketh a terrible and <hi>Conſuming</hi> ſource and
Quality or torment: now in the ſource or quality and torment, there
is a ſincking down like a <hi>dying,</hi> or free yieldiug up it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>11. That free yeelding up it ſelf falleth into the liberty, without or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the ſource or quality or torment, as into <hi>Death;</hi> and yet is no
Death, but it ſo goeth a degree deeper down into it ſelf, and becometh
free from the ſource or quality or torment of the fires Anguiſh; and yet
hath the <hi>ſharpneſs</hi> of the Fire, yet not in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
but in the<note n="*" place="margin">Or Joy.</note> Liberty.</p>
                  <p>12. And then the Liberty and the Abyſs, is a Life, and becometh a
Light in it ſelf; for it getteth the Flaſh of the Anguiſh Source or Quality
or torment; and becometh <hi>deſirous,</hi> viz: of the Subſtantiality.</p>
                  <p>13. And the Deſiring impregnateth it ſelfe with ſubſtantiality out of
the Liberty and <hi>Meekneſs:</hi> For, in that the Anguiſh ſource or quality or
torment, ſinketh or entreth in, it rejoyceth that it is free from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh;
and draweth the joy into it ſelf, and goeth with its will <hi>out</hi> from it
ſelf, which is the Life and<note n="†" place="margin">The Holy Spirit.</note> Spirit of Joy.</p>
                  <p>14. For which, here we had need of an <hi>Angels</hi> Tongue: yet hereby we
will give to the Reader that loveth God, a ſhort <hi>explanation,</hi> to conſider
of; for the underſtanding of the Heavenly Subſtantiality.</p>
                  <p>15. For, in God, All is power Spirit and Life; But whatſoever is Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Subſtance, that is <hi>not</hi> Spirit; but that which ſinketh down
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61375:18"/>
from the Fire, as into <hi>Inability,</hi> that is Being or Subſtance.</p>
                  <p>16. For, the Spirit ariſeth in the Fire, but it ſevereth it ſelfe into two
Sources or Qualities: as one into the Fire, and one in the <hi>ſincking</hi>
down into the Liberty, into the Light.</p>
                  <p>17. This is called God; for it is Meek and Lovely, and hath in it
ſelf the Kingdom of Joy; and the Angelical world is underſtood in the
<hi>ſunk down Liberty</hi> of the Subſtantiality.</p>
                  <p>18. Therefore when we were gone out from the Liberty of the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Subſtantiality, into the Dark ſource or quality, whoſe Abyſſe was the
Fire, then there was <hi>no</hi> Remedy, unleſs, the Lights power and Word, as
a word of Divine Life, became a Man, and brought us out of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
through the fire ſource or quality, through the <hi>Death</hi> in the fire, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again
into the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the divine Life, into the divine Subſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                  <p>19. And <hi>Therefore</hi> muſt Chriſt dye, and with the ſoul-Spirit go
through the Fire of the Eternal Nature, viz: through<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>Hell</hi> and the fierce
wrath of the Eternal Nature, and enter into the Divine Subſtantiality;
and break open a way for our ſouls through the Death and Anger; through
which, <hi>we may</hi> with, and in, him, enter through death into the Eternall
Life.</p>
                  <p>20. But concerning the divine Subſtantiality, viz: concerning the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Corporeity,</hi> we are to underſtand as followeth.</p>
                  <p>21. VVe underſtand that the Light giveth Meekneſs, viz: <hi>Love:</hi> Now
the fires anguiſh deſireth Meekneſs, that it may ſlake its great Thirſt, for
the fire is deſirous, and the Meekneſs is giving, for it giveth it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>22. Thus in the deſiring of Meekneſs, cometh to be <hi>ſubſtance</hi> or Being,
viz; a ſubſtantial<note n="*" place="margin">Weſenheit.</note> Eſſentiality: which is ſunk down from the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrath,
which giveth its own Life <hi>freely,</hi> and that is Corporeity, for out
of the power in the Meekneſs, it becometh ſubſtantial, and is, by the
Aſtringency as by the Eternal <hi>Fiat,</hi> attracted or put on and retained.</p>
                  <p>23. And is therefore called Subſtantiality or Corporeity; becauſe it is
<hi>ſunk</hi> down from the fire ſource or quality and Spirit, and is in reſpect of
the ſpirit as mute or inanimate, Dead and <hi>impotent;</hi> whereas Yet, it is an
<hi>Eſſential</hi> Life.</p>
                  <p>24. Underſtand us aright thus,: when God created the Angels, there
were onely <hi>Two</hi> Principles manifeſted and in Being or Subſtance; viz:
that in the Fire, and that in the light; viz: One in the fierce wrathful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality
in the ſtern aſtringent <hi>Fiat,</hi> with the forms of the fires Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>25. And then that in the Heavenly ſubſtantiality, out of the Holy
Power, with the water ſource or quality of Meekneſs of the Life of <hi>Joy:</hi>
in which the divine <hi>Sulphur,</hi> as in the Love and Meekneſs; was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated;
its <hi>Fiat</hi> was Gods deſiring will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:61375:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
26. Out of this divine Subſtantiality, <hi>viz:</hi> out of Gods Nature, the
Angels <hi>as Creatures</hi> were Created, and the ſource or quality of their
Spirit and Life, ariſeth in the Fire.</p>
                  <p>27. For without Fire no Spirit <hi>doth ſubſist:</hi> and if it go out of the
Fire into the Light, there it obtaineth the love ſource or quality, and
the fire becometh onely a <hi>cauſe</hi> of its Life: but the fires fierceneſs becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
quenched with the Love in the Light.</p>
                  <p>28. But <hi>Lucifer</hi> diſpiſed this, and continued in the Fire-Spirit, and
ſo Elevated himſelf alſo and kindled the ſubſtantiality in <hi>his Place,</hi>
out of which Earth and Stone came to be; and he was thruſt out; and
ſo the <hi>Third</hi> Corporeity and the Third Principle began, together with
the Kingdom of this world.</p>
                  <p>29. So when the Devil was thruſt out into the Darkneſſe, then God
Created <hi>another</hi> Image according to his ſimilitude, in this Place.</p>
                  <p>30. But if it muſt be Gods ſimilitude according to all the <hi>Three</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
then muſt it alſo be taken out of all the Three, and out of All
Beings or Subſtances of this Place or of <hi>this</hi> Deep: as far as the <hi>Fiat,</hi>
had with Lucifers Principality, given it ſelf into the Ether to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
                  <p>31. For, Man came in the <hi>sted</hi> of <hi>Lucifer:</hi> and hence ariſeth alſo the
Envy of the Devils, that they cannot afford Man that Honour: but
leade him continually into the <hi>Evil</hi> way of perdition, whereby they may
but increaſe their Kingdom: and they do it as a <hi>ſpite</hi> againſt the Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<hi>viz:</hi> the love of God, ſuppoſing that ſeeing they live in the fierce
ſtrong Might; that they are higher then the Spirit of God in the Love
and Meekneſs.</p>
                  <p>32. Underſtand it thus: Gods Will-Spirit <hi>viz:</hi> the Holy Spirit hath
compriſed the Two-fold <hi>Fiat</hi> in two Principles, <hi>viz:</hi> in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
world the Inward, and in this outward world, the Outward, and
Created <hi>den Meſch oder Menſchen,</hi> as a <hi>Mixt</hi> perſon; for
<hi>The</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Or Maſs.</note> 
                     <hi>Mixture or Man,</hi>
he ſhould be an Image according to the Inward and outward world;
but ſhould with the inward ſource or quality, <hi>rule</hi> over the outward;
thus he ſhould have been the ſimilitude of God:</p>
                  <p>33. For, the outward Subſtantiality <hi>hung</hi> to the Inward, and
the Paradiſe grew through the Earth, and Men in <hi>this</hi> world
upon the Face of the Earth was in Paradiſe; for Paradiſical fruit grew
for him, till the Fall, when the Lord <hi>Curſed</hi> the Earth.</p>
                  <p>34. Then Paradiſe paſſed into the Myſtery, and became a Myſtery or
<hi>hidden</hi> ſecrecy to <hi>Man;</hi> whereas yet if he be born of God again, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Inward Man, he <hi>dwelleth</hi> in Paradiſe, but according to the
Outward he dwelleth in this world.</p>
                  <p>35. VVe are further to conſider the <hi>Beginning</hi> and Original of Man:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61375:19"/>
thus. God hath created his Body out of the<note n="†" place="margin">The Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> 
                     <hi>Matrix</hi> of the Earth, out
of which the Earth was Created.</p>
                  <p>36. All was <hi>together</hi> one in another, and yet parted it ſelf into Three
Principles of a Threefold Subſtantiality; and <hi>yet</hi> that in the fierce wrath
was not known.</p>
                  <p>37. Now if Adam had continued in Innocency, he had lived the
<hi>whole</hi> time of this world only in Two Principles, and had ruled with
one over all, and the fierce wrathful Kingdom had not been known or
<hi>manifested</hi> in Him, though indeed he had it in him.</p>
                  <p>38. And we are to underſtand furthee; that Adams Body was Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
out of the <hi>Inward</hi> Element, wherein the Inward Firmament and
Heaven together with the Heavenly Eſſences, do lye, as to <hi>one</hi> Part, by
the Inward <hi>Fiat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>39. And, as to the <hi>other</hi> Part he was created by the outward <hi>Fiat,</hi> out
of the <hi>outward</hi> Four Elements, and out of the Conſtellation or <hi>Aſtrum;</hi>
for in the <hi>Matrix</hi> of the Earth, they ſtood one among another; The
Paradiſe was <hi>therein,</hi> and the Body was created alſo in Paradiſe.</p>
                  <p>40. Underſtand us aright: He had divine and alſo Earthly <hi>Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality</hi>
on him, but the Earthly was impotent and as it were ſwallowed up
in the Divine.</p>
                  <p>41. The Subſtance or matter out of which the Body was Created was
a <hi>Maſs,</hi> or Lump of fire and water, together with the<note n="*" place="margin">Out-going ſubſtantial working po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties:</note> Eſſences of Both
thoſe principles, although the Firſt alſo lay therein, but <hi>not</hi> ſtirring.</p>
                  <p>42. Every Principle, ſhould continue in its ſeat, and ſhould not
mixe, even as is done in God, and then Man were a <hi>Total</hi> Image accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Gods Being or Subſtance.</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Of the Breathing-in of the Soul
and of the Spirit.</head>
                     <p>43. The <hi>Body</hi> is a ſimilitude according to Gods ſubſtantiality; the <hi>Soul</hi>
and <hi>Spirit</hi> are a ſimilitude according to the Holy Trinity,</p>
                     <p>44. God gave the Body his ſubſtantiality <hi>out of</hi> the Three Principles;
and the Spirit together with the Soul, out of the <hi>fountain</hi> of the Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Spirit of the All-Being All-Subſtantial Deity.</p>
                     <p>45. And thus we are to underſtand, that the ſoul, with its Image,
and with its outward Spirit, is <hi>proceeded</hi> out of three Principles and
breathed and introduced into the Body: as <hi>Moſes</hi> witneſſeth;<note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 2. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>God
breathed into Man the living Breath into his Nostrils, and ſo Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a living ſoul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:61375:19"/>
46. But now the Breath and Spirit of God is Threefold, <hi>viz:</hi> in a
Threefold ſource or <hi>Quality.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>47. In the firſt Principle it is a <hi>fiery</hi> Breath and Spirit, which is the
true cauſe of the Life, and ſtandeth in the Fathers ſource or quality, <hi>viz:</hi>
in the Center of the fierce wrathful Nature.</p>
                     <p>48. And then in the ſecond Principle Gods breath or Spirit, is the
<hi>light</hi> flaming love-ſpirit, <hi>viz;</hi> the true ſpirit of the True Deity, which
is called God the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>49. And in the Third Principle, as in the ſimilitude of God, Gods Breath
is the <hi>Aire</hi>-ſpirit upon which the Holy Ghoſt rideth; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith:
<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 1. 2.</note>
                        <hi>The Lord rideth upon the Wings of the Wine:</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith,<note n="†" place="margin">Pſalm. 18. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>The
Spirit of God moved upon the Water;</hi> that is upon the <hi>Capſula,</hi> or
incloſure, where the Aire ariſeth.</p>
                     <p>50. Now this Threefold Spirit, hath the total God out of all the
Three Principles, introduced and <hi>Breathed</hi>-in, into the Created
Image.</p>
                     <p>51. <hi>Viz:</hi> Firſt, the Fire Spirit, he hath introduced into him from
<hi>within,</hi> and not at the Noſtrils, but in the Heart in the <hi>Twofold Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi>
of the inward and outward Blood; although the Outward was not
known or diſcerned, but was a Myſtery, But the Inward was ſtirring,
and had Two <hi>Tinctures, viz:</hi> one out of the Fire, and one out of the
Light.</p>
                     <p>52. This Fire-ſpirit is the true Eſſential ſoul, for it hath the <hi>Center</hi>
of Nature with its four formes for its fiery might; It ſtriketh up the
fire, it ſelf, and it ſelf maketh the wheel of the <hi>Eſſences,</hi> as in the<note n="*" place="margin">The three Principles.</note> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and<note n="†" place="margin">The Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Life.</note> Third Book is mentioned at Large.</p>
                     <p>53. And thou art to know, that the Eſſential Souls-fire is <hi>not</hi> the true
Image according to the Deity; It is no Image, but a <hi>Magical</hi> perpetual
enduring Fire.</p>
                     <p>54. It hath had <hi>no</hi> beginning: alſo
it will have <hi>no</hi> End.</p>
                     <p>55. And underſtand: That God hath introduced the Eternal Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-leſs
Fire, which hath been from Eternity in it ſelf in the Eternal <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi>
as in the willing of God in the deſiring of the Eternal Nature, as an
Eternal Center of the <hi>Genetrix:</hi> for this Image ſhould be a Similitude
of or according to <hi>him,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>56. And ſecondly, in like manner it is, with the Eſſential ſouls-Fire; the
Holy Spirit hath introduced the Light-flaming <hi>Love-ſpirit</hi> out of it
ſelf, and that even in the Second Principle, wherein the Deity is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
                     <p>57. <hi>Not</hi> in at the Noſtrils; but as Fire and Light hang one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61375:20"/>
and are <hi>One;</hi> but in <hi>two</hi> ſources or qualities: thus was the Good
Love-ſpirit, together with the Eſſential Fire-ſpirit introduced into his
Heart.</p>
                     <p>58. And each ſource or quality, brought its own <hi>Tincture</hi> along with
it, as a peculiar Life of its own; and in the <hi>Love-Tincture</hi> the right true
Spirit is underſtood; which is the Image of God, which is a ſimilitude
according to the clear true Deity, which reſpecteth the whole Man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
alſo filleth the whole Man, but in its <hi>own</hi> Principle.</p>
                     <p>59. The ſoul, as to what purely belongeth unto it; is a Fire-Eye, or
a <hi>fire-Looking-Glaſs;</hi> wherein the Deity hath manifeſted it ſelf accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the firſt Principle, <hi>viz:</hi> according to <hi>Nature,</hi> for it is a Creature,
and yet Created in no ſimilitude.</p>
                     <p>60. But its Image which it bringeth forth out of its fire-Eye into the
Light, that is the True Image or Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for the ſake of which God became Man, and introduced it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
out of the fierce wrath of the Eternall Nature <hi>in Ternarium ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum</hi>
into the Holy Ternary.</p>
                     <p>61. And we are to underſtand further, thus, concerning the ſoul and
its Image: It is indeed <hi>together</hi> a Spirit; but the Soul is a hungry fire,
and muſt have ſubſtantiality, elſe it will be a hungry Dark valley, as the
Devils are become ſuch.</p>
                     <p>62. Thus, the ſoul maketh Fire and <hi>Life;</hi> and the meekneſs of the
Image maketh Love and heavenly <hi>ſubſtantiality;</hi> thus the ſouls fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
Meekened and ſatiated with Love.</p>
                     <p>63. For the Image hath water out of Gods fountain, which floweth
into Eternal life, the ſame is <hi>Love</hi> and Meekneſs, and it receiveth that
out of the Majeſty of God: As is to be ſeen in a kindled Fire; that the
<hi>fire</hi> in it ſelf is a fierce wrathful ſource or quality, and the <hi>Light</hi> is a
Meek amiable ſource or quality: and that, in the deep of this world, out
of Light and Aire, water cometh to be; this is thus alſo, in a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                     <p>64. Thirdly, God hath in like manner at once, breathed-in, the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
of this world, with the ſource or quality of the Stars and Elements,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Aire,</hi> into Man, into his <hi>Nostrils;</hi> that ſhould be a ruler in the
outward Kingdom, and open the wonders of the
<hi>outward</hi> VVorld; to which End alſo God created Man in the
Outward Life.</p>
                     <p>65. But the Outward Man ſhould <hi>not</hi> reach into the Image.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:61375:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
66. And the Image of God, ſhould <hi>not</hi> lodg the outward Spirit in it
ſelf; and ſuffer that to rule over it.</p>
                     <p>67. For its food was from the <hi>Word</hi> and power of God: and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Body had paradiſical food <hi>not</hi> from the Sack of Wormes, for it had
not that.</p>
                     <p>68. Alſo he had neither the form nor ſhape of Maſculine or Feminine,

                     <p>69. And he ſhould generate another Man out of himſelf according to

                     <p>70. He was a Lord over the Stars and Elements, a <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of God;
as God dwelleth in the ſtars and Elements and they apprehend not him:
he ruleth over all: thus was Man Created alſo.</p>
                     <p>71. The Earthly ſource was <hi>not</hi> wholly ſtirring in him; he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Aire-ſpirit; but the Heat and Cold ſhould not touch him, for
the ſubſtantiality of God preſſed through <hi>all;</hi> as the Paradiſe preſſed and
ſprouted through the Earth; ſo ſprouted the Heavenly ſubſtantiality in
the outward Being or Subſtance of his Body, and outward Spirit. <hi>In
God,</hi> that, was very poſſible, which to us, in the earthly Life ſeemeth
ſtrange.</p>
                     <p>72. Fourthly, thus <hi>Adam,</hi> with the introducing of his fair Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Image into the ſpirit of God, hath together <hi>received</hi> the Living word
of God, which was the food of his ſoul and Image: that living Word
was <hi>ſurrounded</hi> with the divine Virgin of wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>73. And you are to know, that the ſouls Image, ſtood
in the Virgin-like-Image, which
was <hi>diſcovered</hi> in the Deity from
Eternity.</p>
                     <p>74. And the <hi>pure Image</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> was out of the wiſdom of God:
for, God would thus behold and manifeſt himſelf in an Image; and that
was the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> according to God; underſtand, according to Gods
Spirit: according to the Number Three; a Total <hi>chaſt</hi> Image, like the
Angels of God</p>
                     <p>75. And in this Image, <hi>Adam</hi> was the childe of God; not a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

How it would have been if Man had
continued in Innocency.</head>
                  <p>1. MAny Objections hath the Devil framed, whereby he would Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
himſelf; ſaying God hath Creatted him <hi>thus</hi> as he is;
whereas his Angelical form which he <hi>once</hi> had, alwaies <hi>convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth</hi>
him, that he is a Lyer.</p>
                  <p>2. And thus he alwaies doth to the poor fallen Man, he introduceth
alwaies the Earthly Kingdom with its <hi>power</hi> and ability into him; that
ſo he may have a conſtant looking Glaſs before him, that <hi>he alſo</hi> may
blame God, as if he had created him earthly and Evil.</p>
                  <p>3. But he leaveth out the <hi>best, viz:</hi> Firſt, the Paradiſe, in which Man
was created; and then Secondly, Gods Omnipotence; that<note n="†" place="margin">Deut. 8. 3. Mat. &amp; Luk. 4. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
not by bread onely, but</hi> alſo <hi>from the</hi> Power and <hi>Word of God:</hi> and
Thirdly, that Paradiſe with its ſource or quality ruled over the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</p>
                  <p>4. He ſheweth Man onely his <hi>Hard</hi> miſerable fleſhly Naked form or
Condition: but the form or Condition in Innocency, wherein <hi>Adam</hi>
knew not that he was Naked; he covereth or concealeth <hi>that,</hi> to ſeduce
Man.</p>
                  <p>5. And ſo, he would have <hi>this</hi> very much concealed, from us poor
Children of <hi>Eve:</hi> and though the Earthly<note n="*" place="margin">Or Carcaſs.</note> Sack is not worthy to know
it; yet it is very Neceſſary for our <hi>Minds</hi> to know it.</p>
                  <p>6. So it is alſo neceſſary for us to fly to the True <hi>Door Keeper who hath
the Key</hi> to Open it, to pray to him, and yeeld up our ſelves wholly to
him; deſiring him that he will yet vouchſafe to open to us, the Paradiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Gate in the <hi>Inward Center</hi> of our Image, that the Paradiſical Light
might ſhine to us in our Minds, that ſo we might become longing to
dwell with our IMMANUEL again, with the Inward and <hi>New Man</hi>
in Paradiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:61375:21"/>
7. For, <hi>without</hi> this Opening, we underſtand Nothing of Paradiſe
and of our Image which we had in Innocency.</p>
                  <p>8. But being Chriſt the Son of God hath generated us again to the
Paradiſical Image; we ſhould <hi>not</hi> be ſo <hi>remiſs,</hi> to rely upon Art and
earthly Reaſon: for ſo we find no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Paradiſe and Chriſt; who muſt <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Man</hi> in us, if we will ever ſee God; in our Reaſon, it is all but
Dead and Blind.</p>
                  <p>9. VVe muſt go out from Reaſon, and <hi>enter</hi> into the becoming Man
or Incarnation of Chriſt, and then we ſhall be taught of God; and then
<hi>we have</hi> power to ſpeak of God, Paradiſe, and of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>10. And in the Earthly Reaſon, which onely proceedeth from the
Conſtellation or <hi>Aſtrum,</hi> we are but <hi>Fools</hi> in the preſence of God if we
will ſpeak of the Heavenly Myſtery; for we ſpeak of a Thing which we
have <hi>not</hi> ſeen or known.</p>
                  <p>11. But even a Childe knoweth its Mother, ſo alſo every one that is
born of God again, <hi>knoweth</hi> his Mother, not with Earthly Eyes, but
with divine, with the Eyes of the Mother from whom he is born: this
we preſent to the true hearted Reader to conſider, what he is to do; and
from what mind and apprehenſion or <hi>underſtanding,</hi> we will write.</p>
                  <p>12. Reaſon of the outward world, will needs hold, that God Created
Man in the outward Dominion, in the ſource or quality of the fiery
Stars and four Elements; but if that were ſo, then he was Created in the
<hi>Angniſh</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. For, the ſtarry Heaven hath its <hi>limit;</hi> when it attaineth that, it
leaveth the Creature; of which it was a leader; and then that Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninion
and Beeing or Subſtance of the Creature paſſeth away which
was <hi>ſubject</hi> to the outward Heaven.</p>
                  <p>14. And we ſee very well, how we fall away and dye when the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Heaven with the Elements, <hi>leave</hi> us, ſo that even a Child in the
Mothers womb is clearly old enough to dye: alſo oftentimes it periſheth,
while it is yet <hi>without Life,</hi> and in the <hi>Fiat</hi> of the outward Dominion,
is in the coming to be a Body, before the <hi>Center</hi> of Nature ſtriketh
up the Fire of the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>15. And thus by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, we clearly know the Dying and Death;
that <hi>Adam</hi> as ſoon as he became Earthly, <hi>dyed as to Paradiſe,</hi> and was
dead to the Kingdom of God: therefore then the
Regeneration was neceſſary for us,
elſe we could not become Living again.</p>
                  <p>16. But ſeeing God did <hi>forbid</hi> Adam the Earthly fruit which was
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61375:22"/>
mixt, not to touch it, and alſo ereated onely one Man with Maſculine
and Feminine Properties, with both <hi>Tinctures,</hi> as of the fire, and of the
Light in the Love; and brought him inſtantly into Paradiſe, yea he
was <hi>Created in Paradiſe:</hi> therefore we cannot give way to Reaſon, which
by the Devils Infection or inſtigation, ſaith, that Man was Created
<hi>Earthly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. For whatſoever was ſolely Created from the Earthly life, or from
the Earthly ſource or quality, that is <hi>Beastial,</hi> it hath beginning and
End, and reacheth not the Eternity, for it is not out of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>18. And that now, which is not out of the Eternity, that is, <hi>tranſitory,</hi>
and onely a looking Glaſs wherein the Eternal wiſdom hath beheld it
ſelf as in a <hi>Figure</hi> and ſimilitude.</p>
                  <p>19. There remaineth thereof nothing elſe but a <hi>ſhadow</hi> without ſource
or quality and being or ſubſtance; it paſſeth away, as a wind, which hath
raiſed itſelf, and then lieth down again.</p>
                  <p>20. For <hi>ſuch</hi> a Creatures ſake, the word of God, is not become Fleſh:
the Eternal is <hi>not</hi> for the ſake of the Tranſitory entered into the tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſubſtantiality.</p>
                  <p>21. Alſo it is not therefore entred into the Earthly, that it would raiſe
and introduce the Earthly tranſitory, into the Power of the Majeſty; but
for the ſake of <hi>that</hi> which was proceeded out of the Power of the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty;
but was become evil and Earthly, and as it vvere <hi>extinguiſhed</hi> in
Death, that it might make it living again, and awaken, and lift it up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the power of the Majeſty, into that ſtate it was
in, <hi>before</hi> it was a Creature.</p>
                  <p>22. And we are to underſtand <hi>otherwiſe</hi> then we have hitherto done
concerning Man; having accompted him beaſtial: Indeed he <hi>became
Beaſtial,</hi> according to the property of this World; when he dyed in
<hi>Adam,</hi> from thence forward he lived to this world, and not to God.</p>
                  <p>23. But if he entered with his will-ſpirit into God, then the will-ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
would attain the Noble Image again, and according to the Image,
would <hi>live</hi> in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and according to the Beaſtial property, would live to
<hi>this</hi> world.</p>
                  <p>24. Thus he was in Death and yet was living, and <hi>therefore</hi> Gods
word Became Man, that it might unite him into God again, that he
might be <hi>totally</hi> born again in God.</p>
                  <p>25. VVee are to conceive of the Paradiſical Image thus; we ſay and
apprehend, that <hi>Adam</hi> was Created <hi>Good,</hi> pure, and immaculate: as
was alſo <hi>Lucifer</hi> and his <hi>Hoaſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61375:22"/>
26. He had pure eyes, and that Two-fold: for he had <hi>both</hi> kingdoms
in him, viz: Gods Kingdom and the Kingdom of this world.</p>
                  <p>27. But as God is Lord over all, ſo ſhould <hi>Man alſo</hi> in the power
of God, be Lord over this world; for as God ruleth in all and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
through all, imperceptibly to the <hi>Thing;</hi> ſo could the hidden
divine Man preſs into all, and ſee all.</p>
                  <p>28. Indeed the outward<note n="*" place="margin">Man.</note> was in the Outward;<note n="†" place="margin">World.</note> but he was <hi>Lord</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ver the outward, it was <hi>under</hi> him; it could not ſubdue him, he could
break the <hi>Rocks</hi> without any prejudice to him.</p>
                  <p>29. The <hi>Tincture</hi> of the Earth was <hi>wholly</hi> known to him, he ſhould
have found out all the Wonders of the Earth: for to that end he was
alſo created in the outward; that he ſhould manifeſt in figures, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
into work, what was ſeen in the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
wiſdome, for he had the Virgin wiſedome <hi>in</hi> him</p>
                  <p>30. Gold Silver and the Pretious Metalls are indeed alſo out of the
<hi>Heavenly Magia,</hi> thus incloſed and ſhut up by or with the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
they are another thing then Earth; Man loveth that well and
uſeth it for his maintenance; but he knoweth <hi>not</hi> its ground and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal;
it is not in vain, loved by the Minde; it hath a <hi>high</hi> Original,
if we would conſider of it.</p>
                  <p>31. But we are juſtly ſilent of it <hi>here;</hi> ſeeing Man wthout that
loveth it <hi>too</hi> much, and <hi>thereby</hi> withdraweth himſelfe from the ſpirit of
God.</p>
                  <p>32. One ſhould not love the Body more then the Spirit, for the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
is the Life: this we give you to underſtand in a ſimilitude, and
are ſilent of the <hi>Matter</hi> with the ground and Original thereof.</p>
                  <p>33. But know this, that it was given to Man for his Sport and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament,
he had it by the right of Nature; it was his, underſtand,
the <hi>outward Bodyes,</hi> for the outward Body with its <hi>Tincture,</hi> and the
Metalline <hi>Tincture,</hi> are near a kind.</p>
                  <p>34. But when the <hi>Tincture</hi> of the outward Body, was deſtroyed by
the Devils Evil longing; then the Metalline <hi>Tincture,</hi> hid it ſelfe alſo
from the Humane, and became an enemy to it; for it is purer then the
periſhed in the outward Man.</p>
                  <p>35. Let this be manifeſted to you, ye <hi>Seekers</hi> of the Metalline <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi>
If you would find the <hi>Philoſophers ſtone,</hi> then apply your ſelves

for it hath a great agreement with the heavenly ſubſtantiality; which
if it were releaſed from the fierce wrath, would be very <hi>well</hi> ſeen.</p>
                  <p>36. Its luſtre ſignifieth ſomewhat, ſo that, if we had paradiſicall eyes,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61375:23"/>
we ſhould well apprehend it: The <hi>Minde</hi> ſheweth it us indeed, but
the underſtanding and full knowledge, is dead as to Paradiſe.</p>
                  <p>37. Therefore ſeeing we <hi>uſe</hi> that Noble thing, to the diſhonour of
God, and to the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of our ſelves; not to honour God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
and to enter with our Spirit, into the Spirit of God, but leave the
Spirit, and cleave to the ſubſtantiality, <hi>therefore</hi> is the Matalline Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
become a Myſtery, for we are become <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to it.</p>
                  <p>38. Man was created, that he ſhould be a Lord of the <hi>Tincture,</hi>
and it was ſubjected to him; and he became its ſervant, and alſo ſtrange

                  <p>40. For, the Devil <hi>would</hi> be Chief Great Prince, with his fierce
wrath in the heavenly ſubſtantiality, therefore it was ſhut up from him,
and <hi>became</hi> Earth and Stone, ſo that he is not Prince, but a Captive

of Paradiſe.</p>
                  <p>51. The Divine ſubſtantiality ſprouted through the Earthly, and
had <hi>halfe</hi> ſwallowed up the Earthly in the Paradiſical fruit, ſo that the
fruit was not known to be Earthly; and therefore it was called Paradiſe,
as a ſprouting <hi>through</hi> the Anger, where the love of God ſprouted
through the Anger and bare fruit; as the Language of Nature clearly
uuderſtandeth the ſame, without any Expoſition or far fetch'd Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>52. And thus we are further to underſtand, <hi>how</hi> God dwelleth in
this world; and the world is as it were ſwallowed up in him; It is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent</hi>
in him, and he <hi>Omnipotent;</hi> thus was Man alſo, and thus he
did Eat, his earthly Eating was heavenly.</p>
                  <p>53. As we know that we muſt be born again, ſo the Paradiſical
fruit; was <hi>born again</hi> out of the Anger into the Heavenly Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.</p>
                  <p>54. Or, as we ſee, that a good ſweet hearb, groweth out of the <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
Earth, which the Sun qualifieth, or cauſeth to be otherwiſe, then the
Earth had qualified or cauſed it to be: ſo the Holy Man qualified the

up as <hi>Nothing,</hi> and ſtirred not Man at all.</p>
                  <p>55. Or, as we know, that the Earth ſhall at the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

did eat the fruit in the Mouth; and needed no Teeth for that, for
there was the dividing of the Power.</p>
                  <p>56. There were <hi>Two Centres,</hi> of the power in <hi>Adams</hi> Mouth, each
took its own; the Earthly was changed into a Heavenly ſource or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
as we know, that<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 51. 52.</note> 
                     <hi>we ſhall be changed</hi> as to our Bodies, and be
turned into a Heavenly powerful Body; thus alſo was the tranſmutation
in the Mouth.</p>
                  <p>57. And the Body received the Power; for<note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>the Kingdom of God
conſiſteth in Power,</hi> and thus Man ſtood clearly in the Kingdome of
God, for he was immortal and a Child of God.</p>
                  <p>58. But if he ſhould have Eaten thus into the Guts, and have had
Such a <hi>Stink</hi> in his Body, as we now Have; I will ask a Reaſon,
whether that were Paradiſe, and whether Gods Spirit did dwell in that;
whereas Gods Spirit was to dwell in <hi>Adam,</hi> as in the Creature of
God.</p>
                  <p>59. His <hi>labour</hi> in Paradiſe upon the Earth was Child-like, but with
heavenly Wit or Ingenuity <hi>underſtanding</hi> and skil; he might plant
Trees, alſo other Plants, all according to his pleaſure: in <hi>all</hi> there
would grow to him Paradiſical fruit, and all would be pure to him, he
did what he would, and did all right.</p>
                  <p>60. He had no Law, but onely the Law of the <hi>Imagination</hi> or long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pleaſure and delight: that he was to place with or by his Spirit, in
God, and ſo he ſhould have continued <hi>Eternally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>61. And although God had <hi>changed</hi> the Earth, yet he had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without neceſſity, and Death, all would be but changed into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Subſtantiality.</p>
                  <p>62. So alſo is to be underſtood concerning his drinking, the <hi>inward</hi>
Man drank the Water of Eternal Life, out of Gods Beeing or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and the <hi>outward</hi> drank the Water upon the Earth.</p>
                  <p>63. But as the Sun, and the Air, ſuck up the water, and yet is not
filled with it; ſo it was alſo in Mans <hi>Mouth,</hi> it ſeparated it ſelfe in the
Myſtery.</p>
                  <p>64. As we conceive and certainly know, and it is the whole Truth,
that God Made all things out of Nothing but onely out of his <hi>Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
ſo all whatſoever was Earthly ſhould in Mans Mouth, go again into that
which it was <hi>before</hi> the Creation of the World.</p>
                  <p>65. The Spirit and power <hi>thereof</hi> belonged to Man, but not an
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61375:24"/>
Earthly Body: for God had once created him a Body which was Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and needed no Creating more.</p>
                  <p>66. Hee, underſtand, <hi>Adam,</hi> was a Princely <hi>Throne,</hi> made out of
Heaven Earth Stars and the Elements, as alſo out of Gods Beeing or
Subſtance: A Lord of the World, and a Child of God.</p>
                  <p>67. Obſerve this ye Philoſophers, it is the true ground and highly
known; Mingle no School <hi>fictions</hi> with it; it is clear enough; Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
doth it not, but the true Spirit born of God knoweth it <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>68. All Opinion without knowledge, is an Earthly folly, and here
underſtandeth Earth and the four Elements; But <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth
the One Element onely, wherein the four lie hidden.</p>
                  <p>69. Not four, ſhould rule in <hi>Adam,</hi> but the One over the four, the
Heavenly Element over the four Elements of this world: and <hi>thus</hi>
we muſt be againe if we will poſſeſſe Paradiſe; for which
things ſake God is become Man.</p>
                  <p>70. Let this be told you Ye, School-Diſputers or wranglers, ye <hi>go
about</hi> the Circle and enter not within, as the Cat about the ſcalding
Broath, which is afraid of the burning Heat, ſo are <hi>ye</hi> afraid and aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
before the fire of God.</p>
                  <p>71. And as little as the Cat eateth the ſcalding Broath, but goeth
about ſmelling at the <hi>Edg</hi> thereof: ſo little alſo doth Man eat the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſical
fruit, unleſs he go out from Adams <hi>skin</hi> which the Devil hath
defiled, and enter again into the regeneration of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>72. Hee muſt Enter <hi>within</hi> the Circle, and caſt away the skin of
Reaſon; and then he attaineth Humane Wit or Ingenuity and <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhanding,</hi>
and Divine skil and knowledge: No learning doth it; but
to be born or regenerated in it.</p>

                  <p>1. IFwe will rightly deſcribe the Becoming Man or Incarnation, of
JESUS CHRIST; it is neceſſary that we ſhould ſet down the
<hi>Cauſe, why</hi> God is become Man.</p>
                  <p>2. It is no ſmall cauſe, or for nothing, as the Jewes and the Turks
look upon it, the Chriſtians alſo are <hi>halfe dumb</hi> concerning it: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it muſt needs be a great Cauſe, wherefore the unchangeable God
hath moved himſelfe: Therefore obſerve this, we will <hi>ſet you down the</hi>
Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>3 Adam was<note n="*" place="margin">Or, One.</note> 
                     <hi>a</hi> Man, and * <hi>an</hi> Image of God, * <hi>a</hi> whole ſimilitude
according to God; although<note n="†" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>God is no Image,</hi>
he is <hi>the Kingdom, the Power, alſo the Glory</hi> and the Eternity; All
in All.</p>
                  <p>4. Yet the Deepe without ground, longed or pleaſed to manifeſt it
ſelfe in <hi>Similitudes,</hi> as indeed there were <hi>ſuch</hi> manifeſtations
which were done from Eternity
in the wiſdome of God, as in a Virgin-like <hi>Figure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Which yet was <hi>no Genetrix;</hi> but a Looking-Glaſs of the Deity,
and of the Eternity, in the Ground or <hi>Byſs</hi> and in the <hi>Abyſs,</hi> an Eye
of the Glory of God.</p>
                  <p>6. And according to that Eye, and in that <hi>Eye</hi> the Thrones of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
became Created; viz: the Angels and in the End, Man; he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
the Throne in himſelfe as being Created out of the Eternall <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi>
out of Gods Beeing or Subſtance, out of the Nothing into ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
out of the Spirit into Body.</p>
                  <p>7. And as the Eternal <hi>Magia</hi> Generated him out of it ſelfe, into an
<hi>Eye of the Wonders</hi> and Wiſdom of God: ſo he ſhould and could
generate another Man out of himſelfe after a Magical manner, without
dividing or rending of his Body.</p>
                  <p>8. For he was conceived in Gods longing Pleaſure or delight, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61375:25"/>
the <hi>Deſire of God,</hi> had generated him and brought him forth; and ſo
he alſo had that ſame longing, to his own impregnating of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>9. For, <hi>Venus's Tincture</hi> is the <hi>Matrix</hi> which was Impregnated
with the ſubſtantiality, viz: with <hi>Sulphur</hi> in the Fire, which yet in <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus's</hi>
Water cometh to Beeing or Subſtance.</p>
                  <p>10. The Fire <hi>Tincture,</hi> giveth Soul; and the Lights <hi>Tincture</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
Spirit; and the Water, viz: the ſubſtantiality giveth Body: and
<hi>Mercurius,</hi> viz: the <hi>Centre</hi> of Nature, giveth the wheele of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences,
and the Great life, in the Fire, and Water, heavenly and
Earthly; and the <hi>Sal</hi> or Salt Heavenly and Earthly, holdeth it in the
Beeing or Subſtance, for it is the <hi>Fiat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. For, as Man hath the Outward Conſtellation or <hi>Aſtrum</hi> in
him, which is his Wheel of the outward worlds Eſſences and <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the
Minde: ſo alſo he hath the Inward Conſtellation or <hi>Aſtrum</hi> of the
Centre of the fiery Eſſences, as alſo in the ſecond Principle; he hath
the Light flaming Divine Eſſences.</p>
                  <p>12. He had the whole <hi>Magia</hi> of the Beeing of all Beeings or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of all Subſtances in him; it was the poſſibility in him, he could
generate Magically; for he loved himſelfe, and deſired his likeneſſe again
out of his <hi>Centre,</hi> As he was Conceived from Gods deſire, and brought
forth by the <hi>Genetrix</hi> in the <hi>Fiat;</hi> ſo ſhould he alſo have brought forth
his Angelical or Humane Hoaſt.</p>
                  <p>13. But, whether they ſhould all have been generated out of <hi>One,</hi>
viz: out of that one Princely Throne; or <hi>ſucceſſively</hi> all one out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is not needfull to be known, for the limit is broken: we have
<hi>enough</hi> in the Knowledge, in that we know what we are, and what our
Kingdom is.</p>
                  <p>14. Indeed I find in the Deep in the Centre, that one ſhould have
<hi>proceeded</hi> out of the other: for the Heavenly Centre hath its Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
as well as the Earthly, which always ſtrike: where the Wheele
with all the Three Principles always goeth, and always one wonder <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
it ſelfe after another.</p>
                  <p>15. Thus was Mans Image alſo found and contrived wherein the
wonders lie <hi>without number:</hi> they ſhould be opened by the Humane
Hoaſt.</p>
                  <p>16. And clearly in Time, one Greater Wonder <hi>is</hi> opened in one
then in another; all according to the Heavenly and Earthly Birth, and
wonderful Variation or Alteration: as is done alſo at this very day;
that in One <hi>more</hi> Art and underſtanding of the Wonders lyeth then in
an other.</p>
                  <p>17. Therefore I <hi>conclude,</hi> that one man ſhould have been generated and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61375:26"/>
proceeded from another: for the ſake of the Great Wonders, and for the
pleaſure delight and joy of Man wherein a Man would have brought
forth <hi>his like.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18. Thus ſhould the Humane Generations have ſtood in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating,
<hi>till</hi> God had ſet the Third Principle of this World again, in
its own Ether.</p>
                  <p>19. For it is a Globe with Beginning and End, for the beginning
reacheth to the End, that the laſt <hi>may paſſe</hi> into the Firſt; thus all is
finiſhed ond entire.</p>
                  <p>20. And then will the Middle again be cleared, and goe <hi>again</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that which it was before the Times of this world, even all but the
Wonders, which continue in Gods wiſdom in the <hi>great Magia,</hi> ſtanding,
as a ſhadovv of this World.</p>
                  <p>21. Now ſeeing Adam was ſo Glorious an Image; moreover in the
ſted and place of extruded <hi>Lucifer,;</hi> the Devil would not allow or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
him <hi>that,</hi> but Envied it vehemently, and ſet his Vizard and <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination</hi>
alwayes before Adam: he ſlipt alſo with his Imagination in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Earthlineſſe of the fruit: and Imagined or repreſented before
Adam as if Great Glory did ſtick in his <hi>enkindled</hi> Earthlineſs.</p>
                  <p>22. Though indeed Adam did not know him, for he came not in
his own Form, but the forme of the Serpent, as in the <hi>form</hi> of a Sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Beautiful Cunning Beaſt, and Managed his Apiſh Sport like a
Fowler, who deceiveth the fowles and ſo catcheth them.</p>
                  <p>23. So did he alſo, he <hi>infected</hi> the Earthly Kingdom with his diſeaſe
and venome of Pride, and halfe killed it, as is to be ſeen in Earth and
Stones, which though ſo very much diſeaſed venomed and full of vanity,
yet would very<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 8. 20. 22</note> 
                     <hi>fain be looſed from the vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. And when<note n="†" place="margin">The Earth.</note> it found that Adam was a child of God, and had
the <hi>Glory</hi> and the Power, then it Imagined or longed vehemently after
Adam, together with the Kindled Anger of God, that alſo Imagined
or longed after Adam, to delight it ſelfe in this living Image.</p>
                  <p>25. All drew Adam and would have him; the Kingdom of Heaven
would have him, for he was created <hi>for it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>26. Alſo the Earthly Kingdom would have him, for it had <hi>one part</hi>
in him; it would be his <hi>Lord,</hi> ſeeing he was but a Creature.</p>
                  <p>27. Alſo the fierce wrath, ſet open its Jawes, and would be <hi>Creaturely</hi>
and ſubſtantial, to ſatiate its great fierce hunger.</p>
                  <p>28. And thus ſtood Adam in the Trial or <hi>Proba for forty Dayes,</hi> ſo
long as Chriſt was tempted in the Wilderneſs, and Iſrael on Moant
<hi>Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>i,</hi> when God gave them the Law, to ſee whether it were poſſible,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61375:26"/>
that this people, could in the Fathers ſource or quality in the <hi>Law,</hi> ſtand
before God.</p>
                  <p>29. And whether Man could have <hi>continued</hi> in Obedience, ſo as to
have ſet his Imagination<note n="*" place="margin">Or into: that is, Imagine or think like God.</note> upon God; ſo that God ſhould not have <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
to become Man; for which cauſe, God did ſuch wonders in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
that man might ſee, that there is a God, and ſo love and feare
him.</p>
                  <p>30. But the Devil was a lyar and deceiver, and <hi>ſeduced</hi> Iſrael, ſo that
they made a Calf, and worſhipped it for God, now ſeeing it was <hi>not
poſſible</hi> for Iſrael to ſtand; therefore * Moſes <hi>came from the Mountain
with the Tables, upon which the Law was written, and brake them, and
ſlew the worſhippers of the Calf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>31. So alſo muſt <hi>not Moſes</hi> bring this People, into the promiſed
Land, it could not be; JOSUA and laſtly JESUS muſt do it, who
ſtood in the Temptation before the Devil and the Anger of God,
who overcame the Anger and brake <hi>Death</hi> in peeces, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did the
<hi>Tables</hi> of the Law.</p>
                  <p>32. The firſt Adam now could not ſtand, though the Kingdom of
God ſtood before his Eyes and he in <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> yet Gods Anger was
ſo very much inflamed, that it drew Adam; for he was <hi>too much</hi> kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the Earth through the Devils Imagination and ſtrong wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                  <p>33. Now ſaith Reaſon: Had the <hi>Devil</hi> ſo great Might? yes deare
Man: <hi>Man</hi> had it alſo, he can throw down Mountains, if he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſtrongly with his Imagination.</p>
                  <p>34. The Devil was alſo out of the great <hi>Magia</hi> of God, and a Prince
or King of this Throne, and Entered into the ſtrongeſt Might of the
Fire, in a will and entention to be a Lord over <hi>all</hi> the Hoaſt of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>35. Thus the <hi>Magia</hi> became kindled, and the Great <hi>Turba</hi> Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that had wreſtled with Adam, to try, whether he would be ſtrong
enough, to <hi>poſſeſſe</hi> the Devils Kingdom, and to rule in the ſame, with
other Sources or Qualities.</p>
                  <p>36. This, Adams Rational Spirit did not underſtand, but the <hi>Magick
Eſſences</hi> ſtrove againſt one another, whence the whole Luſt and the
will did exiſt, till Adam began and Imagined after the Earthlineſs, and
would have earthly fruit.</p>
                  <p>37. There all was done: then his Noble Image, which ſhould eat
onely of the word of the Lord, became <hi>infected</hi> and Obſcured.</p>
                  <p>38. And ſo then inſtantly grevv the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61375:27"/>
Tree of Temptation; for Adam had <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired</hi>
it and given way for it.</p>
                  <p>39. Then Adam muſt be tempted, to try whether he could ſtand, for
the ſtern Commandment came <hi>from God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>40. <hi>And God ſaid:</hi> Thou ſhalt Eat of every Tree in Paradiſe, but
of the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evill thou ſhalt not eat: for
the day that thou eatest thereof, thou ſhalt dye the Death, <hi>that is, dye to
the Kingdom of Heaven and become Earthly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>41. And Adam knew the Commandement well, and alſo did <hi>not</hi> eat
thereof; but he Imagined thereinto, and was captivated
in his <hi>Imagination,</hi> alſo quite powerleſs, alſo faint and weak, till he
was overcome, then he fell down and <hi>ſlept.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>42. Thus he fell home to the <hi>Magia;</hi> and his Glory was at an End;
for the <hi>ſleepe</hi> ſignifieth Death and a being overcome; for the Earthly
Kingdom had overcome him, it would rule over him.</p>
                  <p>43. The Kingdom of the Starres would have <hi>Adam,</hi> and bring forth
<hi>its</hi> Wonders by him, for there was no other Creature ſo highly gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
and dignified as Man, which <hi>could</hi> attain the Kingdom of the
Starres.</p>
                  <p>44. Therefore <hi>Adam</hi> was drawn, and rightly Tempted, to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he could be a Lord and King, over the Starres and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>45. The <hi>Devill</hi> was buſie, he ſuppoſed he ſhould overthrow Man,
and bring him into his power, whereby this Throne would at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
to be his Kingdom.</p>

                  <p>47. For <hi>if</hi> Adam <hi>had</hi> generated Magically, then he had continued in
Para<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iſe upon Earth, and that the Devil did not like, he was not able
to endure that, it did not reliſh with him in his Kingdom; for it did not
<hi>ſmell</hi> like brimſtone and fire, but like Love and Sweetneſs: Then
thought the Devil, if thou Eateſt not of <hi>that Plant,</hi> then I my ſelfe ſhall
not continue a fiery Lord.</p>
                  <p>48. Thus the Fall of Adam ſtuck wholly in the Earthly Eſſence, and
<hi>loſt</hi> the heavenly Eſſence, out of which the divine Love floweth, and
he attained the Earthly Eſſence, out of which, wrath Malice poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

49. Alſo, he could <hi>no</hi> more <hi>eat</hi> after a Paradiſical Manner, but he
Imagined after the forbidden fruit, wherein Evil and Good were mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as at this day <hi>all fruits</hi> on Earth are
mixed.</p>
                  <p>50. Thus the four Elements became ſtirring and qualifying or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him: for his will with its <hi>Imagination</hi> took the Earthly Kingdom
in the Souls fire for a Lodging.</p>
                  <p>51. Thus he went away from the Spirit of God into the <hi>Spirit</hi> of
the Starres and Elements, that received him and rejoyced it ſelfe in
him, for it was now living and mighty in him; <hi>before</hi> it muſt be in
<hi>ſubjection</hi> and ſervitude, but now it gat the Dominion.</p>
                  <p>52 There the Devil made <hi>merry,</hi> and derided God: but he knew
not what lay behind, he knew not at all of the Cruſher of the Serpent,
who ſhould <hi>take away</hi> his Throne and break his Kingdome in

                  <p>53. Thus Adam ſunk down into ſleepe in the <hi>Magia,</hi> for God ſaw
that he could not ſtand; therefore he ſaid</p>

                     </p>

follow upon it.</p>
                     <p>65. Behold, If I take away the Light from the Fire; then Firſt the

it is Good; and when it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſheth,
it is Nothing.</p>
                     <p>66. Now behold further: <hi>what</hi> would remain of the Fire if I ſhould
take away the Light and Luſtre from the Fire? Nothing but a dry
hunger and a <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> it looſeth the Eſſence and ſource or quality,
it hungreth, and yet is nothing; the <hi>Sulphur</hi> which it had is a Death;
it conſumeth it ſelfe while there is any Eſſence left; and when there is
no more, it <hi>becometh Nothing,</hi> an Abyſs, wherein there is not the leaſt
footſteps or remainder of Any thing.</p>
                     <p>67. Now dear ſeeking Minde; conceive of it but thus; <hi>God</hi> is the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61375:28"/>
Eternal Light; his power and ſource or quality, dwelleth in the Light,
the Light cauſeth Meekneſs, and out of the Meekneſs cometh Being or
Subſtance; <hi>that</hi> Beeing or <hi>Subſtance</hi> is Gods Beeing or Subſtance, and
the Source or Quality of the Light is the Spirit of God, which there
is the<note n="*" place="margin">Original.</note> 
                        <hi>Underſtanding:</hi> there is no other God then this: in the Light
is the Power, and the Power is the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>68. But Now the Light and the Power have onely a <hi>Love-will;</hi> it
deſireth not Evil; indeed it deſireth Beeing or Subſtance, but from
or out of its own Eſſence: underſtand out of the love and <hi>ſweetneſs,</hi>
for that is conformable to the Light.</p>
                     <p>69. But yet the Light ariſeth from the Fire, and <hi>without</hi> the <hi>fire</hi> it
would be Nothing; without that, it would have no Eſſence; the Fire
maketh Life and Mobility, and is <hi>Nature.</hi> Yet it hath <hi>another</hi> will then
the Light, for it is Covetous and willeth onely to Conſume, it taketh
and receiveth onely, and climeth up aloft in <hi>Pride.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>70. The Light receiveth not but <hi>Giveth,</hi> that the Fire may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved:
the ſource or quality of the Fire is fierce wrath; its Eſſences are
<hi>Bitter,</hi> its Sting is enimicitious and unpleaſant.</p>
                     <p>71. It is an Enmity in it ſelfe, it conſumeth it ſelfe: and
if the Light did not come to <hi>help</hi> it,
it would devour it ſelf, ſo that out of it would be <hi>Nothing:</hi> Dear ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Minde, conſider <hi>this,</hi> and thou wilt ſoon come to the Limit to
Reſt.</p>
                     <p>72. God is from Eternity, the Power and the Light, and he is called
God according to the <hi>Light,</hi> and according to the Power of the Light,
according to the Spirit of the Light.</p>
                     <p>73. Not according to <hi>the</hi> Fire-ſpirit, for that is called his fierce
<hi>wrath,</hi> his Anger, and is not called God, but the conſuming fire of the
Might and ſtrength of God.</p>
                     <p>74. The Fire is called <hi>Nature;</hi> the Light is not called Nature:
it hath indeed the Fires property; but <hi>changeth it</hi> out of fierce wrath
into Love, out of devouring Conſuming, into generating, out of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and hatred, &amp; bitter woe and Torment, into Meek weldoing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
amiable deſiring and a perpetual ſatisfying and fulfilling.</p>
                     <p>75. For, the Love deſire, draweth the Meekneſs of the Light into it
ſelfe: and is an impregnated Virgin; viz: with the Wit Ingenuity or
Knowledge and <hi>Wiſdome</hi> of the Power of the Deity.</p>
                     <p>76. Thus it is highly known to Us; what God and Nature is, as alſo
the<note n="*" place="margin">Or the Ground</note> Byſſe and Abyſſe, alſo the deep of Eternity; thus we apprehend,
that the Eternal Fire is <hi>Magical;</hi> and is generated in the deſiring
Will, as is mentioned in the Second and Third Book.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:61375:29"/>
77. Now ſeeing the Eternal Abyſs is Magical <hi>therefore</hi> that is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
alſo, whatſoever is generated out of the Eternal; for, out of the
Deſiring, all things are come to be: Heaven and Earth are Magical, and
the <hi>Minde</hi> with the <hi>Senſes</hi> or <hi>Thoughts</hi> are Magical: If we will but once
know, or underſtand our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>78. Now, what can the Light do, if the fire <hi>lay hold</hi> of ſomewhat
and devoureth it? ſeeing the Thing that is apprehended by the Fire, is
alſo <hi>Magicall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>79. Seeing then it hath a Life, and the Power and underſtanding
of the Light, <hi>why</hi> doth it then run into the Fire?</p>
                     <p>80. The Devil was indeed an Angel, and Adam an Image of God,
they had <hi>both the Fire and the Light,</hi> as alſo <hi>divine</hi> Wit Ingenuity
or <hi>Underſtanding</hi> in them: Why did the <hi>Devil</hi> Imagine according to
the Fire, and <hi>Adam</hi> according to the Earth? They were <hi>Free.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>81. The Light and Power drew <hi>not</hi> the Devil <hi>into</hi> the Fire, but
the fierce wrath of Nature; Why did the Spirit <hi>aſſent</hi> to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?</p>
                     <p>82. Whatſoever the <hi>Magia</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it ſelfe, that, it hath;
the Devil Made himſelfe Hell, and that he hath; and Adam made
himſelfe Earth, and that he is.</p>
                     <p>83. God is <hi>no</hi> Creature, alſo <hi>no</hi> Maker, but a Spirit and an <hi>Opener.</hi>
When the Creation was: we are to Conceive and apprehend of it
<hi>thus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>84. The Fire and Light had <hi>together</hi> at once awakened themſelves in
the pleaſure delight and Longing, and deſired a Looking-Glaſs or <hi>Image</hi>
according to the Eternity.</p>
                     <p>85. Moreover we have it in true knowledge, that the fierce wrath,
viz: the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Fire, is <hi>no</hi> Maker, that hath made Nothing
out of it ſelfe that is <hi>Subſtantial,</hi> for beſides that <hi>cannot</hi> be; but it
hath made <hi>Spirit</hi> and Source or <hi>Quality.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>86. But yet no Creature ſtandeth ſolely and barely in the Eſſence; if
a Creature be, it muſt be out of a <hi>Substance,</hi> viz: out of the power of
<hi>Sulphur;</hi> it muſt ſubſiſt in the Spiritual <hi>Sal,</hi> or Salt; and then out of

Moreover it muſt have a Glance or Luſtre, if it be to have <hi>understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
or knowledge in it.</p>
                     <p>87. Thus we know that all Creatures, ſtand in Spiritual <hi>Sulphur
Mercurius</hi> and <hi>Sal;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">* Or Subſtance</note> and muſt not be <hi>onely</hi> Spirit, but it muſt be <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur;</hi>

wherein the <hi>Fiat</hi> ſtandeth, viz: the ſoure <hi>Matrix</hi> to the <hi>Centre</hi>

                     <p>88. <hi>That is,</hi> it muſt be ſubſtance, for, where there is no Subſtance,
there is alſo, no <hi>Creating;</hi> whereas yet a Creaturely Spirit is no pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable

                     <p>89. <hi>So then</hi> if the Devil drew fierce wrathfulneſs, into him, and Man
Earthlineſs, what could the Love of the Subſtantiality of God, do
to that: The Devil had indeed the Love and Meekneſs of God
with the divine Subſtance <hi>ſet before him</hi> and offered to him, as alſo to
Man, who will blame, God, now.</p>
                     <p>90. But the fierce wrathful Eſſence was <hi>too ſtrong,</hi> ſo that it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the love Eſſence; what can God doe to that? if a good branch
be planted, and periſheth; what can the Earth do to that: It giveth
thereto <hi>Sap</hi> and Virtue, why doth <hi>not</hi> the Branch draw the ſame
to it?</p>
                     <p>91. Thou wilt ſay; its Eſſences are <hi>too weak,</hi> but what can the
Earth do to that, and he alſo, who hath planted that branch: his will is
to produce a good Tree for his pleaſure and delight, and would eat of
its fruit: but if he knew that the branch would <hi>periſh,</hi> he would never
plant it.</p>
                     <p>92. Thus we are to apprehend, that the Angels are Created not as one
that ſetteth a Tree; but with the <hi>Moving</hi> of God, with both the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
as Light, and darkneſs; in which the Fire lay hidden; yet the
fire did <hi>not burn</hi> in the Creating and in the Moving, as <hi>yet</hi> at this day
it doth not burn, for it hath a principle of it own.</p>
                     <p>93. Why did <hi>Lucifer</hi> kindle <hi>That,</hi> the will exiſted out of
his Creature, and not without or beyond him; he
would be a Lord over Fire and Light, he would extinguiſh the Light,
and Contemned the Meekneſſe and would be a <hi>Fire-Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>94. And when he deſpiſed the Light, and his birth in Meekneſs,
then he was <hi>juſtly</hi> thruſt out: thus he loſt Fire and Light and muſt
dwell in the Abyſs in the darkneſs; if he will have fire, he muſt ſtrike
it up for himſelfe, and kindle it with his<note n="*" place="margin">Or Evilneſs.</note> Malice or Malignity in the
<hi>Imagination.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>95. Which yet doth not burn rightly to him, but onely in the <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential</hi>
fierce wrathful ſource or quality, as the four forms in the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre</hi>

that is the <hi>fourth</hi> Form.</p>
                     <p>97. Now if there be no meekneſſe, or ſubſtance of Meekneſs, then it
giveth <hi>no</hi> light, but onely a Flaſh, for the Anguiſh willeth to have the

and yet hath no ſtability or Ground.</p>
                     <p>98. Thus, the Devil muſt dwell in the Darkneſs, and hath onely
the fierce <hi>wrathful Flaſh</hi> in him, alſo the whole form or Condition in
his dwelling is onely a fierce wrathful Flaſh;<note n="*" place="margin">As if it ſent forth Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts.</note>

                     <p>99. Thus we are to underſtand alſo in a <hi>Similitude,</hi> concerning the

would have <hi>Adam;</hi> for it knew in <hi>Adam</hi> the divine Power.</p>
                     <p>101. And ſeeing it was by the Devils Kindling <hi>become</hi> earthly; but

Liberty; therefore it drew Adam
ſo that he Imagined.</p>
                     <p>102. And thus <hi>Adam</hi> Luſted againſt the Command and will of

an Angel, ſo that, if he ſhould fall, and not ſtand hee might helpe
him.</p>
                     <p>105. So that he might not periſh in the fierce wrath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Lucifer</hi> did,
therefore he was Created out of Matter, and his Spirit was introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into the <hi>Matter,</hi> viz: into a <hi>Sulphur</hi> of water and fire, that God

                     <p>106. Thus also was the purpoſe of God; being he knew that he

                     <p>107. That is; when <hi>Lucifer</hi> fell, then was not the foundation of

                     <p>108. But being he ſhould be made out of Three Principles; there
was imminent danger in reſpect of the kindled <hi>Sulphur</hi> of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and though indeed he was Created above the Earth; yet he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
out of the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of the <hi>Earthly</hi> Matrix; as a fair bloſſome out

                     </p>

friend, then <hi>forſake</hi> thy Enmity and hatred, and go to the Father; and

                     <p>121. Therefore; whoſoever layeth the blame on <hi>God:</hi> is a <hi>lyar</hi> and
<hi>Murtherer,</hi> as well as the Devil.</p>
                     <p>122. Art thou the Maker of thy own ſelfe? <hi>Why</hi> doſt thou make thy

beſtowed his heart and Spirit upon thee; <hi>take that</hi> to you in your <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi>
and you <hi>make</hi> your ſelfe Good.</p>
                     <p>123. But if thou takeſt Covetouſneſs and high-mindedneſs, as alſo
Voluptuouſneſs and pleaſure of the Earthly Life; what ſhould God do

                     <p>124. But if thou ſayeſt; I am of an Evil ſource or quality; and

126. The Evil ſource or quality is out of or from the Earth, if the
Earth <hi>get</hi> the Body, then it may take away its Evil, but thou art and
remaineſt to be one Spirit with and in the will of God; in <hi>his

                     <p>128. Concerning the Evil Body which ſticketh full of <hi>Evill Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi>
there is not much to be done: if it be inclined to Evill,
do it the <hi>leſs</hi> good; give it <hi>no occaſion</hi> to wantonneſs.</p>
                     <p>129. To keep it in ſubjection is a good <hi>Remedy;</hi> to be full and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
is at length, to make the <hi>Aſs</hi> perfectly to wallow in the <hi>Mirc,</hi>
where it defileth it ſelfe ſufficiently like a Swine.</p>
                     <p>130. <hi>To be ſober,</hi> and to lead a Temperate life, is a Good purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the Evil Aſs, <hi>not</hi> to give it that it luſteth after, to let it <hi>faſt often,</hi>
ſo that it may <hi>not</hi> hinder Prayer, that is good for it; it, is not willing,

that draweth them continually with <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe, and with

                     <p>132. But thou ſhouldeſt <hi>not</hi> lay the blame on God; if thou doſt
thou art a Lyar, and an Enemy of the Truth; God willeth no Evil,
alſo there is <hi>no Evil Thought</hi> in him: he hath only one Source or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and that is, Love and Joy.</p>
                     <p>133. But his fierce wrath, viz: <hi>Nature,</hi> hath many Sources or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;
therefore let every one have a care what he doth, every Man is

how God by the Curſe hath withdrawn
Paradiſe from him.</head>
                  <p>1. WHen Man became weary and tired, he fell into a ſleep, viz: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Magia,</hi> it was with him as if he were not in this world,
for all his Senſes or Thoughts ceaſed, the wheel of the <hi>Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
paſſed into a Reſt.</p>
                  <p>2. He was as it were Eſſential <hi>Not</hi> Subſtantial, he was altogether like the
<hi>Magia;</hi> for he knew nothing of his Body; he lay, as dead, but was not
Dead, but<note n="*" place="margin">The Spirit of the Body.</note> the Spirit ſtood ſtill.</p>
                  <p>3. And then the Eſſences have their <hi>Effect,</hi> and the Spirit of the ſoul
onely ſeeth or diſcerneth; and there is <hi>pourtrayed</hi> in the ſydereal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
all whatſoever the ſtarry heaven bringeth forth.</p>
                  <p>4. And ſtood Magically, in the Mind as a Looking-Glaſs on which the
Spirit of this world<note n="†" place="margin">Or is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.</note> 
                     <hi>Gazeth;</hi> and conveigheth whatſoever it ſeeth in
the Looking-Glaſs into the <hi>Eſſences;</hi> and the Eſſences<note n="*" place="margin">Qualifie or operate.</note> flow forth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
<hi>as if</hi> they did perform the work in the Spirit, and pourtray it
in the Spirit: which are <hi>Dreames</hi> and Repreſentations, or
<hi>Figures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Thus, we are to know, that when the Earthlineſs wreſtled with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
and that he Imagined thereinto; he became inſtantly infected
thereby, and in his <hi>Minde</hi> became dark and ſtern.</p>
                  <p>6. For the Earthlineſs began to qualifie or operate like water, that
beginneth to <hi>ſeeth</hi> by the fire: the ſource or quality of the Starres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſtirring, and were now, Lord, of the Body.</p>
                  <p>7. And now Moſes ſaith very right<note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 2. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>God ſuffered a Deep ſleep to

God let him fall down; for he brought with the Imagination earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

into the heavenly Subſtantiality, and that, the Spirit of God which
is a Spirit of Light, <hi>would not have.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. For, Adams Spirit was a <hi>Creature,</hi> and proceeded forth out of
Gods <hi>Love-ſpirit:</hi> therefore indeed it did not willingly leave him; but
the Earthlineſs had already captivated him.</p>
                  <p>9. And when <hi>that</hi> left him, then he ſank down in impotency, and fell
home to the Third Principle, viz: to the Starres and the Four Elements
thus he lay in the Earthly <hi>Magia,</hi> and was not yet wholly Earthly.</p>
                  <p>10. He lay in the <hi>Mystery,</hi> between the Kingdom of God and of
this world, where both the <hi>Fiat's</hi> viz: the divine and the Earthly, were
ſtirring in him: and now the Two Kingdoms, viz: of God and of Hell,
were firſt in <hi>ſtrife</hi> about Man.</p>
                  <p>11. And ſo now, if the dear Name JESUS, had not been<note n="*" place="margin">Or Imaged.</note> incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
in Adam, even <hi>before</hi> his Creation, as in the ſubſtantiality of

he would indeed have ſlept <hi>still</hi> and have beene in the Earthly
Death.</p>
                  <p>12. And this is the cauſe; why the Second Adam<note n="†" place="margin">Math. 12. 40.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ,</hi> muſt <hi>reſt

or raiſe up the firſt Adam again out of the Earthlineſs.</p>
                  <p>13. For Chriſt had <hi>alſo</hi> a ſoul and ſpirit out of Adam, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Dear word of the Deity, together with Gods Spirit, awakened
and raiſed up again in Chriſts fleſh, the dead ſubſtantiality of the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur;</hi>
viz: the Body, which, in Adam, was dead; and <hi>put it again</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  </p>
                  <p>14. All thoſe which with their Faith and <hi>Imagination,</hi> in Chriſts

                  <p>15. And God, the Eternal word and power, will at the laſt day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
and raiſe up in himſelfe, with his ſpirit, the <hi>dead Body</hi> which
with <hi>Adam</hi> is fallen home to the Earth.</p>
                  <p>16. For, Chriſts ſoul and Fleſh, <hi>which is alſo</hi> our Soul and Fleſh;
underſtand it right, that part which <hi>Adam</hi> received out of the divine
ſubſtantiality: hath God, through and in the Death of Chriſt, <hi>ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>

the Time of the World, and Us, in and with him.</p>
                  <p>17. And we are onely <hi>wanting</hi> in our giving up our ſelves into it: in
that we <hi>ſuffer</hi> the Devil to with-hold us: for our death is broken, our

                  <p>27. Now when Adam was fallen aſleep, he lay in the Myſtery as in
Gods <hi>Wonder,</hi> what it did with him, that was done.</p>
                  <p>28. Thus the incorporated or Imaged Name JESUS moved the
<hi>Fiat</hi> again in two Forms, viz: in both the <hi>Tinctures,</hi> of the Fire and of
the Water.</p>
                  <p>29. For, this <hi>firſt</hi> Image was now fallen home to the Name JESUS
in the word of Life: and ſo now the word of Life was the <hi>Second</hi> Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
underſtand, with the incorporated or <hi>Imaged</hi> Name JESUS,
which would become Man: that ſevered the two <hi>Tinctures</hi> one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
viz: the <hi>Tincture</hi> of the Fire and of the Light.</p>
                  <p>30. Yet not wholly in the power, but in the ſubſtantiality; for, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
the Subſtantiality of the <hi>Tincture</hi> of the Light, was the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
of the Love, in which <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould and could impregnate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
The Fires <hi>Tincture</hi> gave ſoul, and the Lights <hi>Tincture</hi> gave
Spirit.</p>
                  <p>31. Viz: an Image according to the outward Image, the fire-Life I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined
after the Light-life: and the Light-life after the Fire-life:
viz: after the <hi>Eſſential</hi> power out of which the Light ſhineth.</p>
                  <p>32. This was in Adam, but <hi>One,</hi> for he was Man and<note n="*" place="margin">Or Woman.</note> Wife.</p>
                  <p>33. And the word of Life, took the <hi>Tincture</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> with the
heavenly and earthly <hi>Fiat,</hi> from Adam, alſo a Rib or Bone out of his
Side, as alſo the <hi>half Croſs</hi> in the Head.</p>
                  <p>34. Which is the <hi>Character</hi> of the Holy Trinity; Marked by the
word of Life, viz, with the Severe Name of GOD,<note n="*" place="margin">GoTTes.</note> GOTTES: which
beareth ſuch a Character. T.</p>
                  <p>35. T, ſignifying the Croſs of Chriſt; <hi>on which</hi> he ſhould ſuffer
Death; and New regenerate <hi>Adam</hi> again, and in the Name JESU,
introduce him <hi>in Ternarium Sanstum,</hi> into the Holy Ternary.</p>
                  <p>36. All theſe, the <hi>Fiat</hi> took into it ſelfe, together with all Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences
of the Humane property, as alſo the property of the ſouls Fire,
but in <hi>Venus's Tincture,</hi> not according to the might and ſtrength of
the <hi>Center;</hi> and Separated it into the whole form of Man.</p>
                  <p>37. Thus was the Woman built, with all Members of the feminine
properties, as they ſtill have them: For, the Spirit of the great world,
<hi>Spiritus Majoris Mundi;</hi> had now the ſtrongeſt <hi>Fiat,</hi> and figured the
woman in ſuch a form, as <hi>it</hi> could in poſſibility.</p>
                  <p>38. For the Angelical Form was gone: the <hi>propagation</hi> muſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61375:34"/>
now be in A Beaſtiall Manner.</p>
                  <p>39. And ſo alſo there was given to Adam, being he was fallen home
to the Earthly <hi>Magia;</hi> a <hi>beastial form</hi> and ſhape of Maſculine Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and Adams generating was given to the <hi>Fiat:</hi> and that maketh a
ſimilitude of him, out of him.</p>
                  <p>40. If he had continued heavenly <hi>Minded,</hi> then he had himſelf gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
heavenly; but now the Earthly <hi>Fiat</hi> did it; and his outward
body hecame a Beaſt; he loſt alſo the heavenly wit or <hi>underſtanding;</hi>
and the Power of the <hi>Omnipotency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>41. Beloved Reader thus thou art to know, that the Second Adam;
Chriſt hath <hi>not in vain</hi> ſuffered himſelfe to be Crucified, and with a
Speare to be pierced in his ſide, nor hath in vain ſhed his blood; here
lyeth the <hi>Key.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>42. <hi>Adam</hi> was broken in the Side by the Rib for the Woman, into
that very Side <hi>must Longinus's Speare,</hi> with Gods fierce
wrath, come; for it was come into Adam, and <hi>out</hi> of Maries earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
into Chriſts <hi>Side</hi> alſo.</p>
                  <p>43. And the Blood of Chriſt muſt <hi>drown</hi> the fierce wrath and take
it away from the <hi>Firſt</hi> Adam; for the <hi>Second</hi> Adam had alſo Heavenly
blood, that muſt drown the Earthly <hi>Turba,</hi> that the firſt Adam might
be whole again.</p>
                  <p>44. Let this be told you, ye Children of Men; for it is become
known <hi>in Ternario Sancto,</hi> in the Holy Ternary; and not in <hi>Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or Opinion: it concerneth both Soul and Body; take heed what
you do.</p>
                  <p>45. Thus now the humane propagation began in a beaſtial manner;
for Adam reteined the <hi>Limbus;</hi> and his Eve the <hi>Matrix</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi>
for, the the Tinctures were <hi>divided.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>46. So now Each Tincture is an<note n="*" place="margin">Whole.</note> entire or total <hi>Magia,</hi> viz: a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
longing, wherein the <hi>Centre</hi> of Nature is generated, and that in
the <hi>Sulphur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>47. Thus then in the <hi>Sulphur,</hi> is again the deſirous <hi>Magia,</hi> together
with the <hi>Tincture;</hi> and yet can not come to Life, except the Tincture
of <hi>Fire</hi> come into <hi>Venus's</hi> Tincture; and <hi>Venus's</hi> Tincture, can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
no Life, it is too weak, ſo that life cannot be therein.</p>
                  <p>48. And both the Tinctures deſire alſo the Life; and ſo the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>Imagination</hi> of Man and Wife, beginneth, ſo that the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth
to mix with the other.</p>
                  <p>49. For, the power of the Eſſences willeth to be living; and the
Tincture driveth on that, and deſireth the <hi>ſame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:61375:34"/>
50. For, the <hi>Tincture,</hi> is from or out of the Eternal Life, and yet
is ſhut in with the Subſtantiality: and in that reſpect it willeth to
live, as it hath done from <hi>Eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>51. And therefore the Man longeth after the <hi>Matrix</hi> of the Wiſe;
and the wife after the <hi>Limbus</hi> of the Man.</p>
                  <p>52. The Woman hath a <hi>Watery</hi> Tincture; and the Man, a <hi>fiery,</hi>
the Man ſoweth Soul, and the Woman Spirit; and both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

a Child.</p>
                  <p>53. And therefore ought to continue together; if they Once Mix;
for they are <hi>become</hi> one Body: and whoſoever mixeth with another or
ſeparateth from one another, they break the Order or <hi>Ordinance</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and ſuch a one is like a Brute beaſt, and conſidereth not that in
his <hi>ſeed</hi> the Eternal Tincture lyeth, wherein the divine Subſtantiality
lyeth hid: and in that regard; will one day, in the wrath-part, he <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>54. Alſo that is <hi>a work</hi> which will follow after Man in the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and its ſource or quality, will one day be made ſtirring in the
<hi>Conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>55. For, the Tincture, in the Seed, ariſeth out of the Eternity; it
is <hi>not</hi> tranſitory; it appeareth in the Spirits form, and paſſeth into
the <hi>Magia</hi> of Man; out of which it hath generated and ſhed forth
Man.</p>
                  <p>56. Mark this ye Whores and Whoremongers, what you work in
<hi>private</hi> Corners many times with great falſhood and wickedneſs,
that paſſeth into your Conſciences, &amp; becometh to you an Evil <hi>Gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Worm.</p>
                  <p>57. The Tincture is an eternall Subſtance; and it <hi>would</hi> fain be in
the Love of God; but if ye caſt it into a falſe or impure Veſſel in abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
and inordinateneſs, then it will <hi>hardly</hi> attain Gods Love, and
then it paſſeth with its Imagination again into the firſt Place, viz: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>58. If it be come to be falſe in a falſe Veſſel, ſo that it can not <hi>reſt;</hi>
then it will gnaw you indeed, and alſo paſs into the <hi>helliſh</hi> abyſs in the
<hi>Conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>59. It is not Fiction or jeſting Matter; be not ſo Beaſtial; for a Beaſt
hath its Tincture meerly from this world, but <hi>you</hi> not ſo, ye have it
out of the Eternity, and that which is Eternal dyeth <hi>not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>60. Though indeed you deſtroy the <hi>Sulphur,</hi> yet the will-Spirit
in the <hi>Sulphur</hi> with the Noble <hi>Tincture,</hi> paſſeth into the Myſtery; and
each Myſtery taketh that which is its own; and that Myſtery at the laſt

                  <p>61. Thus the great Mercy of God over all the Generations of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
is highly <hi>known</hi> to us, that God would help Man thus; elſe if

                  <p>62. But God knew well the Fall of Man, as alſo the <hi>Treachery</hi> of
the Devil, which thus with or by <hi>Eve</hi> was brought to deriſion; The
Devil ſuppoſed thus, when <hi>Adam</hi> fell down into a Sleep; Now I am
Lord and Prince upon Earth, but the ſeed of the Woman <hi>hindered</hi>
that.</p>
                  <p>63. We are to underſtand the awakening of Adam out of his ſleep;
he ſlept in the heavenly world, and <hi>awaked</hi> and to the Earthly world, the
Spirit of the great World awakened and raiſed him up.</p>
                  <p>64. Then he <hi>ſaw the Woman, and knew her,</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 2. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>that ſhe was his fleſh

and he looked upon her, and Imagined into her; for ſhe had gotten his

                  </p>
                  <p>65. Alſo <hi>Eve</hi> is known to be no Pure <hi>immaculate</hi> Virgin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as alſo all
her Daughters; The <hi>Turba</hi> hath deſtroyed the Virginity, and Made the

                  <p>66. For, Gods <hi>wiſdom</hi> is a pure Virgin; in which Chriſt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
and in a right Virgin-like Veſſel became Man, as hereafter will
follow.</p>
                  <p>67. Thus alſo could not the <hi>Earthly</hi> Virgin continue in Paradiſe;
though they were yet in Paradiſe, alſo they had both of them the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſical
Source or Quality; but mixed with Earthly longing.</p>
                  <p>68.<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 2. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>They were Naked,</hi> and had the beaſtial Members for propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>and knew it not, alſo</hi> they <hi>were not aſhamed:</hi> for the Spirit of the

Virgin of Gods wiſdom departed from them, and then they firſt felt the

                  <p>69. When the Spirit of God withdrew forth, then the Earthly Spirit
with the <hi>fierce</hi> wrathful ſource or quality, drew in, and there the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
gat an entrance and infected them, and brought them into the fierce
wrath and Evil Malice or <hi>Malignity:</hi> as it is ſtill at this day.</p>
                  <p>70. For, the wrath of God out of the Eternal Nature, which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
hath kindled and awakened, <hi>sticketh</hi> in the Earthly Centre: alſo,
no life can be generated, unleſs the <hi>Centre</hi> be awakened; for the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſtandeth in the Fire, wherein all Life ſtandeth: and the Centre of
Nature hath fierce wrathfulneſs in its <hi>forms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>71. Therefore it is this only that will do it: ſtoop and <hi>ſubmit</hi> thy ſelf,
and enter into Meekneſſe, and let
thy Life be right and juſt.</p>
                  <p>72. For, the Life is Fire, and the Lifes <hi>Image,</hi> which is the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
of God, that is in the Light, viz: in the Love-fire.</p>
                  <p>73. But the Love-fire doth not afford or give the <hi>Centre</hi> of Nature,
and therefore the Devil alwaies ſuppoſeth that he is a greater Lord then
the <hi>Creatures</hi> in the Love-fire.</p>
                  <p>74. Indeed he is more ſtrong or ſtern, but he liveth in the darkneſs;
and devoureth the ſtrong or ſtern Subſtantiality, into himſelfe, and
<hi>therefore</hi> alſo he is an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the Love.</p>
                  <p>75. And we are to know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Devil is in fault, and the Cauſe,
that Man was created in his ſtead; alſo, we are to know, that <hi>he</hi> is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                  <p>76. Although <hi>Adam</hi> and his <hi>Eve</hi> (when God had divided Adam)

                  <p>87. The <hi>whole World</hi> would have continued to be Paradiſe, if
Adam had Continued in Innocency, but when God pronounced the
Curſe, then Paradiſe departed.</p>
                  <p>88. For Gods <hi>Curſing,</hi> is fleeing: It is a fleeing, not departing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
but a going into another Principle, viz: <hi>into himſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>89. For the Spirit of God, proceedeth forth from God <hi>into</hi> the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality,
but when this Suſtantiality became Earthly, and that the
Devil dwelt therein, who was Gods Enemy, then the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61375:36"/>
paſſed into its own Principle; viz: into the Love; and departed out of
the Earthlineſs; and there it ſtandeth now preſented
to Man in the <hi>Light</hi> of Life.</p>
                  <p>90. So that whoſoever now <hi>deſireth</hi> to Enter into the Love of God;
let him go with his will-Spirit into Paradiſe; and then Paradiſe will
ſpring up again into or in his <hi>will-Spirit,</hi> and he will receive on-to
his Image again, the Heavenly Subſtantiality, in which the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<hi>ruleth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>91. Let <hi>this</hi> be a Pearl to you, ye Children of Men; for it is the
true Ground; whoſoever ſeeketh and findeth it, he hath meer Joy
therein: It is<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 13. 44. 46.</note> 
                     <hi>the Pearl</hi> which lyeth <hi>hid in the field, for which one
ſold all his goods and bought the Pearl, of which Chriſt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>92. Thus alſo we may know<note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 3. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>the Cherubine, which draw Adam
and Eve out of Paradiſe,</hi> viz: the ſtern or ſtrong Angel; which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
the Cutter off of the <hi>Earthly life</hi> from Paradiſe, where Body and
Soul muſt part aſunder.</p>
                  <p>93. It is indeed known to Us: that Adam and Eve, were driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
out of the place, where the Tree of Temptation ſtood; <hi>for,</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſical
fruit ſtood there; which they ſhould no more ſee nor Eat, for the
Heavenly <hi>belongeth not</hi> to the Earthly.</p>
                  <p>94. Alſo, the Beaſts were driven out, in reſpect of the Evil Tree;
for, they could not eat of the Paradiſical fruit: but of this Tree, <hi>Every
beaſt</hi> could Eat, for it was Earthly.</p>
                  <p>95. Thus muſt they leave Paradiſe: for God had clothed them,
through the Spirit of the Great World,<note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 3. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>with the skins of Beaſts</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of the Heavenly Clothing of clarity and brightneſs.</p>
                  <p>96. And he had pronounced their <hi>ſentence,</hi> what they ſhould doe

<hi>till they ſhould return</hi> altogether, <hi>to the Earth from whence they

                  <p>1. NOw then, Adam and Eve, ſtanding <hi>thus,</hi> as Man and Wife, in
Paradiſe; and having <hi>yet</hi> the heavenly ſource or quality and
Joy, though Mixed, the Devil could not endure that; for his
<hi>Envy</hi> was too great.</p>
                  <p>2. Seeing he had overthrown <hi>Adam,</hi> and brought down his Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
form: he looked now upon <hi>Eve,</hi> viz: the Woman out of Adam,
and thought: ſhe might conceive Children in Paradiſe, and remain in
Paradiſe, thou wilt therefore ſeduce her, that ſhe may eat of the <hi>forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

                  <p>3. <hi>Which he then alſo did, and perſwaded her to the Evil fruit, ſo
that</hi>

and gave alſo to Adam.</p>
                  <p>4. Now when Adam ſaw, that Eve did not Inſtantly fall down, and
dye, <hi>he did Eat alſo,</hi> for the Luſt was in both of them.</p>
                  <p>5. This is the Bitt, upon which Heaven and Paradiſe departed:
where the<note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 3. 24.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>6. His Sword was that of the <hi>destroying Angel,</hi> which now cutteth
Men with heart, cold ſickneſſe, neceſſity and Death; and at <hi>laſt</hi> cutteth
off the Earthly Life from the Soul.</p>
                  <p>7. When this Sword was to be broken in the Death of Chriſt, then

                     <hi>Thus alſo the Graves of the Saints, Opened; and their Bodies

                  <p>9. But here, when Adam and Eve, did eat the Earthly fruit, they
<note n="†" place="margin">Luk. 10. 30.</note>
                     <hi>fell among Murtherers, who wounded them</hi> and caſt them out; <hi>and
let them lie half dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. Their going forth out of Paradiſe, is the † <hi>going from Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
to Jerico:</hi> for they went out of Heaven into this Evil corrupt
World, into the houſe of Sinne.</p>
                  <p>11. Where inſtantly, in their Minds, in the <hi>Centre</hi> of Nature, the
wheel of the Senſes or Thoughts began to qualifie or Operate in the
Earthly ſource or quality: where one ſenſe or <hi>thought</hi> was againſt and
<hi>Contrary</hi> to the other, where Envy, Pride, Covetouſneſs, Anger and
Contrary oppoſite will, ſufficiently flowed forth upon heaps.</p>
                  <p>12. For, the Noble Light of Love, was extinguiſhed, which <hi>maketh</hi>
the fierce wrathful ſource or quality, amiable, friendly and meek, <hi>in
which,</hi> the ſpirit of God worketh, and the fair Virgin of Gods Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
reſteth; <hi>they</hi> went out from the fair Wiſdome.</p>
                  <p>13. God had created Adam in the chaſt Virgin of his Wiſdome:
but he became in the preſence and ſtead thereof, an Evil Earthly <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">By the word Woman under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Body: ſee the Three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, cap. 13. verſ. 1.</note>
Woman, with which he muſt live in this beaſtial form in meer
<hi>care</hi> anxiety and neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>14. And, out of his fair Garden of pleaſure, which he had in him,
there came an Oppoſite <hi>Thorny</hi> and <hi>Thistly,</hi> Garden; whence yet he
<hi>ſomewhat</hi> ſought the<note n="†" place="margin">Virginal.</note> Virgin-like fruit.</p>
                  <p>15. But it went with him as with a Theeſe, who hath been in a
fair Garden to keep it; but is for his Theft caſt out from it, and yet
would <hi>fain</hi> eat to fruit thereof, but cannot get in, but goeth round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the out-ſide, and reacheth over with his hand after the fruit, which
yet the Gardener <hi>ſnatcheth</hi> out of his hand again, and he muſt go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
lamenting, and cannot ſatisfie his Luſt or <hi>longing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>16. Thus it goeth alſo with him concerning the Woman, when he
was in Gods Love, and the Woman <hi>in him</hi> a <hi>chast</hi> Virgin, in Gods
Sweetneſs and Wiſdom, then he did eat of her fruit, and could very well
refreſh or delight himſelf with his own Love in the <hi>Matrix</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. For, the Fire-<hi>Tincture,</hi> hath a great Joyful recreating delight
in the Lights <hi>Tincture,</hi> and that he had in himſelfe, <hi>he</hi> was Man and
Wiſe.</p>
                  <p>18. But now he muſt go round without that Gardine, and touch
the <hi>Tincture</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> but with one Member, whereas yet the Inward
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61375:38"/>
                     <hi>Tinctures</hi> in the ſeeds receive one another, and labour to produce a
<hi>Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>19. But the outward Body is not worthy, that it ſhould enjoy the
<hi>Inward</hi> Joyful qualifying or operation, wherein the ſouls Life is
<hi>ſowen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>20. The inward Eſſence onely enjoy that; for they are out of the
Eternal; but the outward Beaſtial Aſs, bringeth or affordeth onely a
beaſtial Longing or Luſt.</p>
                  <p>21. He knoweth nothing of the Joy of the Eſſences; when one <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi>
cometh into the other, and what is done then: where there is yet
<hi>ſomewhat</hi> of Paradiſe; but the Earthly Eſſence mixeth it ſelf ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
therein, and it is but as a joyful <hi>Glimpſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>22. Wherein the will to Life, becometh generated, which afterwards
driveth on, and impregnateth it ſelfe with <hi>Sulphur,</hi> till it may reach
the Principle, and ſtrike up fire in the <hi>Centre,</hi> wherein then there is a
true Life, and again a Soul is generated.</p>
                  <p>23. Now when the fair Image <hi>thus</hi> departed away from Gods Love,
then it knew it ſelfe, that it was come into another Source or quality;
then began <hi>feare</hi> and terrour before the fierce wrath of God, for it began
to qualifie or operate in them, they looked one upon another and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi>
their Beaſtial form, and<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 3. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>that they were Naked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. And then ſure the Devil Danced, and God was derided, for<note n="†" place="margin">verſ. 8.</note> they
were afraid, and crept behind the Trees<note n="‖" place="margin">Or Braided the Stalks of the leaves together.</note> and took leaves from the fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees;
and wreathed them together, and held
them before their ſhame.</p>
                  <p>25. For, the heavenly Virgin was gone, they <hi>knew</hi> the fall and were
aſhamed: that is, the Soul, which is out of the Eternal, was aſhamed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the<note n="*" place="margin">Or Beaſtial Kind.</note> Beaſtlineſſe, as it is <hi>at this day,</hi> when we are aſhamed of our
beaſtial Members.</p>
                  <p>26. And <hi>hence</hi> it is, that the Woman Clotheth her ſelfe with a white
<note n="†" place="margin">Or white Apron.</note>covering before her ſhame: that the Spirit of the Soul, which
glanceth forth at the <hi>Eyes,</hi> be not diſturbed, for it knoweth the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix</hi>
of <hi>Venus,</hi> which alſo as ſuddenly in the Man or Maſculine begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to Imagine upon it or Luſt after it.</p>
                  <p>27. Which, if the Woman clotheth her ſelfe with Black, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
her Eyes, <hi>it not eaſily</hi> Effected; but <hi>onely</hi> by Imagining or Luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>28. But elſe, inſtantly both the Tinctures, of the Man and Wife
<hi>cath</hi> one the Other in the Eyes, where the Spirit glanceth forth.</p>
                  <p>29. <hi>Now, when Adam and Eve ſtood thus in terrour, before the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61375:38"/>
of God,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 3. 9. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>God, cattel Adam, and ſaid; Adam where art thou? and
be ſaid: Here I am: I was afraid, for I am Naked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>30.<note n="†" place="margin">Verſ. 11. 12.</note> And he ſaid; Who hath told thee that thou art Naked? Hast

                  <p>31.<note n="†" place="margin">verſe. 13.</note> And he ſaid to the Woman, Why dideſt thou that; ſhe ſaid, the

                  <p>32. Here we underſtand the great Love of God; in that God <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
Adam <hi>again,</hi> that he ſhould know, ſeek and finde himſelf; and
<hi>turn</hi> again to God.</p>
                  <p>33. For, <hi>Adam</hi> had been in God; but he was gone out from the
<hi>Love</hi> out of the Second Principle into the Third.</p>
                  <p>34. <hi>Wherefore,</hi> God ſaid. Where are thou, <hi>Adam?</hi> doſt thou not
ſee thou are <hi>no more</hi> in Heaven? he turned his friendly Countenance
again to one part in Adam underſtand in that part which <hi>he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi>
out of the heavenly Subſtantiality, and glanced upon it againe
with his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>35. <hi>And</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 3. 14.</note> ſaid to the Serpent, <hi>the Old Devil:</hi> Seeing thou haſt done
this, curſed art thou.</p>
                  <p>36. And to the <hi>Creaturely</hi> Serpent; which muſt <hi>now</hi> be a Creature;
for the Devil had turned himſelfe into the Form of a Serpent; therefore
muſt the Serpent <hi>alſo</hi> continue: to it he ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt go upon thy
Belly, and eat Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>37. <hi>Seeing</hi> it had ſeduced Man, ſo that he was become Earthly,
therefore ſhould alſo the <hi>Devils Image</hi> be Earthly, and devour the

                  <p>38. And here we are to know: that the Devil <hi>figured</hi> or framed to

through his Imagination, for he had
great Power, till the Lord wholly curſed him; and ſet the Dear name

                  <p>39. For, he ſaid to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi>

                  <p>40. But he ſhall ſprout forth out of Death, <hi>and Cruſh thy Head;</hi>
that is take away thy power and overcome the wrath, with the

                  <p>41. And here in this place, hath the word of the Promiſe, of the ſeed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61375:39"/>
of the Woman;<note n="*" place="margin">IHS</note> which was the Dear Name IHESUS, with its

                  <p>42. And likewiſe in that Character, hath Imaged the highly precious
Virgin of Gods wiſdome, in which; Chriſt, as the deſtroyer of Death,
ſhould <hi>become</hi> a true Man; and take away the <hi>power</hi> of Death, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy

                  <p>43. Which there ſhould<note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 19. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>tread the Winepreſs of the fierce, wrath</hi>

and quench the Fire with his heavenly Blood; and with the water of
<hi>Meekneſſe</hi> out of the fountain of the Heart of God.</p>
                  <p>44. And know aſſuredly, that if the Word of the Promiſe, had <hi>not</hi>
Imaged it ſelfe in the Light of Life, when Adam and Eve ſell into the
Earthly ſource of quality, then would the Spirit of the ſoul have <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi>
a fierce wrathful Devil, and the Body an evil Beaſt, as indeed it
is now, and <hi>if</hi> the Elementary Water did not allay the <hi>inſolency</hi> of the
Fierce wrath, Men would well ſee; how many a one <hi>would be</hi> a devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Devil.</p>
                  <p>45. Thus now we are to conſider and Conceive, that the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſts becoming Man or Incarnation, <hi>were ſaved</hi> in this imaged
or imprinted Word and Name.</p>
                  <p>46. <hi>Thoſe</hi> who have put their will into God, <hi>they</hi> have received that
word of Promiſe; for, the Soul was received thereinto.</p>
                  <p>47. For, the whole Law of Moſes, concerning the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> is
throughout nothing elſe, but a <hi>Type</hi> of the Humanity of Chriſt: of
what Chriſt in his Humanity, did perform by his Sacrifice, that which
<hi>he</hi> did perform with his Blood and with his Love, in drowning that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of God; that, Moſes did perform with the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> with the Blood
of Beaſts.</p>
                  <p>48. For, the word of the Promiſe, was in the Covenant, and
God for the Time, repreſented the figure, and <hi>permitted</hi> himſelfe to be
attoned or reconciled in the Covenant, with or by a <hi>Similitude.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>49. For, the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> was in the Covenant,
and that attoned or reconciled through <hi>Imagination,</hi> the Anger and
fierce wrath of the Fathers Nature.</p>
                  <p>50. The Jews indeed underſtood not that but the <hi>Covenant</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
it well; for the Beaſtiall Man was not worthy to know it,
till Chriſt was born, and then went the <hi>ſound</hi>
forth.</p>
                  <p>51. Which yet after a <hi>ſhort</hi> time, was covered again, by the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61375:39"/>
chriſt in <hi>Babel;</hi> for, the Beaſtial Man of wickedneſs malignity or
Malice, is not worthy of the moſt precious Name JESUS.</p>
                  <p>52. Alſo it doth <hi>not</hi> belong to the Beaſtial part, but to the divine

Judgement Day, be <hi>conſumed</hi>
through Gods Fire; but the <hi>heavenly</hi> part ſhall
be introduced into the divine power.</p>
                  <p>53. Therefore it is an abomination to God, that Man ſhould ſo
pride himſelfe <hi>with</hi> the Beaſt.</p>
                  <p>54. The Beaſt is not the Image; as the Sacrifice of Moſes was not
the attonement or reconciliation, but the Covenont of Grace, and the
<hi>word of Life</hi> in the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>55. The Circumciſion of the Jewes, that they were to Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
the <hi>Male</hi> Children <hi>onely:</hi> conteineth rightly in it ſelfe, as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>56. <hi>Adam</hi> was the one onely Man that God Created, <hi>and</hi> in him
ws Gods Image, <hi>Eve,</hi> his wife, God would <hi>not</hi> Create, generation was
to be out of one onely.</p>
                  <p>57. But ſeeing he <hi>fell,</hi> ſo that God muſt make him a wiſe, then came
the Covenant and promiſe again upon <hi>One</hi> onely; that all ſhould again
be regenerated and new born out of one onely, viz: out of the <hi>Second</hi>
Adam; not out of the Virgin Mary, but out of Chriſt the Heavenly
Adam.</p>
                  <p>58. For, the <hi>First</hi> Mans Bloud, that is, <hi>Adams,</hi> which he received
out of the Subſtantiality of God, <hi>was to</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">To doe the thing.</note> 
                     <hi>avail;</hi> and not the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
blood of the Woman, in that Adam was become Earthly, and a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

Kind Circumciſed.</p>
                  <p>59. And Chriſt muſt take upon him the Maſculine Forme, though
inwardly he ſtood in a Virgin-like Image; <hi>that</hi> the purpoſe of God
might <hi>ſtand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>60. For, the Mans property, viz: the Fires, <hi>muſt Rules</hi> and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
property, viz: the Lights, <hi>muſt allay</hi> his Fire: and bring it into
the Meek Image of God.</p>
                  <p>61. The Womans blood, <hi>could not</hi> have attoned or pacified the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

unto, or to be in, the Man; and in the Kingdom of God is
to be a Maſculine Virgin, as <hi>Adam</hi> was; <hi>Not</hi> a Woman.</p>
                  <p>62. The Woman cometh to be <hi>ſaved</hi> in the Covenant of the Man:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61375:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for, the Covenant was made for the Mans, viz: the Maſculine Virgins

                  <p>65. <hi>Alſo</hi> the Woman muſt know, that ſhe <hi>is to be</hi> ſaved in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
and Blood of the Man, and that ſhe is <hi>Adams</hi> and <hi>the Mans

                  <p>66. She ſhould be Humble; As a Member ſerveth the Body, ſo
ſhould the Woman ſerve the Man and <hi>love</hi> him as <hi>her ſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>67. Her Love ſhould <hi>ſolely</hi> be<note n="‖" place="margin">Or injected.</note> caſt into him, for, ſo doing, ſhe <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth</hi>

                  <p>68. But to the Single or unmarried Virgins, and Men without wives,
as alſo to the Widdowes, it is ſaid, that they <hi>have</hi> Chriſts Covenant
for a Spouſe, therefore ſhould they be
<hi>Chaſt</hi> and <hi>Humble.</hi>
                  </p>

he ſhould not have needed to have been born a Man, <hi>upon Earth,</hi> and
where then would the Covenant become, in which the Name JESUS,

                     <p>39. For God is <hi>not diviſible,</hi> but Totall Every where: where he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſteth
himſelfe, there he is Totally manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>40. Alſo, he is <hi>not meaſurable,</hi> for him, is no place found, unleſſe
he make a place for himſelfe <hi>in</hi> a Creature; yet he is totally neer the
Creature<note n="*" place="margin">Extra.</note> without or beyond the Creature.</p>
                     <p>41. When the Word moved it ſelfe to the opening of Life, then it
opened it ſelfe in the divine Subſtantiality, in the <hi>water</hi> of Eternal
Life, it entered in and became <hi>Sulphur,</hi> that is Fleſh and Blood.</p>
                     <p>42. It made heavenly Tincture, which the <hi>Deity</hi> did cloſe about

                     <p>43. Underſtand it right: The Deity, hath longed to <hi>become</hi> Fleſh

is it <hi>become</hi> the Spirit and Life of Fleſh; and worketh in the Fleſh; ſo
that we may ſay, <hi>when</hi> we with our Imagination enter into God, and

                     <p>44. For, the Word is <hi>become</hi> Man, and God is the Word.</p>

which is indeed a <hi>Body:</hi> and we liken the whole Deep of this world, to
the Eternal word in the Father.</p>
                     <p>47. Now we ſee plainly, that the Sun ſhineth in the whole Deepe,

                     </p>
                     <p>48. But now we cannot ſay, that in the Deep, without or beyond the

not there, then would the Deep alſo not receive, the power and Luſtre
of the Sun; it is <hi>onely</hi> thus, one power and Luſtre receiveth the other;
the Deep with its Luſtre is hidden, is hidden with its Luſtre.</p>
                     <p>49. If God would pleaſe, the <hi>whole deep</hi> would be a Meer Sun: it

                        <hi>teken upon him the Earthly</hi> ſource or <hi>quality,</hi>
but in his Death, when he overcame Death, the divine ſource
ſwallowed up the Earthly, and
took away its Dominion.</p>
                     <p>59. Not in that manner, as if Chriſt had laid off ſomewhat, but the
outward Source or Quality became overcome, and as it were ſwallowed
up, and in that <hi>he now liveth, he liveth in God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>60. Thus was Adam alſo to be, but ſtood not, and <hi>therefore</hi> muſt
the Word be generated and become Man and give it ſelfe up into the
Subſtantiality, that we might receive power to be able to live in
God.</p>
                     <p>61. Thus hath Chriſt reſtored or brought back again, what Adam
loſt, and <hi>much more;</hi> for the Word is every where become Man.</p>
                     <p>62. Underſtand; it is every where opened in the divine Subſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality,
<hi>wherein</hi> our Eternal Humanity doth Conſiſt.</p>
                     <p>63. For, in <hi>that</hi> Bodily Subſtance, ſhall we ſtand in Eternity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Virgin of God ſtandeth.</p>
                     <p>64. We muſt put on Gods Virgin; for Chriſt hath put it on, he
is become Man in the <hi>Eternall</hi> virgin, and in the <hi>Earthly</hi> virgin.</p>
                     <p>65. Though the Earthly was no right Virgin: but the Heavenly, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
made it, <hi>to be</hi> a Vigin in the <hi>bleſſing,</hi> that is in the opening of
the Word and Covenant; for, <hi>that part</hi> in Mary, which ſhe inherited
from Adam, out of the heavenly Subſtantiality, which Adam made
Earthly, that became bleſſed.</p>
                     <p>66. Thus the <hi>Earthly</hi> part in her, onely, dyed, the other liveth E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally,
and <hi>came to be</hi> a chaſt modeſt virgin again, not in the Death,
but in the bleſsing.</p>
                     <p>67. When God opened himſelfe in her, <hi>then</hi> ſhe put on the virgin of
God, and <hi>became</hi> a Maſculine virgin in the Heavenly part.</p>
                     <p>68. Thus Chriſt became born of a right pure <hi>chaſt</hi> heavenly Virgin;
for ſhe received in the bleſſing, the <hi>Limbus</hi> of God, into her <hi>Matrix,</hi>
in her Seed.</p>
                     <p>69. She received no ſtrange thing, onley the <hi>Limbus</hi> opened it ſelfe in
her, in Gods power, wherein Adam was Dead, <hi>that,</hi> in Gods moving
became living.</p>
                     <p>70. And Gods Eſſence in the word of Life entered in, into her

                     <p>71. And this was a <hi>Right Image</hi> of God, a Similitude according to,

                  <p>2. For herein lyeth incloſed the Secrecy of Man, in that he is, the
<hi>Similitude</hi> and <hi>Image</hi> of God; for, our whole Religion Conſiſteth
in <hi>Three</hi> Parts, which we urge and Teach.</p>
                  <p>3. As <hi>Firſt,</hi> concerning the <hi>Creation;</hi> what Eſſence, ſubſtance, and
property, Man is, whether he be Eternal or not Eternal? and how that
is poſſible, what properly the humane Original is, from which he <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded</hi>
in the Beginning.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Secondly:</hi> Seeing there is ſo much ſpoken and taught Concerning
his <hi>Fall,</hi> and that we ſee, that we are become Mortal becauſe of the
Fall, moreover, <hi>ſubjected</hi> to Evil, and to the fierce wrathful ſource;
what then properly his Fall hath been.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Thirdly:</hi> Seeing God will receive us to <hi>Grace</hi> again: and for
whoſe ſake alſo he hath given the Law and Teaching, alſo confirmed
then with Deeds of Wonder or <hi>Miracles,</hi> what therefore, properly, the
New <hi>Regeneration</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>6. And being we ſee that we <hi>must dye,</hi> in what power and Spirit we

                  <p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:61375:44"/>
7. All this we finde pourtrayed in theſe <hi>two Images,</hi> viz: in the
Eternal Holy, and then alſo in the Earthly corruptible Virginity: and
finde alſo the <hi>New</hi> Regeneration in the Image of Chriſt, very cleare
and bright.</p>
                  <p>8. For, in the Eternal Virginity, viz: in God wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
wherein the Image and Similitude of God is <hi>ſeen</hi> as in a
Looking-Glaſs from Eternity, and known by the Spirit of God; was
<hi>Adam</hi> the firſt Man Created.</p>
                  <p>9. He had the Virginity for his own, viz: the <hi>true</hi> love-<hi>Tincture,</hi>
in the Light, which is deſirous of the Fires Tincture, that it might be
a burning Life in power and <hi>Glory;</hi> and in the Fires Eſſence, might be a
<hi>Genetrix,</hi> which in the Lights Eſſence without the Fire, cannot be.</p>
                  <p>10. And thus we acknowledge a
Virginity in the wiſdome of God,
from Eternity, in the <hi>deſirous will</hi> of the divine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>11. Not a Woman, which generateth, but a <hi>figure</hi> in the Looking-Glaſs
of Gods wiſdome; a pure Chaſt Image <hi>without</hi> ſubſtance; yet
in the Eſſence, but not manifeſted in the Fires Eſſence, but in the
Lights quality or ſource.</p>
                  <p>12. This Image God hath <hi>Creeated</hi> into a Subſtance, and that out of
all the Three Principles; ſo that it is a ſimilitude according to the Deity
and <hi>Eternity,</hi> as a totall Looking-Glaſs of the <hi>Byſs</hi> or Ground and of the
<hi>Abyſs;</hi> of the Spirit and alſo of the Subſtance: and was created out
of the Etetnal, <hi>not</hi> to the Corruptibility or frailty</p>
                  <p>13. But ſeeing the Earthly and Corruptible <hi>hangeth</hi> to the Eternall,
<hi>ſo</hi> thereby hath the Earthly Luſt introduced it ſelfe into the Eternall
Heavenly, and infected the Heavenly <hi>property:</hi> for it would dwell in the
Eternal, and yet was deſtroyed in the fierce wrath of God.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>Thus</hi> the Earthly Source or quality deſtroyed the Heavenly, and
became the <hi>Turba</hi> of the heavenly,
as we know and perceive by Earth and Stones, which aſſuredly have
<hi>their</hi> Original out of the Eternal; but are periſhed in the fierce wrath
and Fire-ſource of quality; and the <hi>Fiat</hi> hath made Earth and Stones
out of the heavenly Subſtantiality.</p>

15. For the ſake of which, a Day of Seperation is appointed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>every thing</hi> ſhall enter again into its own Ether, and be preſerved or
purified by the Fire.</p>
                  <p>16. <hi>Thus alſo</hi> was Man created in the virginity in Gods wiſdome,
but became apprehended by the fierce wrath and Anger of God, and
<hi>therefore</hi> became ſo ſuddenly <hi>periſhed</hi> and Earthly.</p>
                  <p>17. And as the Earth muſt paſs away, and be tryed or purified in
the Fire, and go again <hi>into that</hi> which it was before; ſo alſo Man; ſhall
go agin into the virginity <hi>wherein</hi> he was Created.</p>
                  <p>18. But, in that, it was <hi>not poſſible</hi> for Man, that he ſhould riſe from
the fieece wrathful Death, and enter into a New Birth; for his virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
was ſhut up together in Death; for which cauſe God made a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
out of him: <hi>therefore</hi> the Deity <hi>muſt</hi> move it ſelfe, and open that
which was ſhut up, and make it living again; and that was done in
<hi>Mary,</hi> the included <hi>ſhut up</hi> Virgin.</p>
                  <p>19. Underſtand, in the Virginity which Adam inherited out of
Gods Wiſdome; <hi>not</hi> out of the Earthly part of the Third Principle,
but out of the Heavenly <hi>holy</hi> Part of the Second Principle, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
included and ſhut up in the Earthly Death in the Anger of God
with the Earthly Imagination and yeelding up thereinto, and was as it
were <hi>Dead:</hi> even as the Earth alſo appeareth as Dead.</p>
                  <p>20. And <hi>therefore</hi> hath the Heart of God moved it ſelfe; deſtroyed
Death; and generated the Life again.</p>
                  <p>21. Thus now <hi>to</hi> Us the Birth and becoming Man or Incarnation
of Chriſt, is a<note n="*" place="margin">Or Joyful.</note> powerful and very weighty Matter, that the Total
<hi>abyſſal Heart</hi> of God, hath moved it ſelfe, and ſo therewith, the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Subſtantiality, which was ſhut up in death, is become living again: ſo
that we may now ſay with good ground.</p>
                  <p>22. God <hi>himſelfe</hi> hath withſtood his Anger, in that, with the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his Heartt, which filleth the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he hath again opened himſelf, taken away the power of Death, and
<hi>broken the sting</hi> of the fierce wrath and Anger: in as much, as the
Love and Meekneſs, hath opened it ſelfe in the Anger, and <hi>quenched</hi>
the power of the Fire.</p>
                  <p>23. And ſtill much more is it a great Joy to Us Men, that God
hath opened himſelfe, in our mortified and <hi>dead</hi> virginity; and ſo on
throughly and totally.</p>
                  <p>24. But, that the Word, or the power of Gods Life, hath <hi>given in</hi>
it ſelfe again into the Humanity, viz: into the Dead and as it were
diſappeared virginity, and opened again the virgin-like Life, <hi>at that</hi>
we reioyce; and go with our Imagination, into the <hi>Center,</hi> wherein
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61375:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God hath opened himſelf in the humanity, viz: into his Sons becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Man or Incarnation.</p>
                  <p>25. And ſo in our Imagination,
which we <hi>introduce</hi> into his becoming Man, we become impregnated of
his opened Word, and power of the Heavenly and divine Subſtantiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
not at all with that which is <hi>strange,</hi> yet it ſeemeth ſtrange to the
Earthlineſs.</p>
                  <p>26. The Word hath opened it ſelf every where, even in Every Mans
light of life; and there is <hi>wanting</hi> onely this, that the Soul-ſpirit give it
ſelfe up <hi>thereinto;</hi> and ſo it putteth the Eternal Virginity on again;
not as a Garment, but as from its own Eſſence: <hi>And in that Soul-Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
God becometh Generated or Born.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>27. For <hi>Mary,</hi> together with all Eves Daughters were generated or
become <hi>Earthly;</hi> but the Covenant of Gods Love, ſhewed <hi>iu their</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
that God would <hi>therein</hi> unſhut the Life again.</p>
                  <p>28. And we cannot ſay throughout, concerning Maries Virginity,
as to the Earthly Life <hi>before</hi> the Bleſſing, before Gods Heart moved it
ſelfe; that ſhe was then a Totally perfect Virgin, according to the firſt,
before the Fall; but ſhe was a naturall Daughter of <hi>Eve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>29. But this we ſay with good gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>30. For, the Name JESUS, in the <hi>Center</hi> or Heart of God, hath

as in a Looking-Glaſs: and hath ſtood <hi>againſt</hi> the Center of the

                  <p>31. And Man was<note n="*" place="margin">Ephe. 1. 4.</note>

that, <hi>before</hi> the time of the opening and Maſſage of the Angel, ſhe
was ſuch a Virgin as <hi>Eve</hi> was, when ſhe <hi>wen out</hi> of Paradiſe.</p>
                  <p>34. E're <hi>Adam</hi> knew her; then indeed ſhe was a Virgin, but the
right virginity was periſhed in her, and infected with the Earthly Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61375:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the beaſtiall property was manifeſted on <hi>her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>35. For, the Earthly Imagination deſtroyed the heavenly property,
ſo that ſhe was a <hi>Woman,</hi> and was not chaſt pure <hi>Imma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>36. <hi>For,</hi> She was but one part of the Heavenly Virgin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Other
Part was Adam.</p>
                  <p>37. And ſo there hath been no right pure virgin generated from <hi>Eve,</hi>
which was totall or <hi>entire</hi> in Subſtance: the <hi>Turba</hi> deſtroyed the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gininity
in all, till the Saviour or Champion in the Battel, Came;
who was a <hi>total</hi> maſculine Virgin in Gods wiſdom, according to the
Heavenly Subſtance, and the Earthly <hi>hung</hi> to him: but the heavenly
ruled over the Earthly; for ſo ſhould Adam
alſo be, but he ſtood not.</p>
                  <p>38. Therefore, we ſay with good ground, that Mary, was the <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of</hi> Joachim <hi>and</hi> Anna; and hath, according to the Earthly part,
their Subſtantiality, Eſſentially in her.</p>
                  <p>39. And then we ſay, that ſhe was the <hi>Daughter of</hi> Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and that God hath fixed the Mark of Regeneration, in her: ſo
that the whole Old Teſtament hath <hi>looked</hi> into that Mark, and all
Prophets have Propheſied concerning that Mark, that God would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the rhe Eternall Virginity again, and that, <hi>that Mark</hi> was bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                  <p>40. For, God had given himſelfe with his Mercy with the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Promiſe, into this <hi>Mark,</hi> and the word of Promiſe ſtood in the
Covenant, in the Light of Life, <hi>againſt</hi> the Anger.</p>
                  <p>41. And the firſt world <hi>before</hi> the Deluge or Floud; and <hi>after;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſaved in that Covenant, which God ſet before himſelf as a Virgin-like

                  </p>
                  <p>42. For, if Iſrael had kept the Covenant, and performed the work
of the Covenant, then that had been <hi>acceptible</hi> to God, as if the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
had been in the Looking-G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Iſrael were Earthly and Evil, yet nevertheleſs, God dwelt in Iſrael in
his Covenant in the Wiſdome according to his Love and <hi>Mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>43. Thus the Works of the Law, were<note n="†" place="margin">Or in a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſs.</note> a Looking-Glaſs before
God, <hi>till</hi> the Life became generated or Born out of the Covenant, till
the <hi>fulfilling</hi> came, and there the Works in the Looking-Glaſs Cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
and the work of the fulfilling in the fleſh and blood in the Heavenly
Subſtantiality <hi>began</hi> to riſe again.</p>
                  <p>44. For in Mary was the beginning, when the Angel brought the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61375:46"/>
Meſſage; and ſhe ſaid:<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 1. 38.</note> 
                     <hi>he is done unto me as thou haſt ſaid;</hi> there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
the Center of Life, in the Word of God, viz: in the Heart of
God, <hi>moved</hi> in her dead heavenly ſeed.</p>
                  <p>45. For all the Three Principles of the Deity, became ſtirring and
catched hold of the <hi>divine</hi> Tincture, in the <hi>Dead</hi> heavenly Subſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.</p>
                  <p>46, Not that God ſtood without Subſtance, but <hi>Man</hi> was dead in
the heavenly Subſtance, and now came the Heart of God with <hi>living</hi>
divine Subſtantiality, into Death, and awakened or raiſed up the Dead
Subſtantiality.</p>
                  <p>47. It did not at this time, <hi>take away</hi> the Earthly ſource or quality,
but entered into the Earthly ſource or quality, as a Lord, and Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſher
of the ſource or quality.</p>
                  <p>48, For, the right Life ſhould be introduced, through Death and
the Anger of God; which was <hi>done</hi> on the Croſs,
where death was deſtroyed, and the fierce wrath captivated, and was
quenched and vanquiſhed with the Love.</p>
                  <p>49. And thus we underſtand now, <hi>what,</hi> Mary, with the fulfilling
was come to be, viz: a right pure Virgin according to the heavenly
Part: for when the Heart of God moved it ſelfe, and that the Day brake
forth in her, <hi>then</hi> ſhone in her the Light of the Clarity or brightneſs
and purity of God; for her dead virginity, viz: Gods wiſdome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
opened and Living.</p>
                  <p>50. For, <hi>ſhe</hi> became filled with the divine virginity, viz: with Gods
wiſdome.</p>
                  <p>51. And in that wiſdome and divine Subſtantiality, as alſo in the
dead and now living Subſtantiality,<note n="†" place="margin">Job. 1. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>the Word became fleſh, a Sulphur,</hi>
with the Center of Nature out of the Fathers Eſſence, and out of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's

whereas <hi>both</hi> the Tinctures were but <hi>One.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>52. And as Adam was become a Man, ſo Chriſt became, a Man
alſo, according to the <hi>outward</hi> World.</p>
                  <p>53. For, not Eves Image in the Womans Tincture, was to remain,
but Adams <hi>Image</hi> was to remain, as he was a Man and alſo a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
                  <p>54. But yet being <hi>one</hi> of the Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61375:47"/>
therefore the Champion in the

                  </p>
                  <p>55. For the Man hath the Fires <hi>Tincture,</hi> viz: of the Fathers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
ſo now the Father is the ſtrength and Might of all things, and
the Sonne is his Love.</p>
                  <p>56. Thus the Word became Man in the feminine Eſſence, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a <hi>Man,</hi> that his love might quench the Anger and fierce wrath in
the Father.</p>
                  <p>57. For <hi>Venus's Tincture</hi> hath the Water-ſource or quality, and
the Woman hath <hi>Venus's Tincture:</hi> Thus muſt the Fire, become
<hi>quenched</hi> by the water of Eternal Life; and the Fathers burning
Eſſence in the Fire, become quenched again.</p>
                  <p>58. Now we know that <hi>Mary,</hi> the Mother of Chriſt, according to
Fleſh Soul and Spirit in the bleſſing, is a <hi>pure chast</hi> Virgin; for that is
<hi>her</hi> Bleſſing, that God hath opened himſelf in her.</p>
                  <p>59. She hath carried the Word of Life in her Body: that hath mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it ſelf in <hi>her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>60. She, hath not moved the Word, but the Word hath <hi>moved her,</hi>
both the fruit which ſhe did bear, and her Soul, as alſo that part of her
dead Subſtantiality; ſo that her Soul <hi>inſtantly</hi> became environed with
the divine living Subſtantiality.</p>
                  <p>61. Not according to the Earthly part, viz: according to the Third
Principle, but according to the Second Principle, ſo that thus the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did but <hi>hang</hi> upon her.</p>
                  <p>62. For, her ſoul ſhould alſo, with the word of Life, which in her
became Man, <hi>together</hi> enter through death and the Anger of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
into the heavenly divine ſource or quality.</p>
                  <p>63. And therefore muſt <hi>her</hi> outward Man dye
away from the Earthly ſource or quality that<note n="*" place="margin">Her Outward Man.</note> it may live to
God.</p>
                  <p>64. And, therefore, in that ſhe was bleſſed, and did bear the Mark in
the Covenant, her body, <hi>not</hi> vaniſhed, departed or diſſolved, for the
heavenly hath ſwallowed up the Eartthly, and holdeth that Eternally
captive, to the honour of God and the Manifeſtation of his deeds of
Wonder; It ſhall <hi>never be forgotten</hi> in Eternity, that God is become
Man in her.</p>
                  <p>65. But that <hi>ſome</hi> ſay, ſhe remained <hi>totally</hi> in death, and quite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
or Corrupted: their Reaſon might well diſcern otherwiſe, for
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61375:47"/>
that which is highly bleſſed, is<note n="*" place="margin">Or intranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> uncorruptible, or <hi>cannot</hi> vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                  <p>66. Her heavenly part of the divine ſubſtantiality, which ſhe had
in her, bleſſed; <hi>that</hi> is intranſitory: elſe it muſt follow; that Gods ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality
in the Bleſſing, were yet once more fallen and <hi>dead,</hi> as was
done in Adam, for the ſake of which <hi>dying</hi> indeed, God became Man,
that he might being it to life again.</p>
                  <p>67. Indeed, according to the Outward Life, viz: according to the
outward ſource or quality <hi>ſhe died,</hi> but ſhe liveth according to
the <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> in Gods ſubſtantiality, and alſo in her own Subſtantiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>not</hi> in the Four Elements, but in the root of the four Elements,
viz: in the One Element, which holdeth the Four Elements ſhut up in

in the<note n="*" place="margin">Or Life.</note> Body of God.</p>
                  <p>68. Therefore we ſay, that Mary, was <hi>greater</hi> in <hi>dignity,</hi> then
Ever any Daughter of or from Adam, in that God hath <hi>fixed</hi> the
Mark of his Covenant in her, and that <hi>ſhe</hi> alone among all Eves

for, the Eſſence of the Soul was in us poor Children of Men, <hi>become</hi>

                     <p>76. This is our Anſwer: That Gods Heart was <hi>never</hi> without Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
for, its dwelling is from Eternity in the Light, and the power
in the Light, is the Heart or Word, which God <hi>hath ſpoken</hi> from
Eternity.</p>
                     <p>77. And, the <hi>Speaking</hi> was the Holy Spirit of God, which with
the Speaking goeth forth out of the power of the Light, out of the <hi>ſpoken</hi>
Word.</p>
                     <p>78. And that which is out ſpoken is Gods Wonder and Wiſdome,
and this hath in it, the <hi>divine Looking-Glaſs</hi> of the Wiſdom, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
the Spirit of God looketh, and wherein it openeth the

                     <p>79. Thus underſtand, that the word, which out of or from the
Heart of God the Father, was environed with the heavenly Chaſt Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
of wiſdome, <hi>dwelleth</hi> in the heavenly Subſtantiality, and hath in

in her <hi>own ſeed,</hi> underſtand in the <hi>humane</hi> ſeed, and hath taken into
it ſelfe, Maries ſeed, dead, and blind, as to God, and awakened or railed
it, to Life again.</p>
                     <p>80. The living Subſtantiality came together in the <hi>half dead,</hi> to a
Body, not to a tranſitory, which ſhould ceaſe or vaniſh, but to an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,</hi>
which ſhould remain Eternally, for here the Eternal Life became

                     <p>81. Thus, the Subſtantiality of the Eternity in God, of <hi>his</hi> Deepe,
without Ground, and the Subſtantiality of the dead Adam in the
Humanity, became <hi>one</hi> Subſtantiality; totally or entirely one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:
ſo that the <hi>Creature,</hi> Chriſt, with his Subſtantiality, in like

the power without or beyond the Creature, one power,

He is with his power, the quickening of our Souls, our <hi>life,</hi> and our

                  <p>1. MEn have had much diſputing about Chriſts<note n="*" place="margin">Or Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> becoming Man;
but very <hi>blindly</hi> and have made many Opinions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and have left and let the right becoming Man or Incarnation,
<hi>lye ſtill;</hi> upon which, our Eternal Salvation, dependeth.</p>
                  <p>2. Of which, all the cauſe hath been, that Men have ſought it in
<hi>outward</hi> Wit or Underſtanding and Art: and Not at the right Mark
Aim or Place.</p>
                  <p>3. If a Man were entered <hi>into</hi> Chriſts becoming Man or Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and were born of, or out of, God; it would need no diſputing: for the
Spirit of God, openeth to every one, the becoming Man or Incarnation
even <hi>in himſelf;</hi> and without this there is no finding
it.</p>
                  <p>4. For, how <hi>will</hi> we find, in this Worlds Reaſon, that, which
<hi>is not</hi> in this World; we find in the outward Reaſon ſcarce any Glimps
thereof; but <hi>in</hi> Gods Spirit, is the right finding.</p>
                  <p>5. The becoming Man or Incarnation, of Christ, is ſuch a Myſtery;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61375:49"/>
as which the Outward Reaſon knoweth <hi>nothing of;</hi> for it is done in
all the Three Principles: and cannot be ſearched out, unleſs a man
know the firſt Man, in his Creation <hi>before</hi> the Fall.</p>
                  <p>6. For Adam was to generate the <hi>Second</hi> Man with the Character of
the Holy Trinity, out of himſelfe, in which the <hi>Name</hi> JESUS was Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged
or Incorporated.</p>
                  <p>7. But that could not be, and therefore muſt <hi>another</hi> Adam come,
in whom it was poſſible: for <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Virgin-like Image, with the
Character of the Holy Trinity; he is conceived in Gods Love, and
generated in <hi>this</hi> world.</p>
                  <p>8. Adam had divine Subſtantiality, and his ſoul was out of the firſt
Principle out of the Fathers property, and that ſhould have with its
Imagination <hi>inclined</hi> it ſelfe into the Fathers Heart, viz: into the
Word and Spirit of Love and purity, and have eaten of the <hi>Subſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality</hi>
of Love, and then it had reteined Gods Subſtance in the Word
of Life in it ſelfe, and would have been impregnated with the power out
of the Heart of God.</p>
                  <p>9. Whence then it ſhould have <hi>Imagined</hi> out of it ſelfe into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality
and it ſelfe have impregnated
its Subſtantiality, ſo that a whole ſimilitude according to the firſt I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
<hi>would have</hi> Exiſted, through the Imagination and the yeelding
up of the Soul into it: and be conceived in the power of the Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.</p>
                  <p>10. But being this could <hi>not</hi> be done in Adam, becauſe of the Ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
which clave to him, therefore it was done in the <hi>Second</hi>
Adam <hi>Christ;</hi> who was in ſuch a manner conceived through Gods
Imagination and entering into the Image of the <hi>firſt</hi> Adam.</p>
                  <p>11. And it is known to us, that being the firſt Adam had fixed his
Imagination in the Earthlineſs, he <hi>is become</hi> Earthly, and that done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>purpoſe</hi> of God, yet the purpoſe of God muſt ſtand.</p>
                  <p>12. For, here God ſet his purpoſe in Adams Child, and brought
<hi>his</hi> Imagination into the periſhed Image, and Impregnated the ſame
with his divine power, and Subſtantiality, and <hi>Converted</hi> the Souls
will out of the Earthlineſs into God, ſo that thus <hi>Mary</hi> became Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
with ſuch a Childe, as <hi>Adam ſhould</hi> have
been impregnated with.</p>
                  <p>13. Which ſelfe ability could not effect, but <hi>ſunk</hi> down into ſleepe,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61375:50"/>
viz: into the <hi>Magia,</hi> where then the Woman was made out of Adam,
which ſhould not have been Made, but Adam ſhould himſelfe have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
in <hi>Venus's Matrix,</hi> and have generated Magically.</p>
                  <p>14. But ſeeing that might not be, <hi>therefore</hi> was Adam divided,
and his own wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of Great Might and power was broken in him, and
ſhut up in Death.</p>
                  <p>15. And ſeeing he <hi>would not</hi> ſet his Imagination into the Spirit
of God, therefore muſt his great Might and power in Death, hold
ſtill, and <hi>let</hi> the Spirit of God ſet his Imogination into it, and do with
it what he will.</p>
                  <p>16. Therefore <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> awakened the Life to him out of that
Death and became the Spirit of that Life, that, the Image and Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
according to God, which was known from Eternity in Gods wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<hi>might yet</hi> be generated and ſubſiſt.</p>
                  <p>17. For it ſtood before the time of the World, and from Eternity
in the Virgin-Looking-Glaſs in the wiſdom of God; and that in <hi>two</hi>
Forms.</p>
                  <p>18. Viz: according to the Firſt Principle of the Father in the <hi>Fire;</hi>
and in the ſecond Principle of the <hi>Sonne,</hi> in the <hi>Light;</hi> and yet was
onely Manifeſt in the Light; and in the Fire as it were in a <hi>Magia,</hi> viz;
in a poſsibility.</p>
                  <p>19. As the Starry Heaven, modelleth to Man a figure in ſleep in his
<hi>Minde</hi> according to its ability or<note n="*" place="margin">Or Capacity.</note> poſſibility: ſo alſo hath the Image
in the Center of the Fires Nature <hi>appeared</hi> altogether Inviſibly.</p>
                  <p>20. But in the wiſdom in the Looking-Glaſs of the Deity, it hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
as an Image, like a <hi>ſhadow,</hi> yet without Material Subſtance; and
yet hath been in the Eſſence of that Spirit.</p>
                  <p>21. Which if it had <hi>diſcerned</hi> it ſelfe in the Looking-Glaſs of the
wiſdome, it would have known and ſeen <hi>this</hi> Image, and would once
have ſet its will thereinto, to bring it into Subſtantiality; that God
might have an Image or ſimilitude in Subſtance; where it might <hi>not
need</hi> any more to ſee it ſelfe as in a Looking-Glaſs, but<note n="*" place="margin">Or feel.</note> find it ſelfe in
Subſtance.</p>
                  <p>22. Therefore ſeeing, the firſt Image Imagined into the ſtern Might
and power, and <hi>thereupon</hi> became Earthly and Dead, Gods Spirit
brought its will and life into Death, and took to it ſelfe again the firſt
Life, out of Death, that the firſt Life might ſtand in <hi>full</hi> obedience
before it, and that it alone may be the <hi>Will</hi> and the <hi>Deed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>23. Thus, it is known to us, that God hath Entered into the halfe
dead Image, underſtand into <hi>Mary,</hi> and even into that virgin-like form,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61375:50"/>
                     <hi>which lay</hi> ſhut up in Death, wherein <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have become impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
and generated an Image of himſelfe in the Virgin-like Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>24. In this ſhut up Virgin-like half dead <hi>Matrix,</hi> is Gods Word or
Heart, viz: the Center of the Holy Trinity, become a Humane Image,
<hi>without hurt</hi> to his Subſtance.</p>
                  <p>25. And whereas the firſt living Virgin-like <hi>Matrix</hi> in Adam would
not be obedient to God, yet now, when it was <hi>again awakened</hi> and
raiſed out of Death, it became Obedient, and gave it ſelfe totally hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
and willingly into Gods will: and thus now the right Virgin-like
Image <hi>became figured</hi> into the Obedience of God again.</p>
                  <p>26. For, the firſt will muſt remain in Death, which Imagined againſt
Gods will, and a pure <hi>Obedient</hi> will became awakened which might
remain in the heavenly Meekneſs, which would no more ſuffer the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
in the fire in the Fathers part, to flow up in it ſelf, but would remain
in <hi>one</hi> ſouce or quality.</p>
                  <p>27. Even as the <hi>Deity,</hi> bringeth its Life but into ONE onely
ſource or quality, viz: into the Light, into the Holy Spirit; and yet
carrieth on his Dominion, <hi>over all</hi> the Three Principles.</p>
                  <p>28. Alſo we are to underſtand concerning Chriſts becoming Man
or Incarnation, <hi>that, when</hi> Gods Spirit awakened again, the Virgin-like
Life in <hi>Mary,</hi> which in the Earthly Eſſence, lay ſhut up in Dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h
and fierce wrath; <hi>then</hi> that Life hence-forward <hi>turned</hi> it ſelf onely into
the ONE onely will, viz: into Gods Love, and gave it ſelfe up to the
Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>29. Thus that Life, became impregnated of a right virgin-like I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage;
which ſhould have been with <hi>Adam,</hi> but was not done.</p>
                  <p>30. For the one Imagination received the other, Gods Imagination,
<hi>received</hi> the Imagination in Death, and brought it to Life again; that
Life Imagined again into God, and became Impregnated with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and became, out of the Deity and Humanity, ONE <hi>Perſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>31. The Deity hung to the heavenly Subſtantiality, which hath
ever been from Eternity, with the Kingdom Power and Glory, viz:
the Kingdom of Paradiſe, and the Angelical World, viz: the Spirit and
the <hi>Seaven</hi> forms in the <hi>Center</hi> of Nature: as in the Third Part or
Book of the Threefold Life, is mentioned with all Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>32. And the Humanity hung to the Kingdom of this world, but
when the will of the humanity gave it ſelfe <hi>up into</hi> the Deity, then this
virgin-like Image in <hi>Christ Jeſus,</hi> came to be onely a <hi>Guest</hi> in this
world, and his Deity was a Lord over this World.</p>
                  <p>33. For thus it was to be in Adam, alſo, that<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>the leſſer</hi> and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61375:51"/>
                     <hi>ſhould be ſubject to the greater</hi> and Omnipotent.</p>
                  <p>34. But Adams will, went into the leſs and impotent: end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he became <hi>altogether</hi> impotent, and fell downe into
ſleep, and home again to the Creator.</p>
                  <p>35. But with Chriſt, this Image <hi>remained</hi> ſtanding in the Divine
Wiſdome, and the Earthly ſource or quality hung to it in the Office
and Manner of a <hi>Servant:</hi> but now no more as a Lord; as it was over
<hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother <hi>before</hi> the high bleſſing &amp; opening of the
Deity: but as a Servant: for this Image became now in Gods Spirit
and Might, a <hi>Lord</hi> over the Third Principle of this World.</p>
                  <div type="question">
                     <head>Quſtion.</head>
                     <p>36. Now ſaith Reaſon: How is it come to paſs in this becoming
Man or Incarnation? Was then the Life ſo ſuddenly with the <hi>Point</hi>
of Conception, become ſtirring, above the Naturall Courſe, ſo that
that Part of Mary, viz: the Womans ſeed <hi>inſtantly</hi> lived?</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="answer">
                     <head>Anſwer.</head>
                     <p>37. No: for it was an Eſſential ſeed, and became in its <hi>Natural
Time,</hi> ſtirring, with Soul and Spirit, as all Adams Children.</p>
                     <p>38. But that part of the Deity, environed with divine Subſtantiall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and wiſdome, <hi>liveth</hi> from Eternity to Eternity.</p>
                     <p>39. The Deity, went not to nor fro: what it <hi>was</hi> that it <hi>remained</hi>
to be, and what it <hi>was not,</hi> that it <hi>came to be.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>40. It gave it ſelfe with divine Subſtantiality, into the Eſſence and
Subſtantiality of <hi>Mary;</hi> and <hi>Maries</hi> Eſſence and <hi>Gods</hi> Eſſence, <hi>became</hi>
one<note n="*" place="margin">Or Perſon.</note> 
                        <hi>Sonne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>41. But Maries Eſſences were <hi>Mortal,</hi> but Gods Eſſences, were <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>42. Therefore muſt Maries Eſſences <hi>dye</hi> on the
Croſs, and go through Death into Life; to which Gods Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences
did help; <hi>elſe</hi> it had been impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>43. Thus Gods Eſſence helped us, and ſtill always helpeth us through
Chriſt <hi>into</hi> Gods Eſſence and Life again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:61375:51"/>
44. Thus we konw the becoming Man or Incarnation of Chriſt, to
be <hi>natural,</hi> as of all the Children, of Men; for the heavenly divine
Subſſtantiality, hath given it ſelfe, with its Life into the Earthly halfe
dead ſubtantiality.</p>
                     <p>45. The Lord, gave himſelfe to be under the Servant, that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
might become <hi>living,</hi> and is in like manner, <hi>in</hi> Nine
Moneths, <hi>become</hi> a perfect Man, and alſo continueth a True
God, and is alſo after the Manner and way of all Adams Children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>born</hi> into this World, through that very way and paſſage, as all
Men are.</p>
                     <p>46. And that therefore, Not that he needed it, he could have been
born Magically, but he would not, nor <hi>ſhould not;</hi> for he was to heal
our impure Birth or Geniture, and Entrance into this Life.</p>
                     <p>47. He ſhould enter into our Entrance into this World, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
<hi>us</hi> out of this World, into Gods Entrance, and bring <hi>us</hi> out
of the Earthly ſource or quality.</p>
                     <p>48. For, if he had been generated or born Magically after a divine
Manner, then he had <hi>not</hi> been <hi>Naturally</hi> in this World; for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Subſtantiality muſt have ſwallowed up the Earthly ſource or
quality; and then he had <hi>not</hi> been<note n="†" place="margin">Heb. 4. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>like us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>49. <hi>How</hi> then would he have ſuffered Death; have entred into Death,
and deſtroyed it? but <hi>therefore</hi> it was not ſo.</p>
                     <p>50. He is truely and really the Womans Seed and is entered into this
World the <hi>Natural</hi> way like all Men, but yet alſo is gone forth through
death, the <hi>divine</hi> way, of the divine Might and Subſtantiality.</p>
                     <p>51. He is <hi>a</hi> divine living Subſtantiality, which ſubſiſted in Death,
and <hi>deſtroyed</hi> and deſpiſed <hi>death,</hi> and brought the halfe dead humanity
through Death into Eternal Life.</p>
                     <p>52. For, the <hi>Earthly part,</hi> which he took to himſelfe out of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Mary,</hi> that is, to or upon the divine Subſtance; <hi>dyed away</hi> on the
Croſs from the Earthly ſource or quality.</p>
                     <p>53. Thus was the Soul, in the Subantiality of God, and as a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Conquering Prince,<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 2. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>went into</hi> the <hi>Hell</hi> of
Devils, that is into Gods Anger, and <hi>quenched</hi>
it with Gods love and Meekneſs of the divine Love-ſuhſtantiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>54. For, the Love-fire came into the Anger-Fire-, and <hi>drowned</hi> the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61375:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Anger, wherein the Devill would be God.</p>
                     <p>55. Thus was the Devil taken captive<note n="*" place="margin">Or by.</note> with the darkneſs, and loſt his
Dominion; for the <hi>ſting</hi> and the Sword of the Cherubine the ſtaying
Angel, was here deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>56. And this was the <hi>Cauſe</hi> that God became Man, viz: that he
might introduce us, out of Death, into the Eternal Life, and quench
the Anger which burned in Us, with the <hi>Love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>57. For, you muſt underſtand us aright: how Gods Anger became
quenched, <hi>not</hi> with the Mortal Bloud of Chriſt which he ſhed, upon
which the Jews deſpiſed him.</p>
                     <p>58. But with the Bloud of the Eternall Life, out of Gods ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
which was immortal, which had in it the <hi>fountain</hi> of the

and when, the outward fell to the Earth, then fell the Heavenly <hi>with

                  <head>The Eleventh Chapter. Of the Benefit, and what Profit, the Becoming
Man or Incarnation, and Geniture or Birth of
Jeſus Chriſt the Sonne of God, is, to us
poor Children of Eve. The Moſt rich lovely Gate
of all. </head>
                  <p>1. WE poor Children of Eve, were all Dead in Adam; and though
we did as it were Live, yet we <hi>lived</hi> onely to this World, and
Death <hi>waited</hi> for us, and continually devoured One after
another; and there were no remedy for us, if God had not Generated
us again out of his Subſtance.</p>
                  <p>2. We ſhould not in Eternity as to the <hi>Body,</hi> have returned again,
but our <hi>Soul</hi> would have Eternally continued in Gods Anger ſource or
quality, with all Devils.</p>
                  <p>3. But the Becoming Man or Incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt, is <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi>
a powerful Subſtance or <hi>Matter</hi> to us, for, for <hi>our</hi> ſakes is God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Man, that he might bring our humanity out of Death into himſelf
again, and redeem or <hi>releaſe</hi> our Soule
out of the fire of Gods Anger.</p>
                  <p>4. For, the Soul in it <hi>ſelfe,</hi> is a Fire-ſource or quality, and contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in it ſelfe the <hi>First</hi> Principle the harſh aſtringency, which in it ſelf
laboureth onely<note n="*" place="margin">Or towards.</note> to the Fire.</p>
                  <p>5. But if the Love and Meekneſs of God, become withdrawn from
this Souls Birth or Geniture, or become <hi>infected</hi> with a total ſtern
Matter, then it continueth a ſource or quality in the Darkneſs, a totall
ſtern roughneſs, <hi>devouring</hi> it ſelfe, and yet alſo in the hunger of the
will, <hi>alwaies</hi> thus generating it ſelf again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:61375:53"/>
9. For, a thing that hath no beginning nor Ground, that hath alſo
no End, but it ſelfe is its Ground, it <hi>generateth</hi> it Selfe.</p>
                  <p>7. And yet we will not ſay, that the Soul hath no Beginning; it
hath a Beginning, but onely <hi>according</hi> to the Creature, not according
to the Eſſence, its Eſſence is from Eternity.</p>
                  <p>8. For, the divine <hi>Fiat,</hi> hath compriſed it in the <hi>Center</hi> of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Nature, and brought it into a ſubſtantial Subſtance; moreover
with the whole Croſs, with the <hi>Character</hi> of the Holy Trinity; as a
Similitude of the Threefold Spirit of the Deity, wherein God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth;
now <hi>whether</hi> it be done in Love or Anger, that is in Light or
Fire; for in <hi>which</hi> of them ſoever it Imagineth, of that it becometh
impregnated; for it is a Magick Spirit, a ſource or quality <hi>in</hi> it
ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>9. Thus it is the Center of the Eternity, a fire of the Deity in
the Father, yet <hi>not</hi> in the Fathers Liberty, but in the Eternall Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>10. It is <hi>not</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Come to be.</note> come before the Subſtance, <hi>but</hi> in the Subſtance.</p>
                  <p>11. But Gods Liberty is<note n="*" place="margin">Extra.</note> without or beyond the Subſtance, but
dwelleth in the Subſtance: for in the ſubſtance God
becometh Manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>12. And there <hi>would be</hi> No God without the Subſtance; but an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
ſtilneſs, without ſource or quality.</p>
                  <p>13. But in the ſource or quality the Fire becometh generated, and
out of the Fire, the Light, where then <hi>two</hi> Subſtances fever themſelves,
and drive on a Twofold ſource or <hi>quality;</hi> viz: a fierce wrathful hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
thirſty one, in the Fire, and a Meek lovely yeelding giving oue, in
the Light.</p>
                  <p>14. For, the Light giveth, and the Fire taketh away; the Light
giueth Meekneſs, and out of the Meekneſs, Subſtantiality, that is the
Fires <hi>food,</hi> or elſe it were a dark fierce wrathfull hunger in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>15. As indeed a Spirit <hi>is,</hi> if it have not the ſubſtance of the Light;
like a loathſome poyſon.</p>
                  <p>16. But if it <hi>attaineth</hi> ſubſtance of Meekneſs, then it attracteth that
in it ſelfe, and dwelleth therein, and uſeth it for food and alſo for the
Body; for it affecteth or infecteth it ſelfe therewith, and impregnateth
it ſelfe; for its ſubſtance is its <hi>ſatiating</hi> or fulfilling, and thus the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
becometh ſtilled.</p>
                  <p>17. We are to conceive of the humane Soul thus; it was taken out
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61375:53"/>
of the <hi>Center</hi> of Nature, not out of the<note n="*" place="margin">Or the four Elements.</note> Looking Glaſs of the Eternal,
as viz: out of the ſource or quality of <hi>this</hi> world, but out of the Eternal
Eſſence of the Spirit, or out of the firſt Principle of the Fathers property
<hi>as to,</hi> or according to Nature.</p>
                  <p>18. Not from Subſtance or from <hi>ſomewhat,</hi> but the Spirit of the
Deity breathed into it, the Life, underſtand, the <hi>Image,</hi> into Adams
<hi>ſelfe,</hi> out of all the Three Principles: It hath breathed into him, the
<hi>Center</hi> of Nature, as viz: the fire ſource or quality, to Life.</p>
                  <p>19. Alſo the <hi>Meekneſs</hi> of the Love, out of the ſubſtance of the
Deity, as the ſecond Principle with divine heavenly Subantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                  <p>20. As alſo the <hi>Spirit</hi> of this World, as the Loaking-Glaſs or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totype
or prefiguration of Gods wiſdom, with the Wonders.</p>
                  <p>21. But now the Spirit of this World is by the Devils kindling and
poyſon, which he hath <hi>darted</hi> thereinto, become periſhed, for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
dwelleth in this world, and is <hi>a continual</hi> infecter of the outward
Nature and property: though in the fierce wrath onely, viz: in the
harſh aſtringent deſire, he is Mighty powerful.</p>
                  <p>22. But he putteth his Imagination with his falſe <hi>Tincture,</hi> alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Love, and poyſoneth the Souls <hi>best</hi> Jewel: and hath infected A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams
ſoul, with his Imagination, with his <hi>Evil</hi> hunger-ſpirit, ſo that
Adams ſoul luſted after the Earthly ſource or quality, from which Luſt
it became impregnated with the Earthly ſource or <hi>quality;</hi> ſo that the
Outward Kingdom became introduced into the Inward, whence the
Light of the firſt Principle Extinguiſhed; and his divine Subſtantiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
wherein he ſhould live Eternally, <hi>became</hi> ſhut up in the Earthly
Death.</p>
                  <p>23. Thus, for this Image and alſo Soule, there was
no remedy more, <hi>unleſs</hi> then the
Deity did move it ſelf according to the ſecond Principle, viz: according
to the Light of Life in it; and did <hi>kindle</hi> the ſubſtantiality which
was ſhut up in Death, again with the Love Glance: which was done
in the becoming Man, or Incarnation, of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>24. And this is the Greateſt Wonder that God hath wrought; in
that he hath moved himſelf with the <hi>Center</hi> of the Holy Trinity <hi>in</hi> the
Womans Seed.</p>
                  <p>25. For Gods Heart <hi>would not</hi> reveal or Manifeſt it ſelfe in the Fire,
as viz. in the Mans <hi>Tincture,</hi> but in the Spirits <hi>Tincture,</hi> viz: in <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
in the Love of the Life, that the Fire in the Mans <hi>Tincture</hi> might
be apprehended with the Meekneſs and Love of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:61375:54"/>
26. For, the Eternal Life ſhould and muſt ſpring again <hi>out of</hi> the
ſhut up Death; For, here hath the Root <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">Numb. 17. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>the</hi> true <hi>Rod of
Aaran, budded, and boarn</hi> fair <hi>fruit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>27. For in Adam the Paradiſe was ſhut up in Death, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Earthly; but in Chriſt that <hi>ſpringeth</hi> again out of Death.</p>
                  <p>28. From Adam <hi>we</hi> have all inherited Death, but from Chriſt <hi>we</hi>
inherit the Eternal Life.</p>
                  <p>29. Chriſt is that virgin-like Image, which Adam ſhould have Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
out of himſelfe, with <hi>both</hi> the Tinctures.</p>
                  <p>30. But being he could not, therefore he was divided, and ſo it
muſt be done through <hi>Two</hi> Bodies<note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 49. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>till Shiloh came,</hi> that is the Sonne
of the Virgin, which became generated out of God and Man.</p>
                  <p>31. He is the Breaker through: of which the Prophets ſpake, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note n="*" place="margin">Iſai. 53. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>He ſhooteth up like a Plant or ſprout, he ſprouteth as a Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Tree,</hi> in Gods ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>32. He hath, with his entrance into the humane <hi>halfe</hi> dead Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
broken or deſtroyed death, for he ſprouted at once <hi>both</hi> in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
and divine Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>33. He brought to us, along with him in our Humanity, the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-like
Chaſtity, of the wiſdome of God, he <hi>environed</hi> our
ſouls Eſſence with heavenly ſubſtantiality.</p>
                  <p>34. He was the Champion or <hi>Saviour</hi> in the Battel, where the two
Kingdoms lay together in ſtrife, viz: Gods <hi>Anger</hi> and Gods <hi>Love;</hi>
he gave himſelfe willingly up into the Anger, and quenched it with
his Love, underſtand, <hi>in</hi> the humane Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>35. He came out of God into this world, and aſſumed our Soul
into himſelfe, <hi>that he might</hi> introduce us out of the Earthlineſs of this
world, again in himſelfe into God.</p>
                  <p>36. He generated <hi>us</hi> again <hi>a new</hi> in himſelfe, that we might be
capable to live in God.</p>
                  <p>37. Out<note n="†" place="margin">James 1. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>of his will begat he</hi> or generated he <hi>us,</hi> that we ſhould
put our will into him, and then he bringeth us in himſelfe to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
into <hi>our</hi> Native Country, again: viz: into Paradiſe out of which
<hi>Adam</hi> went forth.</p>
                  <p>38. He is <hi>become</hi> our Fountain, his water ſpringeth up in us: he is
our Spring, and we are Drops in him, he is become the fulneſs of our
ſubſtantiality, that <hi>we</hi> in him may live in God.</p>
                  <p>39. For, God is become Man, he hath introduced his abyſſal <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurable</hi>
ſubſtance <hi>into</hi> the Humanity; his Subſtance which fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the Heaven that he manifeſted in the Humanity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:61375:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
40. Thus, the Humane Subſtance and Gods ſubſtance are become
<hi>one</hi> ſubſtance, one fulneſs of God; <hi>our</hi> ſubſtance is his moving in his
Heaven.</p>
                  <p>51. <hi>We</hi> are his Children, his Wonder, his moving in his abyſſal
Body.</p>
                  <p>42. He is Father, and we his Children in him: we <hi>dwell</hi> in him
and he in Us; we are his Inſtrument, wherewith he ſeeketh and maketh
what he will.</p>
                  <p>43 He is the Fire, and alſo the Light, together with <hi>all</hi> ſubſtance,
or every thing. He is hidden, and the Work maketh
<hi>him</hi> Manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>44. Thus we know that God is a Spirit; and <hi>his</hi> Eternal Will is
Magicall that is <hi>deſirous;</hi> he alwayes maketh ſubſtance out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
ond that in a <hi>twofold</hi> ſource, viz: according to the Fire and
Light.</p>
                  <p>45. Out of the fire, cometh fierce wrath, climing up, Pride, willing
<hi>not</hi> to <hi>unite</hi> it ſelfe with the Light; but a fierce wrathful Eager Earneſt
will, according to which he is not called God, but a fierce wrathful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
Fire.</p>
                  <p>46. This Fire alſo becometh <hi>not</hi> manifeſt in the pure Deity, for the
Light hath ſwallowed up the Fire into it ſelf, and giveth to the Fire its
Love, its ſubſtantiality, <hi>its</hi> water, ſo that in Gods
ſubſtance there is <hi>onely</hi> Love,
Joy, and a pleaſant habitation, and no fire, <hi>known.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>47. But the Fire is onely a Cauſe of the deſirous Will and of the
Love, as alſo of the Light and of the Majeſty, <hi>elſe</hi> there would be no
ſubſtance: As it hath been largely expounded in the former wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
                  <p>48. And now it is known to <hi>Us,</hi> wherein our New Regeneration
ſtandeth, even while we are <hi>yet</hi> in this world, covered with the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Tent or Tabernacle, and are fallen home to the Earthly life, viz:
meerly, in the <hi>Imagination,</hi> that wee with our
will enter into Gods will, and wholly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
and give up our ſelves into Him, which is called <hi>Faith,</hi> or,
Beleeving.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:61375:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
49. For Word <hi>Faith,</hi> or, <hi>Glauden, Believing,</hi> is not Hiſtorical, but it is
a receiving out of Gods Subſtance, <hi>to Eat</hi> of Gods Subſtance, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
Gods ſubſtance with the Imagination into the Souls Fire, to
ſtill its hunger therewith, and <hi>ſo to put on</hi> the Subſtance of
God.</p>
                  <p>50. Not as a Garment, but as a Body of the Soul; the Soul muſt
have Gods Subſtance in its Fire, it muſt Eat the <hi>Bread</hi> of God, if it
will be a Child.</p>
                  <p>51. Thus alſo it becometh New born in Gods Spirit and Subſtance,
which Spirit it <hi>tranſplanteth</hi> out of the ſoyl of the fierce wrath and
Anger, into the ſoyl of Love, Meekneſs, and humility of God, and
bloſſometh forth with a new bloſſom in Gods ſoyl or field.</p>
                  <p>52 And that bloſſome which groweth in Gods <hi>Love,</hi> is the
right true Image of the Deity,
which God <hi>deſired</hi> when he Created Adam to or in his likeneſs, <hi>that</hi>
now hath Gods and Mans Sonne, Regenerated, to us, again.</p>
                  <p>53. For his Regeneration out of God and out of our Subſtance, is
<hi>our</hi> Regeneration; his power, Life, and Spirit, is all ours.</p>
                  <p>54. And we need do no more to it, but that we onely and meerly,
<hi>enter</hi> with our will-Spirit, through him
into Gods ſubſtance, and ſo our Will becometh generated in Gods will,
and <hi>receiveth</hi> divine power and ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>55. Not ſtrange ſubſtance, but <hi>our</hi> firſt, with which we with Adam
entered into Death: and that awakeneth and raiſeth up again to us,
the firſt born out of the Dead, which is <hi>Chriſtus, Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>56. He is God, but yet is generated or born out of <hi>us,</hi> that he
might make us living from or out of the Death.</p>
                  <p>57. Not any <hi>ſtrange</hi> Life which we have not had in this World,
but our own Life for Gods purpoſe muſt ſtand.</p>
                  <p>58. The fait bloſſome and Image, muſt grow out of the Corrupted
ſoyl, and <hi>not onely</hi> ſo, but alſo out of the pure Soyl.</p>
                  <p>59. We muſt be generated or Born of or out of the Virgin, not
out of the Man of the Anger, out of the Fires <hi>Tincture,</hi> but out of the
Lights <hi>Tincture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>60. We put on the Virgin of Chriſt, with our giving up our ſelves
<hi>thereinto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>61. We herewith become the Virgin of Modeſty and Chaſtity and
purity <hi>in Ternario Sancto,</hi> in the holy Ternary, in the Angelical world;
a Looking-Glaſs of the Holy Trinity, whetein God beholdeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61375:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and which he hath taken to him for his <hi>Spouſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>62. He is our <hi>Husband</hi> or Man, to whom we in Chriſt have been
betrothed Maried and incorporated.</p>
                  <p>63. And We, are now, <hi>Mary,</hi> in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace out
of which God and Man become generated or born.</p>
                  <p>64. <hi>Mary,</hi> was the <hi>firſt</hi> in the high bleſſing, for in her was the Mark
at which the Covenant aimed or pointed.</p>
                  <p>65. She was known in God in the highly precious Name JESU, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the foundation of the World was laid.</p>
                  <p>66. Not that ſhe brought the Life out of Death, but that God, <hi>in
her,</hi> would bring the Life out of Death: and therefore ſhe became
highly bleſſed; and the pure virgin Modeſty was put on, to her.</p>
                  <p>67. And out of that Virginity,
out of which Chriſt became Generated or born, we all <hi>muſt</hi> be genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or Born; for we muſt become<note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 14. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Virgins, and follow</hi> after <hi>the Lamb</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>68. The <hi>water</hi> is the Virginity, for the Virgin bringeth the Lights
and Waters <hi>Tincture,</hi> viz: Love and Meekneſs.</p>
                  <p>69. And the <hi>Spirit,</hi> out of which we muſt become generated or

and life of the bloſſome.</p>
                  <p>70. Not according to the Fire-ſource or quality of the fierce wrath,

Modesty or Chaſtity in the Becoming Man

                  <p>1. WE poor Children of Eve, <hi>finde</hi> in us, no pure virgin-like

made us all Feminine and Maſculine.</p>

<hi>we</hi> were diſcerned or diſcovered <hi>before</hi> the times of the world by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, and were know in the Name of JESU, we muſt Enter
with our Will-Spirit.</p>
                  <p>5. For, our true Image, in which we are the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of God, is
with Adam and Eve extinguiſhed to <hi>Us,</hi> and become Earthly.</p>
                  <p>6. Which is done through Luſt or Imagination; and ſo Gods
clear Countenance became <hi>covered;</hi> for we loſt the heavenly Modeſty
or Chaſtity.</p>
                  <p>7. But ſeeing God, for us, hath, out of his favour and Love, <hi>opened</hi>
his clear countenance towards us again in the becoming Man, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,
of Chriſt: and ſo now it lyeth in this; that as we in <hi>Adam</hi>
have <hi>imagined</hi> into the earthly longing, whence we are becom Earthly, ſo
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61375:56"/>
we now ſet our deſiring will in the haven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Virgin, and bring our longing thereinto, and then our
<hi>Image</hi> goeth out from the Earthly Woman; and conceiveth the virgin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Eſſence and property, wherein God dwelleth, wherein the ſouls I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
<hi>may</hi> attain the Countenance of God again.</p>
                  <p>8. Outward Reaſon ſaith, <hi>how</hi> may that come to paſs? that we
might be born again out of <hi>the Virgin,</hi> out of which Chriſt was
born? It underſtandeth <hi>ſolely</hi> Mary: but we underſtand, not the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which is a <hi>creaturely</hi> Virgin.</p>
                  <p>9. For as we alſo, in the <hi>immaterial</hi> Virgin-like modeſty or chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
became Creaturely Virgins, ſo if we enter into the becoming Man
or Incarnation of Chriſt; not according to the outward Life in the
four Elements, but according to the <hi>Inward</hi> in the One Element,
where the Fire of God ſwalloweth up the four Elements <hi>into</hi> it ſelf; and
yet in his Light, viz: in the ſecond Principle, wherein, the outward
Man and Woman <hi>must go</hi> through death, in Chriſts reſurrection, as
a virgin in the one Element, wherein all the four lye hidden; we then
grow forth and ſpring in the Right vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>10. We muſt <hi>dye</hi> away from the Man and the Woman, and Crucifie
the <hi>Corrupt</hi> Adam: he muſt die with Chriſt and be caſt into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

                  <p>11. That ſwalloweth up the Earthly Man &amp; the Earthly Woman, and

a virgin-like Image, wherein the Man and the Woman is but <hi>one</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Image, with one only Love.</p>
                  <p>12. Now the Man ſets his Love in or upon the Woman, and the
Woman in or upon the Man; but if <hi>both the loves</hi> be turned into
one, there is then no deſire of Co-mixture <hi>more</hi> in the one onely I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
but the Image loveth it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>13. But now the Image, in the beginning was Created in the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-like
wiſedome of God, viz: out of the <hi>divine</hi> ſubſtantiality.</p>
                  <p>14. And now becauſe the ſubſtance <hi>was</hi> become Earthly and fallen
into death, therefore the Word which became Man awakened and raiſed
it <hi>up</hi> again; and ſo the Earthly ſource or quality remaineth with death
in the Anger, and the <hi>raiſed</hi> remaineth in the word of life, in the
virgin-like Modeſty or <hi>chaſtity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. And ſo we bear here in this World a <hi>two fold</hi> Man in <hi>one</hi> Perſon,
viz: a <hi>virgin-like</hi> Image born out of the becoming Man or Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chriſt; and an <hi>Earthly</hi> Image Maſculine and Feminine,
ſhut up in Death and in the Anger of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:61375:57"/>
16. The Earthly muſt <hi>bear</hi> the Croſs, and ſuffer it ſelfe to be ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
perſecuted and afflicted in the Anger, and becometh at length <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
to Death; and then the Anger ſwalloweth it up into the ſourcive
qualifycating fire of God.</p>
                  <p>17. And ſo if the word of Life, which in <hi>Mary,</hi> became Man, is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the Earthly Image, <hi>then,</hi> Chriſt, who wrought the word of
Life out of God, riſeth up from Death, and bringeth the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the
ſourcive or Qualificating fire, underſtand the humane Eſſence; <hi>out,</hi>
forth from Death.</p>
                  <p>18. For he <hi>is ariſen</hi> out from Death, and liveth in God, and his life
is become our Life, and his death our Death, we are buried in his
death, and ſprout forth, in his reſurrection and victory, in his
Life.</p>
                  <p>19. But underſtand the meaning right. <hi>Adam</hi> was the virgin-like
Image: he had peculiar Love of his own: for the Spirit of God had
breathed <hi>it</hi> into him: for what other can the Spirit of God breath out
of it ſelf, then what <hi>it ſelfe</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>20. But now, that, is <hi>All;</hi> and yet all ſources or qualities, are not
called God; but in all ſources or qualities there is but <hi>one</hi> onely Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which is God; viz: according to the ſecond principle in the Light;
<hi>yet</hi> there is no Light without Fire.</p>
                  <p>21. But in the fire, he is not the love-Spirit, or Holy Ghoſt; but the
fierce <hi>wrath</hi> of Nature and a cauſe of the Holy Spirit; an Anger and
a Conſuming fire.</p>
                  <p>22. For in Fire, is the Spirit of Nature, <hi>Free;</hi> and yet the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
fire alſo giveth or affordeth, Nature, and <hi>is</hi> it ſelfe,
Nature.</p>
                  <p>23. And yet we underſtand, but one holy Spirit, in the Light;
though indeed all is but <hi>one ſubſtance;</hi> yet we underſtand, that the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which is generated out of the Meekneſs of the Light, is as it were
impetent and <hi>obſcure;</hi> which the fire draweth and ſwalloweth up into
it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>24. But giveth forth out of the Material ſource or quality out of the
fire, a mighty potent Spirit, which is <hi>free</hi> from the Matter, and alſo
from the fire; and though the fire reteineth it: yet it apprehendeth not
<hi>its</hi> ſource or quality.</p>
                  <p>25. As we ſee, that the Light <hi>dwelleth</hi> in the Fire, and yet hath
not the ſource or quality of the Fire, but a Meek love-ſource or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61375:57"/>
                     <hi>which alſo,</hi> would not be, if the Matter were not
dead and conſumed in the Fire.</p>
                  <p>26. Thus we conſider and conceive of the firſt Adam; he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
or<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>Imagined</hi> out of the Lights Eſſence and ſubſtantiality, but
being he was to go into a Creature and was to be a total or <hi>entire</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of God, according to all ſubſtances, according to all the Three
Principles, <hi>therefore</hi> he became alſo apprehended with the word <hi>Fiat</hi>
in all ſubſtances of all the Three Principles, and was brought into a
Creature.</p>
                  <p>27. Now certainly, all the three Principles were <hi>free</hi> in Him, and
ſtood one in another, each in <hi>its Order,</hi> and ſo he was a right totall or
entire ſimilitude, of God, according to and out of the ſubſtance of all
ſubſtances.</p>
                  <p>18. But we are to know and obſerve; How the Third Principle, <hi>viz:</hi>
the ſource or quality of <hi>this world</hi> in the kindling of Lucifer, became
totally fierce wrathful thirſty and baſe or <hi>Evill;</hi> and inſtantly, in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam

of the pure Love out of the Holy Spirit had<note n="*" place="margin">Or oe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>29. But when the Love entered into the Earthly ſource or quality to
ſatisfie it, in its <hi>kindled</hi> thirſt; then the pure Material love conceived
or received the <hi>deſirous</hi> Earthly periſhed Cortupt Longing.</p>
                  <p>30. And then the ſecond Principle Extinguiſhed, not as a <hi>Death,</hi> as
that it were become a Nothing, but it became caprivated in the fierce
wrathful <hi>thirſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>31. Now then ſeeing God is a Light, the pure Love-ſource or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
ſtood as ſhut up in Death <hi>without</hi> the Light of God.</p>
                  <p>32. And now the Image was periſhed and captivated in the fierce
wrath of God, and the Own ſelfe-love <hi>loſt</hi> its might and ſtrength,
for it was ſhut up in the periſhed corrupt Earthlineſs, and loved
Earthlneſs.</p>
                  <p>33. Thus a Woman or Wife <hi>muſt</hi> be made out of this Image, and
the <hi>Two</hi> Tinctures viz: the fires Eſſence, and the <hi>Matrixes</hi> watery Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
muſt be parted, viz: into a Man and a Woman.</p>
                  <p>34. Whereas yet the Love thus became moving in a twofold ſource
or quality, and ſo one <hi>Tincture</hi> loved and deſired the other, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
together, whence the Generation was <hi>to be</hi> propagated and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:61375:58"/>
35. But now this Generation of Men, thus in the Earthly ſource
or quality, could <hi>not know</hi> or ſee God, for the pure Immaculate Love
was ſhut up in the Earthly thirſty ſource or quality, and was ſhut up
and captivated in the fierce wrath of the Eternal Nature, which Lucifer
had kindled: for the fierce wrath had <hi>attracted</hi> the love with the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
into it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>36. That now in the <hi>captivated love,</hi> ſtood the virgin-like Mc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
or Chaſtity of the wiſdome of God; which to <hi>Adam,</hi> was with
the ſecond Principle, with the heavenly ſubſtantiality; together incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
to his body, and much more the Spirit of the Meek ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality,
through the <hi>breathing in</hi> of the Holy Spirit; which was brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
into <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>37. And ſo now ther was no Remedy, <hi>unleſs</hi> the Deity
awakened it ſelfe, in the divine Virgin, according to the ſecond Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
in the virginity which was ſhut up in Death; and that <hi>another</hi>
Image, came to be out of the Firſt.</p>
                  <p>38. Thus it is ſufficiently known and underſtood by <hi>us;</hi> that the
firſt Image muſt be given to the fierce wrath, wherewith it <hi>might</hi> quench
its thirſt: and muſt go into Conſumption, as into the Eſſential fire;
whereas yet the Eſſence <hi>dieth not,</hi> nor conſumeth.</p>
                  <p>39. For which cauſe, God hath appointed a Day, wherein he will
being <hi>the Eſſence</hi> of the Old and firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> through the fire, that it
might be delivered or looſed from the <hi>vanity</hi>
viz: form the Longing of the Devil, and of the Anger of the Eternal
Nature.</p>
                  <p>40. And we underſtand further, that God hath again borught into
US, the life of his Eternal ſubſtance, when he moved himſelfe, with his
own heart and Word, or <hi>power</hi> of the divine Life in the virginity which
was ſhut up in Death, viz: in the true pure Love; and <hi>kindled</hi> that again;
and introduced his heavenly ſubſtantiality, with the pure Virginity
into the virginity which was <hi>ſhut up</hi> in Death; and hath, out of the
heavenly, and out of the Virginity that was ſhut up in Death and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<hi>generated</hi> a New Image.</p>
                  <p>41. And then Thirdly we underſtand; that this New Image, muſt,
<hi>through Death</hi> and the fierce wrath of the fire, be introuduced again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the heavenly divine ſubſtantialit, <hi>in Ternarium Sanctum,</hi> into the
Holy Ternary.</p>
                  <p>42. For, the Earthly longing which the Devil had <hi>poſſeſſed,</hi> muſt

became Man, that became Man alſo in like manner, <hi>in all Men</hi> that had
dyed from <hi>Adam,</hi> to that time; who had given up and Commended

the Corrupted periſhed Adam, who <hi>would</hi> but ſuffer that word to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken

                     <p>58. <hi>Adam</hi> is the ſtock, we all are his branches, but <hi>Christ</hi> is become
our ſap virtue and life.</p>
                     <p>59. Now if a branch on the Tree <hi>withereth,</hi> what can the virtue,
and the ſap of the Tree do to it: It giveth its <hi>virtue</hi> to all brances
why then doth not the branceh draw the ſap and virtue <hi>into</hi> it.</p>
                     <p>60. The fault is, that Man draweth <hi>devilliſh</hi> virtue or power and

Devil ſeduce him into <hi>Earthly deſires</hi> longing and luſt.</p>
                     <p>61. For, the Devil knoweth the Branch, which in the Country that

a Murtheter and lyer at the beginning, <hi>ſo he is ſtill,</hi> and infecteth or

                     <p>62. Being he knoweth, that they are fallen to the outward Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                        <hi>Faith alone attaineth it;</hi> very right: In
the right Faith the Impregnation proceedeth.</p>
                     <p>71. For, Faith is Spirit, and <hi>deſireth</hi> Subſtance, and that ſubſtance
is nevertheleſs <hi>in all</hi> Men, and that which is wanting, is, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the Spirit of Faith.</p>
                     <p>72. And if it be come apprehended, then the fair Lilly <hi>bloſſometh</hi>
out of it: not onely a Spirit, but the Virgin-like Image, becometh ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
or born out of Death <hi>into Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>73. The Rod of Aaron, which is dry; ſprouteth forth out of the dry
death, and taketh <hi>its body</hi> out of Death; the fair New virgin-like life,
out of the halfe dead virginity.</p>
                     <p>74. And this, the dry Rod of Aaron ſignified; as alſo Old <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
alſo <hi>Abraham</hi> with his old <hi>Sarah;</hi> who according to the outward
world were all as it were dead, and no more fruitful.</p>
                     <p>75. But the Promiſe in the New Regeneration muſt <hi>do</hi> it, the Life
muſt ſprout out of Death.</p>
                     <p>76. The Old <hi>Adam</hi> which became Earthly muſt not be Lord; Nor
<hi>Eſau</hi> the firſt born, to whom formerly the Inheritance had belonged if
<hi>Adam</hi> had continued ſtanding; But the ſecond Adam, <hi>Christ,</hi> who
ſprouted forth through death out of the firſt, muſt remain Lord.</p>
                     <p>77. Not the Man or the Woman, ſhall poſſeſs the Kingdom of God,
but the <hi>Virgin,</hi> which becometh generated or born out of the Mans
and Womans Death, muſt be Queen of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>78. One onely Generation or ſex, not two; one onely <hi>Tree,</hi> not
Many: Chriſt was the ſtock, being he was the root of the New Body
which ſprouteth out of Death, which brought forth the <hi>dead</hi> virgin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
as a fair branch out of Death.</p>

79. And we all are his ſprouts and ſtand all upon <hi>one stock,</hi> which is
Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>80. Thus we are Chriſts Sprouts, his branches, his children, and
God is the <hi>Father of as all,</hi> and alſo of Chriſt,<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 17. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>In him we live and
Move and are.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>81. We bear Chriſts Fleſh and bloud in us, if we do but <hi>come</hi> to
the New Birth, for we become regenerated in Chriſts Spirit.</p>
                     <p>82. That in <hi>Mary;</hi> became a living Man in the dead humanity,
without the touching of a Man, and that alſo becometh a Man in our
ſelves, in <hi>our</hi> dead virginity.</p>
                     <p>83. And henceforward that which is wanting is this, that we caſt
the Old Adam viz: the <hi>Husk;</hi> into Death, that the Earthly lifes qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or ſource may depart from us, and ſo we go forth from the Devil,
out of <hi>his</hi> Country.</p>
                     <p>84. And not alone this; for, the Old Adam muſt not be ſo <hi>total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
caſt away, but the Huske onely,
viz: the <hi>Shell</hi> wherein the Seed or Kernel lyeth.</p>
                     <p>85. Out of the <hi>Old</hi> Eſſence muſt the <hi>New</hi> Man in Gods bleſſing
ſprout forth, as the blade out of the Grain, or Corn, as Chriſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us.</p>
                     <p>86.<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> Therefore muſt the Eſſence be <hi>injected</hi> into Gods Anger, muſt
be perſecuted, afflicted, plagued, ſcorned, and lye under the Croſs: for
the New Man muſt ſprout forth out of God anger fire, he muſt be <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
in the Fire.</p>
                     <p>87. We were fallen home to the Angers Eſſence; but the Love of
God <hi>ſet it ſelfe</hi> in the Anger, and quenched the Anger with the Love
in the blood of the Heavenly ſubſtantiality in the Death of
Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>88. Thus the Anger <hi>reteined</hi> the Husk, viz: the periſhed corrupt
Man, underſtand the Earthly ſource or quality; and the Love reteined
the New Man.</p>
                     <p>89. Therefore can no Man <hi>beſides,</hi>
ſhed heavenly Bloud, the Earthly Mortal Bloud onely; for, Chriſt, who
was conceived without Man and Woman, <hi>he onely</hi> could do it; for, in
his heavenly ſubſtantiality there was no Earthly Blood.</p>
                     <p>90. But yet he did ſhed his heavenly bloud under or <hi>among</hi> the
Earthly, that he might deliver us poor Earthly Men from the fierce
wrath.</p>
                     <p>91. For, his heavenly bloud muſt in <hi>its</hi> bloud ſhedding mix it ſelfe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61375:61"/>
together with the Earthly, that the <hi>Turba</hi> in the Earthlineſs in us, which
held us captive, might be drowned; and that the Anger might be
quenched with the love of the Heavenly bloud.</p>
                     <p>92. He gave his life for us, into Death, <hi>he went</hi> for us, <hi>into Hell,</hi>
into the ſource or quality of the Fathers Fire; and out of Hell again
into God; that he might break or deſtroy Death, and <hi>drown</hi> the Anger,
and make way for us.</p>
                     <p>93. Therefore now the whole matter depends on this that we <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>

                     <p>24. For, the Old Husk belongeth to the Anger of God, it muſt be
purged.</p>
                     <p>95. For, it is not the Old Man, that muſt live in us, but the New:
the old is to be given up to the Anger, for, the New Man <hi>bloſſometh</hi> up
out of the Anger, as the Light ſhineth out of the Fire.</p>
                     <p>96. Thus the Old Adam muſt be
Wood or <hi>Fewel</hi> for the Fire;
that the New may ſprout forth in the Light of the Fire; for it muſt
ſubſiſt in the Fire.</p>
                     <p>97. That is not Eternal, which cannot ſubſiſt in the Fire, and which
ariſeth <hi>not</hi> out of the Fire.</p>
                     <p>98. Our <hi>Soul</hi> is out of Gods Fire, and the <hi>Body</hi> out of the

which is <hi>no Spirit,</hi> but an Eſſential Fire.</p>
                     <p>100. The<note n="†" place="margin">The Spirit of the Soul.</note> Spirit is much higher; for its Original is the fire of the

                  <p>37. He is indeed very Joyful: <hi>like one</hi> that danceth to an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

and he remaineth to be the Old Adam; for he belongeth to the Earth,

                  <p>38. So ſoon as it cometh ſo farre with a Man, that the virgin-like

                  </p>

the Old Adam <hi>may</hi> touch infect and poſſes it.</p>
                  <p>40. Becauſe his own dwelling in the Darkneſs of the Abyſs pleaſeth

                  <p>42. But being he dare not touch the virgin-like Branch, therefore

                  <p>44. But the Noble Lilly Twig or Branch, <hi>groweth</hi> in

                  <p>45. Not out of any <hi>strange</hi> or Heterogene property, but out of its

                     <hi>The Old Adam knoweth not the New,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth

                  </p>
                  <p>49. Therefore the Old goeth often very <hi>mournfully</hi> about, when it
ſeeth it muſt be a fool, and yet knoweth <hi>not</hi> how it befalleth him, for he
knoweth not Gods will.</p>
                  <p>50. He hath <hi>onely</hi> the will of this world, what there flattereth faire,
he willeth to have that; he would fain be Lord continually, before
whom, Men muſt bowe or ſtoop.</p>
                  <p>41. But the New boweth it ſelfe before its God, and deſireth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
alſo <hi>willeth nothing,</hi> but it panteth after its God, as a childe
after its Mother; It caſteth it ſelfe into the boſome of its Mother, and
giveth its <hi>body up</hi> to its heavenly Mother, into the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>52. It deſireth the food and Drink of its <hi>Eternal</hi> Mother, and it

                  <p>53. For, ſo long as it is covered in the Old Adam, ſo long it is yet
in the becoming Man or Incarnation; but <hi>when</hi> the Old dyeth, then the

                  <p>54. It leaveth the Veſſel, wherein it <hi>lay,</hi> and became a virgin-like

                     <hi>not</hi> PERFECT.</p>
                  <p>57. This is no otherwiſe then as with a child, where the ſeed with

the <hi>Impregnation</hi> beginneth.</p>
                  <p>59. And the Soul apprehendeth in it ſelfe, the Word, that moved it
ſelfe in <hi>Mary,</hi> in the <hi>Center</hi> of the Holy Trinity, which in <hi>Mary,</hi> with
the Modeſt highly bleſſed heavenly Virgin, the wiſedom of God gave
in it ſelfe into the halfe dead Virgin, and <hi>became</hi> a True Man.</p>
                  <p>60. That very Word, which in <hi>Mary,</hi> in the Center of the Holy
Trinity, moved or <hi>rouſed</hi> it ſelfe, which united or Eſpouſed it ſelfe with
the half dead ſhut up virginity; apprehendeth the Souliſh Fire; and

viz: in the ſhut up virgin-like wiſdom, the Impregnation <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>61. For, Mans love-Tincture apprehendeth Gods Love-Tincture;
and the ſeed is <hi>ſown</hi> in the Holy Spirit in the Souls Image; as in Our

                  <p>62. Now behold! When the virgin-like Marks, in Gods love, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
then <hi>may</hi> this twig or branch be born; <hi>for in God</hi>
ALL <hi>is</hi> PERFECT.</p>
                  <p>63. But being it ſticketh covered in the Old Adam, and ſtandeth
onely as it were in the Eſſence as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:61375:65"/>
concerning it: for, many attain this Twig or Branch <hi>firſt</hi> at their <hi>last</hi>
End.</p>
                  <p>64. And though indeed he hath brought it along with him out of
his Mothers body or <hi>womb,</hi> yet it becometh periſhed or corrupt, and
broken, and made earthly, <hi>by many.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>65. Thus it goeth alſo with the poor ſinner, when he <hi>repenteth,</hi> but
afterwards becometh an Evil Man, it goeth with him as befell <hi>Adam,</hi>
who was a fair Glorious Image Created and highly Englightned from
God.</p>
                  <p>66. But when he ſuffered Luſt to overcome him, he became Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and his fair Image became <hi>captivated</hi> in the Earthly ſource or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in the Anger of God; and thus it goeth <hi>continually.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>67. But this we ſay: according as we have received enlightning in the
Grace of God, and have wreſtled <hi>much</hi> for the Garland; that they that
in the Earneſt continue ſtedfaſt or Conſtant, till his Twig or Branch,
get a Bud or little <hi>bloſſom,</hi> his Twig or branch will <hi>not eaſily</hi> be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in one or more <hi>ſtorms:</hi> for that which is weak, hath alſo a weak
life.</p>
                  <p>68. We ſpeak not thus in or as concerning the <hi>Deity,</hi> but <hi>Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
it is thus, and indeed alſo all is done Naturally; for the Eternal hath
alſo its Nature, and the one doth but proceed out of
the other.</p>
                  <p>69. If this world <hi>bad not</hi> been poyſoned by the Malignity and fierce
wrath of the Devil, then Adam had <hi>continued</hi> in this world in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
and there would have been <hi>no</hi> ſuch fierce wrath in the Starres and
Elements.</p>
                  <p>70. For the Devil was a King and great Lord in the place of this
world, and he <hi>hath</hi> awakened the fierce wrath.</p>
                  <p>71. God <hi>therefore</hi> created the Heaven out of the midſt of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that the fiery Nature, viz: the fiery Firmament, might be <hi>captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
with the water-Heaven, that its fierce wrath might be quenched.</p>
                  <p>72. Elſe, if the water ſhould be gone or <hi>paſs away,</hi> Men would
plainly ſee, what would be in this world, nothing elſe but a cold ſtern
<hi>harſh</hi> aſtringent and <hi>fiery</hi> burning: yet onely <hi>Dark,</hi> for there could be
no Light; for, the Light ſubſiſteth meerly in the Meekneſs: ſo there can
alſo be no ſhining fire, except it have meek ſubſtantiality.</p>
                  <p>73. Therefore it is known to US, that God hath burned the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſubſtantiality into water, which was done <hi>Naturally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>74. When God the Father moved himſelfe, and the Devil fell, who
would be a fire-Lord over the Meekneſs; then there was ſuch a <hi>Bolt</hi>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:61375:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thruſt in before his poyſoned Malignity: ſo that now he is Gods Ape
or <hi>Mimick,</hi> and not Lord, a raver and fulfiller in the Anger-ſource or
quality.</p>
                  <p>75. Therefore being we know this; that we are <hi>environed</hi> with the
Anger, we ſhould have a care of our ſelves, and not ſo ſlightly and
<hi>meanly</hi> Eſteem our ſelves: for we are, not onely from this world, but
alſo in lik manner, from the <hi>divine</hi> World, which ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
hidden in this world, and is <hi>neer</hi> us.</p>
                  <p>76. We can live and be in Three worlds at once; if we ſprout forth
with the virgin-like Image, <hi>out of</hi> the Evil life.</p>
                  <p>77. Eor, we live in the firſt Principle, in the fire-world in the fire,
as to the Eſſential-ſoul, viz: as to <hi>the</hi> fire-ſource or quality, in the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of Nature of <hi>Eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>78. And then, with the right pure Virgin Image, we <hi>live in</hi> the
Light-flaming, Paradiſe-world, although in the place of this world the
ſame <hi>is not manifeſt,</hi> yet in the virgin Image in the Holy Spirit, and
in the word that dwelleth in the virgin-like Image, <hi>becometh</hi>
known.</p>
                  <p>79. And then Thirdly, with the Old Adam, we live in this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<hi>ſickly</hi> world with the Devil in his kindled ſickneſs or Longing:
therefore it is ſaid <hi>be Watchful,</hi>

                  <p>81. In Gods Kingdome we need wo ſubtilty, we are onely <hi>Children</hi>
in the boſome of the Mother; but in this world we muſt be watchfull,
or Circumſpect, or look to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>82. We carry the Noble <hi>Treaſure</hi> in an Earthly Veſſel; it is ſoon

a valley of <hi>Miſery,</hi> full of anguiſh, Croſſes, cares, ſorrow and troubles:
we are here ſtrange Gueſts, and are upon the <hi>Path</hi> of our Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
                  <p>94. We muſt wander through great diſmall wilde deſert Corners;

                  </p>
                  <p>96. But we know and ſay this with good ground; that <hi>when</hi> the
Noble Twig or Branch groweth, and becometh ſtrong: then in that
Man, the Old Adam <hi>muſt</hi> be Servant: muſt go behinde, and often do

                  <p>97. But, the virgin-like Image in Chriſt ſubdueth him, for it will
readily and with Joy follow after Chriſt <hi>its Bridegroom,</hi> and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to him in the Croſs and <hi>tribulation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>98. And we may well ſay this alſo: that indeed none become

again; for in that place, God becometh Man: How then can there be
but Great Joy?</p>
                  <p>102. The <hi>Old</hi> Adam danceth for Company, but as an Aſs after the

                  <p>104. If thou overcomeſt, and wilt be acknowledged and received
for a victorious Child of God; then will the <hi>womans Crown</hi> with the

105. For, while the virgin-like Image lyeth yet ſhut up in the Old
Adam, it attaineth <hi>not</hi> the Angels-Crown; for it ſtandeth yet in
great danger and hazard.</p>
                  <p>106. But when it is born, with the dying of the Old Adam; and

                  <p>3. I find indeed, the great longing and deſire after it; but cannot ſee,
where my heart might reſt.</p>
                  <p>4. I am yet continually as a Woman, which would fain bring forth:
<hi>how fain</hi> would I ſee my fruit, which is promiſed me from my God.</p>
                  <p>5. There is a Continual longing for the Birth,<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 19. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>one day calleth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Morning to the Evening, and the Night to the Day again,</hi>
and hopeth in the Abſtinence; when once the clear Morning Star will
ariſe, which will give reſt to the Mind.</p>
                  <p>6. And it is with it, as with a Woman, that laboureth for the Birth;
that continually <hi>hopeth</hi> for the diſcovery, and waiteth for it with long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and groaning.</p>
                  <p>7. Thus my beloved, Children of God, it goeth with us, we ſuppoſe
that we are far off from it; yet thus <hi>we ſtand in</hi> the Birth; we generato
thus in great groaning in anguiſh; and know not the ſeed which we
generate; for it lyeth <hi>ſhut up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. We generate not as to this World; <hi>how</hi> will we then ſee the fruit
with the Eyes of this world? neither doth the fruit <hi>belong</hi> to this
world.</p>
                  <p>9. But ſeeing we have attained the True knowledge of this Matter,
not as to the outward Man, but as to the Inward; therefore we will
pourtray it in a <hi>ſimilitude,</hi> for the Readers ſake, and for our Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>10. If we would conſider our ſelves, how we are ſo <hi>twofold,</hi> with a
Twofold Mind, Thoughts, ſenſes
and will, we can not better come to the knowledge thereof
then by conſidering the Creature or Creation.</p>
                  <p>11. We ſee a rude ſtone lying on the ground, and in many of them,
there is the <hi>beſt</hi> Gold, and we ſee plainly how the Gold gliſters in the
Stone, but the ſtone is <hi>inanimate,</hi> and knoweth not that it hath ſuch
Noble precious Gold in it.</p>
                  <p>12. So alſo we; we are Earthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Sulphur,</hi> but we have an Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Sulphur</hi> in the Earthly, wherein each is its own by it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>13. Indeed, during this life time, they are one among another, but
they qualifie or operate <hi>not</hi> together, one with the other, the one is the
<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note>
                     <hi>conteiner</hi> and dwelling-houſe of the other.</p>

                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:61375:68"/>
14. As we ſee in Gold, that the rude droſſy ſtone is not the Gold,
but is onely its <hi>receptacle</hi> that conteineth it; alſo its rude droſſineſs
doth not afford the Gold; but the <hi>Tinctura ſolis,</hi> or Tincture of <hi>Sol</hi>
affordeth it in the rude Stone.</p>
                  <p>15. But the rude Stone is the Mother, and <hi>Sol</hi> is the Father, for <hi>Sol</hi>
impregnateth the rude ſtone, becauſe it hath the <hi>Center</hi> of Nature, out
of which <hi>Sol</hi> hath its Original.</p>
                  <p>16. If we would go on into the <hi>Center,</hi> we would ſet it down: but ſeeing
it is ſufficiently explained in the other writings we let it alone <hi>here.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. But ſo it is alſo with Men; the <hi>Earthly</hi> Man is ſignified by the
rude droſſy Stone: <hi>Sol</hi> ſignifieth the Word which became Man, which
impregnateth the corrupted periſhed Man.</p>
                  <p>18. The cauſe is this: the Corrupted periſhed Man is indeed Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he hath the <hi>Eternal</hi> Center of Nature, he longeth after Gods<note n="*" place="margin">Word or New-Man, viz: the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Gold.</note> 
                     <hi>Sol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
for in his Creation Gods <hi>Sol,</hi> was taken along to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>19. But now the rude Stone hath <hi>over-grown</hi> the Gold, and hath
ſwallowed it up into it ſelfe, ſo that the Gold is intermixed with the
rude droſſy <hi>Sulphur:</hi> and cannot eſcape the rude <hi>Sulphur,</hi> unleſs it be
<hi>clenſed</hi> in the fire, ſo that the rude droſſineſs be melted away, and then
<hi>Sol</hi> remaineth alone.</p>
                  <p>20. Underſtand this of Dying and conſuming, therein the rude
droſſy Earthly <hi>fleſh,</hi> is melted away, and then the virgin-like ſpiritual
fleſh, remaineth alone</p>
                  <p>21. Underſtand us aright, what we mean; we ſpeak the precious and
ſublime Truth, as we <hi>know</hi> and underſtand it.</p>
                  <p>22. The New-Man is not onely a <hi>Spirit:</hi> He is even Fleſh and
Blood, as the Gold in the <hi>ſtone</hi> is not onely Spirit, it hath a Body,
but not ſuch a one as the rude droſſy ſtone is; but a Body, which <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſisteth</hi>
in the Center of Nature, in the Fire.</p>
                  <p>23. Whoſe Body, the fire <hi>cannot</hi> Conſume, and that, becauſe the
Gold hath another Principle.</p>
                  <p>24. Doſt thou know this thou Earthly Man? No, It juſtly remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Mute in ſilence: for the Earth is <hi>not worthy</hi> of the Gold, though
indeed it carrieth it, and alſo generateth it.</p>
                  <p>25. So alſo the earthly Man, is not worthy of the <hi>Jewel,</hi>
which he carrieth, and though indeed he helpeth to generate it, yet he
is but dark or dusky Earth, <hi>in reſpect</hi> of the virgin-childe, born of God.</p>
                  <p>26. And as the Gold hath a true Body, which lyeth hidden and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61375:68"/>
captive in the rude droſſy ſtone: ſo alſo the virgin-like <hi>Tincture</hi> in the
Earthly Man hath a true real Heavenly <hi>divine Body</hi> in fleſh and blood.</p>
                  <p>27. But <hi>not in ſuch</hi> fleſh and and blood as the Earthly: It can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in the Fire, it goeth through Stone and Wood, and is not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended;
as the Gold preſſeth through the rude Stone and breaketh it
<hi>Not,</hi> neither doth it break or deſtroy it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>28. Thus it is alſo with the Earthly Man: when he conceiveth the
Word of life, which became Man in Chriſt, then he conceiveth it in
the periſhed <hi>Sulphur</hi> of his fleſh and Blood, in the virgin-like <hi>Center</hi>
which was ſhut up in Death; wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was a virgin like Image:
wherein the wilde Earth inveloped, his Gold of the clear Divine
Subſtantiality; ſo that the heavenly muſt ſtand in Death
in the <hi>Center</hi> of the Fire: In that very <hi>Center,</hi> I ſay.</p>
                  <p>29. And in <hi>that very</hi> Center, the Word of Life moved it ſelf, which
became Man in <hi>Mary,</hi> and therein, the Subſtantiality ſhut up in
Death, <hi>attained</hi> a living Tincture.</p>
                  <p>30. And then the Noble Gold, viz: the heavenly ſubſtantiality in
Death, began to ſprout forth, and had <hi>instantly in it ſelfe</hi> the Holy
Spirit in the word of Life, which<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> there proceedeth from the Father
and the Sonne, and maketh the wiſdome, viz: the heavenly Virgin, as a
Looking-Glaſs of the Expreſs Image of the Deity, as a pure <hi>Sulphur</hi>
for it ſelfe; a pure fleſh and bloud wherein it dwelleth.</p>
                  <p>31. Not earthly Eſſence, but divine Eſſence, out of the heavenly
Subſtantiality.</p>
                  <p>32. This is<note n="*" place="margin">Note. Joh. 6. 54.</note> 
                     <hi>the</hi> true real <hi>Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt;</hi> for it groweth
in Chriſts Spirit in the word of Life, which became Man, which brake
or deſtroyed Death, wherein the divine Tincture ſprouted again, and
generated <hi>ſubstance</hi> out of it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>33. For all is generated and proceeded out of Gods deſiring: But if God
be a fire and alſo a Light, then
it is ſufficiently knowable to Us, out of <hi>what</hi> every thing is proceeded.</p>
                  <p>34. Yet we cannot by any means ſay otherwiſe, then that out of the
Good and richly amiable; <hi>Good</hi> is proceeded.</p>
                  <p>35. For, a Good-deſiring will, conceiveth in its<note n="†" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>Imagination,</hi> its
<hi>like;</hi> it maketh that, through the hunger of its deſiring like it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>36. Thus it is knowable to us, that being the Deity hath<note n="*" place="margin">Or longed.</note> pleaſed
to have a Looking-Glaſs, an Image of its like; that the divine long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Pleaſure or <hi>Placet,</hi> would alſo in its impregnating, have the <hi>Good</hi>
and Moſt lovely, to be generated in its deſirous will, a right ſimilitude,
according to the Good, according to the clear bright Deity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:61375:69"/>
37. But that the Earthly hath intermixed it ſelfe therewith; that is
the fault of the <hi>deſirous</hi> Anger, viz: of the fire; the fault of the Devil
who with his Imagination kindled it.</p>
                  <p>38. Thus alſo it is highly knowable to us, That God<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>would not</hi>
forſake his own, his very <hi>beſt</hi> and lovelieſt of all, which he Created to
his likeneſs, into a Creaturely ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>39. He <hi>rather</hi> became himſelfe, ſuch a one as he had Created, that
he might generate or bring forth the periſhed or corrupted out of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
or Corruption again, and put or <hi>change</hi> it into the Beſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he might Eternally dwell.</p>
                  <p>40. And we ſay with good ground, that God himſelf dwelleth <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtingly</hi>
in the New Man, not through a Glimps or a ſtrange Glance
or appearance, but ſubſtantially, yet in his own Principle.</p>
                  <p>41. The <hi>outward</hi> Man, toucheth or apprehendeth him not.</p>
                  <p>42. Alſo, the fleſh and Blood of the New-Man,<note n="*" place="margin"> Note. Note.</note> 
                     <hi>is not God.</hi>
It is heavenly Subſtantiality; God is Spirit; God doth not periſh or
Corrupt, though plainly the Subſtance periſheth or Corrupteth: thus
God remaineth in himſelf.</p>
                  <p>43. He needeth no going away, for he <hi>uſeth</hi> alſo no going or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
in.</p>
                  <p>44. But he manifeſteth himſelf in Fleſh and Bloud; it is his <hi>long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pleaſure,</hi> to poſſeſs a ſimilitude.</p>
                  <p>45. And thus if we rightly know our ſelves, and go according to it;
we then find, that, Man, underſtand the <hi>whole Man,</hi> is a right
ſimilitude of or according to God.</p>
                  <p>46. For, according to the Earthly life and Body, he is of from <hi>this
world;</hi> &amp; according to the virgin-like Life and Body he is from <hi>heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>47. For, the virgin-like Eſſence, hath <hi>heavenly</hi> Tincture, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
heavenly Fleſh, <hi>in which God dwelleth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>48. As, the Gold in the Stone hath another <hi>Tincture</hi> then the rude

                  <p>52. Firſt, that the new Regenerate Man; which lyeth <hi>hidden</hi> in the
Old, as the Gold in the Stone: hath a heavenly Tincture, and hath
divine heavenly fleſh and Bloud <hi>on it,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>53. And that the Spirit of that Fleſh, is no ſtrange Spirit but its
<hi>own,</hi> generated out of its own Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>54. Secondly: And then we alſo clearly know and ſay; that the
Word which in <hi>Mary</hi> became Man, is the firſt Ground to the beginning
<hi>Tincture</hi> in the <hi>Sulphur:</hi> and plainly know, that Chriſts Spirit which
filleth heaven in All places, <hi>dwelleth</hi> in that very Tincture.</p>
                  <p>55. Thirdly, we manifeſtly know, that <hi>this</hi> heavenly Fleſh is Chriſts
Fleſh, in which the Holy Trinity dwelleth <hi>undivided.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>56. Fourthly; we apparently know, that it is poſſible, that, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fleſh and Blood in the <hi>Time</hi> of the Old Adam, can through Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
become <hi>periſhed</hi> or Corrupted again, as came to paſs in Adam.</p>
                  <p>57. Fifthly; we ſay, that the <hi>Deity</hi> in the periſhing or Corrupting,
doth not depart or go away, alſo is touched with <hi>No</hi> Evil.</p>
                  <p>58. For, that which looſeth the Love of God; that falleth home to
the Anger: what falleth out from the Light, that catcheth the fire: and
the Spirit of God remaineth <hi>to it ſelfe</hi> unperiſhed or uncorrupt.</p>
                  <p>59. Sixtly; That, the <hi>poſſibility</hi> to the New-Birth, is, in all
Men, <hi>elſe</hi> God were divided, and not in one place as he is in
another.</p>
                  <p>60. And herein we exactly know, that, Man, is <hi>drawn,</hi> by the Fire
and the Light; to which he inclineth with the Beam of the Balance,
into that he falleth; and yet he may in his life time,
<hi>raiſe up</hi> the Tongue of his Angle or Beam, aloft again.</p>
                  <p>61. Alſo, that the Holy clear <hi>Deity,</hi> willeth no Evil; it alſo willeth
no Devil, it hath deſired none, much leſs to have any man be in Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Anger of God.</p>
                  <p>62. But ſeeing there is no Light without fire; therefore it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
knowable to Us, how the Devil hath through <hi>Imagination ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi>
or reflected himſelf on the Anger-fire, as alſo all men that will become
Damned; they will <hi>not</hi> ſuffer themſelves to be remedyed, but themſelves
fulfil the Greedy fire-ſource or quality; they ſuffer themſelves to be drawn,
and <hi>yet can</hi> well ſtand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:61375:70"/>
63. Seventhly, we ſay; That the true Temple, wherein the
Holy Ghoſt preacheth, is in <hi>the New-Birth;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>64. That all is Dead Crooked and Lame, which teacheth not out
of <hi>Gods</hi> Spirit.</p>
                  <p>65. That the Holy Spirit mixeth not it ſelfe in the ſound of the
Mouth of the wicked: That <hi>no wicked Man</hi> is Chriſts ſhepheard.</p>
                  <p>66. For, although, in the Holy, or Saints, the Clock cometh to be
ſtruck with or by the voyce of the wicked; it would indeed be done by
the <hi>Cry</hi> of a Beaſt, if its noiſe were intelligible, and did ſound the
moſt precious Name of God.</p>
                  <p>67. For as ſoon as the Name of God is mentioned, and giveth a
ſound, then inſtantly the other ſound catcheth it, viz: in that place
wherein it is ſounded, as, <hi>in the holy Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>68. But no wicked awakeneth, or raiſeth up another wicked, out of
Death; for, that <hi>cannot be;</hi> they are both in the Anger of God, and
lie yet ſhut up in Death.</p>
                  <p>69. Had we our ſelves <hi>been able</hi> to have riſen up out of Death, then
had Gods heart not <hi>needed</hi> to have become Man.</p>
                  <p>70. Therefore we ſay with Certain Ground:<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> That onely <hi>that</hi> very
word, which there is become Man, awakeneth or raiſeth up the
poor ſinner out of his Death; and generateth him to <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>to
a new life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>71. Therefore all Preachers or Cryers, that are wicked
or <hi>ungodly,</hi> are not profitable in the Temple of Chriſt; but thoſe that
have Chriſts ſpirit,<note n="†" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>they are</hi> his ſhepheards.</p>
                  <p>72. We clearly know and ſay, That all Teachers which give out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for Chriſts ſervants and Church-Miniſters, and that for their <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>
and <hi>honour</hi> ſake, and <hi>yet</hi> are Unregenerate; are the Antichriſt and
the Woman in the Revelation of <hi>John,</hi> upon the Dragon.</p>
                  <p>73. We ſay; That all Tyranny and ſelfe uſurped power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
wherewith the miſerable are ſqueezed, <hi>Oppreſſed,</hi> drunk up, <hi>vexed</hi> and
tormented, is that abominable Horrible Cruel Beaſt, upon
which Antichriſt Rideth.</p>
                  <p>74. We know and ſay; that the Time is near; and the Day Dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
or breaketh, wherein<note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 19. 20. Note.</note>

himſelf Chriſts Miniſter, Paſtor, or ſhepheard, <hi>invited</hi> for a Gueſt:
and all the high-Schools or Vniverſities of this World; with their
diſputations and <hi>Lawes;</hi> as alſo all the Children of Chriſt; who
bear Chriſt Croſs: <hi>They</hi> ſhall <hi>all</hi> ſee the true Ground.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Not</hi> with this meaning, to contemn any in his Ignorance, but
for the true Teaching and Inſtruction, that every one might ſeek and

                        <p>7. For it will be a very Earneſt matter, and concerneth Man, it
<hi>coſteth</hi> body and Soul.</p>
                        <p>8. He ought not at all to flight it; for he that hath this knowledge

                        </p>
                        <p>9. There will be a Great Two-fold King Come, out of <hi>Two</hi> Gates:
he is but one Onely, and yet two; he hath<note n="*" place="margin">Puniſhment and Grace.</note> Fire and Light; he draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in both, on Earth and alſo in Heaven, let this be a <hi>Wonder</hi> to
thee.</p>
                        <p>10. Dear Children of Chriſt, when we conſider of Death, how we
muſt go through Death into Life, then we find altogether <hi>another kind</hi>
of Life; which cometh out of Death.</p>
                        <p>11. And we find <hi>Inſtantly,</hi> why Chriſt muſt have dyed; and why
we muſt alſo dye in Chriſts Death, riſe again in him; and with him,
and <hi>through</hi> him, enter into Gods Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>12. If now we would find this, we muſt then conſider the Eternity
in the Ground and Abyſs, <hi>elſe</hi> there is no finding of it: we muſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
find it where it is.</p>
                        <p>13. For, out of the Eternal Ground have we, with the Image of
God, our original, viz: with the <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>its</hi> Image.</p>
                        <p>14. But are become introduced into the Temporary and <hi>Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
viz: into the ſource or <hi>quality</hi> thereof.</p>
                        <p>15. But now the Eternity, viz: the Abyſs, is a
Liberty without ſource or<note n="*" place="margin">Extra. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>

and therefore we muſt go again into the Liberty through <hi>dying.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>16. Yet we cannot ſay, that there is no Life therein; it is the right
Life, which there ſubſiſteth <hi>Eternally</hi> without ſource or quality.</p>
                        <p>17. And we give you it in a True reall ſimilitude to meditate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of: which indeed is a <hi>ſimilitude</hi> according to the Kingdom of this
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61375:73"/>
world; but if we<note n="*" place="margin">Or apply in our Mind and Thoughts.</note> take the divine world to it, or along with it; then
it is the <hi>Subſtance</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>18. You know that our Life conſiſteth in <hi>Fire,</hi> for without warmth
we live not.</p>
                        <p>19. Now, the Fire hath its own Center, its own Maker in its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
or Circumference and Extent, viz: the <hi>ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ven</hi> Forms or Spirits of
Nature.</p>
                        <p>20. And yet onely the Firſt <hi>four</hi> Forms are acknowledged and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
to be Nature, viz: the ſpringing ſource or quality, wherein the
fire becometh awakened and ſtruck up, that there be a Principle and
lifes Circle or Center there, wherein the<note n="†" place="margin">See the 12. Queſtion of the Soul, verſe 19. 20. &amp; 22.</note> 
                           <hi>Matter</hi> of the burning, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it ſelfe, in the Spirits or formes, and is alſo Continually <hi>conſumed</hi>
in the Fire.</p>
                        <p>21. And the Fire giveth forth out of the<note n="*" place="margin">Conſumptibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> Conſumingneſs, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that is <hi>better,</hi> then the Firſt, which maketh the Fire.</p>
                        <p>22. For, the Fire killeth or mortifieth and devoureth the ſubſtance
which the fire it ſelfe Maketh, underſtand the <hi>Eſſential Fire,</hi>
in the
forms to Fire: it confumeth that, and giveth out of the Death, a much
<hi>Nobler</hi> and better, which it cannot Conſume.</p>
                        <p>23. And that is demonſtrated to you in fire and Light; which is
not onely the true ſimilitude, but it is the <hi>ſubstance</hi> it ſelfe; onely a
Man is to diſtinguiſh the Principles; It is indeed all a Fire; but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth
it ſelfe according to the ſource or <hi>Quality.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>24. If we will preſent this to be underſtood; it is neceſſary, that
we mention the fires <hi>Originall:</hi> but being we have elſewhere, viz:
in the Book of the Three Principles, and in other beſides, deſcribed it
at large, with all Circumſtances: therefore here we will ſet down a
<hi>brief</hi> deſcription, and direct the Reader to the other writings, if he
would throughly ſearch out the <hi>Seaven</hi> forms of Nature.</p>
                        <p>25. The Fire hath Eſpecially <hi>Three</hi> forms in it to the Center; and the
<hi>Fourth</hi> form is the fire it ſelfe, and giveth the Principle, viz: the Life,
together with the Spirit; for in the firſt Three Forms there is no right
Spirit, they are onely Eſſences.</p>
                        <p>26. Viz: <hi>Firſt,</hi> the <hi>Harſh</hi> Aſtringency, that is the deſirous Will;
that is the firſt and Chiefeſt Form.</p>
                        <p>27. <hi>Secondly,</hi> And the <hi>Bitter</hi> ſtinging, that is the ſecond Form, a
Cauſe of the Eſſences.</p>
                        <p>28. <hi>Thirdly:</hi> After that, the Anguiſh, viz: the Circle or Center of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61375:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Life: the turning wheele, which catcheth or apprehendeth the ſenſes
or <hi>Thoughts,</hi> viz: the bitter Eſſences, in it ſelfe, and ſwalloweth them
up as it were into Death; and giveth forth out of the Anxious Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
viz: out of Death, the <hi>Minde,</hi> viz: another Center.</p>
                        <p>29. Now underſtand this thus;<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> In the Eternity, viz: in the <hi>Abyſs</hi>
without or beyond Nature, is Nothing but a ſtilneſs without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;

or any thing in <hi>poſſibility</hi> there.</p>
                        <p>30. That Abyſs is <hi>like</hi> an <hi>Eye:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">AVge.</note> AVge, for it is its own Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Glaſs;

                           <hi>Magia,</hi> and it hath
a will, after which we ſhould not dive or ſearch, for it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
us.</p>
                        <p>32. With or by this very will, we underſtand, the <hi>Ground</hi> of the
Deity, which is of No Original, for it apprehendeth it ſelfe in it ſelfe;
concerning which we are juſtly <hi>Mute</hi> or ſilent; for it is without or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Nature.</p>
                        <p>33. And being we are in Nature, <hi>we know it not</hi>

                           <hi>in Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
for, in the Will, the Deity it ſelfe, is All; and the Eternal Originall
of its own Spirit, and of All and every ſubſtance.</p>

                        <p>38. And the <hi>Deſiring</hi> is a drawing in, and yet there is Nothing,
that can there be drawn, but the will draweth it ſelf in the deſiring it
ſelf, and modelleth it in its deſiring, for <hi>what it is.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>39.<note n="†" place="margin">Note the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of the Eternal wil into ſubſtance.</note> That very <hi>Model</hi> is the Looking-Glaſs,

wherein the will ſeeth what it is for it is a <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of or according to
the willing.</p>
                        <p>40. And we know <hi>that</hi> very Looking-Glaſs, wherein the will ſeeth
or beholdeth it ſelfe; <hi>to be the</hi> Eternall wiſdome
of God.</p>
                        <p>41. For, it is an Eternal <hi>Virgin</hi> without Subſtance, and yet is the
Looking-Glaſs of all ſubſtances, in which all things have been <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen</hi>
from Eternity whatſoever there ſhould or <hi>could</hi> be.</p>
                        <p>42. But now alſo, this Looking-Glaſs, is not the ſeeing it ſelfe: but
the will, which is deſirous; that is the outgoing longing pleaſure of the
will, which goeth forth out of the <hi>will,</hi> and that is a Spirit, and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,</hi>
in the longing pleaſure of the deſiring, the Looking-Glaſs.</p>
                        <p>43. The Spirit is the Life, the Looking-Glaſs is the Manifeſtation or
<hi>Revelation</hi> of the Life; elſe the Spirit would not know it
ſelfe: for the Looking-Glaſs, viz: the wiſdome, is its ground and
reteiner or <hi>preſerver.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>44. It is the <hi>Invention,</hi> or that which is found by the Spirit, where
the Spirit findeth it ſelf in the Wiſdom.</p>
                        <p>45. The wiſdome without the Spirit, is <hi>no ſubſtance;</hi> and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

                        </p>
                        <p>46. Thus the wiſdome, viz: the Looking-Glaſs of the Spirit of the

                     <p>1. As then we underſtand, that the Eternal beginning in the Abyſs,
is an <hi>Eternal will</hi> in it ſelfe; whoſe <hi>Originall</hi> in it ſelfe,

                     <p>3. For, a will is thin or <hi>Obſcure,</hi> as it were <hi>Nothing:</hi> therefore it is

                     <p>5. Wherein the will, in the Looking-Glaſs of Wiſdome, diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

7. The Looking-Glaſs remaineth Eternally a <hi>Virgin,</hi> without ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating;
but the will becometh impregnated with the <hi>Glimps</hi> of the
Looking-Glaſs.</p>
                     <p>8. For the <hi>will</hi> is Father, and the Impregnation in the Father, viz:
in the will, is <hi>Heart,</hi> or Sonne; for it is the wills, viz: the Fathers
Ground, wherein the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the willing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> in the Ground,
and out of the willing in the ground goeth forth into the Virgin-like
wiſdome.</p>
                     <p>9. Thus, the willings Imagination, viz: the Fathers: attracteth the
Looking-Glaſſes Aviſion, or aſpect form or <hi>repreſentation,</hi> viz: the
<hi>Wonder</hi> of the Power Colours and virtue, into it ſelf, and ſo
becometh impregnated with the Glance of the wiſdome with the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and virtue: This is the wills, viz: the Fathers Heart, wherein
the <hi>Abyſſal</hi> will attaineth a ground in it ſelfe, through and in the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Imagination.</p>
                     <p>10. Thus we know the Fathers impregnating to be the <hi>Center</hi> of the
Spirit of the Eternity, wherein the Eternal Spirit continually <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth</hi>
it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>11. For, the will is the beginning; and the moving or drawing in
into the Imagination, viz: to the <hi>Looking-Glaſs</hi> of wiſdome, is the
Eternal abyſſal Spirit, which ariſeth in the willing, and apprehendeth it
ſelfe in the <hi>Center</hi> of the Heart, in the power of the intracted wiſdom,
and is the Hearts <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. Now then being the Eternal Abyſſal will in it ſelfe, is as it were
<hi>inanimats</hi> mute or ſilent, therefore that which is apprehended or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
our of the wiſdome, which is called Heart or <hi>Center</hi> is the word
of the willing; for it is the <hi>ſound</hi> or the power, and is the willings
<hi>Mouth,</hi> which manifeſteth the willing.</p>
                     <p>13. For, the will, viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Father, <hi>Speaketh</hi> with the moving of the
Spirit, the power, forth, in the Looking-Glaſs of the wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>14. And with the ſpeaking forth, the Spirit goeth, out from the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
out of the Word of the <hi>Mouth</hi> of God, viz: out of the Center
of the Heart, forth, into that which is out-ſpoken, viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-like</hi>
Looking-Glaſs; and openeth the word of life in the Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſs
of wiſdome, ſo that the Threefold ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Deity in the wiſdome <hi>becometh</hi> Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</p>
                     <p>15. Thus we acknowledge an Eternal abyſſal divine Subſtance, and
therein <hi>Three Perſons,</hi> whereas one is not the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:61375:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
16. Viz: the Eternall will, which is the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of all and every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
that is the <hi>Firſt</hi> Perſon; yet, is not the ſubſtance it ſelfe; but
the Cauſe of Subſtance, and is <hi>free</hi> from Subſtance, for it is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſs.</p>
                     <p>17. There is nothing before it, that can give it, but it <hi>giveth it ſelfe,</hi>
of which we have <hi>no</hi> knowledg.</p>
                     <p>18. It is <hi>All,</hi> and yet alſo <hi>thus</hi> but ONE onely, in it ſelfe without
ſubſtance, a Nothing.</p>
                     <p>19. And in this One onely willing, ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>20. And in the Deſiring, the willing impregnateth it ſelfe out of
the Eye, <hi>AVge,</hi> of wiſdome; which with the <hi>willing</hi> is in like or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
Eternity, without ground and beginning, as is mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
                     <p>21. That very Impregnation is the Ground of the willing, and of
the ſubſtance of all Subſtances, and is the <hi>Sonne</hi> of the willing.</p>
                     <p>22. For, the will generateth this Sonne from Eternity in Eternity
<hi>perpetually,</hi> for it is its<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> Heart or its <hi>word,</hi> viz: a ſound or <hi>revelation</hi>
or Manifeſtation of the Abyſs of the ſtill Eternity, and is the willings
* <hi>Mouth</hi> or underſtanding; and is juſtly called <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
Perſon, then the Father: for it is the Fathers revelation or
Manifeſtation, his Ground and Subſtance.</p>
                     <p>23. For a Will is no ſubſtance, but the willings Imagination ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<hi>Substance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>24. Thus, the <hi>ſecond</hi> Perſon is the ſubſtance of the Deity; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand;
the ſubſtance of the Holy Trinity; the Mouth of the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or <hi>Revelation</hi> of the ſubſtance of all Subſtances, and the power
of the Life of all and every Life.</p>
                     <p>25. The <hi>Third</hi> Perſon, is the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which with the apprehenſion
of the Willing through the Imagination, out of the power of, the
ſpeaking, goeth forth out of the Mouth of the Father, into the <hi>Eye,
AVge,</hi> viz: into the <hi>Looking Glaſs</hi> of wiſdome, that is clearly free
from the willing and alſo from the Word.</p>
                     <p>26. And although, indeed the will out of the Word giveth it, yet
it is <hi>free</hi> as the Aire is free from the Fire: as Men ſee, that the Air is the
Fires ſpirit and Life, and yet is another thing then the Fire, and yet is
<hi>given forth</hi> alſo from the Fire.</p>
                     <p>27. And as Men ſee, that the Air giveth forth a living and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Heaven, which is luſtrous and <hi>moveable:</hi> ſo alſo is the Holy
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61375:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Spirit, the Spirit and Life of the Deity; and another Perſon, then the
Father and Sonne.</p>
                     <p>28. It beareth alſo another Office; it <hi>openeth</hi> the wiſdome of God,
ſo that the Wonders <hi>Appeare:</hi>
as the Aire openeth all the Life of this World, that all Live and

                     <p>29. Thus, this is a ſhort explanation of the Deity in the <hi>Abyſs;</hi>
how God dwelleth in himſelfe, and is himſelfe the <hi>Center</hi> of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrix.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>30. But now the humane Mind reſteth not ſatisfied with this; it
asketh or inquireth after <hi>Nature,</hi> after that out of which this world is

                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>11. For, that which is drawn in, is the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> of the free willing,

in it ſelf without the Imagination, it would be a Nothing.</p>

Contrary or <hi>oppoſite</hi> willing: for, the deſiring is drawing in, and the
firſt will is <hi>quiet</hi> or ſtill, and in it ſelf, without ſubſtance.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>17. Underſtand this further thus. The firſt will, viz: God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that is and remaineth Eternally <hi>free</hi> from the Anxious ſource or
quality; as to what the willing in it ſelfe, is; but <hi>its</hi> deſiring becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
impregnated, and in the deſiring, ariſeth <hi>Nature,</hi> with the Forms,
and Nature dwelleth in the Will, viz: <hi>in God,</hi> and the will in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>19. And yet there is no Mingling; for the will is ſo very <hi>thinne</hi> as
it were Nothing, and <hi>therefore</hi> it is not apprehenſible, it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by Nature; elſe if it might be Comprehended there would in
the Deity, be BUT, ONE Perſon.</p>
                     <p>20. It is indeed the <hi>cauſe</hi> of Nature, but yet it is, and remaineth in
Eternity, <hi>another</hi> World; and Nature, remaineth alſo <hi>another</hi> world
in it ſelf; for it ſtandeth in the power of the Eſſence, out of which the
Principle ariſeth.</p>
                     <p>21. For, the Clear <hi>bright</hi> Deity in the Majeſty, ſtandeth not in the
Eſſence or in the Principle, but in the Liberty without or beyond Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>22. But the ſhining Light without or beyond the Principle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
the <hi>Incomprehenſible</hi> or Abyſſal Deity manifeſt; it giveth the
ſhining or Luſtre of the Majeſty; and yet hath it not <hi>in it ſelfe,</hi> but
it comprehendeth or conceiveth it out of the Looking-Glaſs of the
virgin-like wiſdome, out of the Liberty of God.</p>
                     <p>23. For, if the Looking-Glaſs of Wiſdome, were <hi>not,</hi> then could
no Fire or Light be generated; it all taketh its Original, from the
<hi>Looking-Glaſs</hi> of the Deity: that is now to be underſtood, in this
manner following.</p>
                     <p>24. God, is in himſelfe, the Abyſs, viz: the firſt World, of which
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61375:78"/>
                        <hi>no</hi> Creature knoweth any thing at all;<note n="*" place="margin">Viz: the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> for it ſtandeth ſolely and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
with Spirit and Body in the <hi>Byſs</hi> or Ground.</p>
                     <p>25. Thus alſo God himſelfe in the Abyſs, would not be manifeſt to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>imſelfe; but his <hi>wiſdome</hi> is from Eternity <hi>become</hi> his Ground or
Byſs.</p>
                     <p>26. After which therefore the Eternal willing of the Abyſs of the
Deity hath <hi>pleaſed</hi> to Long, from whence the <hi>divine Imagination</hi> hath
exiſted, ſo that the Abyſſal will of the Deity, hath thus from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
in the Imagination, with the power of the <hi>Aviſion</hi> or Aſpect,
or form of the Looking-Glaſs of Wonders, impregnated it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>27. Now, in this Impregnation of the Eternal Original, are <hi>two</hi>
Principles to be underſtood, viz: <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Eternal Darkneſs, out of
which the Eternal world Originateth it ſelfe, and the Subſtantiality of
the fierce wrath in the Darkneſs, wherein we underſtand Gods <hi>anger</hi> and
the Abyſs of Nature: and thus we know and
acknowledge the fiery world to be the <hi>Great</hi> Life.</p>
                     <p>28. And then alſo <hi>Secondly</hi> we underſtand, <hi>Firſt,</hi> how out of the Fire,
the <hi>Light</hi> becometh generated. And <hi>Secondly;</hi> how, between the fiery
and light World Death is.</p>
                     <p>29. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How the Light ſhineth out of <hi>Death:</hi> and <hi>Fourthly:</hi>
How the Light-flaming World, is <hi>another</hi> principle ſource or quality
in it ſelfe, then the fire-world: and yet neither is ſeperated from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>neither can</hi> the one comprehend the other.</p>
                     <p>30. <hi>Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>thly,</hi> we underſtand; How the Light-world <hi>filleth</hi> the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Liberty. viz: the firſt willing, which is called Father.</p>
                     <p>31. <hi>Sixthly;</hi> Thus we underſtand alſo, herein Earneſtly and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally:
how, that <hi>Natural</hi> life, which will dwell in the Light fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
world, <hi>muſt</hi> go through death, and muſt become generated or
born forth out of <hi>Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>32. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Yet we underſtand or mean; that Life which <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally</hi>
ariſeth out of the Darkneſs, viz: out of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the dark
ſubſtantiality; as viz: the ſoul of <hi>Man;</hi> which had out of the fire-world
turned it ſelfe into the Dark ſubſtantiality in Adam: <hi>Eighthly;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
then we fundamentally and Exactly underſtand; wherefore God,
viz: the Heart of God, is become Man.</p>
                     <p>33. And <hi>Ninthly;</hi> wherefore he muſt of neceſſity dye, and enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Death, and break his Life in Death, and afterward bring it through
the fiery world into the Light-flaming World: And <hi>Tenthly,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt thus follow him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="133" facs="tcp:61375:78"/>
34. And <hi>Eleventhly;</hi> we underſtand further, wherefore many ſouls
remain and Continue in the fire-world, and cannot go through Death
into the light-world. <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> what Death is. <hi>Thirteenthly</hi> alſo,
what the Soul is. This is now as followeth.</p>
                     <p>35. When we conſider what the life is; we find that it ſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
in <hi>Three</hi> parts, viz: <hi>firſt,</hi> in the Deſiring; <hi>Secondly</hi> in
the Mind; <hi>Thirdly</hi> in the ſenſes or thoughts.</p>
                     <p>36. Now if we ſearch further, what that is which giveth or affordeth
that; then we find; the <hi>Center,</hi> viz: the Eſſential Wheel, which hath
the<note n="*" place="margin">Or Vulcanus.</note> Fire-Smith in it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>37. And then if we conſider further, whence that Eſſential Fire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſteth;
we find, that it taketh its original in the <hi>Deſiring</hi> of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>abyſſal</hi> willing, which, with the deſiring maketh to it ſelfe a
Ground.</p>
                     <p>38. For, every deſiring is attractive, or <hi>harſh</hi> and aſtringent, of
that which the will deſireth;<note n="*" place="margin">Or before it.</note> and yet there is nothing for it, that it
may deſire, but onely it ſelfe; that is the Great <hi>Wonder-Eye,
Wunder-AVge,</hi> without limit and ground; wherein all
lyeth.</p>
                     <p>39. And yet alſo is a Nothing, unleſs it become in the deſiring
will, made a <hi>ſomewhat,</hi> which is done by <hi>Imagination;</hi> wherein it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
a ſubſtance, whereas yet it is a Nothing, for it is onely an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowing
of the <hi>Free-willing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>40. Which Subſtance, over-ſhadoweth the Liberty, viz: the
Thinne unſearchable willing, ſo that <hi>two</hi> worlds come to be: <hi>firſt:</hi>
One which in it ſelfe is incomprehenſible and unconceivable, an abyſs
and Eternal Liberty; and <hi>Secondly,</hi> one which comprehendeth, and
maketh it ſelfe a Darkneſs.</p>
                     <p>41. And yet neither is <hi>ſundred</hi> from the other, onely this is the
difference or diſtinction, that<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 1. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>the Darkneſs cannot comprehend the
Liberty;</hi> for<note n="†" place="margin">The Liberty.</note> it is too Thinne, and dwelleth alſo in it ſelf, as alſo the
Darkneſs dwelleth in it ſelf.</p>
                     <div type="section">

                        <head>The very Earneſt Gate.</head>
                        <p>42. Here now we underſtand. <hi>First,</hi> how the Fathers Second Will,
which, in the Looking-Glaſs of wiſdome he ſharpeneth to his <hi>hearts
Center,</hi> becometh impregnated with the ſubſtantiality in the Father
<hi>Imagination.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>43. And <hi>Secondly</hi> that, the ſame impregnation in reſpect of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the firſt will, which is called Father, is a Darkneſs: and
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> How in the Darkneſs or ſubſtantiality, all powers, Colours
and Virtues lie in the Imagination; moreover all <hi>Wonders.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>44. And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> we underſtand; How the powers, wonders and
virtues, <hi>muſt</hi> be manifeſted through the <hi>Fire,</hi> viz: in the Principle
wherein all paſſeth into its Eſſence: for in the principle the Eſſence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
ariſeth.</p>
                        <p>45. And <hi>fifthly;</hi> we underſtand very Earneſtly and exactly; that,
in the Principle, ere, the fire ariſeth, there is a <hi>dying,</hi> viz: the great
anguiſh life.</p>
                        <p>46. Which yet is <hi>no</hi> dying, but a harſh aſtringent, ſtern dying ſource
or quality, out of which the great and ſtrong Life ariſeth, viz: the fire-life;
And <hi>ſixthly,</hi> then out of the deadned, the ſight-Life, with the
power of the Love.</p>
                        <p>47. Which <hi>Light-life</hi> with the Love dwelleth in the Eternal Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
viz: in the firſt willing, which is called Father; for, that, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in his own willing, which is himſelfe, <hi>deſireth;</hi> and nothing
more.</p>
                        <p>48. That now underſtand thus: ye ſee and know that there is no
Light without Fire; and there is no Fire, without the Earneſt ſource
or quality, which ſource or quality is <hi>like a Dying;</hi> and the Sabſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
out of which the Fire burneth muſt thus alſo dye and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.</p>
                        <p>49. Out of the Conſuming conſiſteth two Principles, of two great
Lives; <hi>One</hi> in the ſource or quality which is called Fire, and one out
of the vanquiſhedneſs, viz: out of the <hi>Death,</hi> which is called Light,
which is <hi>Immaterial</hi> and without ſource or Quality, and yet hath all
ſources or qualities in it, but not the ſource of the fierce wrath.</p>
                        <p>50. For, the fierce wrath is <hi>remained</hi> in Death, and the Light-life
groweth out of the Dying, as a fair bloſſome out of the Earth, and is
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61375:79"/>
                           <hi>no more,</hi> apprehended by the Dying.</p>
                        <p>51. As then ye ſee, how the Light dwelleth in the Fire, and the
fire cannot move it, and beſides that there is alſo nothing that can
move the Light; for it is <hi>like</hi> the Eternall Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and dwelleth in the Liberty.</p>
                        <p>52. Here ye underſtand, how the Sonne is <hi>another</hi> Perſon then the
Father; for he is the Light-world; and yet dwelleth in the Father; and
the Father generateth him in his <hi>willing;</hi> and he is rightly the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Love, alſo<note n="†" place="margin">Iſai. 9. 6.</note> 
                           <hi>wonder Council and Power.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>53. For, the Father generateth him in his Imagination in himſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and bringeth him through his own fire, viz: through the Principle, forth
<hi>through</hi> Death, ſo that the Sonne maketh and is <hi>another</hi> World, viz:
another Principle in the Father: then the fire-world in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
is.</p>
                        <p>54. Thus you underſtand alſo, How the Fathers Eternal Spirit, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
it ſelfe into <hi>Three Worlds.</hi> The <hi>Firſt</hi> is the Exit out of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of the firſt willing of the Abyſs, Which is called Father; in
which, with the outgoing it openeth the <hi>wiſdome:</hi> and dwelleth in
the wiſdome, and weareth it upon it ſelfe, as its Garment of the Great
<hi>wonders.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>55. <hi>Secondly:</hi> it is the Cauſe to the indrawing to the Subſtantiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the darkneſe, viz: to the other world, and is the Cauſe, and the
Spirit to the <hi>Originall</hi> of the Eſſential Fire: it is it ſelfe the ſource or
quality, in the Anguiſh of the Principle, and alſo of the fiery world,
viz: of the Great Life.</p>
                        <p>56. And then <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is it ſelfe alſo, that which the power in the
dying of the principle, <hi>bringeth forth</hi> out of the Fire, wherein the
power, out of the anguiſh, out of the dying, ſevereth it ſelfe from the
Dying, goeth into the <hi>Liberty,</hi> dwelleth in the Liberty, and maketh
the Light-world, and ſo it is the flame of the Love in the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>world.</p>
                        <p>57. <hi>Here in this place ariſeth the deare</hi>
                           <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 28. 19.</note> Name of
God, of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the Holy Spirit.</p>
                        <p>58. For, in the Fire-world,<note n="†" place="margin">Viz: the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit of the Father.</note> 
                           <hi>it</hi> is <hi>not</hi> called the Holy Spirit or
God, but Gods Anger, Gods fierce wrath; wherein as to this,
God calleth himſelf <hi>a Conſuming fire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="136" facs="tcp:61375:80"/>
59. But in the Light-world, viz: in the Sonne of God, it is the
Flame of Love, and the power of the <hi>Holy divine</hi> Life; wherein it
is called God the Holy Spirit.</p>
                        <p>60. And the Light-world, is called the Wonder, Council,
and Power, of the <hi>Deity,</hi> which the Holy Spirit openeth, for it is the
Life therein.</p>
                        <p>61. And is all, together, as farre as our Heart and Mind or Thought
can reach: Nothing, but onely <hi>theſe Three worlds;</hi> it ALL ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
therein.</p>
                        <p>62. Viz: <hi>Firſt,</hi> there is the Eternal Liberty, and therein the light,
with the power in the Looking-Glaſs of wiſdome, <hi>which is called</hi> God
the Father Sonne and Holy Spirit.</p>
                        <p>63. <hi>Secondly,</hi> there is the dark ſubſtantiality, in the <hi>Imagination,</hi>
in the harſh aſtringent deſirous willing; the Impregnation of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring,
wherein all ſtandeth in the Darkneſs, viz: in the anxious
death.</p>
                        <p>64. <hi>Thirdly:</hi> There is the fiery world, viz: the firſt Principle,
which ſtandeth in the Anguiſh, viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Great ſtrong Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Life, wherein the <hi>Light-world</hi> dwelleth; but runapprehended
by the Fire.</p>

                     <head>The Fourth Chapter. Of the Principle, and of the Originall of the
Fire-World; and of the Center of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
alſo how the Light ſevereth it ſelfe
from the Fire: ſo that, from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in Eternity, two Worlds are one
in another.</head>
                     <p>1. WEe will not write mutely or not to be underſtood, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively
with good Evidence: We perceive and know,
that every Life doth originate it ſelfe out of the <hi>Anguiſh,</hi> as
in a venome or poyſon, which is a dying, and yet is alſo the life it
ſelfe; As it is plainly to be <hi>perceived</hi> in Men and all Creatures.</p>
                     <p>2. For, <hi>without</hi> the Anguiſh or poyſon, there is no Life, as is very
well to be ſeen in all Creatures, Eſpecially in Man, which exiſteth in
Three Principles.</p>
                     <p>3 As <hi>Firſt.</hi> One in the Fire, wherein the Great Life ſtandeth, to
which a dying Poyſon viz: the <hi>Gall,</hi> belongeth, which Poyſon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the Anguiſh-Chamber, wherein the Fire-life originally ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>
                     <p>4 And <hi>Secondly:</hi> out of the fire-life, the ſecond Principle, viz:
the Light-life, out of which the Noble <hi>Minde</hi> with the Senſes or
<hi>thoughts</hi> Exiſteth, wherein we bear and underſtand our Noble Image:
for, the fire-life in the Heart, originally ariſeth from the <hi>Death</hi> of the
<note n="*" place="margin">The Gall is the Dying, ſource or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note>Gall.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Thirdly:</hi> We underſtand the Third Principle in the other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh-Chamber,
viz: in the Maw or <hi>Stomack</hi> or Entrails; whereinto
we ſtuffe the four Elements with the conſtellation or <hi>Aſtrum,</hi> where
then the other Anguiſh-Chamber, viz: the third Center, is; viz: the
Kingdom of this World; a <hi>ſtinck</hi> and Evil ſource or qualities, houſe;
wherein the third Life, viz: the ſtarry and Elementary life becometh
generated; and through the <hi>outward Body,</hi> governeth, with the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the third Principle.</p>

                        <pb n="138" facs="tcp:61375:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
6. Now, we underſtand very well; that, in the Heart, viz: in the
Center, there ſtandeth <hi>another</hi> world hidden, which is incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to the ſtarry and Elementary ſource or qualities <hi>houſe;</hi> for the
Heart ſigheth or <hi>panteth</hi> after that World.</p>
                     <p>7. And the Spirit which becometh generated out of the Death of
the Hearts Poyſon, <hi>poſſeſſeth</hi> that other world; for, it is free from the
Poyſon, which kindleth the Fire, and yet dwelleth in the Fire of the
Heart.</p>
                     <p>8. But<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                        <hi>with its Imagination,</hi> it conceiveth
or comprehendeth the other world of the Libertty, in the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and dwelleth in the Liberty, without of beyond the fire-ſource or
quality, but that onely <hi>ſo farre</hi> as it brings or bears a longing pleaſure,
to or into God.</p>
                     <p>9. Now then ſeeing there is ſuch a Threefold dominion <hi>in</hi> Man,
ſure it is much more ſo <hi>without</hi> or beyond Man, for if that were not
it could not poſſibly <hi>have come</hi> into Man; for where there is nothing,
there alſo Nothing comes to be: but if ſomewhat cometh to be, it
cometh out of that which is there; Every Imagination modelleth

                     </p>

is a meer wonder.</p>
                     <p>11. Therefore now we are to think upon <hi>theſe</hi> wonders; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
the kind and property of the Eternal <hi>Genetrix;</hi> for there can be
no property unleſs it have a mother that giveth or affordeth it.</p>
                     <p>12. Therefore we underſtand now, <hi>firſt,</hi> in <hi>this</hi> Great wonder of all
wonders, which is God and the Eternity, together with Nature: Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>ſeaven Mothers,</hi> out of which the ſubſtance of all Subſtances, ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
ariſeth; and yet they are all ſeaven but <hi>one</hi> onely ſubſtance,
none of them is the firſt or the Laſt, they are all <hi>ſeaven</hi> alike Eternal
without beginning; their beginning is the Opening of the Wonders
of the ONE onely Eternal willing, which is called God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>13. And then <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>Seaven</hi> Wonders could not be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
or revealed, if the ONE onely Eternal will, which is called Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
were not deſirous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:61375:81"/>
14. But if it be deſirous, then it is an Imagining in
it ſelfe, and is a longing <hi>pleaſure</hi> to find it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>15. And it findeth it ſelfe alſo in the Imagination, it findeth Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially<note n="†" place="margin">Seaven.</note> Three forms in it ſelfe. whereof None is the other, and alſo
none is <hi>without</hi> the other, but every one generateth the other: and if
the one were not, the other would not be; but the will remaineth an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Nothing without ſubſtance, alſo without ſhining or <hi>Lustre.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>16. So now if the will be deſirous, therefore it is in-drawing, of
that which is in the <hi>Imagination;</hi> wherein <hi>yet</hi> there is nothing; and ſo
it draweth it ſelfe, and impregnateth it ſelfe in the Imagination, and not
in the willing, for the will is as Thinne as Nothing.</p>
                     <p>17. But now, every <hi>deſiring,</hi> is harſh or aſtringent; for it is its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty:
and that is the firſt Mother.</p>
                     <p>18. And the willings indrawing in the deſiring, is the other or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Mother;</hi> for theſe are two forms which are contrary or oppoſite one
to the other; for, the will is quiet or <hi>Still</hi> as a Nothing: and it is
harſh or aſtringent, like a ſtill death; and the Indrawing is its ſtirring
or <hi>rouſing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>19. And, that, the ſtill will in the harſh aſtringency <hi>cannot</hi> endure,
and thereupon draweth much more vehemently in it ſelfe, and yet doth
but onely ſharpen its own willing, in the drawing, and, will with its
ſtern <hi>indrawing,</hi> ſhut in and retain, the Indrawing; and in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
doth but onely <hi>awaken</hi> or raiſe it up.</p>
                     <p>20. The harder the harſh aſtringency gripeth together to hold the
ſting, the greater onely is the ſting, the raging and the breaking: for the
ſting will not <hi>ſuffer</hi> it ſelfe to be tamed, and yet is ſo ſtrongly held by
its Mother that it cannot get away.</p>
                     <p>21. It will be above, and the Mother beneath; for the harſh aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
draweth into it ſelfe, and maketh it ſelfe <hi>Hard;</hi> and ſhe is a
ſincking down-wards, and maketh in the <hi>Sulphur</hi> the <hi>Phur,</hi> and in
the <hi>Mercurius</hi> the <hi>Sul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>22. And the ſting, maketh, in the <hi>Sal, Phur,</hi> or maketh to it ſelfe
further, the bitter form, viz: the <hi>woe,</hi> an Enmity in the Aſtringent
Harſhneſe, and willeth continually to rend forth out of the Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency,
but yet <hi>cannot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>23. Thus one climeth upwards, and the other tendeth downwards,
and ſo if it cannot, it becometh <hi>winding</hi> as a<note n="*" place="margin">Rota. Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum Eterna Natura, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum Omnium.</note> wheele, and wheeleth it
ſelfe continually inwards into it ſelfe; and this now, is the <hi>Third</hi>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:61375:82"/>
Form, from whence the Eſſence Originally
ariſeth, and the Wonder of <hi>Multiplicity</hi> without Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and Ground.</p>
                     <p>24. In this wheel, underſtand, the Wonder or power, which the
Will, underſtand, the firſt abyſſal will out of the Looking-Glaſs of
the Abyſs <hi>draweth</hi> into it ſelfe to its Center or Heart; that, is here the
will of the power and Wonder.</p>
                     <p>25. In this wheel of the great Anguiſh: originally ariſeth the other or
ſecond will, viz; the Sonnes will, to <hi>go forth</hi> out of the anguiſh into
the ſtill Liberty of the firſt Abyſſal willing.</p>
                     <p>26. For the wheel maketh Nature; for ſo Nature originally ariſeth;
it is the Center and the <hi>breaking</hi> of the ſtill Eternity, that killeth the
Nothing, but it maketh the great <hi>Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>27. But that we ſpeak of <hi>killing,</hi> it is to be underſtood in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
it is <hi>no</hi> killing, but it is the pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ceptibility.</p>
                     <p>28. For the Life, before the fire, is Mute or ſilent or inanimate, and
without feeling: it is only a <hi>hunger</hi> after the Life; as the Material world
is onely a hunger after the Life; and in its hunger ſo very eagerly or
ſtrongly laboureth, towards the Principle; that it may <hi>reach</hi> the fire:
wherein then the Life of this World, originally ariſeth.</p>
                     <p>29. And it cannot be otherwiſe; unleſs it break the firſt <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,</hi>
viz: the harſh aſtringent deſiring; this is the wheel of the firſt
<hi>Three</hi> Forms, viz: harſh aſtringency; and the drawing of the harſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringency
maketh the Anguiſh, and ſource-ſubſtance or quality-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                     <p>30. For, it is a <hi>terrifying</hi> in it ſelfe, in that it ſhould be ſo, that the
Nothing ſhould come into perceptibility; for, that is
the Poyſon-ſource or quality; whence the <hi>fierce wrath</hi> and <hi>all Evill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
malignity or Malice, originally ariſeth, and yet is the right original of
the perceptible life.</p>
                     <p>31. The Life findeth it ſelfe thus, viz: in the Anguiſh ſource or
quality; as we ſee it in all Creatures, that the Life taketh its original
in the <hi>ſtifled</hi> bloud, in the Anguiſh; both the Creaturely Life, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the <hi>Eſſential</hi> Life; as in ſtincking Dung in the rottenneſs; where,
in the<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 36.</note> 
                        <hi>dying of the Corn</hi> or Grain the Great Life Springeth up.</p>
                     <p>32. Whereas yet in the <hi>Eſſence,</hi> no dying is underſtood: but an
anguiſhing ſource or quality, wherein the Mother muſt ſpring forth:
which is a Mute or ſilent or inanimate ſubſtantiality: as is to be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61375:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
perceived in Corne, where the Eſſential Life <hi>groweth</hi> out of the
Corruption.</p>
                     <p>33. In like manner, it is held with the Center of Nature; the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh-ſource
or quality is the <hi>right</hi> Center, and maketh the<note n="*" place="margin">fire</note> 
                        <hi>Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle</hi>
in Nature.</p>
                     <p>34. And the fire-flaſh, viz: the fourth form of Nature, maketh, of
the Triangle, a<note n="†" place="margin">cross</note> 
                        <hi>Croſs;</hi> for there is the Principle and becometh ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
into <hi>two</hi> worlds, of two Principles, viz: into a <hi>two</hi> fold ſource or
<hi>quality</hi> and Life: One ſource abideth or remaineth, and is the
fire or anguiſh-life; the other or ſecond ſource exiſteth in the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Corrupting of the Anguiſh: which underſtand as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                     <p>35. The <hi>firſt</hi> form of the Subſtantiality, viz: the harſh aſtringen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in the <hi>deſirous</hi> unconceivable or unpalpable willing, muſt give it
ſelf wholly up to the anguiſh ſource or quality in the wheel of Nature,
for the ſting is <hi>two</hi> ſtrong; thus the harſh aſtringency ſincketh down
as a Death, and yet is no death, but a <hi>dying</hi> ſource or <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>36. For the ſting becometh Lord, and changeth the harſh aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
into its property, viz: into a raging flaſh, into an anguiſh ſource
or quality, which from the ſting and the harſh aſtringency, is <hi>bitter;</hi> as
is the kind and Manner of <hi>Poyſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>37. For, the Poyſon or the dying, hath eſpecially <hi>Three</hi> forms, viz:
harſh aſtringency, bitterneſs, and Anguiſh: it maketh it ſelfe thus in
it ſelf; and hath <hi>no Maker,</hi> but onely the ſtrong will in the Great life
in the fire.</p>
                     <p>38. Underſtand us aright thus: The <hi>Abyſs</hi> hath no Life; but in
ſuch a property the Great Eternal Life becometh generated, the Abyſs
hath no mobility or <hi>feeling.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>39. Thus the Mobility or feeling generateth it ſelf; and thus the
<hi>Nothing</hi> findeth it ſelfe in the Eternal <hi>willing;</hi> whoſe<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> ground we
know not, alſo ſhould not ſearch, for it troubleth or diſturbeth
us.</p>
                     <p>40. And yet this is onely an Eſſential Life without underſtanding,
like the <hi>Earth;</hi> and the Death or <hi>dying,</hi> wherein really there is a ſource
or quality in it ſelfe, but in the <hi>darkneſs</hi> without underſtanding; for
the harſh aſtringent anguiſh draweth into it ſelfe, and that which is
indrawn maketh darkneſs, ſo that the Anguiſh Life <hi>standeth</hi> in the
Darkneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="142" facs="tcp:61375:83"/>
41. For every ſubſtance is, in it ſelfe, dark, unleſs it have the Lights
<hi>Tincture</hi> in it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>42. For, thus the <hi>Tincture</hi> is a Liberty or freedom, from the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and is <hi>not</hi> comprehended by the anguiſh ſource or quality: for
it is in the Light-world; and though indeed it <hi>ſticketh</hi> in the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,
viz: in a dark Body; yet is out of the ſubſtance of the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>world;
where <hi>no</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Begriffe.</note> Comprehenſion is.</p>
                     <p>43. We have mentioned above, <hi>Firſt,</hi> concerning the Looking-Glaſs
of the wiſdome, of the <hi>wonder</hi> of All ſubſtances: and <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
Concerning the <hi>Ternary</hi> or Number Three of the Subſtance of All
Subſtances; how they Originally ariſe out of one onely willing,
which is called the Father of all Subſtances.</p>
                     <p>44. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> how it createth another will in it ſelfe; to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
or find it ſelfe in it ſelfe; or as a Man may ſay, to find <hi>what</hi> and
<hi>how</hi> is is.</p>
                     <p>45. And then <hi>Fourthly;</hi> How that Second re-Created Magick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
to <hi>finde</hi> it ſelf, is its heart and own ſeat of poſſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>46. And <hi>Fifthly:</hi> How the firſt abyſtal will, impregnateth, it ſelfe
with the Imagination it ſelf, <hi>out</hi> of the Looking-Glaſs of the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which in the <hi>Light world</hi> is called the Wiſdome.</p>
                     <p>47. And then <hi>Sixtly:</hi> as we have mentioned; How that firſt ayſſal
will, together with the Impregnation; and alſo the Looking-Glaſs of
the wonder or <hi>wiſdome,</hi> in ſuch a property, before the Principle of
Fire; is <hi>no</hi> divine ſubſtance, rightly called: but much rather a <hi>Myſtery</hi>
of the wonder of all ſubſtances.</p>
                     <p>48. Which Myſtery, taketh its <hi>partition,</hi> in the Fire, into <hi>infinite</hi>
Endleſſe Parts or ſubſtances, and yet remaineth alſo but ONE ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                     <p>49. Thus we give you now further to underſtand concerning the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or <hi>ſecond</hi> will; which, the firſt will in its Imagination or impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
Createth; which is the Great Myſtery, <hi>Mysterium Magnum,</hi>
wherein the firſt will which is called Father, ſeeketh, <hi>findeth</hi> and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it ſelf, as a light in the Heart: How that very other or ſecond will,
is the<note n="*" place="margin">Note. Note.</note> Mother of the <hi>Genetrix,</hi> in the indrawn or in the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                     <p>50. It is that which <hi>cauſeth</hi> originally the Seaven formes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and it is alſo that which cauſeth the Anguiſh wheel, viz: the

taketh the Glance of the Majeſty into it ſelfe, and in the Light of the
Majeſty dwelleth in the <hi>fire,</hi> unapprehended by the Fire, as one that

bringeth another ſovrce or quality into it ſelfe, which <hi>feel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

findeth the firſt from which it hath dyed away.</p>
                     <p>51. And that we may briefly and yet fundamentally and properly or
<hi>Exactly,</hi> diſtinguiſh the fires <hi>Originall;</hi> know, that we perceive, in
the Deep opened to us out of Gods Grace; that the fire in its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
ſtandeth in <hi>two</hi> Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>52. The <hi>firſt</hi> cauſe is the willing-ſpirit of the Heart, underſtand,
the Fathers <hi>Second</hi> will, viz: the Sonnes property.</p>
                     <p>53. And, the <hi>Second</hi> Cauſe, is the Willings<note n="†" place="margin">Materia.</note> Matter,
viz: of the wonders of the Wheel, of the Eſſential Life, viz: the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
Chamber.</p>
                     <p>54. The anguiſh ſigheth or<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 8. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>groaneth</hi> after the willing of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and the will longeth or <hi>groaneth</hi> after the Manifeſtation or
Revelation; for, the willing cannot in the ſtill liberty in it ſelfe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
or reveal it ſelfe, <hi>without</hi> the Eſſential fire, which in the anguiſh,
viz: in the dying cometh to the Manifeſtation or Revelation, and to the
Great Life.</p>
                     <p>55. Thus, the will is in the dark anguiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Anguiſh is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
<hi>darkneſs</hi> it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>56. Now then, being the anguiſh thus vehemently<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                        <hi>groaneth</hi> or
panteth <hi>after the</hi> willing of the <hi>Liberty:</hi> ſo it conceiveth or receiveth
the willing of the Liberty as a flaſh, as a great Crack as when a Man
powreth water into the Fire</p>
                     <p>57. And here the right dying is Effected: for the very fierce wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
dark <hi>anguiſh,</hi> ſcreecketh or trembleth before the flaſh, viz: the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
before the Light; for the darkneſs is Killed and vanquiſhed, and
the terrour or Crack is a Crack of great <hi>Joy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>58. There the harſh aſtringent fierce wrathful Poyſon ſincketh down
into Death, and becometh <hi>impotent</hi> or weak, for it looſeth the ſting,
and yet is no Death, but thus the right life of the feeling and <hi>panting,</hi>
becometh kindled.</p>
                     <p>59. For this is, juſt as if a Man did ſtrike<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                        <hi>Steel</hi> and a <hi>Stone</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
for they are two Great hungers, of the willing after the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,
and of the ſubſtantiality after the Life.</p>
                     <p>60. The will giveth or or affordeth Life; and the ſubſtantiality gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
or affordeth the Manifeſtation or <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Life: as fire
burneth out of a <hi>Candle,</hi> ſo burneth the will not of the Eſſential ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality.</p>

61.<note n="*" place="margin">Note. Fire is the Principle. The white fire, is the divine Love fire.</note> The will is not the Light it ſelf, but the Spirit of the Light

again out of the willing.</p>
                     <p>62. The anxious Eſſential Fire, is the <hi>Matter</hi> to the ſhining Fire:

                     <p>67. For here death is broken or deſtroyed, and yet remaineth a Death
<hi>in it ſelf;</hi> but the willing-Spirit, viz: the right holy Life,
goeth with the breaking open forth out of the anguiſh.</p>
                     <p>68. And is now alſo a fire; but a <hi>fire</hi> in the Liberty: and burneth
in the Love-ſource or quality; as a Man may ſee this in Fire and Light,
how the Eſſential fire is a burning woe or <hi>pain,</hi> and the Light an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
richly Joyful <hi>delight</hi> and habitation, without ſenſible pain, ſource,
or quality.</p>
                     <p>69. And yet hath all ſources or qualities and properties of fire in it;
yet in another Eſſence, viz: a <hi>friendly</hi> munificent wel-doing Eſſence; a
right Glimps of the rich Kingdome of Joy: and the fire
a Glimps of terrour, and of Anguiſh; and yet one dwelleth in the

                     <p>74. For which cauſe, the will of the Love out of the light world,
is again entered into the Material <hi>Subſtantiality</hi> in the humanity, and
hath again eſpouſed or united it ſelf to the Eſſential fire-ſpirit in Man,

                     <head>The Fifth Chapter. Of the Principle, in it ſelf; what
it is.</head>
                     <p>1. WE ought further to conſider the firſt <hi>four</hi> Forms of Nature; and
<hi>ſo</hi> we ſhall find, what a Principle is.</p>
                     <p>2. For that is properly a Principle, when a thing <hi>becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi>
what it <hi>never</hi> was before; where out of Nothing a ſource or
<hi>quality</hi> cometh to be; and out of the ſource or
quality, a right life with <hi>underſtanding</hi> and ſenſes or thoughts.</p>
                     <p>3. And yet we know the right Principle to be in the <hi>fires</hi> Original,
in the fire-ſource or quality, which breaketh the ſubſtantiality and alſo
the darkneſs.</p>
                     <p>4. Thus we acknowledge and underſtand, <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Eſſence and
<hi>property</hi> of the Fire for a Principle; for it maketh and giveth the
Original, of Life; and of all mobility, alſo the ſtrong might of the
fierce wrath.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Secondly:</hi> We underſtand and acknowledge that alſo for a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.
<hi>Firſt,</hi> which can dwell in the fire, unapprehended by the fire: <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
which can take away the might of the fire: And <hi>thirdly,</hi> can
change the fires quality or ſource into a Meek love. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> which is
omnipotent over all. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> which hath the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> to
break the Root of the fire; And out of the fire <hi>to make</hi> darkneſs, and a
dry hunger and thirſt, without finding any caſe or refreſhment as the
Helliſh quality or ſource is.</p>
                     <p>6. This is the <hi>Abyſs</hi> wherein the ſubſtance is<note n="*" place="margin">Choaked or made faint with thirſt and hunger.</note> ſpoiled; where death
domineereth with its ſting, as a ſpoiled or faintened Poyſon.</p>
                     <p>7. Wherein really there is an Eſſential Life, but it <hi>hateth</hi> and is
at enmity with it ſelf, where the right fires kindling is not attained; but
onely appears as a <hi>flaſh</hi> without blazing.</p>
                     <p>8. And thus we give you to underſtand, that in the <hi>Eternal</hi> there
are no more but two Principles, viz: one is the burning or blazing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61375:85"/>
fire, which becometh <hi>filled</hi> with the Light; the Light giveth it its
property; ſo that out of the burning ſource or quality, an <hi>high</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Joy cometh to be.</p>
                     <p>9. For the Anguiſh attaineth the Liberty, and ſo the burning fire
continueth onely to be a <hi>cauſe</hi> of finding the
Life and the Light of the Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>10. The fire, taketh into it ſelf, the Lights property, viz: the <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
and the light taketh into it ſelfe the fires property: viz: the Life,
and to find it ſelf; and the ſecond Principle is underſtood in the Light,
or to be the Light.</p>
                     <p>11. But the Eſſential ſubſtantiality, out of which the Fire burneth,
<hi>continueth</hi> Eternally a Darkneſs, and a ſource or quality of fierce
wrath; wherein the Devil dwelleth.</p>
                     <p>12. As ye ſee plainly, that the fire is another thing then <hi>that</hi> out of
which the fire burneth.</p>
                     <p>13. Thus the Principle conſiſteth in <hi>Fire,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> in the Eſſential
ſource or quality of the Subſtantiality.</p>
                     <p>14, The Eſſential ſource or quality, is the <hi>Center</hi> of Nature, the
cauſe of the Principle; but it is dark, and the fire ſhining.</p>
                     <p>15. And here is rightly ſhewn you: how, the <hi>breaking</hi> of the fierce
wrath, viz: of the Death: and the Eternal Liberty out of Nature,
both together; are the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the ſhining.</p>
                     <p>16. For, <hi>Therefore</hi> is the Wonder-ſpirit of the Abyſs, deſirous, viz:
that it might become ſhining; and <hi>therefore</hi> it bringeth it ſelf into
ſource or quality, that it may perceive and find it ſelf, and that it might
manifeſt or <hi>reveal</hi> its wonder in the ſource or quality, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſource or quality there can be no Manifeſtation or revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>17. Now underſtand us further, thus: The ſource or quality, viz:
the fierce wrath hath no right ſubſtantiality, but the harſh fierce wrath
is the ſubſtantiality of the <hi>sting,</hi> wherein it ſticketh or ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                     <p>11. And the Anguiſh, together alſo with the fire, are or <hi>make</hi> alſo
no right ſubſtantiality, but it is onely ſuch a Spirit; yet the one muſt
be <hi>thicker</hi> then the other, elſe there w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uld be no finding.</p>
                     <p>19. As, viz: the harſh aſtringency maketh thick and dark, and ſo
the bitter <hi>sting</hi> findeth the Anguiſh, in the harſh dark property; as in
<note n="*" place="margin">In einer M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria.</note>Matter; for if there were <hi>no</hi> Matter, there would be <hi>no</hi> ſpirit
or finding.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="148" facs="tcp:61375:86"/>
20. The Abyſs findeth it ſelfe in the
harſh aſtringent darkneſs, but it breaketh open the darkneſs, and goeth
forth out of the harſh darkneſs, as a <hi>ſpirit,</hi> which hath found it ſelfe in
the anguiſh-ſource or quality.</p>
                     <p>21. But it leaveth that <hi>hard</hi> Matter of the darkneſs, wherein
it found it ſelfe; and goeth in into it ſelfe, again into the Liberty,
viz, <hi>into</hi> the Abyſs, and dwelleth in it ſelf; thus muſt the ſource or
quality, be its <hi>ſharpneſs</hi> and finding; and is to it alſo a kindling
of its Liberty. viz: of the Light; wherein it <hi>ſeeth</hi> it ſelfe
what it is.</p>
                     <p>22. And thus now it deſireth no more for it ſelfe, but the ſource or
quality, but <hi>modelleth</hi> it ſelf, and ſeeketh or ſeeth it ſelf according to
all Forms.</p>
                     <p>23. And every form is deſirous to find and to manifeſt or <hi>reveal</hi> it
ſelfe; and thus alſo every form findeth it ſelfe in it ſelf, but yet goeth
with the deſiring out of it ſelf, and ſetteth it ſelf there repreſented as a
<hi>figure</hi> or Spirit; and that is the Eternal wiſdome, in the Colours
wonders and virtues, and yet is not particular but all totally <hi>univerſally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
yet in infinite forms.</p>
                     <p>24. Theſe forms, have with the moving of the firſt willing, which
is called Father, incorporated or <hi>corporiſed</hi> themſelves into Spirits,
viz: into Angels, that ſo the hidden ſubſtance might perceive, and
find and ſee it ſelf in Creatures, and that there might be an Eternal
ſport or <hi>Scene</hi> in the wonders of Gods wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>25. And thus we underſtand <hi>further,</hi> the ſubſtantiality of the Light-world,
which really is a right ſubſtantiality; for no right ſubſtance can
conſiſt in fire, but the <hi>Spirit onely</hi> of the Subſtance.</p>
                     <p>26. But the fire cauſeth the ſubſtance; for it is a hunger, an Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
deſiring, it muſt have ſubſtance or it <hi>extinguiſheth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>27. <hi>Vnderſtand this as followeth.</hi> The meekneſe giveth, and the
fire taketh: the <hi>Meekneſs</hi> is a going forth out of it ſelf, and giveth a
ſubſtance, of its likeneſs, every form out of it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>28. And the fire <hi>devoureth</hi> that, yet it giveth the Light out of it:
it giveth that which is <hi>more Noble</hi> then what it had devoured, it giveth
Spirit for ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>29. For it devoureth the Meek munificence or well doing, that is,
<note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 21. 6. and 22. 1. 17.</note>
                        <hi>the water of</hi> Eternal <hi>Life:</hi> but it giveth the ſpirit of Eternal Life;
As ye ſee, that the Wind goeth out of the fire, as alſo the Air, viz: the
right ſpirit out of the fire-life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:61375:86"/>
30. Thus underſtand our Minde aright: God the Father, is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
the Liberty without or beyond
Nature; but maketh himſelf manifeſt in <hi>Nature</hi> through the Fire, the
fiery Nature is his property.</p>
                     <p>31. But he is in himſelf the <hi>Abyſs,</hi> wherein there is no feeling of
any ſource quality or pain.</p>
                     <p>32. But yet bringeth his deſirous willing, into ſource or quality, and
Createth to himſelf in the ſource or quality, an other or ſecond willing
to <hi>go out</hi> of the ſource or quality again into the Liberty <hi>without</hi> or
beyond the ſource or quality.</p>
                     <p>33. That ſame ſecond will is his Sonne, which he generateth out of
his own <hi>Eternal</hi> willing from Eternity.</p>
                     <p>34. Which he bringeth through the breaking open of the ſource or
quality of Death, viz: through the Earneſt <hi>ſeverity</hi> of his fierce wrath,
forth, Through the fire.</p>
                     <p>35. That very ſecond will, viz: the <hi>Sonne,</hi> of God the Father; is, that
which breaketh or deſtroyeth Death, viz: the ſtern dark ſource or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
which <hi>kindleth</hi> the fire, and goeth forth through the Fire as a thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Luſtre or Glance of the fire, and filleth or <hi>ſatiateth</hi> the firſt willing,
which is called Father.</p>
                     <p>36. For, the Glance is alſo as a thinne as a Nothing or as the will
which is called Father, and therefore it can dwel in the Liberty, viz:
in the Fathers <hi>Willing,</hi> and maketh the Father, Light, clear, bright,
amiable, friendly, for it is the Fathers <hi>Herts oder Barmhertzig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kcit.
Heart</hi> or <hi>Mercifulneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>37. It is the Fathers <hi>ſubſtantiality,</hi> it filleth or ſatiateth the Father
in all places, though indeed there is no place in him, no beginning nor
End.</p>
                     <p>38. Underſtand us further, thus, The Fathers fire, <hi>devoureth</hi> the
Meek ſubſtance, viz: the water-ſource or quality of Eternal Life into
it ſelfe, into the fires owne Eſſence, and meekeneth it ſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
                     <p>39. There muſt the ſubſtantiality in the fire, <hi>as it were</hi> dye, for the
fire devoureth it into it ſelf, and <hi>Conſumeth</hi> it.</p>
                     <p>40.<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> And giveth forth out of the Conſumingneſs a <hi>living</hi> richly
Joyful ſpirit; and <hi>that</hi> is the Holy Spirit; which thus
goeth forth from the Father and the Sonne, into the Great Wonder of
the <hi>holy ſubstantiality,</hi> and openeth the ſame perpetually and Eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="150" facs="tcp:61375:87"/>
41. <hi>Thus</hi> the Deity is an Eternal Band, which cannot ceaſe
or paſs away; and thus it generateth it ſelf from Eternity and the firſt
is continually alſo the laſt, and the laſt again the firſt.</p>
                     <p>42. And thus underſtand the Father to be the <hi>fiery</hi> world; the Sonne,
the <hi>Light</hi> and power-world; and the holy ſpirit, to be the Life of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
viz: to be the outgoing driving Power; and yet all is but
ONE God.</p>
                     <p>43. As the <hi>Fire</hi> and the <hi>Light,</hi> together with the <hi>Aire,</hi> are but
one onely Subſtance; but yet divideth it ſelf into <hi>Three</hi> parts; and none
can ſubſiſt without the other; for, the fire, is not the Light, alſo not the
wind, which goeth forth out of the Fire.</p>
                     <p>44. Each hath its office, and Each hath its own <hi>Subſtance</hi> in it ſelf;

                     <p>50. Thus dear children of God in Chriſt, we <hi>give you</hi> our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and<note n="*" place="margin">Purpoſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal.</note> entent to ponder of. We mentioned in the beginning, that
we would ſhew you concerning the Death of Chriſt.

muſt dye alſo: and <hi>Thirdly,</hi> riſe again, in Chriſt.</p>

                        <pb n="151" facs="tcp:61375:87"/>
51. This you ſee now in this deſcription very clearly; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
our Great Miſery, that it hath been <hi>neceſſary</hi> for us, that the
word or Life of the Holy Light-world is become a Man and hath gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
us anew <hi>in himſelfe:</hi> whoſoever underſtandeth nothing here,
he is <hi>not</hi> generated or born of God.</p>
                     <p>52. Do but ſee into what <hi>Lodging</hi> Adam hath introduced us; He
was an extract of all the Three Principles, a <hi>total</hi> ſimilitude according
to all the Three-worlds, and had in his Mind and Spirit the Angelical
property in him.</p>
                     <p>53. He was introduced into the holy power and ſubſtantiality, viz:
into <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> that is, the divine ſubſtantiality, he ſhould have eaten of
divine ſubſtantiality, and have drunk the water of Eternal Life after an
<hi>Angelical</hi> Manner; as in the Book of the Threefold Life hath been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
at large.</p>
                     <p>54. But he loſt the <hi>divine</hi> ſubſtantiality, and the Angelical proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and <hi>Imagined</hi> into the out-birth, viz: into the Kingdom of the
Earthly ſource or quality, which the <hi>Devil</hi> had kindled in <hi>his</hi> Fall:
He turned his Eyes out from God into the Earthly<note n="*" place="margin">Or Ruler.</note> God, out from
the divine Light, into the light of this world.</p>
                     <p>55. Thus he became <hi>captivated,</hi> and remained in the Earthly
ſource or quality; and ſo he fell into the Earthly Corruptible ſource or
quality, which ruleth in him, and <hi>filleth</hi> him; it putteth a body on
to him, and breaketh or deſtroyeth it again: and ſwalloweth it up into
its own Eſſence, into its <hi>Eſſential</hi> Fire.</p>
                     <p>56. But being the ſoul was breathed in, out of the Spirit of God,
viz: out of the Eternal, <hi>into Man,</hi> ſo that the ſoul is an Angel, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
hath God aſſumed the ſame to himſelf again.</p>
                     <p>57. And the power of the holy Light-world, viz: the Heart of God
is <hi>entered</hi> into the humane Eſſence, which lay ſhut up in death, into
the anguiſh Chamber of <hi>our</hi> Miſery.</p>
                     <p>58. He hath gotten into himſelf a ſoul out of our Eſſence, he hath
taken our <hi>Mortal</hi> Life into himſelfe, and introduced the ſoul through
death, through the Earneſt ſevere fire of God the Father, into the
<hi>Light-world:</hi> hath broken or deſtroyed death which held us captive,
and unſhut the life.</p>
                     <p>59. Now it may not nor <hi>cannot</hi> be otherwiſe; w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oſoever will poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
the Light-world: muſt enter in through the <hi>ſame path,</hi> which he
hath made, he muſt enter into the death of Chriſt, and ſo in Chriſts
Reſurrection he entereth into the Light-world.</p>
                     <p>60. Even as we know, that the Eternal Word of the Father, which
is the Fathers heart; becometh <hi>generated</hi> from Eternity to Eternity,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61375:88"/>
out of the fierce wrath of the Death of Darkneſs,
<hi>through</hi> the Fathers Fire; and is in himſelf the right <hi>Center</hi> of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Trinity, and is out of himſelf, together with the outgone Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
the Light-flaming Majeſty or Light-world.</p>
                     <p>61. Thus alſo in like manner and property, muſt we with our Hearts,
Senſes or <hi>Thoughts</hi> and Minds, go forth out of the harſh aſtringent
ſtern and <hi>Evil</hi> or malignant Earthlineſs out of our ſelves, out of the
periſhed or corrupted Adamical Man, and with our earneſt ſevere wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and doing <hi>ſlay</hi> him.</p>
                     <p>62. We muſt take upon us the Old Adams <hi>Croſs,</hi> which hangeth

                     <p>63. But ſeeing we were <hi>not</hi> able to do this; therefore hath Chriſt
given himſelf into that ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ry Center of the fierce wrath, and <hi>broken</hi>
the fierce wrath, and extinguiſhed it with his Love.</p>
                     <p>64. For he brought heavenly divine ſubſtantiality into that very
fierce wrath into the Center of the <hi>Anguiſh</hi>-Chamber, and extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſouls anguiſh-fire, viz: the fierce wrath of the Father of the fiery
world in the ſoul: ſo that thus Now, we fall <hi>no more</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Or into the Boſome of wrath.</note> home to the
fierce wrath.</p>
                     <p>65. But when we give up our ſelves into the <hi>Death</hi> of Chriſt, and
go forth out of our ſelves, out of the <hi>Evil</hi> Earthly <hi>Adam;</hi> then we fall
in Chriſts death into the Path or way, which he hath made or prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for us, we fall into<note n="†" place="margin">Luke 16. 22. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>the Boſome of Abraham;</hi> that is into

                     <p>66. For, the Boſome of <hi>Abraham,</hi> is the<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> unſhut light world in the
death of Chriſt; it is the Paradiſe; wherein God Created us.</p>
                     <p>67. And now the Matter lyeth in this, <hi>Not</hi> that we be Lip-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
or Mouth-Chriſtians, and pourtray and repreſent Chriſts death
before us, and <hi>remain</hi> wicked in heart, ſpirit, and ſoul, but that we
very Earneſtly with Mind and Thoughts, with willing and doing, go
forth out of the evill <hi>Inclinations</hi> or Injections, and
ſtrive and fight againſt them.</p>
                     <p>68. And though they <hi>evidently</hi> cleave and hang to us; yet we muſt

we <hi>must</hi> do, that which we would not willingly do.</p>
                     <p>69. <hi>We</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 16. 24.</note> must deny our <hi>earthly Evil life it</hi> ſelf, <hi>and</hi> put on Chriſts

                     </p>
                     <p>70. Thus we become impregnated with the Kingdom of Heaven, and
enter thus into Chriſts death<note n="†" place="margin">Even while we are alive in this Body.</note> with the <hi>living</hi> Body, and receive the

ſuch things, or deſire to know them.</p>
                        <p>7. Hereby hath the fair Woman continued finely Covered: O how
hath <hi>Antichriſt</hi> been able to ſport and act its Scene under this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
                        <p>8. But it <hi>ſhall</hi> ſtand open, againſt the will of the Devil and of
Hell, for the time is born; the <hi>Day</hi> of the bringing again or <hi>Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
breaketh, that it may be found what Adam loſt.</p>
                        <p>9. The Scripture ſaith;<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 3. 19. &amp; 18. 27.</note> 
                           <hi>We are Duſt and Aſhes,</hi> that is very right:
we are duſt and Earth.</p>
                        <p>10. But now it may be asked. Whether God made man out of
Earth? <hi>That,</hi> Reaſon will maintain; and prove it out of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom
yet <hi>they</hi> underſtand not; neither doth the proof afford it, but afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
much more, that Man is a <hi>Limus,</hi> that is, an Extract out of all the
Three Principles.</p>
                        <p>11. If he <hi>is to be a</hi> ſimilitude of Gods ſubſtance, then he muſt
needs be proceeded out of Gods ſubſtance, for that which is not out of
the Eternal, that is <hi>not</hi> permanent.</p>
                        <p>12. All that which <hi>beginneth,</hi> belongeth to that out of which it
is gone forth; ſo that if it be proceeded forth <hi>barely</hi> out of the Earth;
then we are of the Earth, what then can blame us that we do ſo as the
<hi>Earths</hi> property driveth and willeth.</p>
                        <p>13. But if there be<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 2. 14. &amp; 7. 23.</note> 
                           <hi>a Law in us,</hi> that blameth, checketh or accuſeth
us, that we live Earthly; then that it <hi>ſelfe</hi> is not Earthly; but it is
out of or from that, <hi>to which</hi> it directeth and draweth us: viz: out of
the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ernal, whither it <hi>alſo</hi> draweth us: and<note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 2. 15.</note> 
                           <hi>our own Conſciences</hi>
blame or <hi>accuſe us</hi> before the Eternal, that we make and do that which
is againſt the Eternal.</p>
                        <p>14. But if we give our ſelves up to that which draweth us into the
Eternal, then muſt the other that draweth us into the Earthly <hi>break</hi> or
Corrupt, and enter into that into which it willeth, viz: into the <hi>Earth,</hi>
into which it draweth us, and that willing which we give up into the
Eternal, that the Eternal receiveth <hi>in.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>15. Being God hath Created man in a ſubſtance, to be therein <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally,</hi>
viz: in fleſh and Blood: therefore of neceſſity, to that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
which giveth it ſelfe up into the Eternal, muſt <hi>ſuch</hi> fleſh and
blood be put on; <hi>as it was,</hi> when God Created it in Paradiſe in the
Eternal.</p>
                        <p>16. <hi>Whereby</hi> then we clearly known, that God hath <hi>not</hi> created us
in ſuch fleſh and blood, as wee now beare upon us, but in ſuch
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61375:91"/>
fleſh and blood; as, to the willing in the New birth,
is put on.</p>
                        <p>17. Elſe it would inſtantly <hi>before</hi> the Fall have been Earthly and
Corruptible: what ſhould my Conſcience blame or <hi>accuſe</hi> me for that,
wherein God had Created me? Or what ſhould it deſire other then
what it <hi>was</hi> in its own ſubſtance?</p>
                        <p>18. Thus we neceſſarily find it clear, that there is yet <hi>another</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in our fleſh, which groaneth, ſigheth and panteth after that, which
yet <hi>now,</hi> is <hi>not.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>19. Being then that it ſigheth and panteth after that which ye <hi>now</hi> is
not, therefore it muſt needs have been ſo in the <hi>beginning</hi> of its being
and ſubſtance, elſe there would be no ſighing or longing in it after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing.</p>
                        <p>20 For, we know, that Every ſubſtance ſigheth after that, out of
which it had its <hi>first Original;</hi> and ſo our will ſigheth after ſuch a fleſh
as God Created, which may ſubſiſt in God, not after an earthly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory
one, in ſource and quality, but after a <hi>permanent</hi> one without
ſource or quality.</p>
                        <p>21. Whereby we clearly underſtand, that we are gone forth out of
the Eternal into the Corruptible, that we have <hi>attracted</hi> or contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Matter to the<note n="*" place="margin">The Limus is not of all the Three Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> 
                           <hi>Limus,</hi> and are become Earth, where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s yet
God had extracted us out thereof as a <hi>Maſs,</hi> and introduced his Spirit
thereinto with the Eternal.</p>
                        <p>22. For, Adams Imagination, hath drawn the Earthly ſource or
quality of the Stars and Four Elements into the <hi>Limus,</hi> and the
Stars and Elements have drawn in the longing Malady of the Earth;
and thus the heavenly Matter,
of the heavenly Fleſh, <hi>became</hi> Earthly.</p>
                        <p>23. For, the Spirit of God, which was breathed in from the Word
<hi>Fiat</hi> into the <hi>Limus,</hi> out of Gods Heart, which had heavenly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality,
heauenly fleſh and blood on it, that ſhould rule Adam ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the heavenly <hi>divine</hi> property.</p>
                        <p>24. But being the Devil, when he ſat in Heaven had infected the
<hi>Limus,</hi> ſo, now he did to it alſo, this wickedneſs, and <hi>infected</hi> it with
his Imagination, ſo that it began to <hi>Imagine</hi> or long after the periſhed
Malady or ſeeking of the Earthly ſource or Quality, whence he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
captivated by the Kingdom of this periſhed world, which drew in,
into the <hi>Limus</hi> as a Lord.</p>
                        <p>25. And Now the Image of God <hi>became</hi> periſhed, and fell into the
Earthly ſource or quality.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="160" facs="tcp:61375:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
26. But being the heavenly Spirit was in the periſhed Earthly<note n="*" place="margin">The Sulphur and Limus are near of the ſame portent.</note> 
                           <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi>
the heavenly glance of the divine Fire, could not <hi>ſo</hi> ſubſiſt in the
burning; for the Eternal fires Light ſubſiſteth in the <hi>Liberty,</hi> without
or beyond the ſource or quality.</p>
                        <p>27. But being the water of the Liberty,
which was the food of the Eternal fire, <hi>became</hi> Earthly, that is, filled
with Earthlineſs, and that the Meek love became <hi>infected</hi> with the
Earthly evil Longing and Malady.</p>
                        <p>28. <hi>Therefore</hi> could not the Eternal fire burn, alſo give no Light;
but it<note n="†" place="margin">Flowed or qualified <hi>Quall.</hi>
                           </note> Glowed thus in the Earthly fleſh, as a <hi>damped</hi> fire, that cannot
burn for mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>29. That very fire<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> Gnaweth us now,
it alwaies blameth or accuſeth us, and would fain burn, and receive
heavenly Subſtantiality, therefore it <hi>must</hi> devour and ſwallow up the
earthly ſource or quality into it ſelfe, viz: the Earthly Imagination,
wherein the Devils longing Malady, mixeth it ſlfe.</p>
                        <p>30. Thus, it alſo <hi>becometh</hi> Evil, and draweth us Continually to
the Abyſs, into the <hi>Center</hi> of Nature, into the Anguiſh-Chamber, <hi>out
of which</hi> it went forth in the Beginning.</p>
                        <p>31. Thus thou ſeeſt O Man what thou <hi>art;</hi> and whatſoever thou
further makeſt out of thy ſelfe; that thou <hi>wilt be</hi> in Eternity; and
thou ſeeſt wherefore thou muſt break <hi>Corrupt</hi> and dye; for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of<note n="*" place="margin">1. Joh. 2. 16. 17.</note> 
                           <hi>this world paſſeth away.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>32. Yet thou art <hi>not</hi> in thy outward ſubſtance, ſo potent to continue
in that Kingdom, even to its Eternity: but thou art impotent or
weak <hi>therein,</hi> and lyeſt meerly therein, in a Conſtellation or <hi>Astrum,</hi>
which hath the Configuration or Courſe; wherein thou in fleſh and
blood or the Earthly ſubſtance in the Mothers body or <hi>Wombe</hi>
art flown forth.</p>
                        <p>33. Thou art ſo impotent or weak in the outward life, that thou
<hi>canst not</hi> prevent thy Conſtellation or <hi>Aſtrum,</hi> thou muſt go into the
Corruption or breaking of thy Body, when the Conſtellation leaveth
thee.</p>
                        <p>34 And there thou ſeeſt undeniably what<note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 3. 19.</note> 
                           <hi>thou art,</hi> viz: <hi>Duſt</hi> of the
Earth: Earth full of ſtincking rottenneſs, even while thou liveſt; a
dead Carcaſs, <hi>while</hi> thou <hi>yet</hi> liveſt.</p>
                        <p>35. Thou liveſt to the<note n="*" place="margin">Aſpects.</note> Configuration and Elements, they rule and
drive thee according to their property: they give thee <hi>employment</hi> and
Art: and when their <hi>Seculum,</hi> time or ſeaſon or period, is run about,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61375:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that thy Conſtellation, under which thou wert <hi>Conceived</hi> and born
to this world, is finiſhed, then they let thee fall away.</p>
                        <p>36. And then thy <hi>body</hi> falleth home to the four Elements, and
thy <hi>ſpirit</hi> which leadeth thee, to the Myſtery; out of which the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum</hi>
or Configuration became generated, and wilt be here <hi>reſerved</hi> to
the Judgement of God, where God will prove and try all through the
fire of his Might.</p>
                        <p>37. Thus thou muſt Moulder away and become Earth, and a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
all but the <hi>ſpirit</hi> which is proceeded out of the Eternal, which
God introduced into the <hi>Limus:</hi> therein conſider what thou art, even
a handful of Earth, and a ſource or quality-houſe or tormentive
<hi>Workhouſe</hi> of the Stars and Elements.</p>
                        <p>38. Wilt thou not have thy ſoule
or Eternal Spirit which is given thee from the Eternal higheſt <hi>Good;</hi>
here in this time, kindled again in the Light of God, ſo that it becometh
born again in the Light, out of the divine ſubſtantiality;
<hi>then</hi> it falleth in the Myſtery to the <hi>Center</hi> of Nature, viz: home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to the firſt Mother, into the Anguiſh Chamber of of the firſt four
forms of Nature.</p>
                        <p>39. There it <hi>muſt be</hi> a Spirit in the dark anguiſh ſource or quality,
with all Devils, and devour that which it hath in this world intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into it ſelfe; <hi>that</hi> will be its food and life.</p>
                        <p>40. But being God would <hi>not</hi> have it thus with man his ſimilitude
and Image, <hi>therefore</hi> he himſelfe is become that, which poor Man was
come to be, after that he was fallen out of the divine ſubſtantiality out
of Paradiſe: that he might <hi>help</hi> him again, ſo that Man hath in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

                        <p>42. Which went forth out of the ſouls fire, and that the Adamical
fleſh might <hi>draw back</hi> the ungodly willing, ſo that the poor ſoul might
not be filled again with the Earthly and devilliſh Longing Malady.</p>

                        <p>43. This is now to be underſtood thus, God is become Man and hath
introduced our humane ſoul into the divine ſubſtantiality again in
Chriſt: <hi>that</hi> eateth <hi>again</hi> of the divine ſubſtantiality, viz: of the love
and meekneſs, and drinketh of the water-ſpirit of Eternal Life, out
of the Eternal wiſdome, which is the <hi>fountaine</hi> of divine ſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                        <p>44. That ſame ſoul of Chriſt, hath gotten divine heavenly fleſh
and Bloud on it, together with the word which is the Center of the
Light-world, which therein Imagineth or longeth after the poor Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Souls, <hi>that very Word</hi> dwelleth in the divine ſubſtantiality, and in
the virgin of Wiſdom.</p>
                        <p>45. But<note n="*" place="margin">Note. John 1. 14.</note> 
                           <hi>came</hi> into <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>took</hi> our own <hi>Fleſh</hi> and Bloud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the divine ſubſtantiality, and brake and deſtroyed the power which
held us captive in the anger of Death and of the fierce wrath, on the
<hi>Croſs,</hi> viz: in the <hi>Center</hi> of Nature of the Original in the Fathers
Eternal willing to Nature, out of which our ſoul was taken.</p>
                        <p>46. And <hi>kindled</hi> in that ſame Eſſence, viz: in the ſouls dark fire,
the burning Light fire, again, and brought the other or ſecond willing
of the ſoul <hi>through</hi> the fire of God, viz: quite forth out of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
into the burning white clear <hi>bright</hi> Light.</p>
                        <p>47. And when Nature <hi>in the ſoul</hi> found this, it became richly full
of Joy, it brake Death in pieces, and ſprouted with Gods power forth
into the Light world, and made out of the fire a <hi>Love-deſire,</hi> ſo that in
Eternity no fire more is perceived or known, but a great and ſtrong
will in the Love, after its ſprouts and branches, viz: after our ſouls.</p>
                        <p>48. And this is that which we ſay: God <hi>thirsteth</hi> after our ſouls:

                        <p>54. When the Soul taſteth that, <hi>then</hi> it breaketh through the dark
Death in it ſelf, and kindleth the Fire of Eternity in it ſelfe, out of
which the <hi>ſhining</hi> Light of the Meekneſs burneth.</p>
                        <p>55. That ſame very Meekneſs, draweth the Soul again into it ſelfe,
viz: the <hi>ſouls Fire,</hi> and ſwalloweth the ſame up into it ſelfe, and giveth
forth out of the Death the Life and Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>56. Thus that ſame Spirit, which goeth forth out of the Eternal fire,
<hi>dwelleth</hi> in the Light world with God, and is the right <hi>Image</hi> of the
Holy Trinity.</p>
                        <p>57.<note n="*" place="margin">According to the right Image our converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> It dwelleth not in this world, the body apprehendeth it not;
but the Noble <hi>Minde,</hi> wherein the ſoul is a Fire, that apprehendeth it,
yet not palpably.</p>
                        <p>58. Indeed the Noble Image, dwelleth in the ſouls fire of the Minde;
but it <hi>hovereth</hi> therein, as the light in the Fire.</p>
                        <p>59. For, while the <hi>Earthly</hi> Man liveth; the ſoul is continually in
hazard or Danger; for the Devil hath Enmity with<note n="†" place="margin">The Soul.</note> 
                           <hi>it,</hi> who
continually caſteth forth his ſtreames with
falſe and wicked <hi>Imaginations</hi> into
the ſtarry and Elementary ſpirit and reacheth or graſpeth therewith after
the ſouls Fire, and willeth continually to <hi>infect</hi> the ſame with Earthly
devils longing and Malady.</p>
                        <p>60. There muſt the Noble Image defend it ſelf againſt the Souls fire,
and there it coſteth ſtriving and <hi>fighting</hi> for the Angels Garland, there
riſeth up often in the Old Adam, Anguiſh; <hi>doubting</hi> and <hi>unbelief,</hi> when
the Devil ſets upon the ſoul.</p>
                        <p>61. O thou Croſs of Chriſt, how <hi>heavy</hi> art thou ofentimes, how
doth the heaven <hi>hide</hi> it ſelfe, but ſo the Noble Grain is ſown, when
that is ſprung up, then it bringeth forth <hi>much</hi> faire fruit in Patience;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61375:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thus every little ſprout groweth in the ſoule, out of the divine wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                        <p>62. It muſt all preſs forth out of the Anguiſh Chamber, as a ſprout

ſuch a<note n="*" place="margin">Or Condition</note> form or manner, as here.</p>
                        <p>75. The ſpiritual Body can go through Earthly ſtone, ſo ſubtile it is,
elſe it were not <hi>capable</hi> of the Deity.</p>
                        <p>76. For God dwelleth without or beyond the palpable ſource or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,

                        <p>77. Thus we muſt alſo have a <hi>power-body;</hi> but truly and really
in fleſh and Bloud; but therein is a Glance of the Tincture; for
the ſpirit it ſo very thin that it is <hi>unapprehenſible</hi> by the Body, and yet
is palpable in the liberty, <hi>Elſe</hi> it were a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                        <p>78. And the Body is much <hi>thicker</hi> then the ſpirit, that ſo the Spirit

and out of the Light, again, the Meekneſs in fleſh and bloud, ſo
that there is an Eternal ſubſtance.</p>
                        <p>79. Now if we <hi>thus</hi> finde and know our ſelfe; then we ſee know
and <hi>understand</hi>
                           <note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> what God is and can do;
and what the Subſtance of all ſubſtances, is.</p>
                        <p>80. And we thus find how altogether blindly, we are lead aſtray Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roniouſly,
in that Men <hi>tell</hi> us very much of Gods will, and repreſent
the <hi>Deity</hi> continually as ſome forinſik or ſtrange ſubſtance, which is far

                        <p>81. And did bear onely ſome inclinable will towards Us, and did
forgive ſinne out of <hi>Favour,</hi> as a King pardoneth one his Life, which
had forfeited it.</p>
                        <p>82. But no! hearken; <hi>It is not</hi> Hypocritical flattery and <hi>ſeeming</hi>
Holineſs, and to continue and abide wicked that is called for: but it is
ſaid; we muſt become <hi>born</hi> out of God, or to be <hi>loſt</hi> from God E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally.</p>
                        <p>83. For, true Faith and Will muſt do

Subſtance, elſe <hi>neither</hi> ſinging, Ringing, Crying or flattering, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever

                        <p>84. God needs no ſervice or Miniſtry: we ſhould ſerve and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

but onely leadeth a Man away from God.</p>
                        <p>86. Gods <hi>Kingdom</hi> muſt <hi>Come</hi> in us; and <hi>his will be

ſelves; this is the whole ſervice of God</hi> which he accepteth of us.</p>
                        <p>87. What need we flatter our ſelves; are we righteous? then <hi>we</hi> our

and through us.</p>
                        <p>88. If his Spirit be in us, why do we ſo very long take care about

Servants, he muſt be the Workmaſter, if a work be to pleaſe God.</p>
                        <p>89. Whatſoever is beſides that, is <hi>Earthly</hi> built in the Spirit of this

                        <p>27. For, the Spirit which <hi>becometh</hi> generated out of the ſouls Fire

                        <p>44. For in Love and <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> we become New Born out of the

thee out of the old skin, to go home into the pure Garment.</p>
                        <p>78. See; though thou plainly walkeſt in this way, yet thou wilt have
upon thee <hi>weakneſs</hi> enough, and feel far too much; thou wilt ſtill work
very farre<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                           <hi>too</hi> much Evil.</p>
                        <p>79. For we have an Evil Gueſt lodging within us, to comfort ones
ſelf onely doth not avail, but to <hi>fight</hi> and ſtrive againſt it; and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
to ſlay and vanquiſh it: without this it is ever <hi>too ſtrong</hi> and
will have the Dominion.</p>
                        <p>80. Chriſt hath indeed in us and for us, broken and <hi>deſtroyed Death;</hi>
and made way for us, but what doth it help me, to comfort my ſelfe
with that, and learn to know that, and yet <hi>continue</hi> lying ſhut up in
the dark Anger, and Captivated in the Chains of the Devil?</p>
                        <p>81. I muſt even <hi>enter</hi> into that very way and Path, and walk in

<note n="*" place="margin">Titus. 3. 5. 6.</note>
                        <hi>He hath regenerated us</hi> in Chriſt out of the <hi>Water</hi> of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life, and hath left us at laſt the ſame in the Covenant of <hi>Baptiſm</hi>
for a Key; that we ſhould therewith unlock and therewith

                        <hi>given us his Body for food, and his Blood for drink,</hi>
that we ſhould receive it, and enter into his Covenant, and feed our
ſouls therewith, that they may be quickened and awake up from
Death, that the divine Fire, may <hi>kindle</hi> them.</p>
                     <p>4. Dear Children; It muſt burn, and not continue to lie ſhut up
in Stone, or as an <hi>Ember</hi> or Tinder, which would fain glimmer, and
cannot for the Devils Moyſture.</p>
                     <p>5. The Hiſtorical Faith is onely an <hi>Ember,</hi> which glimmereth like a
little ſpark; it muſt become Kindled, we muſt give it <hi>Matter,</hi> wherein
the ſparkle may kindle it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>6. The ſoul muſt preſs forth out of the Reaſon of this world in to the
life of Chriſt; into Chriſts fleſh and Bloud, and ſo it conceiveth the
<hi>Matter</hi> to its kindling: It muſt be in Earneſt Sincerity.</p>
                     <p>7. For, the Hiſtory reacheth not Chriſts fleſh and Bloud, Death muſt
be <hi>broke open.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. Although indeed Chriſt hath broke it open, yet the Earneſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere

deſire muſt <hi>follow</hi> after, that would fain doe or act, and alwaies
labour therein.</p>
                     <p>9. As a Pilgrim or Meſſenger who hath a long <hi>dangerous</hi> way to
travail, he alwaies runneth on towards the End, and is unwear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

though woe and miſery befall him, yet he hopeth for the End, and
cometh alwaies nearer where then he Expects in hope his <hi>wages</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment,
and joyeth that his ſore travail and wandering will have an
<hi>End.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. Thus muſt a man that will travail and wander to God, behave
himſelfe in the <hi>Way</hi> of his Pilgrimage: He muſt continually more and
more wander or travail forth out of the <hi>Earthly</hi> Reaſon, out from the
<hi>will</hi> of the Fleſh, of the Devil and the World.</p>
                     <p>11. Often woe and miſery befall him, when he muſt forſake that,
which he might <hi>well</hi> have had, and could <hi>therewith</hi> have ſwum in
Temporal Honour.</p>
                     <p>12. But if he will Travel in the Right Path, then he muſt onely put
on the Mantle of Righteouſneſs, and put off the <hi>Mantle</hi> of Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and the Hypocritical Life.</p>
                     <p>13. He muſt<note n="*" place="margin">Iſai. 58. 6. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>impart his bread to the Hungry,</hi> and give his <hi>clothes</hi>
for a <hi>Covering,</hi> and not be an <hi>Oppreſſor</hi> of the Miſerable; and onely
<hi>fill</hi> his own Sack full, ſqueeſe away the ſweet from the ſimple; and
impoſe <hi>Lawes</hi> upon him, onely for his pride
and pleaſure ſake.</p>
                     <p>14. He is no Chriſtian that doth ſuch things, but he travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in the Path of <hi>this</hi> world, as the ſtarres and the Elements with the
Devils infection and <hi>Lust,</hi> drive him.</p>
                     <p>15. <hi>And though likely he knoweth the Faith of Gods Mercifulneſs,
of the</hi> ſatisfaction <hi>of Chriſt, yet that will not help him: for</hi>
                        <note n="‖" place="margin">Mat. 7. 21.</note> not all
that ſay Lord Lord ſhall enter enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but
thoſe that do the will of my Father in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>16. <hi>And that will is,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 22. 39.</note> Love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf:<note n="‖" place="margin">Mat. 7. 12.</note> What thou

                           <p>54. Anſwer: Behold! in the Center of Nature there is <hi>ſuch</hi> a Thing
Being or ſubſtance: do but Mind it.</p>
                           <p>55. The Eternal will which is called God;
that is <hi>Free;</hi> for it hath in it nothing but the Light of the
Majeſty; and dwelleth in the Eternal Nothing; and therefore alſo <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
can touch him.</p>
                           <p>56. But his <hi>Deſiring;</hi> which maketh the Center
of Nature; that hath ſuch a property; for therein is the <hi>harſh</hi> aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency,
viz: the <hi>firſt</hi> Property of Nature, which alwaies attracteth to it
ſelf, and receiveth where nothing is, where it hath made Nothing:
and taketh it and <hi>twitcheth</hi> it up together.</p>
                           <p>57. Yet it may not Eat it, alſo it is <hi>not</hi> profitable to it: Thus it
maketh to it ſelf anguiſh pain and unquietneſs therewith; as alſo Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs,
in Man, doth.</p>
                           <p>58. The Second Form, is its drawing or Sting; that is its Servant
or <hi>Child,</hi> which there twitcheth together what the deſire will; that is the
Labourer; and ſignifieth the <hi>Inferiour</hi> Man, who is Evil, baſe, Angry,
Raging, and ſtingeth and throbbeth in the Harſh aſtringency.</p>
                           <p>59. And that cannot the Aſtringent harſhneſs <hi>endure</hi> from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
but draweth it the more eagerly; and ſo the ſervant becometh
more Evil and Baſe, more raging, and <hi>ſtormeth</hi> the Lords houſe.</p>
                           <p>60. Thereupon, will the Lord bind and hold the ſervant, and the
ſervant teareth forth with <hi>Malice</hi> aloft again.</p>
                           <p>61. And then ſeeing the Lord, viz: the <hi>harſh</hi> aſtringency cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-power
it; they ſtruggle together in Great Anguiſh, enmity and
Oppoſition, and begin to make a whirling-wheel; to <hi>worry</hi> murther
and put to death one the other.</p>
                           <p>62. This is the <hi>Third</hi> Form of Nature, whence ariſeth Warres,
fighting, ſtrife, deſtroying of Country and City, envy and anxious
vexatious Malice and wickedneſs: whereas alwaies <hi>one</hi> would have the
other Dead; willeth to devour all and draw it into it ſelfe, it willeth
to have it alone, and yet there is nothing profitable to it but <hi>hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>63. It doth as the fierce wrath of Nature doth, that ſwalloweth it ſelf
up into it ſelf: and <hi>Conſumeth</hi> and breaketh it ſelf, and yet it <hi>genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth</hi>
it ſelf alſo thus.</p>

                              <hi>Whence,</hi> all Evil cometh; the Devill together with all Evil

as Nature in the Center doth, underſtand, <hi>without</hi>
the Light.</p>
                           <p>65. Thus doth the Devil alſo, who hath not the Light: as alſo E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Men and Beaſts, alſo hearbs and Graſs, and all whatſoever is <hi>odious</hi>
or Enemicitious.</p>
                           <p>66. For, it is the poyſon-wheel, whence the <hi>Life</hi> ariſeth Originally,
that whirleth it ſelfe thus in great anguiſh, in ſtinging raging and
breaking; till it <hi>Createth</hi> another will in it ſelfe to go out of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,

into the Liberty of the firſt willing, which kindleth the Anguiſh of
Death-with the ſtill Liberty, whence the Anguiſh is <hi>terrified,</hi> Death
breaketh, and out of the Anguiſh goeth forth a Life of Joy.</p>
                           <p>68. Thus it goeth alſo with Man when he is in the Anguiſh and
Enmity, that the ſting of Death and of Anger <hi>rageth</hi> in him, ſo that
he is anxious Covetous, Envious Angry and Enemicitious.</p>
                           <p>69. Then he ſhould <hi>not</hi> continue in this Evil Subſtance, Condition,

becometh Generated.</p>
                           <p>76. And as we further know: that Nature in the Crack or Terrour
<hi>divideth</hi> it ſelfe into two Kingdoms; the <hi>Firſt,</hi> into the Kingdom of
Joy: The <hi>Second,</hi> into a ſincking of Death into a Darkneſs: ſo alſo
Man, when the Lilly branch to the Kingdom of Joy thus becometh
Generated, then its Nature divideth it ſelf into <hi>Two Wills.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>77. As <hi>Firſt,</hi> the one riſeth up in the Lilly and groweth in Gods
Kingdom: <hi>Secondly,</hi> the other ſincketh down in the Dark Death, and
panteth or <hi>longeth</hi> after the Earth; after its Mother: which ſtriveth

                           <p>78. As a ſprout groweth out of the Earth; and the Eſſence fleeth
before or from the Earth, and is drawn up by the ſun; till it becometh
a ſtalk or Tree: ſo alſo Gods <hi>Sun</hi> draweth Mans <hi>Lilly,</hi> viz: the<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                              <hi>New

laſt out of it, a Tree in Gods Kingdom.</p>
                           <p>79. And then he letteth the old Evil Tree or Shell, under which
the New did grow; <hi>fall away</hi> into the Earth into its Mother, after
which it indeed Longed; and out of the Earth again into the Center
of Nature, at the <hi>End</hi> of the Day of Separation, wherein all <hi>must</hi> again

                           <p>80. Thus goeth the Lilly alſo into its Ether, viz: into the<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note>

                           <p>82. Thus the <hi>Prima Materia,</hi> viz: the firſt Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which the harſhneſs maketh with its entering in, wherein the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

                           <p>83. And then the <hi>Second</hi> Part; ſevereth it ſelfe out of the Terrour

                     <p>8. Alſo he can frame or Create <hi>no</hi> Imagination or longing after it;
for Gods wil ſpirit, floweth into him and <hi>quelleth</hi> him in the Anguiſh
Chamber, in the firſt four forms of Nature; he can <hi>not</hi> attain the
Fift.</p>
                     <p>9. And though indeed, he hath all forms, of Nature, yet <hi>all</hi> is <hi>enimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citious</hi>
and Oppoſite or of Contrary will; for the Holy Spirit hath
left him, and now the ſource or fountain of the Anger or fierce <hi>wrath</hi>
is in him.</p>
                     <p>10. God, who is ALL, hath opened his fierce
wrath, or the <hi>Center</hi> of the Original, in him: ſo that it alſo is <hi>Creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
for it hath alſo longed to manifeſt it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>11. And when God once moved himſelf to the Creation of Angels,
then all <hi>became</hi> manifeſt, whatſoever from Eternity in the Wonders

                     <p>12. Seeing now we thus know: what we are; and that God <hi>letteth
us</hi> know it; we ſhould now look to it, and generate <hi>ſome</hi> Good out of

                     </p>
                     <p>15. Here we are in the Making, in the Creating; we ſtand in the

                     <p>16. <hi>God</hi> is become Man, and willeth to have us; ſo alſo his <hi>Anger</hi>
in the Kingdom of the fierce wrath willeth to have us; the <hi>Devil</hi> alſo
willeth to have us into his ſociety: and Gods <hi>Angels</hi> alſo into theirs:

                     <head>The Tenth Chapter. Of Gods Expreſs-Reflex Image of Man, viz: of
Gods ſimilitude and Man.</head>
                     <p>1. WE cannot in <hi>this</hi> world ſee our ſubſtantiality or New Body,
while we are in the Earthly Body: the Outward Man
knoweth it <hi>not;</hi> onely the Spirit, which becometh ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated,
and goeth forth out of the New Man, that knoweth its Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                     <p>2. But if we would fain have the knowledge thereof, and would know
whether we are in the New Birth: then we have <hi>no better proof</hi> or try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
of it; then by or in the ſimilitude of God, which we underſtand, to
be viz: the Deſiring, the ſenſe or<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                        <hi>Thoughts</hi> and the Mind.</p>
                     <p>3. Theſe Things contein in them, the <hi>Center</hi> of the ſpirit, out of
which the ſtrong will becometh generated and brought forth; in which,
the right true <hi>ſimilitude,</hi> and the Image of God with fleſh and Bloud,
ſtandeth, which the outward man knoweth not.</p>
                     <p>4. For that very Image is not in this world, but it hath another
Principle, viz: in the <hi>Angelical</hi> world, and during this Time of the
Body ſtandeth in the Myſtery in the ſecreſie or <hi>Arcanum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. As the Gold in the Stone, whereas the Gold hath another <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi>
another Eſſence another Glance and Luſtre or ſhining; and the
rudeneſs or droſſineſs of the Stone, <hi>cannot</hi> comprehend it: and the
Gold alſo doth not comprehend the rude droſſineſs of the Stone, and
yet the rude droſſineſs, viz: the <hi>Anguiſh</hi> Center, is a Cauſe of the
Gold; <hi>for</hi> the rude droſſineſs is the Mother, and the Sun or <hi>Sol</hi> is the
Father.</p>
                     <p>6. Thus alſo is our Old Adam and Body, a Cauſe of the New Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
for it is the Mother: out of the Old ſubſtantiality <hi>originally</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth
the new Body, and Gods Spirit in Chriſt is the Father, as the
Sun is the Father of the Gold: ſo alſo is Gods <hi>heart</hi> the Father of the
New-Man.</p>
                     <p>7. But now we can not know the New Man, better <hi>then</hi> in the
Center, namely in the Deſiring, Thoughts and Mind.</p>

8.<note n="*" place="margin">Note. How we may know whether the Noble Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-branch, viz: the Body of Gods Image, be Generated in us.</note> When we find our ſelves thus,
viz: that our Deſiring ſtandeth totally according to and <hi>towards</hi> God;
that our Thoughts continually run in the will of God, and that the
Mind totally giveth it ſelf up in Obedience <hi>into</hi> the will of God, and
that the Imagination or longing ſucketh of Gods power: then we may
<hi>aſſuredly</hi> know, that the Noble Lilly-Branch is generated, that the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God is in ſubſtance; that God in the ſimilitude
<hi>is become</hi> Man.</p>
                     <p>9. There it is neceſſary that the Noble Image be highly regarded and
taken care of, and that the Old Adam with his <hi>Luſts</hi> have no room or
ſpace left him, but that he be continually put to death, that the <hi>New-Man</hi>
may Grow, and be great, and become adorned with the Wonders
of the wiſdome.</p>
                     <p>10. But now Reaſon asketh: <hi>How</hi> is then the ſimilitude?</p>
                     <p>11. <hi>Behold!</hi> God is Spirit, and the Mind, together with the Thoughts
and deſire is alſo Spirit. The Mind is the wheel of Nature, the Deſire
is the Center, viz: the firſt ſubſtance to Nature: the Thoughts are
the<note n="*" place="margin">Or Branches.</note> Eſſences.</p>
                     <p>12. For, out of the Eſſences go the ſenſes or Thoughts; they are and
have their Original, <hi>out of</hi> the ſting of the deſirouſneſs, viz: out of
the harſh aſtringency; for they are the bitterneſs, and <hi>run alwaies</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Mind as an anguiſh wheel, and ſeek reſt, to try whether they may
attain the liberty of God.</p>
                     <p>13. They are <hi>they,</hi> which <hi>ſtrike</hi> up the fire in the Anguiſh wheel,
viz: in the Mind, and in the kindling in the Crack or Terrour <hi>willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
give up themſelves into Death: and thus ſinck down through the
fire-ſource or quality, into the Liberty, viz: into Gods Arms, and <hi>they</hi>
go forth into the Liberty as a Life out of Death.</p>
                     <p>14. <hi>They</hi> are the Root of the New Taſt or reliſh, which penetrate
into Gods wiſdome and wonders; <hi>they</hi> bring the Deſire, out of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
of Death, <hi>they</hi> fill their Mother the Mind, and give it power from
Gods Eſſence.</p>
                     <p>15. Thus is the mind, the wheel, or the Right Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Life, viz:<note n="*" place="margin">Or dwelling of the ſoul.</note> the ſouls own Houſe, of which it ſelf is a Part; if
the ſubſtantiality, underſtand, the ſubſtantiality of the <hi>Tincture,</hi> be
accompted to it, viz: the Fire-life.</p>
                     <p>16. For, out of the Fire-life <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>iſteth the Mind, and the fire-life dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61375:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the Mind: but the Mind is <hi>Nobler</hi> then the Fire, for it is the
Mobility of the Fires-life: it maketh the <hi>underſtanding.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>17. The Thoughts or ſenſes are the Minds
<hi>Servants,</hi> and are the ſubtileſt Meſſengers; they go into God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
out of God into neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>18. And wherein-ſoever they <hi>kindle</hi> themſelves either in God, or in
Neceſſity, viz: in falſhood or wickedneſs, that they bring home to the
Mind.</p>
                     <p>19. Therefore muſt the Noble Mind <hi>often</hi> be <hi>Lord</hi> over the Evil or
wickedneſs, and ſtifle it, in its Anguiſh, when the Thoughts have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
or loaden in, falſe or evil Imaginations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Deſire.</p>
                     <p>20. Thus underſtand it laſtly in <hi>this Manner:</hi> God is himſelf <hi>ALL
and in ALL.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>21. But he goeth forth out of the fierce wrath, and findeth the
Light-and power-<hi>world</hi> in himſelfe: he himſelfe maketh them, ſo that
the fierce wrath with all forms are <hi>onely</hi> a Cauſe of the Life, and a find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of himſelf in Great Wonders.</p>
                     <p>22. <hi>He</hi> is the Ground or Byſs and Abyſs; the Liberty
and alſo the Nature, in Light and Darkneſs.</p>
                     <p>23. And <hi>Man</hi> alſo is IT <hi>all,</hi> if he do but ſo ſeek and find himſelf <hi>as</hi>
God doth.</p>
                     <p>24. Our whole Writing and Teaching, aimeth at this, how we muſt
ſeek make and laſtly <hi>finde</hi> our ſelves; how we muſt generate or bring
forth; that we may be ONE ſpirit with God; that God may be in
US, and we in God; that Gods Love-ſpirit in us, may be the willing
and the Doing.</p>
                     <p>25. And that we, withdraw from the Anguiſh ſource or Quality,
that we may introduce our ſelves into the true <hi>ſimilitude</hi> in Three
worlds, that each of them may ſtand in their Order, and that the <hi>Light</hi>-world
in us, may be LORD, that, <hi>that</hi> may lead the Dominion.</p>
                     <p>26. That ſo, the Anguiſh world may abide hidden in the Light-world,
as it doth alſo in God, and ſo be <hi>onely</hi> a Cauſe of

                     <p>28. And this <hi>strife</hi> laſteth ſo long as the Earthly Life endureth; and

of God, which God highly loveth, and manifeſteth himſelf in
this ſimilitude; as in his <hi>own:</hi> God is in Man the Midlemoſt.</p>
                        <p>30. But he dwelleth onely in himſelf: and if it be ſo that the ſpirit
of Man, become ONE ſpirit with HIM, <hi>then</hi> he manifeſteth himſelf
in the humanity, viz: in the Mind, Thoughts and Deſiring; ſo that the
Mind <hi>feeleth</hi> him.</p>
                        <p>31. Elſe in this world he is very much <hi>too ſubtile</hi> to be beheld by us,
onely the Thoughts <hi>behold him</hi> in the Spirit, underſtand in the willing-ſpirit;
for the will ſendeth the Thoughts into God, and God giveth
himſelf <hi>into</hi> the Thoughts.</p>
                        <p>32. And <hi>then</hi> the Thoughts bring the Power of God to the will:
and the will receiveth them with Joy, but with<note n="*" place="margin">Or Quaking</note> 
                           <hi>Trembling.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>33. For it acknowledgeth it ſelf unworthy, ſeeing it proceedeth out
of a rough Lodging, viz: out of a wavering Mind; and therefore it
receiveth the Power in the <hi>ſinking</hi> down before God.</p>
                        <p>34. Thus out of its Triumph cometh a ſoft gentle Meekneſs to be:
that is Gods <hi>true</hi> ſubſtance, and it apprehendeth that very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                        <p>35. And that conceived or apprehended ſubſtance, is in the willing,
the heavenly Body, and <hi>is called</hi> the True and Right Faith;
which the will hath received in the power of God; the ſame ſincketh
or demerſeth it ſelf into the Mind, and <hi>dwelleth</hi> in the fire of the Soul.</p>
                        <p>36. Thus the Image of God is entire or total; and <hi>God</hi> ſeeth or
findeth himſelf in ſuch a ſimilitude.</p>
                        <p>37. And we ſhould not at all think or Conceive of God that he is
a ſtrange ſubſtance or ſorrein Thing, to the wicked indeed he is a
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61375:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtrange ſubſtance: for the wicked apprehendeth him <hi>not.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>38. God is in him indeed, but <hi>not Manifeſt,</hi> in
the willing and minde of the wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly;
it is onely his fierce wrath that is manifeſt in him, he <hi>cannot</hi>
reach or attain the Light.</p>
                        <p>39. It is in him, but it is not profitable to him, his Eſſence concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
or apprehendeth not it; it ſheweth it ſelf before him; and is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his <hi>pain</hi> ſource or Torment; and he doth but hate it and is an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
to it, as the Devil is an Enemy to the <hi>Sun;</hi> and alſo to the light
of God.</p>
                        <p>40. He would be better at Eaſe, if he could be Eternally in the Dark;
and <hi>knew</hi> that God were farre from him, and then he would find no
ſhame or reproach in him.</p>
                        <p>41. But if he knew, that God is ſo neer him, and he cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
him, that would be his greateſt <hi>plague,</hi> ſo that he would <hi>hate</hi>
himſelf, and it would make him an Eternal contrary will, oppoſite An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
and deſpair, <hi>in that</hi> he knoweth, that he cannot attain Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of gracious Countenance.</p>
                        <p>42. His own falſhood or wickedneſs plagueth him, but he can create
or procure <hi>no Comfort,</hi> that he might come to Grace, for he touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not God, but onely the Center in the Anguiſh in the fierce
wrath.</p>
                        <p>43. He abideth in Death, and in the <hi>Dying</hi> ſource or
Torment, and cannot break through; for there cometh
nothing to help him, of which he can lay hold, whereby he might
Ground or found himſelf in the Kingdom of God.</p>
                        <p>44. When he hath lead a Thouſand years in the Abyſs in the Deep,
yet then he would be <hi>without</hi> God in the Darkneſs, and YET God is
<hi>in him,</hi> but helpeth him not; alſo he knoweth him not, onely he
knoweth of him and onely feeleth his fierce wrath.</p>
                        <p>45. Underſtand that thus: juſt as a fire is in a Stone, and the Stone
knoweth it not, it feeleth it not, <hi>onely,</hi> the fierce wrathfull cauſe

                        </p>
                        <p>46. Thus, the Devil alſo feeleth onely the Cauſe of the Light, that
very cauſe, is the fierce wrathful Center: and holdeth him captive,
and <hi>that</hi> he <hi>hateth</hi> and cannot endure it: and yet he hath nothing elſe
that <hi>would be better</hi> for him.</p>

                           <pb n="195" facs="tcp:61375:109"/>
47. Thus he is nothing but a fierce wrathful vehement eager
Malignity or Malice, a Dying ſource or <hi>Torment,</hi> and yet is no Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but a deadly loathſome poyſon, a hunger and thirſt; but no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment.</p>

                        <p>59. It muſt ſerve the Holy Man for the Beſt, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note>
                           <hi>All things must ſerve for the Beſt to them that Love God,</hi> even
Sinne.</p>
                        <p>60.<note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 6. 1. 2.</note> What ſay we then? Shall we then ſinne? that our Salvation

againe into that to which I have dyed? <hi>Shall I go out of the Light
into Darkneſs?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>61. But thus it muſt be, that the Saints of God may looſe <hi>Nothing;</hi>
therefore it muſt <hi>all</hi> ſerve them: that which to Sinners is a Sting

                           <hi>unto Death,</hi> that is to the Saints a Might and Power <hi>unto
Life.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>62. Then ſaith outward Reaſon: ſurely <hi>I muſt ſinne,</hi> that my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
may be great.</p>
                        <p>63. But we know, that whoſoever goeth forth out of the Light,
he goeth <hi>into</hi> the Darkneſs: let him look to it that he abide
not in the Darkneſs; for he ſinneth <hi>purpoſely</hi>
ſtubbornly or obſtinately, in or againſt the Holy Spirit:<note n="†" place="margin">Gal. 6. 7.</note> 
                           <hi>Erre not;
God will not be Mocked</hi> nor ſlighted.</p>
                        <p>64. Of his Love, we are after our Fall become righteous again,
through <hi>his</hi> Entrance into our Fleſh.</p>
                        <p>65. But he that entereth <hi>purpoſely</hi> or obſtinately into Sinne, he
deſpiſeth and Contemneth the becoming Man or Incarnation of
Chriſt: and taketh a heavy burden upon or into himſelf: he ſhould
do <hi>well</hi> to look to it; he will <hi>more hardly</hi> be able to go again out
of the purpoſed ſinne: then one, to whom rhe way of God is not yet
Manifeſted.</p>

                           <pb n="197" facs="tcp:61375:110"/>
66. Therefore it is Good to ſhun,
and to <hi>flee</hi> fom Evil, to turn his Eye from falſhood and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that he Senſes or <hi>Thoughts may not</hi> enter into that which is

doth exiſt, ſo that the Deſire Imagineth, and bringeth it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

an Abomination in the preſence

                        <p>67. Wee would have the Reader and Hearer that loveth God,

but the ſpirit of God, helpeth us mightily according to that which
is pleaſing to God.</p>
                  <p>5. And <hi>ſo now</hi> Faith, is <hi>not</hi> an Hiſtorical knowledge, for
a Man to Make <hi>Articles</hi> of it, and to depend onely on them, and to
<hi>force</hi> his mind into the <hi>works</hi> of his Reaſon; but Faith is<note n="*" place="margin">Or a Spirit one with or in God.</note> ONE
Spirit with God: for the <hi>Holy</hi> Spirit moveth in the Spirit of Faith.</p>
                  <p>6. True Faith, is the <hi>Might</hi> of God, ONE Spirit with God; it
worketh in God and with God.</p>
                  <p>7. It is <hi>free,</hi> and bound to no Articles, but onely to the right and
true Love; wherein it fetcheth <hi>the breath of</hi> its Lifes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and ſtrenth; and lyeth not in humane <hi>Arbitrium</hi> Opinion or

                  <p>8. For, as God is free from all inclination or deviation, ſo that he
doth what he will; and need give no accompt for it, ſo alſo is the True
<hi>Faith</hi> free in the Spirit of God; it hath no more but one Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
viz: into the Love and <hi>Mercy</hi> of God, viz: that it caſt its willing
into Gods willing; and to go out from the Syderial and Elementary
Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>9. It Seeketh not it ſelf in the Reaſon of the <hi>Fleſh;</hi> but in Gods Love;

                  <p>13. And hath no Law, for the fierce wrath of Nature toucheth it
not: it ſubſiſteth in Eternity; for it is comprehended in <hi>No</hi> Ground,
it is included or Bolted up in Nothing.</p>
                  <p>14. As the <hi>Abyſs</hi> of Eternity is Free, and Reſteth in Nothing, but
onely in it ſelf, where there is an Eternal <hi>Meekneſs;</hi> ſo alſo, is the

                  <p>15. It is in it ſelf, the ſubſtance: it liveth, and yet ſeeketh <hi>not</hi> its

forth out of its own lifes Spirit, and <hi>poſſeſſeth</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>16. Thus, it is free from the ſource or Torment, and dwelleth thus
in the Eternal <hi>Liberty</hi> in God.</p>
                  <p>17. It is with, or as to, the Eternal Liberty, as a <hi>Nothing;</hi> and yet

God and the Eternity is and can

                  <p>18. It is in Subſtance, and yet is or <hi>becometh</hi> apprehended by no

                  <p>20. But if it becometh apprehended, then is <hi>it ſelf</hi> entered into Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

                  <head>The Second Chapter. Of Faiths Original: and why Faith
and Doubting dwel together.</head>
                  <p>1. NOw ſeeing Faith is ONE Spirit with God; therefore we are to
conſider of its Original, For we may not ſay, that it is a <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi>
or Image of Reaſon,<note n="*" place="margin">Faith is Gods Image, viz: the deſiring ſeeing and Mind.</note> but it is Gods Image, Gods ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
an <hi>Eternal Figure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. And yet may deſtroy or Corrupt it ſelf in the time of the Body,
or <hi>transmute</hi> and alter or change it ſelfe into the Anguiſh-ſource.</p>
                  <p>3. For in its own ſubſtance in the Original, it is meerly a <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
and that willing is a <hi>Seed,</hi> and that muſt the fire-ſpirit, viz: the
Soul, ſow into the Liberty of God.</p>
                  <p>4. And ſo a Tree groweth out of that ſeed, of which the ſoul feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and <hi>allayeth</hi> or meekeneth its fire-life: ſo that it becometh
powerful, and giveth its virtue to the root of this Tree, whence the
Tree groweth in the Spirit of God even into the wonders of the <hi>Majeſty</hi>
of God, and ſpringeth in the Paradiſe of God.</p>
                  <p>5. And although it be ſo; that thus we are as it were dumb or Mute
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:61375:114"/>
and may <hi>notwell</hi> be underſtood; for Reaſon will needs comprehend
and ſee all preſently; yet we will ſet it down very clearly to the Light:
<hi>why</hi> Faith <hi>and</hi> Doubting <hi>are</hi> together: And as it were bound with a
Chain, ſo that there is a vehement ſtrife in Man,
all the Time, while he is a Gueſt in<note n="*" place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>this Tabernacle</hi> of the <hi>Earthly</hi>
Life.</p>
                  <p>6. Unleſs, he ſo very eagerly ſinck down in himſelf, that he can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
the Lifes fire into the <hi>Liberty</hi> of God, and ſo he is in the life
of Reaſon, <hi>as</hi> Dead, and though he liveth,<note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 6. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>he liveth to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. Which is indeed a highly precious life of a Man, and is rarely
or <hi>ſeldom</hi> found in any, for it is<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> like the firſt Image, which God Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>8. Although the Mortal hangeth to it, yee it is <hi>as it were</hi> Dead,
as if a Dead Image hung to him, into which corruption <hi>belongeth,</hi>
wherein the true Man liveth <hi>not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. For, the Right life ſtandeth <hi>converted,</hi> and is in another world, in
an other Principle, and liveth in another ſource or Quality.</p>
                  <p>10. Uuderſtand us now therefore in <hi>this</hi> manner: ye ſee and know
the Original of the Humane Life, how <hi>that</hi> exiſteth in the Mothers
Womb or Body; and ye ſee moreover <hi>wherein</hi> it qualifieth or opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
and moveth it ſelfe, viz: chiefly in Four Forms; as, in Fire, Air,
water, and Earth or Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>11. And though clearly it thus ſtandeth therein, yet it is in this <hi>no
more</hi> then a Beaſtial Life, For its <hi>Reaſon</hi> cometh to it from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>llations,
and findeth, that the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Conſtellation</hi> maketh a
<hi>Tincture</hi> in the four Elements, <hi>whence</hi> the Reaſon and qualification or
working cometh, alſo pleaſure and diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>12. But it is <hi>not</hi> by farre yet, the right humane Life: for this
Reaſon ſeeketh no higher, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it ſelf in <hi>its</hi> wonders.</p>
                  <p>13. Yet there is in Man a Deſire and a great Longing or panting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a higher better and <hi>Eternal</hi> Life, wherein there is no ſuch ſource
quality or Torment.</p>
                  <p>14. And though it be clear that Reaſon apprehendeth it not, nor
ſeeth it not, yet <hi>a Myſtery</hi> lyeth <hi>in Reaſon,</hi> which there taſteth and
knoweth it, whence the ſeeking exiſteth.</p>
                  <p>15. Whereby we know that the ſame Myſtery, is <hi>together</hi> implanted
in the firſt Creation, and is Mans <hi>own,</hi> and thus find, that it ſtandeth
in a deſiring or Longing, viz: in a Magick ſeeking.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:61375:114"/>
16. Further we find, that, with that Myſtery, we are in a <hi>ſtrange</hi>
Lodging for our Houſe: that, the ſame Myſtery ſtandeth <hi>not</hi> in the
ſpirit of this World: for <hi>that</hi> apprehendeth it not, alſo findeth it not,
whereby then we know the heavy fall of Adam.</p>
                  <p>17. For, we find that Myſtery in the willing of the <hi>Mind firſt;</hi> that
it is a ſecret fountain Spring, which openth it ſelf in another Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>18. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we underſtand alſo, that, that Myſtery ſtandeth <hi>hidden</hi>
in the fire in the Anguiſh ſource or quality, and openeth it ſelf, through
the <hi>Anguiſh</hi> of the willing.</p>
                  <p>19. And then <hi>Thirdly</hi> we find, how that ſame Myſtery <hi>is</hi> held cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
by the ſpirit of this world.</p>
                  <p>20. And as the <hi>Outward</hi> lifes Reaſon hath Might or ability, to enter
thereinto, and to deſtroy it, ſo that, that myſtery cometh not to the
Light, in that it covereth the ſame, ſo that the <hi>Genetrix</hi> cannot gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;
and ſo<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>abideth</hi> as a Myſtery hidden.</p>
                  <p>21. And ſo then when the Body breaketh, then the willing hath
nothing <hi>More</hi> which can open the Myſtery: and thereupon the <hi>fire</hi> or
Souls ſpirit abideth in the Darkneſs; and the Myſtery ſtandeth <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi>
hidden in it, as in another Principle.</p>
                  <p>22. Thus we know that Myſtery to be<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>Gods Kingdom,</hi> which
ſtandeth hidden in the ſoul, which giveth a <hi>longing</hi> pleaſure and deſire,
ſo that it Imagineth in that Myſtery.</p>
                  <p>23. Where then it becometh impregnated magically <hi>in that</hi> Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
out of which the willing <hi>exiſteth</hi> to it, to go forth out of the Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life
into the Myſtery of God.</p>
                  <p>24. And ſo now if it lifteth up the willing, and caſteth it from it
into the Myſtery, then the willing becometh Impregnated in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</p>
                  <p>25. For, it is longing and attaineth or cometh to be the <hi>Body</hi> of the
Myſtery, viz: the ſubſtance of the Myſtery, which is Gods ſubſtance,
which is<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>Incomprehenſible</hi> to Nature; Thus the willing draweth Gods
ſimilitude or Image on to it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>26. So now when the willing is generated out of the Souls Fire,
then it ſtandeth indeed alſo with its <hi>Root</hi> in the ſoul, and ſo between the
willing and the ſoul there is no parting or renting: but the willing thus
becometh ONE ſpirit in <hi>or with</hi> God, and becometh the ſouls Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſo that the ſoul in the willing becometh <hi>hidden</hi> in God.</p>
                  <p>27. So that though it dwelleth in the Body, yet nevertheleſs it is
with its <hi>willing</hi> environed and hidden in God; and is thus in the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:61375:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
willing, which is the right earneſt Faith, <hi>a Child of God;</hi> and dwelleth
in another world.</p>
                  <p>28. This now is not ſo to be underſtood, like a Hiſtorical willing,
whereby <hi>Reaſon knoweth,</hi> that there is in it ſelf a deſire after God, and
yet holdeth or reteineth that very deſire captive, in Evil or wickedneſs,
ſo that the willing <hi>cannot</hi> go out from the ſoul, and enter into the Life
or Myſtery of God, but <hi>maketh</hi> Opinions, and ſetteth the willing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
Conjectures.</p>
                  <p>29. Wherein then it cannot reach the Myſtery, and ſo abideth in
the Conjecture, or indeed <hi>altogether</hi> hidden in the ſoule, in which it
is directed and pointed or put off to a Future thing, <hi>whereby</hi> Reaſon
holdeth the will Captive in the Longing or luſt of the Fleſh in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derial <hi>Magia,</hi> and continually ſaith; <hi>to Morrow</hi> thou wilt go forth
and ſeek the Myſtery of God.</p>
                  <p>30. Verily, there is no own or<note n="*" place="margin">Note. Thou muſt through Chriſt in thee deny thy ſelf.</note> 
                     <hi>ſelf ability</hi> of finding it: This O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
deceiveth itſelf; ſo alſo the <hi>Liberty</hi> is in no Conjecture or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
where the will may Enter in and behold God, that Reaſon need
to Image or Contrive to make or to do ſomewhat, and ſo <hi>therewith</hi> to
be pleaſing to God.</p>
                  <p>31. For there is no righter way then onely to go with the willing <hi>out</hi>
from Reaſon, and not will to ſeek it ſelf, but Gods Love, to caſt it ſelfe
wholly into Gods willing, and to let <hi>all</hi> lye, which
Reaſon caſteth in the way.</p>
                  <p>32. And though there were great ſinnes and forepaſt Luſts, into
which the <hi>Body</hi> was Entered; onely to go <hi>above</hi> them with the will,
and Eſteem Gods Love greater † <hi>then the</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>orbid <hi>Pleaſure of ſinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>33. For God is not an áccepter of ſinnes but an accepter of the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
free</hi> willing, he letteth not ſinnes, into himſelf.</p>
                  <p>34. But a humble lowly willing, which goeth forth out of the houſe
of Sinnes, and willeth ſinnes No more, but ſincketh it ſelf out from
Reaſon into it Love, as an <hi>Obedient</hi> humble Child, that he accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
for <hi>it is pure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>35. But ſo long as it ſticketh in the Opinion and Conjecture, it is
ſurrounded with the Opinion, and is <hi>not</hi> free.</p>
                  <p>36. But now ſeeing then God is free in himſelf from the Evil or

                  <head>The Third Chapter. VVhence, Good and Evil, Love and Anger, Life
and Death, Joy and Sorrow, Cometh: and how
the VVonders of Nature appear in the Free

mingleth not it ſelf with the Wonders
of Nature.</head>
                  <p>1. ANd underſtand us further in <hi>this</hi> Manner: We apprehend and
have it ſufficiently made known to us even in the <hi>Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi>
as alſo in the <hi>light</hi> of Nature and in <hi>All</hi> and Every
thing or Subſtance; that from the Eternal Subſtance
all <hi>proceedeth,</hi> both Good and Evil, Love and Anger, Life and Death,
Joy and Sorrow.</p>
                  <p>2. Yet we <hi>cannot</hi> ſay, that therefore Evil and Death Cometh from
God; for<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>in God is no Evil,</hi> alſo no Death, and in Eternity no Evil
goeth into Him.</p>
                  <p>3. The fierce wrath onely proceedeth out of the <hi>fire</hi> of Nature, where
the life ſtandeth as in a <hi>Magia,</hi> where one form deſireth and awakeneth
the other, whence the Eſſences of Multiplicity Exiſt; out of which the
wonders become generated; in which the Eternity manifeſteth or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth
it ſelfe in <hi>Similitudes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. And yet we muſt ſay that in Gods willing, there is a deſiring,
which there cauſeth the <hi>Magia,</hi> out of which the Multiplicity exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>5. And yet the Multiplicity is not Gods willing it <hi>ſelfe:</hi> which is
free from all ſubſtance; but in the Seeking or <hi>longing</hi> of the willing,
Nature generateth it ſelf with all forms, where then all originally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth
out of the Deſiring, as viz: out of the Eternal <hi>Magia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. And we are further to know, that all whatſoever there <hi>attaineth
Life</hi> (which Imagineth into the ſeeking or Longing, and ſetteth its
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61375:116"/>
will into Nature), that it is the Child of Nature, and ONE
life with Nature.</p>
                  <p>7. But whatſoever with its willing; <hi>goeth forth</hi> out of the ſeeking or
longing of Nature, into the free willing of God, that becometh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
and known in that free willing, and is <hi>ONE</hi> ſpirit in, <hi>or with
GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. And <hi>though</hi> it be Nature: as alſo Nature hath <hi>Ever</hi> from <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
generated it ſelfe in Gods willing, yet its Spirit-life is without or
beyond Nature in the free willing,<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> and ſo the wonders ſtand mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
in God, and yet are not God <hi>himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. And if the ſouls will-ſpirit goeth forth from the Reaſon of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
into the free-willing of God, then is the willing-ſpirit <hi>Gods Child,</hi>
and the Nature-ſpirit <hi>Gods wonder;</hi> and the Creature, ſtandeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
into it ſelfe, <hi>as</hi> God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>10. For, the Sydereall or Reaſon-ſpirit, ſeeketh in its <hi>Magia,</hi> in it
ſelfe, in its Center, the Wonders of Eternity: To which <hi>End,</hi> God
hath created the ſoul, in the Body of the outward Nature, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it be onely apprehended in the Inward.</p>
                  <p>11. And the willing-ſpirit goeth into the liberty of God, where then
the Holy Spirit bringeth it into the Free <hi>divine</hi> Myſtery, ſo that the
<hi>Deity</hi> ſtandeth manifeſt in the willing-ſpirit, and in the Reaſon Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
ſtandeth the <hi>Magia</hi> of Nature, with its wonders, Manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>12. So then ſeeing the ſoul is the <hi>Center,</hi> where the right willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirit
towards the liberty of God, goeth forth into the liberty of God,
viz: into the <hi>Divine</hi> Myſtery, yet it hath the Sydereall ſpirit for a
Band.</p>
                  <p>13. And if it <hi>tameth</hi> that ſo that it worketh
not Evil, may introduce, the Sydereal Wonders, which in the
Elementary Looking-Glaſs became made or brought to a Subſtance,
and bring them before the <hi>Majesty</hi> of God into the free willing of God:
that ſo the wonders may ſhine or appear in the <hi>divine</hi> Liberty, as a
ſimilitude of Gods willing.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>Not</hi> ſo to underſtand; that the liberty of God <hi>mixeth</hi> with
the Nature-wonders and with the ſimilitude, ſo that they be One;
<hi>NO.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. God abideth Eternally <hi>Free;</hi> he dwelleth in the wonders as the
Soul in the Body; and ſo little as the Body apprehendeth the ſoul, or
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61375:116"/>
the fire, the Light; ſo <hi>little</hi> alſo doth Nature, the Deity.</p>
                  <p>16. And yet is <hi>ONE</hi> ſubſtance, and hath from Eternity <hi>parted it
ſelf</hi> into two ſubſtances, viz: the Fire and the Light.</p>
                  <p>17. Where in the <hi>Fire</hi> we underſtand the ſource or quality of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and in the <hi>Light,</hi> the Myſtery the ſpirit of the Life without
ſource or quality, although the Fire alſo is a Myſtery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>18. Thus, underſtand us, it hath one and the ſame form or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in Man. The <hi>Soul</hi> is the Fire of the true humane life; that, God
out of the Eternal Nature in Adam breathed or blew up by or with his
ſpirit, as viz: out of the Center of God.</p>
                  <p>19. And the <hi>Spirit</hi> that became generated out of the ſouls fire, which
Gods ſpirit <hi>formed</hi> to its Image; that, <hi>HATH</hi> the divine Myſtery, out
of which the willing towards the Love of God, becometh Generated,
out of which the Divine <hi>Magia</hi> or ſeeking, Exiſteth; that, the willing
ſpirit of God, deſireth.</p>
                  <p>20. And ſo now if it Lift up it ſelf, that is, go forth out of the
hidden Myſtery into the liberty of God, then it is a <hi>branch</hi> bud or
ſprout in Gods Kingdom: Sprouted out of Gods Myſtery, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in Gods willing, and <hi>Continually</hi> openeth the Wonders of Gods
wiſdome.</p>
                  <p>21. <hi>NOT</hi> in that form or Manner, as if in God <hi>ſomewhat New</hi>
were become Generated, that had <hi>not</hi> been from Eternity in Gods
wiſdome, which hath no Ground or bottom nor Number.</p>
                  <p>22. Onely in the ſouls <hi>Spirit</hi> in it ſelf the Endleſs or Infinite My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery

to the Eternal Joy of it ſelf, underſtand of the <hi>Creatures</hi> ſelf.</p>
                  <p>23. Now ſeeing the Earthly periſhed ſeeking or longing mixeth it ſelf
<hi>together</hi> with the Starry ſource or quality, and that the ſoul in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Fall of Adam, hath with its willing <hi>imagined</hi> into the Starry ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or longing, as alſo into the Earthly, and introduced, the ſtrange
<hi>Magia</hi> into it ſelf; therefore is the willing become broken or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and the divine Image become deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>24. And the Heavenly divine Image of Man <hi>became</hi> Earthly, ſo that
the right willing ſtandeth as it were <hi>reverſed</hi> or turned about, as viz.
in the ſpirit of this world, viz: in <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which is generated
out of the Conſtellation.</p>
                  <p>25. Now therefore it is neceſſary for the right Image of God, which
is thus deſtroyed and <hi>become</hi> Earthly; that it become<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 3. 3. 5. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>born againe</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new.</p>
                  <p>26. And there would be no Remedy or Council found, to help this
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61375:117"/>
Image; if the word out of the Center of God, viz: Gods own Life,
<hi>ſhould not</hi> become Man, and new Regenerate the pure ſoul again in it

the liberty and Majeſty of God.</p>
                  <p>27. And ſo now ſeeing <hi>all</hi> ſouls are proceeded out of <hi>ONE,</hi> they
are all <hi>THEREFORE</hi> generated out of the periſhed or Corrupted
Root.</p>
                  <p>28. But ſeeing the New regenerated Life in Chriſt is come again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<note n="*" place="margin">Or one.</note>a ſoul: therefore it is neceſſary, that we <hi>all</hi> caſt our willing into
the Regeneration of Chriſt: for in Chriſt
we are with our ſouls, become Generated in God again, and have <hi>in
Chriſt</hi> attained the Image again.</p>
                  <p>29. For our Myſtery in the ſoul ſtood after the Fall onely and <hi>barely</hi>
in the <hi>Magia</hi> of Nature, which in its <hi>Center,</hi> is a Fire, and the Image
was turned out of the liberty of God into the outward <hi>Magia,</hi> viz:
into the outward Principle.</p>
                  <p>30. So now when that breaketh or Corrupteth in the Subſtance;
then the poor periſhed Image of the Soul, ſtandeth as a forlorn <hi>loſt
child,</hi> where in its own Center it <hi>can</hi> awaken or ſtirre up <hi>Nothing,</hi>
but onely the fierce wrathful fire-ſource or quality: for it is gone out
of the word of God, viz: out of Gods Myſtery, into a <hi>Corruptible</hi>
Looking-Glaſs, viz: into the ſpirit of this world; which is inceptive
and finite, or hath a beginning and End.</p>
                  <p>31. And therefore alſo the ſouls Body is <hi>wholly</hi> become Earthly,
and is fallen home to Corruptibility and to Death.</p>
                  <p>32. Therefore it is neceſſary for us: (being God hath out of Grace
turned his <hi>Love</hi> to us, and hath turned in our ſoul, <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> into
himſelf again into the Liberty, and made the divine Myſtery ſtirring
in the Image, ſo that the Image <hi>can</hi> dwell again in God, viz: in the
Paradiſical Wonders) that we break off our willing from the <hi>outward
Center,</hi> viz: from the tranſitory Life, and introduce it into the <hi>free</hi>
willing of God.</p>
                  <p>33. And to that Now belongeth, not a Hiſtory onely, or
<hi>knowledge;</hi> for one to ſay. I Believe, that is, I <hi>know</hi> it, or
<hi>deſire</hi> it, and yet abide with the willing in the outward Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
viz: ſtand in the outward ſeeking or Longing: No!</p>

                  <p>38. For Gods willing muſt become <hi>Lord</hi> over Reaſon; if Reaſon
would make or do any thing vertuous, which ſubſiſteth before God.</p>
                  <p>39. For nothing <hi>ſubſiſteth</hi> before God unleſs it be generated in Gods

                  <p>5. For, the Looking-Glaſs, viz: the outward King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

ſtandeth, into the outward Looking-Glaſs, viz: into an <hi>Hypocritical</hi>

captivated therewith, and infected with the outward <hi>Magia,</hi> viz: with
the ſeeking or longing thereof.</p>
                  <p>7. Where then the Image putteth on the outward ſubſtantiality,
not onely as a Garment, but it is an <hi>infection</hi> and totall mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>8. Though indeed the ſouliſh-fire, mixeth not it ſelf with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

remaineth rough, and <hi>hath</hi> in the willing-ſpirit, an Earthly I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>

its Image, viz: its willing-Spirit: and now is <hi>departed</hi> away from

                  <p>10. What it hath loved here, that hath been its Treaſure, whereinto

                  <p>13 For it can Frame or Create no other willing, for it <hi>cannot</hi>
enter into the liberty of God, into the <hi>Holy</hi> Myſtery; where it might
create or procure another willing; it liveth onely and barely in it
ſelf.</p>
                  <p>14. It hath Nothing; and can alſo attain Nothing but onely, that
which in the outward Life it hath comprehended or <hi>Conceived</hi> in it

                  <p>20. Where then at laſt the ſoul departeth away, and renounceth

                  <p>26. So then if our Minde and Willing become ſet thereinto, and
that the willing <hi>deſireth</hi> the ſame; then is the willing Magical and

<hi>appropriate</hi> themſelves with the Image: For, the children of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,

<hi>ſent</hi> their willing in their prayer into Gods Myſtery: and therewith
unite them, to their deliverer and comforter.</p>

                  <p>41. And all this becometh <hi>reſerved</hi> to the Judgement of God the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

breaketh, and he that loveth the ſame is bereaved thereof.</p>
                  <p>27. And he is like one who in a great water<note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 7. 26.</note>

Kingdom; who draweth on the heavenly and divine Myſtery, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth

                  <p>30. All the Ornament and Bravery of this world, is <hi>Dung</hi> in reſpect
of the Heavenly: and is not worth a Mans ſetting his Love upon it.</p>
                  <p>31. Although it be ſo; that it <hi>muſt</hi> yet be brought to the<note n="*" place="margin">Work or Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</note> Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
to which End alſo God hath Created it: that Man, underſtand,

in the outward Myſtery, both out of the Earth and above the Earth.</p>
                  <p>32. All whatſoever the Starres can do, and the Earth hath in it,
<hi>ſhould</hi> Man bring into Wonders, into <hi>Forms,</hi> and into Being and
Subſtance, according to the Eternal <hi>Figure,</hi> which became ſeen in
Gods wiſdome, before the Times of the World.</p>
                  <p>33. But he ſhould not <hi>ſet</hi> his willing therein, and Eſteeme
that for his Treaſure, but for his Joy and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he may <hi>uſe</hi> it; but with the Inward Man he ſhould labour in
Gods Myſtery, and then Gods Spirit helpeth him <hi>alſo</hi> to ſeek and finde
the Outward.</p>
                  <p>34. Seeing then, we are through the Heavy fall become ſo periſhed,
that our <hi>Mind</hi> is become turned out of the heavenly Myſtery into the
Earthly, as into the Looking-Glaſs, ſo that we are found as it were
<hi>half</hi> dead; therefore it is highly neceſſary for us, that we go <hi>quite</hi>
forth out of the Earthly, with our Mind and willing: and <hi>ſeek</hi> our
ſelves firſt, before we ſeek the Earthly Beauty and Ornament; that
we may firſt learn to know, where we are at home, and not make our
Mind Earthly.</p>
                  <p>35. For, though Man ſtandeth clearly in the Image of God, yet
he is in a <hi>Three fold</hi> Life; but if he looſe Gods Image, then he is only
in a <hi>Twofold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>36. The <hi>First</hi> Life is the Soules Life, and it originally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth
in the Fire of the Eternal Nature, and ſtandeth Eſpecially in
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61375:123"/>
                     <hi>Seven</hi> Forms, all according to the Spirit of Nature, as in our ſecond
and Third Book is expreſſed and declared.</p>
                  <p>37. And the <hi>Second</hi> Life ſtandeth in the Image, which is or becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
generated out of the fountain of the Eternal Nature, viz: out of
the ſouls Fire, which Image ſtandeth in the <hi>Light</hi> in another ſource or
quality, and hath its living Spirit; as you may find it in Fire and Light.</p>
                  <p>38. For, the ſource or quality of the Light, is not as the ſource or
quality of the Fire, and yet the Light exiſteth <hi>out of</hi> the Fire, where
a Man is to underſtand in the ſource or quality of the Light, the meek
pure amiable Spirit, and in the ſource or quality of the fire, the
<hi>Cauſe</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <p>39. As you ſee, that out of the fire the <hi>Air</hi> Originally ariſeth,
which is the Spirit, and the Air alſo is underſtood to be in Four
Forms, as <hi>Firſt,</hi> one Day according to the fierce wrath of the fire;
and <hi>Secondly,</hi> a Moiſt or damp one, viz: water, from the harſh aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
attraction; and <hi>Thirdly,</hi> a Meek one from the Light: and <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
a ſwelling riſing one, from the fierce wrath of the fire-Crack.</p>
                  <p>40. Wherein we then underſtand; that the Light in <hi>all</hi> Forms is
Maſter, for it hath the Meekneſs, and is a Life, which becometh ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
through the fierce wrathful Death, viz: through the <hi>Anguiſh</hi>
ſource or quality in the ſincking down: viz: as another Principle,
which ſubſiſteth in the fire without feeling; and yet hath its feeling in
it ſelf; viz: the Laudable worthly Reliſh.</p>
                  <p>41. Wherein then we underſtand, that the water, becometh generated
through the Death, through the <hi>ſincking down</hi> through the fires Anguiſh,
and we underſtand further, how yet it is no Death, and yet it is a Death.</p>
                  <p>42. But the Light maketh it Sprouting, ſo that there is a <hi>Life</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
which life ſtandeth in the Lights Power, wherein the life ſprouteth
out of Death.</p>
                  <p>43. And, underſtand; the Subſtantiality, viz: the Comprehenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or Palpability, for, or to be, the <hi>water;</hi> which is dead in it ſelfe,
but the fire-life, and the Lights power is its Life.</p>
                  <p>44. Thus the ſubſtantiality is eſteemed as it were dead, where the
Life is its <hi>own</hi> therein, and poſſeſſeth and generateth it ſelf in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>45. Wherein the Death of the ſubſtantiality muſt give the <hi>Body</hi>
thereto; as is declared in our Third Book: where then in the Light-life,
and in the water of the Death, we underſtand <hi>two</hi> forms; and
according to the Anguiſh in the Fire, the <hi>Third.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>46. As <hi>First,</hi> in the Anguiſh of the Mortifying or killing in the
fierce wrath of the Fire, we underſtand a <hi>fierce</hi> wrathful water, which
in reſpect of the firſt four forms to Nature, viz: harſhneſs, bitterneſs
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:61375:123"/>
anguiſh and fire, is like <hi>Poyſon,</hi> and, is alſo Poyſon, a helliſh ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
in the fierce wrath, according to the original of the firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
wherein Gods Anger ſpringeth or floweth up.</p>
                  <p>47. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> we underſtand the other water, in the Lights
Crack, in which the ſource or quality ſincketh down quite through the
<hi>Mortifying,</hi> and in the Death, becometh like as it were nothing, for
in the <hi>Nothing,</hi> the Eternal Liberty, viz: the Eternal Abyſs of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity;
becometh <hi>attained.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>48. And if then the incomprehenſible Light, in that very ſinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down into the Eternity ſhineth or diſcovereth it ſelfe, and, alwaies
<hi>filleth</hi> the ſinking down, then ſprouteth forth in the Light, the power
of the Light, viz: the Life of the <hi>demerſed</hi> or ſunck down Death.</p>
                  <p>49. For, the fierce wrath of the Fire, abideth in the fierce wrathful
ſource or quality of the fierce wrathful water, and goeth<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>not</hi> along
into Death; alſo it cannot be, for the fierce wrathfulneſs is the ſtern
<hi>Almighty</hi> life; that <hi>cannot</hi> dye, <hi>nor</hi> attain the Eternal
Liberty; for it is called, &amp; remaineth to be, in <hi>Eternity,</hi> the Nature-life.</p>
                  <p>50. And though indeed in the Light-life, there is found <hi>alſo</hi> a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
yet it is <hi>not painful</hi> odious or Enemicitious, as that in
the <hi>Original</hi> of Nature, according to which, God called himſelfe a
zealous jealous Angry God.</p>
                  <p>51. For, in the Light-ſource or quality, the water, which is ſunck
down through death into the Liberty, becometh a ſource &amp; <hi>water of the
Eternal life</hi> of Joy, in which the Meekneſs and Love, Eternally flow up.</p>
                  <p>52. Where then there is no more ſincking down, but a ſprouting,
which is called <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>53. And the movinng out of the waters-ſource, is called <hi>Element,</hi>
that is the pure Element in the Angelical world.</p>
                  <p>54. And the Cauſe of the fire in the Light, is the Eternal <hi>Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
wherein the Eternal skill and knowledg in Gods <hi>wiſdom</hi> becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
opened: as we have a ſimilitnde hereof in the Firmament and Starres.</p>
                  <p>55. Thus, we underſtand <hi>two</hi> worlds <hi>one</hi> in another, one not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
the Other, viz: One, in the fierce wrath of the fiery Nature,
in the water of the Poyſon and Anguiſh ſource or Quality, wherein
the <hi>Devil</hi> dwelleth.</p>
                  <p>56. And then one in the Light, wherein the water of the Light,
is ſunck down, out of the Anguiſh, into the Eternal Liberty, which
the Poyſon-water, cannot apprehend or <hi>reach.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>57. And yet is <hi>not</hi> ſevered aſunder, but onely through the Death,
where it divideth it ſelfe into two Principles, and ſo ſevereth it ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>two Lives,</hi> viz: one in the Anger, and the other in the Love, <hi>which</hi>
Life, is known to be the right Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:61375:124"/>
58. And herein ſticketh the ground; that as we with <hi>Adam</hi> went
out of this Life into the Outward Life; wherefore alſo God became
Man: ſo he muſt introduce us <hi>through</hi> this death, through and out
of the fierce wrathful ſource or quality out of the fire-An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh-life,
through the Death into the Light-and
Love-life, again.</p>
                  <p>59. Whereas yet the <hi>Gates</hi> of Death, were in the wrathfulneſs ſhut
up in the humane ſoul, ſo that the ſoul ſtood in the Anguiſh ſource or
quality, in the <hi>inward</hi> Nature, in the fire of the Poyſon, viz: in the
water of the Anguiſh.</p>
                  <p>60. And there hath the Prince Chriſt, broken the Look Fort or
Barre of Death, and is with <hi>his humane</hi> ſoul ſprouted forth through
the Death into the Light of God again, and ſo now his Light-life
leadeth Death captive, and ſo it is become a Reproach and Scorn.</p>
                  <p>61 For with the Lock Fort or Barre, Lucifer <hi>thought</hi> to be a Lord
and Omnipotent Prince.</p>
                  <p>62. But when the Lock Fort or Barre became broken, then the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi>
of the Deity in the Light deſtroyed his Kingdom; and there he
became a <hi>Captive</hi> ſervant, for Gods Light and the Water of Meekneſs
is his Death; for the Anger, becometh killed or mortified therewith.</p>
                  <p>63. Thus is the Light and the Love <hi>entered</hi> into the Anger, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Paradiſe-Element, and the water of the Eternal Life, and
Gods anger is become <hi>quenched.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>64. And ſo now Lucifer abideth in himſelf in an anxious fierce
wrathful fire-ſource, where <hi>his Body</hi> is a Poyſon, a ſource of Poyſon-water.</p>
                  <p>65. And thus, is become thruſt out from Gods fire, into the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix</hi>
of the Eternal Nature, viz. into the ſtern harſhneſs, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
the Eternal darkneſs, wherein he manageth the very ſtern domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in the Anxious <hi>Mercurius,</hi> and ſo is as a Reproach
or Out-caſt.</p>
                  <p>66. Who in his Original was a Prince, but now is no more then
an <hi>Executioner,</hi> a Baſe Slave, which muſt be there in Gods fierce
wrath, as a Hangman, who <hi>puniſheth</hi> the Evil, when he is commanded
by his Lord to do ſo: he hath no further power.</p>
                  <p>67. Although yet he is a <hi>deceiver,</hi> that he might entrap many,
and that his Kingdom may be great, that he may have many, and not
ſtand in reproach with ſo few.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:61375:124"/>
68. As a Whore thinketh, if there were many Whores, then I ſhould
<hi>not</hi> be a <hi>Where alone,</hi> I am as others are; thus he alſo deſireth a great
Tribe or Genealogy; that thereby he may reproach God.</p>
                  <p>69. For he alwaies <hi>attributeth</hi> the blame and fault to God, that he
is fallen, as that <hi>bis</hi> wrath hath ſo drawn him, and thruſt him into
ſuch a willing of Pride and ſtate, ſo that he ſtood not.</p>
                  <p>70. Thus he ſuppoſeth, if he did draw many to him, that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
would be <hi>great,</hi> and ſo ſhould get more to him, that would do as he
doth and Curſe God, but <hi>juſtifie himſelf;</hi> that is his ſtrength and
pleaſure in his dark harſh anguiſh, where he continually ſtirreth up the
fire in himſelfe; and flyeth out above the Thrones, and ſo <hi>holdeth</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſtill to be a Prince and King.</p>
                  <p>71. And though he be indeed Evil, yet he is a Prince in his Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the Anger in <hi>his Creature,</hi> but, With the Anger
without his Creature, he hath <hi>not</hi> power to Act;
therein he muſt abide as an impotent captive.</p>
                  <p>72. Thus underſtand the Life, in <hi>two</hi> forms, viz: <hi>one</hi> according to
the fire of Nature, and the <hi>other</hi> according to the fire of Light, which
fire bunreth in the Love, wherein the Noble Image of God appeareth or
ſhineth.</p>
                  <p>73. And we underſtand herein, that the willing of Man <hi>ſhould</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into Gods willing, and ſo he goeth, in Chriſts Death with Chriſts
ſoul, <hi>through Death</hi> into the Eternal Liberty of <hi>God</hi> into the light
Life; and<note n="*" place="margin">Col. 3. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>there he is in Christ with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>74. And the <hi>Third</hi> Form of Life is the outward Created Life from
or out of this world, viz: from the Sun, Stars, and Elements.</p>
                  <p>75. Which, Gods ſpirit, with or by the Spirit of the Great world,
<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 2. 7.</note>
                     <hi>to Adam breathed into his Nostrils,</hi> wherein then alſo he became an
outward ſoul, which moveth or ſwimmeth in the Bloud and Water,
and burneth in the outward kindled Fire, viz: in the warmth,</p>
                  <p>76. That ſame outward Life, ſhould not gripe into the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
in the Inward Life, alſo the Image ſhould <hi>not let in</hi> that into the
inward Light, which ſhineth through Death, and ſprouteth with its
power into the Eternal Liberty; for the outward Life, is <hi>onely</hi> a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
of the inward Life.</p>
                  <p>77. The Inward Spirit, ſhould onely, in the outward Looking-Glaſs,
<hi>open</hi> the Eternal Wonders, which in Gods wiſdome, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
diſcovered in the Abyſs in the divine <hi>Magia;</hi> and bring them

Gods honour, and to the Joy of the Inward Man, generated or Born
out of God.</p>
                  <p>78. But <hi>its will</hi> ſhould not go into it, to draw in the outward won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
into the Image; as we now with Lamentable Miſery know, that
Man, draweth in and Imageth to himſelf an <hi>Earthly treaſure</hi> into the
Mind, and ſo deſtroyeth the pure Image of God in the ſecond Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
                  <p>79. For, his willing-<hi>ſpirit,</hi> goeth into the Earthly Subſtance, and
bring th his <hi>Body,</hi> wherein the Image ſtandeth, into the Earthly <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi>
viz: into the Earthly Treaſure, into an Earthly Veſſel, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.</p>
                  <p>80. And now, the Image through the <hi>Imagination</hi> becometh alſo
Earthly, and goeth again into Death, and looſeth God and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven; for, his willing-ſpirit ſticketh with the Body in the

                  <p>81. And now the outward Life <hi>muſt die,</hi> and break or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
that the Created Image according to the Inward Kingdom may
appear and ſhine.</p>
                  <p>82. And thus the willing-ſpirit, ſticketh with the Body, in the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

                  </p>
                  <p>83. And there ſhall the willing-ſpirit go through the fire, and the

muſt be burned off from the Image, it muſt be pure

                  <p>84. As the Light ſubſiſteth in the Fire, ſo muſt willing-ſpirit

                  <head>The Sixth Chapter. What Luſt can do: How we are fallen in Adam,
and helped again in Chriſt: and how it is no

                  <p>1. THus we underſtand, that it lyeth in Luſt; that deſtruction or <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
is come out of the Luſt, and yet ſtill Cometh from <hi>thence</hi>
continually.</p>
                  <p>2. For Luſt is an Imagining, where the Imagination windeth or
<hi>inſinuateth</hi> it ſelf into all Forms of Nature, ſo that, they all become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
with the Thing, out of which, the Luſt exiſteth.</p>
                  <p>3. As then we underſtand, that the outward ſpirit of Man, which is
a <hi>fimilitude</hi> of the Inward hath luſted after the fair Image; and in that
regard ſet its Imagination into the Inward, whence the
inward is become<note n="*" place="margin">Affected or Tincted.</note> 
                     <hi>infected.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. And being it did <hi>not instantly</hi> feel the death, therefore, did it give
the ſpace and room to the outward in its willing-Spirit, and ſo the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is drawn into the Inward for a Lodging, and is at length become
the <hi>Host</hi> in the houſe, and hath obſcured or dimmed the inward, ſo that
the fair Image is <hi>diſappeared.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. There the Image fell among the Murderers, viz: among the <hi>stern</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>6. And now the <hi>Samaritan, Chriſt,</hi> was needful, and that is the Cauſe,
that God became Man.</p>

                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:61375:126"/>
7. If the <hi>wound</hi> or hurt could have been healed, by a word ſpeaking
or word forgiveneſs, God would <hi>not</hi> have become Man.</p>
                  <p>8. But God and Paradiſe were loſt, as alſo the Noble Image became
deſtroyed and made <hi>deſolate;</hi> and muſt be New-Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
or born out of God again.</p>
                  <p>9. And <hi>therefore</hi> came God with his word, which is the <hi>Center</hi> in
the Light-life, * <hi>and became Fleſh,</hi> ſo that the Soul gat a divine Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſical
habitation again; thus, to be underſtood.</p>
                  <p>10. That, as Adams Soul had opened the <hi>Door</hi> of the Fires Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and had let in the Earthly Eſſences; whoſe ſource or quality had
wound it ſelf into the Paradiſe-Image, and made the Image Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>11. So Gods Heart did <hi>ſet open</hi> the Doors of the Lights Eſſences,
and encompaſſed the ſoul with heavenly Fleſh, and ſo the Holy Fleſhes
Eſſences <hi>Imagined</hi> after the Image, after the ſouls Eſſences.</p>
                  <p>12. Thus now, the ſoul became impregnated again, ſo that it went
with its willing-ſpirit <hi>through</hi> the Death, into the Paradiſe-life.</p>
                  <p>13. And thence came the Temptation of Chriſt, that he became
Tempted, to <hi>try</hi> whether the Soul <hi>would Eat</hi> of the Word of the Lord,
whether it could enter through Death into Gods Life.</p>
                  <p>14. Which in the End became <hi>fulfilled</hi> on the Stock or Tree of the
Croſs, where Chriſts Soul, went through the fire of the fierce
wrath, through the ſtern ſource, through Death; and ſprouted forth
again into the <hi>Holy</hi> Paradiſe-world, <hi>in</hi> which Adam was Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>15. Thus are we Men become helped again, and it is neceſſary for
us, that we draw away our willing, <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and Mind, from all
Earthly things, and, <hi>turn them</hi> into Chriſts Suffering, Dying, Death,

                  <p>16. So that we continually <hi>Crucifie</hi> the Old Adam with Chriſts

Death, into a New Man; and ſprout into the life of God, <hi>elſe</hi> there is

                  <p>17. We muſt dye away to the Earthly willing in our willing, and
muſt continually become regenerated to the <hi>New world</hi> in Faith, in the

                  <p>35. For, as the Noble Image muſt ſubſiſt in the Fire, ſo alſo ſhould
that ſame Noble Image, rule through the whole Man, <hi>through</hi> all the
Three Principles, and rule and <hi>fill all</hi> with the Paradiſical ſource or
quality.</p>
                  <p>36. But ſince that cannot be at all, and that indeed the fleſh <hi>is</hi>

in the Faith, where truly the Earthly Life <hi>covereth</hi> the
right Life.</p>
                  <p>37. Therefore we muſt put on the right Garment, which is called
<hi>Hope,</hi> and ſet our willing into the Hope, and Continually Labour
upon the Tree of Faith, that it may bring forth its fruit, viz: the
<hi>ſaving</hi> amiable and bleſſed<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>Love towards God and its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>38. He ſhould do Good, not for his own ſake onely, but alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that he may <hi>Edifie</hi> and <hi>better</hi> his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61375:127"/>
with his Example and Life.</p>
                  <p>39. He ſhould Conſider, that he is a Tree in the Kingdom of God;
and that he muſt bear fruit to God, and grow in Gods <hi>field</hi> and ſoyl,
and that his fruits belong to Gods Table.</p>
                  <p>40. And that he ſhould conceive or compriſe his works and <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
in the right true Love, and Converſe and walk in Love, that he
may bring them into Gods Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>41. For, God is a Spirit, and Faith is <hi>alſo</hi> a Spirit or One Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in him, and God is in Chriſt Become Man, and the
Faiths Spirit, is <hi>alſo</hi> in Chriſt <hi>Generated</hi> or Born Man.</p>
                  <p>42. Thus the willing-ſpirit converſeth or walketh in God, for it is
<hi>ONE</hi> ſpirit with God, and worketh or co-worketh with God, <hi>divine
works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>43. And though it be ſo, that the Earthly Life covereth it, in, ſo
that<note n="*" place="margin">NOTE. NOTE.</note> 
                     <hi>he knoweth not his work</hi> which he hath
generated or born in the Faith, yet in the breaking
of the Earthly Body, it will be manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>44. For the Hope is its Chiſt or

                  <head>The Seaventh Chapter. To what End this World, and all Subſtances or
Things were Created. Alſo of the Two Eternal
Myſteries. Of the Mighty ſtrife in Man about
the Image: and wherein the Tree of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith ſtandeth Groweth and
beareth Fruit.</head>
                  <p>1. SEeing then that Man ſtandeth thus in a <hi>Threefold,</hi> Life, So there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is every Life a Myſtery or hidden <hi>Arcanum</hi> to the other, and
deſireth the other, to which <hi>End,</hi> this World, with all ſubſtances
or Things are become Created.</p>
                  <p>2. For, the divine ſubſtantiality deſireth the Looking Glaſs or <hi>Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,</hi>
for this world is a ſimilitude according to Gods being or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>3. And God is manifeſt in an Earthly ſimilitude, for the Wonders
of the <hi>Arcanum</hi> or hidden ſecreſie, <hi>might not</hi> be opened in the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
world, in the Love-Birth.</p>
                  <p>4. But in this world, where Love and Anger is <hi>mixed,</hi> therein is
a Twofold <hi>Genetrix,</hi> and <hi>there</hi> it might be.</p>
                  <p>5. For, all things originally ariſe out of the fire-Root, and yet were
<hi>encompaſſed</hi> with the Water of Meekneſs, ſo that it is an amiable or
lovely Subſtance or Being.</p>
                  <p>6. Yet, thus the Fire, became not known in the Angelical world, for
the Center of the <hi>Genetrix</hi> ſtandeth in the Light, and is the word
of God: and ſo the Wonders of Nature may not, otherwiſe, then in a
Spiritual <hi>Magia,</hi> become opened, that is, become <hi>ſeen</hi> in Gods wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>7. But ſeeing that ſame is <hi>almoſt</hi> incomprehenſibe to the Angels and
to the ſouls of Men; and yet God will be known in Angels and Men,
therefore the Angelical World luſteth or longeth after the Great
Wonders, to <hi>know</hi> them, which have from Eternity ſtood
in the wiſdom of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:61375:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And they became in the Earthly Similitude brought to ſubſtance in
<hi>Figures</hi> and Images, all according to the Eternal <hi>Eſſences</hi> of the Center
of Nature, that the Wonders may ſtand Eternally.</p>
                  <p>9. Yet not Eſſentially, but in <hi>Figures</hi> in Images, and ſimilitudes
in formings according to the willing, indeed Magically, but yet the
<hi>Genetrix</hi> is in the <hi>Center</hi> of the wonders.</p>
                  <p>10. For it hath once become awakened or raiſed out of the Fire, but
it will be again <hi>ſwallowed</hi> up into the Myſtery, and ſtandeth as a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Life.</p>
                  <p>11. Therefore ſhall all ſubſtances or <hi>things</hi> become manifeſt as in
ſhadows in the Angelical world, yet<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>thoſe onely</hi> which in Gods wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
have become introduced into the Myſtery.</p>
                  <p>12. For the Myſteries which are Eternal are <hi>two,</hi> as one in the Love
and one in the Anger: into which ſoever the willing-ſpirit with its
wonders entereth in, <hi>therein</hi> ſtandeth its work and Wonder.</p>
                  <p>13. So in like manner, we are to know, that alſo the outward vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
deſireth the Inward, for all <hi>runneth</hi> after the Center, viz: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Original, and deſireth the Liberty.</p>
                  <p>14. For in the fire of Nature, there is anguiſh and pain or ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
quality, therefore now will the Imaging or the <hi>Image</hi> of the
Meekneſs in the ſourcive quality of Love be free, and yet may not in
the ſourcive quality of the fiery Eſſences, be free, ſo long, till the ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
quality <hi>divideth</hi> it ſelf in the breaking, and there each paſſeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
its Myſtery.</p>
                  <p>15. In like manner will the fire be <hi>free</hi> from the water, for the water
is alſo the Fires Death, and it is alſo Myſtery to it.</p>
                  <p>16. And we ſee likewiſe hereby, how the water, holdeth the fire Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and yet <hi>no</hi> Dying is in the Fire, but it is onely a Myſtery in the
Fire.</p>
                  <p>17. As then may be ſeen, how it breaketh forth in the water, and
<note n="*" place="margin">Diſplayeth.</note>
                     <hi>openeth</hi> it ſelf, ſo that openeth it ſelf out of the Center of its own
<hi>Genetrix,</hi> as is to be ſeen in the Lighting and Tempeſt, alſo in a
Stone, which yet is <hi>water;</hi> may be known.</p>
                  <p>18. And yet we ſee eſpecially, how all forms of Nature deſire the
Light, for in that deſiring the <hi>Oyl</hi> becometh generated, wherein
the Light becometh known, for it originally ariſeth out of the <hi>Meekneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>19. Thus <hi>first,</hi> we are to know, our Life: that in us the Fires-Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſtandeth <hi>open,</hi> for the Life burneth in the Fire.</p>
                  <p>20. And then <hi>Secondly</hi> we are to, ponder and Conſider of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to Love, which in the word of Life originally ariſeth in the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
world, where the <hi>Heart</hi> of God with his deſiring ſtandeth towards
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61375:129"/>
us with his Imagining, and alſo <hi>draweth</hi> us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the divine Myſtery.</p>
                  <p>21. And then <hi>Thirdly;</hi> we are to Conſider the Magick Kingdom
of this world, which alſo burneth in us, and <hi>vehemently</hi> draweth us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
its wonders; for it willeth to be manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>22. And Man is become Created therein to that End, that he <hi>ſhould</hi>
manifeſt that ſame Myſtery, and to bring the Wonders to Light, and
into <hi>forms</hi> according to the Eternal wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>23. Now then ſeeing he is to do this, and that he thus burneth in a
<hi>Threefold</hi> fire, therefore, the right Spirit, in which the Angelical Image
ſticketh, hath great wearineſs, and is in great <hi>danger,</hi> for it wandereth
upon a very ſmal Bridge.</p>
                  <p>24. For, it hath <hi>two</hi> Enemies, which continually draw it, each
would be in the Image, and bring its ſourcive quality thereinto, as, viz:
the <hi>Inward</hi> fire, and alſo the <hi>outward</hi> Fire, the inward Kingdom of the
fierce wrath, and alſo the outward Earthly Kingdom of the Looking-Glaſs;
and thus the right Image ſticketh in the Midſt in the<note n="*" place="margin">Quetzung.</note> Squee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
Preſs.</p>
                  <p>25. For the Inward Kingdom, <hi>will,</hi> through the outward, open the
Wonders.</p>
                  <p>26. But being it is too ſharp, therefore the outward Kingdom <hi>fleeth</hi>
away before the Inward, and graſpeth after the Midlemoſt, viz: after
the Image, which ſtandeth in the Liberty of God, and ſo fleeth and
<hi>ſlippeth</hi> it ſelf into the Image for it all graſpeth after the Heart of God,
that is, after the Center of the Kingdom of Joy.</p>
                  <p>27. Therefore now it is neceſſary for the Image, that it <hi>defend</hi> it
ſelfe, and not let in the Earthly Gueſt, much leſs fiery; and yet becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
generated cut of <hi>Both,</hi> viz: out of the fire, the Life; and out of the
outward, the Wonder.</p>
                  <p>28. Therefore it is highly neceſſary for Mans Image, that he lead
<note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 8.</note>a ſober temperate life, and not fill himſelf
with the outward Kingdom, for elſe it maketh an indvvelling in the
Noble Image.</p>
                  <p>29. And vve underſtand herein, the mighty ſtrife in Man about the
Image of God; for there are <hi>Three</hi> that ſtrive about it, as <hi>firſt,</hi> the
ſtern ſtrong fire-Life; and then <hi>Secondly</hi> the divine Life; and then
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Earthly Life; and ſo the Noble Image ſticketh in the
midſt, and is drawn of Three.</p>
                  <p>30. Now it is neceſſary for it, that it hide it ſelfe with the Faith in
the Myſtery of Hope, and <hi>ſtand ſtill</hi> in that ſame Myſtery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="233" facs="tcp:61375:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
31. Where then the Devil in the inward fire-life, continually rideth
forth into the <hi>outward</hi> earthly life, in pride Covetouſneſs and falſhood
or wickedneſs over the Noble Image; and would introduce it into the
fire, and <hi>anguiſh</hi> life, and break or deſtroy it.</p>
                  <p>32. For, he ſuppoſeth continually, that the place of <hi>this world</hi> is his
Kingdom, he will ſuffer no nother Image therein.</p>
                  <p>33. Now thereupon the Noble Image, falleth into the Croſs and
<hi>Tribulation</hi> into anguiſh and neceſſity, &amp; here there belongeth ſtrife to
it, to fight for the Noble <hi>victorious</hi> Crown or Garland, of Gods Image.</p>
                  <p>34. And hence originally ariſeth <hi>Prayer,</hi> ſo that the Image
continually goeth forth out of the introduced Earthly ſubſtance or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and alſo out of the proud ſtately helliſh abominations, with the
<hi>Prayer;</hi> and continually Entereth into Gods <hi>life</hi> into his Love.</p>
                  <p>35. And thus the right Image continually killeth the Earthly Adam,
and alſo the helliſh pride and ſtate of the Devil, and muſt alwaies ſtand
as a <hi>Champion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>36. And it is moſt neceſſary of all for it, that it ſhould inſinuate it
ſelf into <hi>Patience,</hi> and Caſt it ſelf under the Croſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
Spring or flow up into the Love.</p>
                  <p>37. For, that is its <hi>Sword;</hi> wherewith it ſlayeth the Devil, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
forth the Earthly ſubſtance, it hath <hi>no other</hi> ſword, wherewith to
defend it ſelf, then the <hi>Meek water</hi> of the Eternal Life, and that, the
proud ſtately fierce wrathful Spirit reliſheth not; for it is his poyſon,
and he fleeth before it.</p>
                  <p>38. Now if we will rightly demonſtrate the <hi>Tree</hi> of Chriſtian <hi>Faith,</hi>
then we ſay: Its Root, ſtandeth in the Myſtery of the <hi>Hope,</hi> its Sprouting
ſtandeth in the <hi>Love,</hi> and its Body in the<note n="*" place="margin">Or Reception</note> Comprehenſion of <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>39. That is, where the Image, through its earneſt deſiring, preſſeth
into the love of God, and, comprehendeth or <hi>attracteth</hi> the Subſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
of God, that is, <hi>Chriſts Body;</hi> that is now the <hi>Corpus</hi> or Body,
wherein the Tree, ſtandeth, groweth, floriſheth and bringeth forth fruits
in Patience, which all belong in, to the Angelical world.</p>
                  <p>40. They are the Souls food, wherein it eateth and refreſheth or
quicken its fiery Life, ſo that it is tranſmuted or changed into the <hi>Light</hi>
or Meekneſs.</p>
                  <p>41. And thus the Tree groweth in the Paradiſe of God, which the
Outward Man<note n="†" place="margin">Note the <hi>Outward</hi> MAN, nor Reaſon, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the not the Tree of Faith.</note> 
                     <hi>knoweth not,</hi> and
Reaſon apprehendeth it not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:61375:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
42. But, to the Noble Image, it is very well to be known, <hi>that</hi> will
then when the outward life breaketh, be manifeſt, and all its works fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
after it in the Myſtery of <hi>Hope,</hi> into which it hath ſown.</p>
                  <p>43. Therefore ſhould <hi>none,</hi> who will travail in the Path of Gods

                  <p>30. Eſpecially, if Reaſon looketh after the <hi>Courſe</hi> of this World, and

                  </p>
                  <p>37. And though the fair Tree, ſtandeth very clearly in the inward

                     <hi>is as fooliſhneſs to it;</hi> for it cannot apprehend it.</p>
                  <p>38. And though it be ſo, that often the <hi>holy ſpirit</hi> openeth it ſelf in
the outward Looking-Glaſs, ſo that the outward life highly rejoyceth
