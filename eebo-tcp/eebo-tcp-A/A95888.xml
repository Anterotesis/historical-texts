         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of what I have thus fairly and faithfully atteſted of him; It pleaſed the

&amp; ere he was (as the Proverb is) hardly warm in the ſeat of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,

which followed mee from the Mount) beaten out of the work, and
driven to a moſt ſhamefull retreat, leaving the bodies of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
dead upon the place; many of their Souldiers killed and
wounded. Whereupon, on the ſaid 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> my Lord Generall
called a Councell of warre, where it was reſolved for us to iſſue forth,
and to beat them out of their next workes approaching to ours. The

marching along, about nine of the clock that morning, toward the
enemies line of approach, on every ſide, the enemy abandoning one
work after another, untill wee had made our ſelves maſters of their
Ordnance. But, as the Sun (in its greateſt brightneſs) is ſubject to
Eclipſes: ſo it fell out with us at this time; for, the forwardneſs and
violence of our ſouldiers was abated by about an hundred pikes of the
enemie, who charging the Van of our foot, ſcatter'd and drave us back
again, even ſo, as that they regained their Ordnance, and enforced us
all to a ſhamef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

either taken priſoner, or killed dead, and ſo fallen into ſome ditch,

head quarter: Whereupon wee turned the two laſt pieces, now taken
by us, upon this bodie of their armie, and thereupon they were all
inſtantly forced to a moſt wretched retreat, and to ſtand at a diſtance
untill wee had ſleighted their whole line of approach, and then wee
brought off nine pieces of Ordnance, the Demy-Cannon, aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,

notice when he was at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

come into <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> under the command of <hi>Generall Henderſon,</hi>
and that upon the retreat of Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
from about <hi>Lowth,</hi> they were much heightned with confidence

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gement.
The want of foot and Dragooneers made Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
<hi>Cromwell</hi> very unwilling to fight with them; till they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
my Lord, and tryed what ſupplies he could afford them;
and withall his Lordſhip was aſſured (if he could draw any forces
toward <hi>Balenbrook-Caſtle,</hi> the enemy was ſo confident of his own
ſtrength) that he would bring down all his force to fight with him.
Upon theſe grounds my Lord drew all his forces both horſe and foot
from <hi>Linne,</hi> ſave onely one troop of horſe and ſix companies of foot,
which he left for the guard of that Town with Colonell <hi>Walton,</hi>
whom he made Lievtenant-Governour.</p>
            <p>Thus, upon the <hi>Munday,</hi> my Lord drew out all his foot out of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi>
ten Companies he laid in <hi>Bolenbrook-Town,</hi> under the command
of Major <hi>Knight,</hi> Serjeant Major to Sir <hi>Miles Hobart;</hi> Colonell <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells</hi>

to <hi>Hull,</hi> and left at <hi>Linne</hi>) at <hi>Stickney,</hi> and the horſe were all quarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the Townes round about, at eight and ten miles diſtance.</p>
            <p>Upon this <hi>Munday</hi> at night, Major <hi>Knight</hi> ſummoned the Caſtle
of <hi>Bolenbrook</hi> in my Lord of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

That his bug-bear words muſt not winne Caſtles, nor ſhould make
them quit the place; that night, our men took in a little houſe on
the right hand between the Caſtle and the Church, and reſolved the
next night to endeavour to break-open the Church-doores, and there
to mount a Morter-piece, and thence fire the Caſtle. The enemie had
notice on the <hi>fryday</hi> following,<note place="margin">The enemie prepares to meet and fight with the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter.</hi>
               </note> that my Lord was coming, or come

from their ſeverall Garriſons, at <hi>Lincoln, Newark</hi> and <hi>Gainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borow,</hi>
with a bold reſolution to finde him out and fight with him.
Upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> thoſe of the Caſtle kill'd one or two of our men; and
as Major <hi>Knight</hi> and Quarter-maſter Generall <hi>Vermeyden</hi> were view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, made ſome ſhot at them, and one of them hit the ſaid Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-maſter
Generall a little below the ancle, but pierced not the skin,
onely bruis'd his leg.</p>
            <p>That afternoon, my Lord of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> came himſelf to <hi>Kirkby,</hi>
which is within a mile of <hi>Bolenbrook,</hi> with Colonell <hi>Cromwell,</hi> where
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:113334:25"/>
alſo my Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> met him,<note place="margin">Our forces are drawn all neer each other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Bolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook.</hi>
               </note> and Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> was then
at <hi>Horn-Caſtle,</hi> about five miles off, one of his Regiments having the
watch at <hi>Edlingſton,</hi> about three miles farther, but neerer to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.
My Lord had not been long there before he received a Letter
from Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> that an allarm was given to ſome of our
Quarters, and that himſelf had ſent out ſome horſe to diſcover what
it might be, and would immediately give him a farther account,
which he did by another Letter, about an houre after, the partie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
returned and could get no information of any enemy neer, but
conceived it to be a miſtake. However, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> reſolved to ſtay
there untill the evening, and then to come to <hi>Kirkby</hi> to my Lord.
My Lord conceived it fit, and ſo did all thoſe that were with him,
to give the allarm to all his quarters, and to appoint <hi>Horn-Caſtle</hi> to
be the Allarm-place, and then to goe himſelf, immediately, thither
to Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> and when all their men were thus drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to take farther reſolutions; and ſo, immediately, with my Lo.
<hi>Willoughby,</hi> and ſome Officers with him, he took horſe for <hi>Horn-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi>
Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> in the mean time, getting no intelligence of
the enemies approach, came away toward <hi>Kirkby</hi> to my Lord.</p>
            <p>Before my Lord had reached <hi>Horn-Caſtle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The enemie gives ours the allarm, about <hi>Horncaſtle.</hi>
               </note> the allarm came to him
in good earneſt, that the enemie was fallen into our quarters, and was
marching toward <hi>Horn-Caſtle.</hi> Coming neerer the Town he could
hear great ſhouting and noyſe, which he conceived to be the enemies
triumph, having beaten our men out of the Town; but it proved o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe;
for,<note place="margin">Ours bravely bicker with the enemies forlorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopes.</note> ſome of our men falling upon the enemies forlorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopes,
though (but part of two troopes) ſeeing themſelves deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
engaged, reſolved to put the beſt face on it, and fell upon them
with crying and ſhouting, which did exceedingly amaze the enemie,
and gave our men the eaſier paſſage through the midſt of them. Now,
my Lord finding the enemie come into his quarters before he could
have any certain information where he was, and the allarm-place
poſſeſſed by the enemie, he appointed <hi>Kirkby</hi> and <hi>Bolenbrook-hill,</hi> for
all his men to repair unto; and accordingly ſent word to all the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
whither all our men came but that night, except three troopes
that were directed to <hi>Stickney,</hi> and three or four troopes that went by
the way of <hi>Totterſhall,</hi> and came not in till next morning. Many of
our troopes came to <hi>Horn-Caſtle,</hi> according to the firſt orders, but
finding the enemie there, came away without any loſs at all or very
little. The enemie had fallen into our quarters at <hi>Thimbleby</hi> and ſome

Townes thereabout,<note place="margin">Three or four of our troopes in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

manner ſurprized, but, finding themſelves ingaged, gave ſo good teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and proof of their courage and reſolution, that the enemie had
little or no cauſe to brag of that nights work, which being of ſo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
conſequence, I have thought fit briefly heer to relate, which
was thus: Captain <hi>Johnſon,</hi> Captain <hi>Samuel Moody,</hi> and Captain
<hi>Player,</hi> were three of the commanders of theſe troopes which the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
had thus almoſt ſurprized in their quarters, and were afterward
alſo environed about by the enemie,<note place="margin">Cap. <hi>Iohnſons,</hi> Cap. <hi>Moodies,</hi> and Captain <hi>Players</hi> brave courage and reſolution.</note> who had gotten between them
and the bodie of their horſe: ſo that they were forced to break
through two bodies of the enemies horſe, of at leaſt a thouſand horſe
in each body; but with admirable courage and reſolution, they with
their troopes charged the enemy, crying all of them (as before they
had agreed among themſelves) with a ſhout and loud voyce; <hi>Come
on, come on, all is our own, all is our own;</hi> which ſo amazed the enemie,
expecting ſome ambuſcado, that theſe three troopes brake thorow
the firſt bodie, and ſo thorow the ſecond, doing great execution, yet
loſt but three men. After that, they haſting toward the Town of
<hi>Horncaſtle</hi> (where they thought the Earl of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ncheſter</hi> was) about a
mile before they came at the Town, they diſcovered another partie
of the enemies horſe.<note place="margin">The comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders notable diſcretion and courage.</note> Heer, they diſcreetly agreed to goe ſoberly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them, every man making anſwer to him that asked any queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nothing but <hi>Friends, friends,</hi> all <hi>friends,</hi> as if they had been of the
enemies troopes, and were going upon ſome deſign, it being, yet, dark;
therefore when the enemies called to them, <hi>Who is there,</hi> the other
all anſwered, <hi>Friends, friends,</hi> and ſo they paſſed, but as ſoon as they
were paſt, and thought themſelves ſecure, they turned faces about,
and asked the enemie, <hi>Who are you for?</hi> They anſwered, <hi>for the King.</hi>
Then, ſaid they, <hi>Wee are for the King and Parliament,</hi> and charging
the enemy, fled toward <hi>Horncaſtle,</hi> and the enemy purſuing, followed
them to the Town-ſide, there being no forces in the Town on either
ſide;<note place="margin">The great ſtrait they were ſtill put unto.</note> but they in the Town, had with carts and timber, barracadoed
the paſſages into the Town, ſo that by this meanes there was ſome
loſs in the troopes, being thus unexpectedly put to their ſhifts; but
the loſs was but little, a Cornet and ſome few others, and they
brought half a douzen of priſoners with them. Which could not
but manifeſt a moſt evident hand of God in ſo great a preſervation.
But to proceed.</p>
            <p>All that night wee were drawing our horſe to the appointed ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouz;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:113334:26"/>
And the next morning being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> my Lord gave order
that the whole force both horſe and foot, ſhould be drawn up to <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenbrook-hill,</hi>
where he would expect the enemie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bolenbrockhill</hi> deſigned to be the place to fight.</note> being the onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
ground to fight with him; But Colonell <hi>Cromwell</hi> was no way
ſatisfied that wee ſhould fight, our horſe being extremely wearied
with hard duty two or three dayes together.</p>
            <p>The enemy alſo drew (that morning) their whole body of horſe
and Dragooneers into the field,<note place="margin">The enemies ſtrength and ours.</note> being 74 Colours of horſe, and 21
Colours of Dragooneers, in all 95 Colours. Wee had not many more
than half ſo many Colours of horſe and Dragooneers, but I believe
wee had as many men, beſides our foot, which indeed could not be
drawn up untill it was very late;<note place="margin">The word on both ſides.</note> The enemies word was <hi>Cavendiſh,</hi>
and ours was, <hi>Religion.</hi> I beleeve that as wee had no notice of the
enemies coming toward us; ſo they had as little of our preparation
to fight with them. It was about twelve of the clock ere our horſe and
Dragooneers were drawn up; after that wee marched about a mile
nearer the enemie,<note place="margin">Both armies in ſight of each other.</note> and then wee began to deſcry him by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
coming toward us. But untill this time wee did not know wee
ſhould fight, but ſo ſoon as our men had knowledge of the enemies
coming, they were very full of joy and reſolution, thinking it a great

            <p>And that which addes extraordinarie luſtre to the honour of our

            <p>About the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1643. came Letters from <hi>Glouceſter</hi> to
<hi>London,</hi> with moſt credible intelligence, that the truly valiant and

This noble and moſt vigilant Colonell being very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to be rid of ſuch unfriendly and unruly neighbours, ſpeedily
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:113334:27"/>
and privately drew forth a conſiderable partie of horſe and foot from
<hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and marched with them to <hi>Tewksbery,</hi> where he ſodainly
and reſolutely fell upon the enemie, ſlew above 30 of them, took ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
priſoners, and forced the reſt to flie for their lives, ſome of whom,
were in that their haſtie flight, drowned in the river <hi>Severn.</hi> He alſo
took many of their horſes and armes, moſt of their pickaxes, ſpades,

like ſo many prey-devouring Wolves, or Sheep-biting miſchievous
Maſtives; and having, thus, moſt ſucceſsfully demoliſhed their works,
he returned again victoriouſly to <hi>Glouceſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much alſo about the ſame time came certain intelligence by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

there came a conſiderable partie of them in the midſt of the night into

haſtily ſleighted their workes, (as by credible information was rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
and ſpeedily quitted the place, and fled away thence to <hi>Newark.</hi>
And very ſhortly after this moſt noble and renowned Lord having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

(maugre all the oppoſition of <hi>Newcaſtles</hi> viperous papiſticall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
from thoſe devouring <hi>Cormorants,</hi> and hideous <hi>Harpyes,</hi> which

his God, who made him ſo victorious, and pray for the perfecting
of this his ſo pious and honourable reſolution.</p>
            <p>And heer now good Reader, give me leave to tell thee, or rather
to remember thee of what thou knewſt too well before,<note place="margin">The great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign againſt the Citie of <hi>London.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> That the
moſt famous and ever to be honoured Citie of <hi>London,</hi> being the main,
if not the onely white and mark of the inveterate malice and envie of
the <hi>Oxonian Court-Achitophels</hi> and atheiſticall and <hi>Popiſh Cormorants</hi>

and mightie <hi>Stone</hi> in the way of their miſchievouſly intended <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall
Monarchie</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Hierarchie,</hi> which muſt be removed, or
els all their whole work muſt needs be fruitleſs and frivolous. Now
therefore having graſped ſuch a handfull of the Kingdome in the
<hi>Weſtern</hi> parts thereof, and having, as they hoped (but falſly, praiſed
be God) gotten good hold on the <hi>Northern</hi> parts of the Kingdome
too; Now, I ſay, they began to knock all their heads and hearts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
on the anvill of their utmoſt <hi>Jeſuiticall</hi> Councells, ſeeing <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
to be ſo great a goad in their ſides, and ſuch a ſtrong bolt and
obſtacle in the way of their high deſignes, and that it was impoſſible
to be maſtred by any of their preſent might or immediate aſſaults.
This therefore was the main and great deſign,<note place="margin">The great plot and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne was how to contrive to ſtarve up the Citie of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

diſabling them in money and armes, hindring, thus, all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
to and from the Citie, and thus alſo ſtopping all kinde of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
to be brought to it; and then the <hi>Iriſh Rebells</hi> (or deluded <hi>Iriſh

help forward this great and main deſigne, and then to ſhare and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the plunder, the honours and lands both of <hi>London, England,</hi>

            <p>Now the manner of the beginning and ſetting this deſigne on foot,

adviſed to ſtay at home in peace, and not to ſhew themſelves in any

of <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> Souldiers. This noble Colonell willing to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
thoſe Worthies, drew part of his forces from <hi>Namptwich</hi> to ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard

I have heer thought fit for the Readers better ſatisfaction and
more full content, to ſet down as they came from ſingular good hands,
which were as follow.</p>
            <p>1. That whiles wee quartered at <hi>Drayton,</hi> as wee were on our March
to aſſiſt Sir <hi>Thomas Midleton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Divers rare paſſages of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our forces in this defeat.</note> and the reſt; when there came with all

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s; they were
all repelled and beaten back again, by onely a partie of thirtie or fortie
horſe and Dragooneers, commanded by Captain <hi>Munck,</hi> there being
divers of them ſlain, and the reſt purſued by our horſe many miles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Shrewsbery;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Thirty or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our horſe and Dragoons chaſe and beat a thouſand of their horſe.</note> at which time ſome of Major <hi>Bromhalls</hi> men were
taken priſone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, ſome ſlain and ſome wounded; and one <hi>Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rge Cook</hi>
a very valiant man of Sir <hi>William Breretons</hi> own troop was ſlain, and
one <hi>Peter Anlet,</hi> another of them taken priſoner, but afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed.</p>
            <p>2. That wee were not interrupted in our march to <hi>Wem</hi> all the
next day, nor diſquieted or diſturbed there during ſix or ſeven dayes,
untill wee had made ſome works of defence, which though they were
then but ſleight and weak, yet were of ſome encouragement and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to our men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:113334:35"/>
3. That when they had made mightie preparation to hinder us in
our fortification at <hi>Wem,</hi> and that notwithſtanding all the forces they
could make, united into a bodie (which were ſaid to conſiſt of three
or foure thouſand, which quartered within three or foure miles of
<hi>Wem</hi>) yet that they ſhould and did receive interruption by two or
three Companies of our Dragooneers, who were quartered at <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pington,</hi>
a little village about two miles from <hi>Wem,</hi> who hearing of the
enemies approach, betook themſelves to the protection of the Church
and Churchyard, which they did moſt valiantly maintain a long
time, untill by the multitudes of the enemies encompaſſing them, they
were enforced to betake themſelves onely to the Church, where they
behaved themſelves ſo valiantly, as that their enemies could not take
the Church, untill they fired the porch &amp; roof of the Church, which
were covered with ſhingles, by which meanes ſome of our men were
almoſt ſuffocated and ſtifled, ſo as they were conſtrained to deliver up
themſelves priſoners, though wee ſpeedily reſcued many of them.
Our Souldiers, then, wounded, were, Major <hi>Spotſwood,</hi> and Captain
<hi>Daughtie</hi> (ſince reported to be dead) and one other Captain wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and their Cannonier wounded or ſlain, and their whole armie
was repulſed by leſs than 200 foot and 300 horſe of ours, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
from <hi>Wem</hi> to the relief of our men in the Church, ſo ſoon as they
heard the enemies Cannon play, and our horſe purſued and routed
them, ſo as they left one of their Cannons within our power, but by
reaſon of the darkneſſe of the night wee knew not thereof, nor could
we ſee to purſue them, the lanes being narrow and hedges thick. They
took Major <hi>Bromhall</hi> priſoner, and we took Maſter <hi>Needham</hi> the Lord
Vicount <hi>Kilmurreys</hi> ſonne priſoner. If they had then come on to <hi>Wem</hi>
they had found the Town very weak and naked, and much leſs able
(in reſpect of the workes) to make reſiſtance and defence, than when
they did make their violent aſſault upon tueſday and wedneſday 17.
and 18. <hi>October.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. That betwixt the firſt and ſecond aſſault, (at which time, they
were much more encouraged by the increaſe of their ſtrength from
<hi>Litchfield, Dudley, Worceſter,</hi> and ſome from the Kings armie) and when
their forces were all united, and in readineſſe: The Lord in his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and goodneſs was pleaſed ſo to order as that there were many
interruptions, and diverſions, which occaſioned their delay, as want
of cariages, and ſteering their courſe toward us and aſſaulting <hi>Nampt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi>
on purpoſe to withdraw the <hi>Cheſhire</hi> forces out of <hi>Wem,</hi> during
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:113334:35"/>
which intermiſſion wee made good uſe of our time in <hi>Wem</hi> to perfect
the workes.</p>
            <p>5. That when they all came againſt <hi>Namptwich</hi> upon Munday
<hi>October</hi> 16. they were ſo confident of ſurprizing the ſame (as that the
Lord <hi>Capell</hi>) (as it is reported) returned backe all the <hi>Cheſter</hi> horſe
which were tendered unto him and coming to his aſſiſtance, returning
this anſwer, That he had ſtrength ſufficient to take <hi>Namptwich,</hi> to
which end he did ſpeedily (and that before notice was given of his
approach) ſeize upon and poſſeſſe himſelfe of <hi>Acton</hi> Church, and <hi>Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
houſe, and attempted to force their paſſage by the way of Beame-bridge,
but by the valour of thoſe few men who were left in the Town
they were repulſed from paſſing the water, not without the loſſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of their men: Foure whereof were found dead in the ditch, thoſe
that attempted to undermine the walls in the darkneſſe of the night
were taken priſoners, and this night, and the next morning there were
neer forty priſoners taken, beſides many horſes and armes, and many
of their men run away: And upon the newes of our approach to their
reliefe, they ſent away their carriages, and marched after them with
ſpeed towards <hi>Wem.</hi> This was the fift time they did come before and
attempt this poore Town of <hi>Namptwich,</hi> which the Lord hath mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly
preſerved and defended, and returned them alwayes backe
with ſhame and diſhonour.</p>
            <p>6. That whilſt the <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Souldiers continued in <hi>Wem,</hi> (which
were about 500 Musketteers, beſides horſe) the enemy did forbeare
to make any attempt againſt the Town, but were repulſed and beaten
off with great loſs, by a far leſſe number than the third part of thoſe
who were commanded out of the Town, and gone to relieve <hi>Nampt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
as though the Lord judged all too many, and preferred rather
to deliver them by <hi>Gideons</hi> three hundred, to whom the whole glory
of this deliverance, is to be attributed and aſcribed.</p>
            <p>7. The unparalleld magnanimity, reſolution, and dexterity of
thoſe young Souldiers, who were not in any ſervice (except ſome of
them in that skirmiſh at <hi>Lappington</hi>) before they were ingaged in this
ſiege at <hi>Wem,</hi> whoſe courageous ſpirits were ſo ſupported, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
beyond themſelves, as did much admire and daunt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
there being no ſuch thing expreſſed as any deſire or willingneſſe
to entertain or embrace the motion of a parley or treaty with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
ſeeming all to be as of one mind, reſolved to fight and ſtand it out
to the laſt man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:113334:36"/>
8. The great ſlaughter and execution which was performed upon
the enemy when they ſet upon <hi>Wem,</hi> there being ſix cart loads of dead
men carried away at one time, (beſides the wounded) and, as it is ſaid,
there were fifteen found buried in one grave, neer the Town-workes,
and divers were ſeen dead, and ſtripped, lying upon the ground the
next day. And that little execution which was done upon our men,
whereof we loſt not above three in the Town, Major <hi>Marrow,</hi> and
one Souldier, and one boy, and we had very few others hurt.</p>
            <p>9. The qualitie of the perſons ſlain or wounded, even ſuch as were
moſt eminent or conſiderable. Col. <hi>Win</hi> certainly ſlain, his Major
<hi>Vaughan</hi> wounded in the ribs; one of <hi>Winters</hi> Captain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſhot in the back;
Captain <hi>Daviſon</hi> taken priſoner, ſince dead; Captain <hi>Francis Manley</hi>
ſhot in the leg; Captain <hi>Ellis</hi> of <hi>Oſweſtray</hi> wounded, ſome ſay ſlain.
Captain <hi>Jones</hi> ſlain, as ſome ſay; Colonell <hi>Scriven</hi> ſlightly wounded;
Sir <hi>Richard Willis,</hi> Major <hi>Trercon,</hi> and Major <hi>Braughton</hi> wounded, as
ſome report, the certainty I cannot affirme; their Cannoneer ſhot in
the leg; Captain <hi>Chapman</hi> taken priſoner, who was Captain Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to Colonell <hi>Woodhouſe,</hi> exchanged for Captain <hi>Zanchie;</hi> Captain
Lievtenant <hi>Smith,</hi> a Papiſt, who was Captain Lievtenant to Sir <hi>Rich:
Willis;</hi> Colonell <hi>Scrivens</hi> Captain Lievtenant taken priſoner; a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of good quality ſhot in the back at <hi>Leighi-bridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. The various circumſtances of admiration which happened du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the fight, wherein the Lords hand is much to be acknowledged.</p>
            <p>Firſt, One of their great Cannons or Morter-pieces (or both as it
is reported) brake with the firſt ſhot, ſure I am that part of the carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of one or both of them was broken and left in the lane.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The mighty execution which our Cannon did upon the
enemies, whereas their Cannon and Morterpiece, though diſcharged,
did no execution at all, having (as it ſhould ſeem) no commiſſion
from heaven, to touch any of thoſe that fought the Lords battail.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A Cannon diſcharged in the night by Col. <hi>Mittons</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
intended to give Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> and his Souldiers, who were
marching, warning, that the Town was not taken, and onely levelled
at one of the enemies fires, (as ſome report) diſmounted one of the
enemies Cannons, wounded their Cannoneer in the knee or leg.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, A barrell of powder was blown up, which burned or
wounded 15 of their men, whereof 12 dyed.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The confeſſions and acknowledgements which the Lord
extorted out of the mouthes of ſome dying men, as it is reported of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:113334:36"/>
Colonell <hi>Winter,</hi> that he ſhould reply to ſome (who were lamenting
their misfortune to be repulſed by a few) that there were more with
them in the Town than againſt them, for God was with them, and
divers other expreſſions to the like purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Others confidently report, that one of their Cannons ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
fire twice or thrice, yet could they not procure the ſame to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,
wherewith they were much amazed, and did draw off their
pieces and retreated.</p>
            <p>All this, I thought fit, heer, thus particularly to relate, as a juſt and
rare monument of Gods power and providence in thus taking the
proud and ſelf-conceited wickedly wiſe ones of this world, in their
own accurſed craftineſs, and ſtill (as hath been clearly ſeen and
ſhewen all along in this narration) making good and ratifying to the
full,<note place="margin">Pſal. 62. 9, 10.</note> that of the holy Prophet <hi>David,</hi> an excellent place, appliable moſt
fitly to the vain and prophane enemies of Gods truth in theſe our
dayes; <hi>Surely, men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a
lie; to be laid in the ballance they are altogether lighter than vanity. Truſt
not therefore in oppreſſion, and become not vain in robberie.</hi> But to
goe on.</p>
            <p>About the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this inſtant <hi>November,</hi>

There is one thing which may ſtick as a doubt with ſome that
reade this Commiſſion, which is not cleared by that Gentleman, that
hath obſerved well upon <hi>The Myſierie of Iniquitie:</hi> viz. <hi>That the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
have poſſeſſed themſelves of the whole ſtrength of the ſaid Kingdome in
appointing Governours, Commanders and Officers in all parts and places
therein:</hi> It may be objected, There was no ſuch thing done when the
Commiſſion bore date. It is anſwered: The <hi>Parliament</hi> even at that
time, and two moneths before, were a nominating fit perſons to be
preſented to his Majeſtie, to be entruſted with the places of ſtrength
within the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>But for further obſervations upon this Commiſſion, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
of the truth thereof (for works <hi>in tenebris</hi> muſt come to light
by circumſtances) be pleaſed to read the Booke, entituled, <hi>The Myſtery
of Iniquitie,</hi> where this Commiſſion is at large ſet down, and you will
finde <hi>Endymion Porter</hi> had the great Seal of <hi>Scotland</hi> in his cuſtody

            <p>But ſee now (as was touched before) how the moſt wiſe God gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly

                  <p>SInce my laſt unto you of the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1643. the enemie hath
preſſed hard upon us againſt <hi>Mount Stamford</hi> workes, with their
great Ordnance,<note place="margin">A proper note, and fitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</note> and began to play againſt the ſame on the Sabbath day laſt,
being the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> hoping by that means to perform what the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
plot of the <hi>Popiſh-Gunpowder-Treaſon</hi> ſhould have done: They play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo hard againſt it all that day with batteries (and it being not any way
made to endure the ſame) that ſome of our Guns they diſmounted, and ſome
clogged with earth which fell upon them, ſo as wee could not make uſe of any
of them; in ſo much that on the morrow they ſurrounded the Worke, fell on
with all their ſtrength of Horſe and Foot upon all quarters: yet the chiefe
Commander of the Fort behaved himſelfe ſo bravely, that three times he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them to retreat; and could wee have got any indifferent reliefe over the
Water in any reaſonable time, wee had kept the Fort. Yet nevertheleſſe the
Enemy ſent a Parley three times before the Captain would accept of it.
Then conditions were made, That all Souldiers ſhould march away with
their Armes, flying Colours, and Bullet in their mouths; and that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſhould have any one piece of Ordnance away, that he would make choice
of. The Enemy loſt foure or five Captaines before the Fort, beſides divers
other Officers, and many Souldiers. Wee loſt at that time no Officer of note,
onely one Lievtenant killed with a great ſhot, and divers Souldiers taken
priſoners, which were all exchanged the next day, for ſome of their own men
that we had formerly taken. I beleeve they will not brag much of their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
by getting that Worke, for wee are now better and in more ſafety in the
Towne than before. For wee were forced to keepe a Leager there, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
to relieve them; ſo that our men were forced to very hard duty, to keepe
all the other Workes and Fortifications belonging to the Towne. The Enemy
having the Worke yeelded to them, thoſe of the Enemies party in the Towne
(as it muſt be expected in all places are ſome) began to get courage, our own
friends doubtfull; and I believe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>traliſts do deſire that the Towne
might be delivered up: Whereupon, for feare either of the treachery of
the Towneſmen, or for want of experienced men, I ſeized the Fort and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:113334:41"/>
the Caſtle and Magazine, that in caſe the Towne ſhould be forced and
over-powered with ſtrength by the Enemy, and knowing this place of ſuch
great concernment, that through Gods aſſiſtance I would keepe them till ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
and reliefe come. Whereupon I have put them into the hands of ſuch
as will keepe them for the King and Parliament, with the laſt drop of bloud
in their bodies. Our friends began then to be incouraged, our enemies both
within and without us to be diſmayed, thinking that there was no hope of
ſurrendring the Towne: ſo ever ſince, the Townſmen and all Inhabitants
have been more forward to contribute their beſt aſſiſtance than formerly many
have done. And upon Thurſday laſt after Prayer and our mornings beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for the ſame, my ſelfe and Mr. Major, took a Vow and Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which I have here ſent incloſed, and cauſed it to be preſented to all Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

all Officers and Souldiers, and all Inhabitants whatſoever; which I finde
was generally taken with great joy and cheerefulneſſe. I hope the honourable
Houſes of Parliament are not unmindfull of us; yet I never received any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions

                  <p>THat I may give you an account of our proceedings at <hi>Thurland,</hi>
you may underſtand that Sir <hi>John Girlington</hi> having drawn For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
into his Caſtle of <hi>Thurland,</hi> he began to plunder the Countrey,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:113334:42"/>
and to commit robberies and murthers, and thereupon for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of him and his adherents, I repaired thither, and after ſeven
weeks ſtrait ſiege of the Caſtle, it was delivered unto me, to be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
upon agreement, to ſuffer him and all his in the Caſtle, to paſſe
away with their lives, and goods: During moſt part of the ſiege, the
greateſt part of the Forces of <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> lay within our view, and
daily threatned us; but God confined them to their own Countie,
and every day more and more inclined the hearts of the Commons of
<hi>Weſtmerland</hi> to decline any attempt upon us, though wee then lay in
an Out-Angle of our County, far from ſupplies, and whileſt theſe
things were in ſuſpence, a deſigne was ſet on foot by all the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Gentry of <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> and <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and by <hi>Roger Kirby,</hi> and
<hi>Alexander Rigby</hi> of the <hi>Burghe,</hi> two <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> men, to raiſe all the
Forces of <hi>Cartmell</hi> and <hi>Fournes,</hi> part of <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> to joyn with <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi>
and <hi>Weſtmerland,</hi> to ſurprize <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>Hornby Caſtles,</hi> and
to aſſault us on all ſides, and to raiſe our Siege, and then to proceed
further into <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and (as upon credible information I beleeve)
to joyn with <hi>Latham</hi>-houſe, and all the ill-affected in our Countie,
to our generall devaſtation. And for this end, they drew together
part of <hi>Cumberland</hi> forces into <hi>Fournes,</hi> and with them the ſtrength of
that place, to about the number of ſixteen hundred, intending the
next day to March into <hi>Cartmell</hi> towards us, and there to adde to
their forces, and in their way, they took and impriſoned divers of
the beſt affected, and cauſed the reſt of them to flie out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
who poſting to us, I forthwith took five hundred foot, two
Drakes, and three ſmall Troops of horſe, parcell of my Forces at
<hi>Thurland,</hi> and with them in one day, I marched almoſt thirty miles,
over mountaines, and through Sea-ſands, and waters, within two
miles of the Enemie, and the next morning being the Lords day, wee
found the Enemy in the field, ſtanding with a body of horſe, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
of foot, in a poſture to receive us, upon a ground choſen for
their own advantage: and when we were within half a mile of them,
wee committed our ſelves to Gods protection, and began our work
with publike prayers for his bleſſing upon us: And thoſe done, wee
ſpeeded unto the Enemy, with ſuch reſolution and courage in all the
Captains, and common Souldiers, as by their deportment, I might
have rather deemed, that they had made haſt to have ſaluted their
friends, than to have encountred their enemies: the enemies word
was (<hi>In with Queen Mary</hi>) ours was (<hi>God with us</hi>) and at our firſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:113334:43"/>
appearance, God ſo ſtruck the hearts of theſe our enemies with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
that before a blow given, their Horſe began to retreat, our foot
gave a great ſhout, our Horſe purſued, theirs fled; their foot diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and fled; they all truſted more to their feet, than their hands;
they threw away their Armes and Colours, deſerted their magazine
drawn with eight Oxen, and were totally routed in one quarter of
an houres time; our horſe ſlew ſome few of them in the purſuit, and
drave many of them into the Sea; wee took their Colonell <hi>Hudleſton</hi>
of <hi>Millam,</hi> two Captains, and an Enſign, and about foure hundred
Priſoners, ſix foot Colours, and one horſe Colour; and their Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin,
and ſome horſes, and more armes than men: and all this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the loſſe of any one man of ours; wee had onely one man hurt
by the Enemy, and onely another hurt by himſelfe with his own
Piſtoll, but neither mortally; upon the cloſe of the buſineſs, all our
men with a great ſhout cryed out, <hi>Glory be to God;</hi> and wee all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
one Troop of horſe, and one foot Company, which I left to
quiet the Countrey, returned forthwith towards our ſiege at <hi>Thur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
moſt of our horſe-men without alighting from our horſes, and
moſt of us all, without eating or drinking; ſo that early the next

within view of more than treble forces from <hi>Weſtmerland;</hi> this
worke in <hi>Fournes</hi> had that influence upon all the Caſtles, and all the

            <p>About the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> alſo of this inſtant <hi>November,</hi> came certain informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

valourous taking of the Town of <hi>Warham</hi> in that Countie, which was

could poſſibly approach them, and had drawn ſeverall ambuſcadoes
into the hedges to annoy them, which way ſoever they came, and
withall making good the bridge-foot (as they conceived) which was
the main hiding place to come into the body of the Town. But this
courageous and reſolute Captain being too wiſe for ſuch untuter'd
freſh-water Souldiers, before he came neer the Town, had landed an
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:113334:44"/>
indifferent ſtrong partie, which being divided into two parts were at
one and the ſame time to enter the Town in two places at once, and
the reſidue were to follow preſently at the main landing place, all
which was exactly obſerved according to command and direction;
but by the way, the enemies ambuſcadoes, ſtill, at adventures playd
upon our men, retreating amain into the Town, but did little hurt,

volley of ſhot to purpoſe; this was a notable meanes that the enemie
knew not well how to ſhoot to annoy them. Our men, thus, courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
coming on, the enemie left all their defenſive breſt-works, and
rallyed themſelves into a body in the midſt of the Town, and all with
one voice crying out,<note place="margin">

the enemie having no way to eſcape but by a gate behind them, which
could not poſſibly be blockt up by our men; but ours being come up
moſt bravely together, gave them a handſome volley of ſhot, at which
the enemie unanimouſly without farther diſpute betook them to their
heeles,<note place="margin">The enemies flie. Priſoners ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> and throwing down their armes, fled away, and it being in the
night ſeaſon, many eſcaped out of that <hi>Poſtern-gate;</hi> but about 200 of
them were taken priſoners, and much ammunition and armes, beſides
many fat beeves, ſheep, and other proviſion, which was then provided
for the next dayes Market,<note place="margin">Prizes taken.</note> with good ſtore of other pillage, and the
Souldiers, who before had reſolved to be in no Drapers debt for new-cloathes,
borrowed as much cloath as would ſerve their turn of other
kinde neighbour-<hi>Cormorants,</hi> who at the firſt word gave them no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall

then likewiſe gone Eaſtward from <hi>Pool</hi> to <hi>Winborn</hi> to demand that

            <p>About the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this <hi>November</hi> alſo it pleaſed our good God ſo to
order and diſpoſe of things by the wiſdome and providence of our

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:113334:44"/>
renowned pious and valiant Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> was by an unanimous

honourable title fit to be inveſted on ſo honourable, truſtie and noble
a perſonage; and indeed I cannot exactly ſay, whether the title more
honours him, or he the title; but, this I am ſure of, the title is moſt

him, whoſe actions are and ever have been moſt like himſelf, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
pious, and faithfull.</p>
            <p>Much alſo about the aforeſaid time came credible information by

thither, beſide, to make the ſaid Houſe a more ſtrong and complete
garriſon for part of his Souldiers, the better to free and ſecure thoſe

            <p>About the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this inſtant <hi>December,</hi> came credible intelligence by
Letters to <hi>London,</hi> from out of <hi>Glouceſterſhire,</hi> that whereas the enemies
reſolutions were grown very high and lofty to garriſon and entrench

bravely lopt and cut down,<note place="margin">The brave exploits of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Maſsie</hi> at <hi>Glouceſter.</hi>
               </note> by the vigilancie, valour and prudent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection
of that moſt famous &amp; ever to be renowned Commander
Colonell <hi>Maſſey.</hi> As firſt, Colonell <hi>Vavaſor</hi> being appointed Governour
of <hi>Tewksbery,</hi> iſſued out his Warrants in that name, to the adjacent
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:113334:50"/>
parts, commanding in proviſions and pioners for the ſtrengthning of
his garriſon and eſtabliſhment of his government there: But by two
troops of horſe ſent out of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> he was ſo diſanimated &amp; frighted
that his government ſoone diſſolved,<note place="margin">Colonell <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſor</hi> beaten from <hi>Tewks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery.</hi>
               </note> and <hi>Tewksbery</hi> was quite quitted
by them, and he thus freed of ſo troubleſome a neighbour as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have been.</p>
            <p>After this, Colonell Sir <hi>John Winter,</hi> the Court-<hi>Papiſt,</hi> and one of
the <hi>Queens white-boyes,</hi> entred upon the government of <hi>Newnham</hi> with
ſuch forces as the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> could afford him, horſe and foot; but
by a partie ſent out by this active and reſolute Colonell <hi>Maſſie,</hi> after
ſome of <hi>Winters</hi> forces had got a good purchaſe of ſtoln Cattle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their filching fingers, and were entred their garriſon at <hi>Newnham</hi>
ere Colonell <hi>Maſſeys</hi> troops could reach them, after a complement of
thanks given to one Major <hi>Adams,</hi> a grand ſheep-ſtealer in thoſe parts
for his extraordinary care in that piece of the every which he had new
brought in unto them;<note place="margin">Sir <hi>John Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> frighted from <hi>Newn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
               </note> but, I ſay, ere the ſaid complement was fully
ended, the <hi>Glouceſter</hi> troops moſt reſolutely arrived at this Towns end,
which being ſo ſodain, changed the cloſe of the foreſaid complement
into a fearfull alarm &amp; cry, <hi>Wee are all loſt, wee are all loſt.</hi> So that with
the loſs of two of their colours, and 7 or 8 men ſlain, they quitted that
government, alſo. Beſides, after this, the enemie took courage on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> to erect new governments at <hi>Tedbury</hi> &amp; <hi>Wotton;</hi>
which cauſed that valiant and vigilant Governour Colonell <hi>Maſſey</hi> to
march that way alſo, with what forces he could poſſibly make againſt
them; but two troops of his horſe which were ſeen before, by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
were ſo formidable and terrible to them at <hi>Tedbury,</hi> that with the
loſs of ſome 14. or 15. of their Souldiers ſlain and taken priſoners, the
whole regiment, government and governours, with <hi>Horatio Carey,</hi> fled
thence and were diſſipated, ſcard &amp; ſcattered, with ſuch a panick feare
and trembling, as hardly to return again in haſte to that government.
Upon this good ſucceſs, this moſt worthy and unwearied Col. <hi>Maſſey</hi>
took the opportunitie to march to another Garriſon at <hi>Wotton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note>
where the enemy (being, and that with good reaſon, jealous of him)
expected his coming upon them alſo, who accordingly hearing of his
coming upon them indeed, drew themſelves into a body upon a hill
to face our brave Colonell, but on his neerer approach they retreated
haſtily to their Garriſon, at night, where, ſomewhat late, Col. <hi>Maſſey</hi>
valiantly coming on &amp; ſetting on them, found the enemy all mounted,
yet gave the word &amp; ſo fell on them, and put them all to flight toward

made their eſcape, and left that government alſo for Col. <hi>Maſſey</hi> to

to <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> contrary to the hopes of Sir <hi>John Winter,</hi> aforeſaid, and

Sir <hi>John Winter,</hi> in perſon, much amazed at that change, with all ſpeed
alſo marched away, in ſuch a confuſed manner, at the approach of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

and ſo that plot, was by Gods mercy, thus, happily prevented,
and the enemie diſcomfited.</p>
            <p>About the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this inſtant <hi>December,</hi> came credible information

               <hi>Bleſſenden,</hi> a Prebend of that Church, came in very devoutly,
and cryed out, <hi>Oh hold your hands, I pray, what hurt do theſe images? ſpoyl

then preſent to aſſiſt the <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> he grew very ſick of this

                  <p>Colonell <hi>Dacre,</hi> one that was formerly in the North, a familiar friend and
acquaintance of my brothers, ſent to me to deſire that he might have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
to ſee him, to which, with the knowledge of the <hi>Committee,</hi> I gave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
&amp; then being in his company, he deſired ſome words in private with my
brother, pretending a deſire to be ſatisfied in ſome doubts of his concerning
this warre; but ſome accidents then falling out, he was prevented of that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
conference, and therefore deſired that my brother ſome two dayes after
would come to his quarters; but he, to prevent all ſuſpitions, would not goe
but writ him a deniall: after which Colonell <hi>Dacre</hi> writ very earneſtly to
him to come againe, and invited Captain <hi>Poulton</hi> to come with him; but my
brother would not, only with the leave of the <hi>Committee</hi> he ſent Cap. <hi>Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
to excuſe it, of whoſe going we intended to make ſuch uſe, as if we could,
to diſcover how the enemy lay, and what their intentions were: ſo ſoon as he
came thither, he was moſt kindly entertained, and Colonell <hi>Dacre</hi> taking him
aſide, told him, that now the Governour of <hi>Nottingham</hi> and his brother had
an occaſion offerd to gain themſelves great honour, to do the King very good
ſervice, and to receive a great recompence for ſo doing; which he demanding
how that was, the Colonell told him, that if I would deliver up the Caſtle,
the command of it ſhould be confirmed to me and my he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and that I ſhould be made the beſt Lord in <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> that my
brother ſhould have three thouſand pound to deliver the Bridges, &amp; that Cap.
<hi>Poulton</hi> ſhould have two thouſand pound to get this effected; to which Cap.
<hi>Poulton</hi> anſwered, that he thought it was an impoſſible thing, for the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
had formerly been tempted with ſuch like offers, and had refuſed them,
that we all ſcorned ſo baſe an act, and for his own part, he would ſtarve and
rot before he would betray his truſt: the Colonell was further importunate with
him, to move it to me, and that you may, ſaith he, be better aſſured I doe not
this without Commiſſion, he then pul'd out of his pocket a paper written with
theſe words, or to this effect; <hi>Theſe are to authorize Col.</hi> Dacre <hi>to treat
with Col.</hi> Hutchinſon <hi>and Lievtenant Colonell</hi> Hutchinſon, <hi>for the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring
up of the Caſtle and Bridges of</hi> Nottingham <hi>for the ſervice of
his Majeſty, and to make them large promiſes which ſhall be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:</hi>
and this paper ſigned with <hi>W. Newcaſtle</hi> at the bottome: and he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:113334:57"/>
deſired, that he might but come to the Caſtle to ſpeak with me; when Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Poulton</hi> told him, there was no hope of obtaining that, he entreated him
that he would but deliver the meſſage to me, which he told him he would doe;
and the Colonell told him, that if I would not deliver the Caſtle, yet if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
would but leave us, and come away, he ſhould immediately have a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of horſe delivered into his command; and earneſtly preſſed that I would
ſend him an anſwer: which preſently after both my brother and I did, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
whereof I have heer ſent you. There were alſo two Officers of Cap. <hi>Whites</hi>

and refuſed ſuch unworthy offers, that this did but increaſe his contempt
of them, whoſe faith and honeſtly hath been apparently great in this cauſe. I
confeſſe, had it not been for drawing a ſcandall or jealouſie on my ſelf, I would
have gone ſo far as to have gotten the Propoſitions under Col. <hi>Dacre</hi> his hand,
if not under the Marqueſs his hand; but this I durſt not doe, leſt my own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
intentions ſhould in the mean time have bin miſtaken: I therfore thought
it ſufficient to make it preſently known to the <hi>Committee,</hi> &amp; ſo to acquaint
you with it, and withall to aſſure you, that were I certain we ſhould utterly
bedeſerted and left (as, for any reliefe I yet heare of, we are like to be, our
Souldiers being 30 weeks behinde with pay, and the whole Country now poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed

were ſo unworthy of a Gentleman, ſo wicked, and baſe, that once
I thought in contempt and ſcorne to have forgotten them; yet leſt my
ſilence may receive too favourable an interpretation from you, know
and tell your Generall, that ſet you on this brave imployment, that I
abhorre the thought of treaſon to my Country, though I might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
grow as great for wickedneſſe as he; tell him Ile weare no title but
what my faith and vertue purchaſeth, and Ile leave my children an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
though a ſmall inheritance, to whom my ſpotleſs name, not tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the foule blot of treaſon, ſhall be an ornament, when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of all treacherous Apoſtates ſhall rot with infamie; and I
doubt not but my gracious Prince, once cured of his miſtake, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
my loyall conſtant faithfulneſſe to his Regall Power, and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
with a larger recompence than he propounds for my corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
if he doe not, vertue is its own reward. Tell your moſt Excellent
Generall, his threats and promiſes are both alike contemptible to me;
I feare not thoſe, and I hate theſe. I fight not to repaire a broken for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
but to maintain a juſt quarrell; in which may that man periſh,
and fall low as the depth of hell, that can be hired to prove unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
tell him, if you dare, that it had been an imployment more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming
you, or any Gentleman, had he ſent you with ten thouſand
armed men, to aſſault our well defended wals; than with ſo many pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

<hi>Cavaliers</hi> have retained a ſenſe of Gallantry and Honour, though no
Religion; and have been enriched with thoſe morall vertue which
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:113334:58"/>
made the Heathen famous; ſuch a one I beleeved you to be; but ſince
you can attempt to buy mee to ſo great a villany, as you did in your
late propoſitions by Captain <hi>Poulton,</hi> I muſt needs be perſwaded, you
would never offer me what you your ſelf would not have done: 'Tis I
confeſſe ſtrange to me you could imagine, that a Chriſtian, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
or a Commonwealths-man would ever prove ſuch a villain, as for
a little gaudie dirt to ſell his ſoule, his honour, and his Countrey; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
that moſt contemned gain, with all that can accept or offer it:
<hi>Dacre,</hi> 'twas baſe in you to think ſo of me, I am ſure you cannot ſo
miſ-interpret any act of mine, as to receive from it the leaſt ground of
encouragement to ſuch an opinion; and had you known my Brother,
you would have thought it eaſier for you your ſelf alone to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
all the men now fighting in the Kingdome, than to corrupt
that guard of vertues which protect his conſtant ſoule from treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
thoughts. Did you think men of ſenſe will part with reall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
for a Title? you are not capable of a religious conſideration; or
I could tell you, that our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are by you moſt unequally valued at a poore inconſiderable ſumme of
money; but your thought cannot reach heaven: look upon earth, and
give me an example where ever any Traytor preſerved his foul name
from an horrid blot of infamy on him and on his houſe for ever? How
can you think, He that by you will be corrupted to betray anothers
truſt, will not by another be again corrupted to betray yours? Keep
your deſpiſed coyn to tempt ſome fraile waiting-woman, it may work
with her to procure ſuch honeſt things as you affect; but deſiſt theſe
baſe attempts on men of noble ſpirits, with whom they will but ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you as contemptible as your offers. Conſider the unworthy meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
you ſent, and bluſh at the remembrance of your guilt in it, and if
yet you have ſo much worth left in you, repent the injury you did
to him that was your Friend. Farewell that name for evermore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

to deceive the expectation of their enemies) that they would honour them with
their preſence at a dinner in the City: The Speaker, therefore, told them, he
was commanded by the Houſe to take notice of the good affection of this great

of their love to them, and their reſolved loyaltie to the Cauſe, and
that therefore they were reſolved on Thurſday then next enſuing to give them

to preach a Sermon for the commemoration (among the reſt of Gods manifold

as two wals, between which they paſſed without preſſe

the enemie was to be let in at the <hi>North-gate;</hi> but if they could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh

following, which might much animate the Kings partie, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly

at a Conference in <hi>Parliament,</hi> touching this diſcovery) whereby he
ſhould have fired the Magazine of the Town; but, if none of theſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded;
then upon their Storming of the Town, he was to ſet fire on

theſe marched two dayes and three nights in the extremity of very
bitter cold weather, which was at that time, in ſo much that at laſt
they were not able to march or ſet one foot before another, the wayes
were ſo deep with ſnow, and the ſnow beating in their faces, and ſo

them like dogges to force them forward, and ſo at laſt with much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe

they there heard for certain, that their deſign was diſcovered, ſo that

                     <hi>SIR;</hi> About 6 of the clock in the morning, <hi>Jan.</hi> 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 1643. the enemie
faced us on both ſides of the Town; and our houſe with 2 foot Companies
went to the workes, but they being a very great body, and the workes not yet
defenſible in many places (they to give them their due) very bravely came on,
and forced their entry into the Town, and our horſe and foot were both forced
to retreate to the Caſtle, but we had not one man ſlain or wounded in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate:
Our Ordnance from the Caſtle made a lane among them at their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and our Musketteers kild many of them as they retreated into the Caſtles
The enemy poſſeſſed themſelves of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church, and thoſe houſes &amp; ſtreet
ends, which hindred our ſallying out, but when our horſe ſaw they were able
to do no ſervice (their body of horſe being far greater) Colonell <hi>Thornhagh</hi>
&amp; all the other horſe Commanders, encouraged their Troopers to take Muskets
in their hands, and ſerve as foot (which to their great glory they very cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and couragiouſly did) and with a foot company joyned to part of them,
ſallied out and beat the Cavaliers out of the neereſt houſes to the Caſtle, and
poſſeſſed them: When we ſaw our ſally and retreat, both made indifferent ſafe,
we drew out 2 other foot Companies, &amp; all the reſt of the Troopers with Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
who went on with ſo great courage &amp; valour, that they drove the enemy
before them out of the Town, with a great deal of diſhonour and confuſion: we
have now 80 priſoners, and all their armes, and a great many kild, the certain
number whereof I cannot relate, divers of them were wounded &amp; carried dead
off from the field, ſome they had buried in the field before they had entred the
Town, we traced them 2 miles in the ſnow by much bloud which we found ſpilt;
and we hear that they left dead and wounded men in the Towns as they paſſed.
I do not perceive we have any priſoners above the quality of a Captain, Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
but the reaſon is, becauſe the Commanders ran away in ſuch haſt, that
they left their own and got Troopers horſes, and took no care of their men, but
left them without command, being happy who could firſt ſcape away: We loſt
not all this day but one man ſlain, and 2 or 3 wounded: At laſt the enemy ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
in a valley about a mile from the Town (where they had a body of horſe
which never came into the Town) we faced one another, but we finding their
body ſo much exceeding all our force, would not hazard the whole garriſon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch unequall termes, towards night the enemy marched away to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Garriſons. Col. <hi>Cartwright</hi> had his horſe kild under him with a Cannon
bullet they ſay (but I am not certain) that he himſelf is ſhot. That you may know
their devilliſhnes, give me leave to acquaint you with their deſign as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to us: They were reſolved to have ſurpriſed us this morning by two of the
clocke, but the bitterneſs of the ſnowie weather which fell, hindred ſo ſpeedy a
march of their foot as they expected; therefore failing of that, their farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:113334:73"/>
was, to try if they could get the Town, which if they could, they then reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to ſummon the Caſtle, &amp; if they could neither winne nor have it delivered
up, they reſolved to plunder, and then fire the Town; to this purpoſe and with
theſe threats they had prepared a Letter to ſend me, and when they could finde
none that would venture to carry it, they ſeiz'd on M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Majores,</hi> and would
with many threats have compelled him to carry it to me; one clauſe of it was,
that if I would not ſend them the Major &amp; Aldermen, nor deliver the Caſtle,
they would proceed to plunder and fire: Before M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Majores</hi> was well out of
doores with his Letter, there was ſo quick &amp; unexpected an anſwer ſent them
by 400 Muskettiers, which ſallied out upon them, that they were in too great
haſt to take with them the plunder of the Town, ſo that in that reſpect the Town
eſcaped well and loſt nothing of value; we muſt acknowledge it was a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
mercy of God that it eſcaped firing, for they caſt a many coals of fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
a great deal of hay, in Capt. <hi>Whites</hi> Quarters, and laid fire to divers
houſes, and had prepared divers Gorſe Buſhes to fire, and ſhot muskets and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols
into the thatch of houſes as they paſſed by, and into barnes, but God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
us from all theſe dangers, ſo that though the fire was found halfe an
hour after they were gone quick in the hay, yet there was not ſo much as a ſmoke
in the Town: The number of theſe forces were (as neer as we could gueſſe) or find
out by the priſoners) 1500 horſe and foot, being all the force that could be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together from <hi>Newark,</hi> Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>THere is no cauſe why we ſhould conceive that our Brethren of
<hi>Scotland</hi> have delayed in any wiſe their comming, though they
have not been here ſo ſoon as ſome expected, but rather that wee
ſhould give God praiſe for their ſo ſoon and ſpeedy march.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Conſidering the great Army which they have raiſed, and
proviſion for them, which to be done orderly, and by the brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aſſiſtance of that whole Kingdome, is a great worke, and asketh
long time.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Becauſe they are not onely ayding and aſſiſting
unto us, but alſo to our brethren of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who are brought to a
very low, and moſt miſerable condition, inſomuch that informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from thence have certified the Kirke of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that 200. at
the leaſt of the <hi>Scots</hi> are ſtarved to death in <hi>Ireland</hi> for want.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Their chiefe Engineer hath formed a new kind of great
gunns, never before diſcovered, which were made purpoſely for
this deſigne, above three quarters of a yard long, or ſome a yard,
that will carry a twelve pound bullet, to doe good execution at a
good diſtance, and yet ſo framed, that a Horſe may carry one of
them, all which tooke up a great deale of time.</p>
                        <p>Yet nevertheleſſe, bleſſed be God, they are now come into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
their number being 18000 Foot, 3000 Horſe, and between
4 and 500 Dragoneers, and they bring along with them 120 great
Gunns, and other traine of Ammunition, very full and large,
which came to <hi>Barwick</hi> by Sea, and there met the Army in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
time, and was prepared ready for them in their march.</p>
                        <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 18 of <hi>January</hi> laſt, they marched to <hi>Barwick</hi>
and that day was a ſore day to them, by reaſon of great ſtormes
and Snow that fell all the day long, and yet ſuch was their valiant
reſolution, and deſire of expedition, that they came 18 <hi>Scotch</hi>
miles that day to reach <hi>Barwick</hi> which is at the leaſt, as much as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113334:75"/>
three and twenty or foure and twenty of our miles heere.</p>
                        <p>They billited about <hi>Barwick</hi> that night and there received their
train of Artillery, which they neglected not, though after ſo long
and weariſome a dayes journey, and the next day, being <hi>Ianuary</hi>
the 19. they marched out of <hi>Barwick,</hi> one Regiment after another,
as conveniently as they could obtaine fit quarter in thoſe parts.</p>
                        <p>Our Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> brought along with them Printed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for information and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to their brethren of <hi>England,</hi> concerning their preſent expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whereas the greateſt Queſtions that are like to ariſe in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
may be deduced to theſe three particulars, <hi>viz. The juſtneſſe
of ourcauſe: The lawfulneſſe of our calling thereto:</hi> And <hi>the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe

endeavour to give ſatisfaction in them all, and doubt not to doe it,
unleſſe there remaine ſome, whoſe inveterare malice hath produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in them a reſolution to be unſatisfied.</p>
                        <p>This their Declaration gave the Countrey ſo good ſatisfaction,
that they found no oppoſition, and they doe carry themſelves ſo
civill and well and without offering the leaſt wrong to any, where
they come, that the Count ey are exceeding glad of their being
come.</p>
                        <p>When the Meſſenger that brought the meſſage to the Parliament
yeſterday, left the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, which was on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> laſt, then
they were at <hi>Adeſtone,</hi> within ſome ſixe miles from <hi>An wick</hi> in
their march towards <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> which is about ſome 28 <hi>Engliſh</hi>
miles, and then a Letter was prepared to be ſent to Colonel <hi>Glem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
the Governour of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> to require the delivery of the
ſame up to the uſe of the Parliament, in <hi>England,</hi> and he doth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
beleeve that by this time they can give account of the ſame: for
on <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt they intended to be before <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi>

                        <p>Colonell <hi>Glemham,</hi> it ſeemes had marched out of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>
with a Partee, ſuch ſtrength as he could make; and the the Letters
were delived to him, which came from our brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
ſent from both the Chaire-men of the Committies of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland,</hi> which was very faire; and declared, that they did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
blood, but to bring in thoſe Delinquents to juſtice, who ſeeke
to divert his Majeſtie from the Parliament. The Letter was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to Colonell <hi>Glemham,</hi> and by him read to the Army then with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113334:75"/>
him, which himſelfe would not deny, but that it was very faire;
and ſo made unto them three Propoſitions, at the reading of the ſaid
Letter.</p>
                        <p>1. Whether the Countrey ſhould be burnt up before them, and all
deſtroied and laid waſt. To this it was anſwered, No, which they had
reaſon ſo to doe, becauſe there were then preſent many of the Gentry
of thoſe parts, who had interest in the Land there.</p>
                        <p>2. Whether they ſhould oppoſe the <hi>Scots,</hi> and ſend them a denyall.
To which it was anſwered, that they were altogether unable to oppoſe
them, becauſe they being but two thouſand Foot, and ſome few Horſe,
it would be in vain to ſtand againſt them.</p>
                        <p>3. Whether an Anſwer ſhould be retuned to the ſaid Letters,
To which ſome ſaid, that it were beſt, Firſt to ſend to the Earle of
<hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> to know his mind: Others, that it was convenient,
firſt to ſend to <hi>Oxford,</hi> before an anſwer be returned.</p>
                        <p>The Meſſenger further reporteth, that as he ſailed by the mouth of
the Channell which leadeth to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> he ſaw ſome ſeven Ships
or more, which ſeemed to be fraught, and upon inquiry, it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
that they were laden with Malignants goods, ſuppoſed for
<hi>Holland,</hi> whereof he gave notice to ſome Commanders under the
Lord Admirall, who appointed eleven Ships to wait their comming
out, and if they came not foorth before <hi>Saturday,</hi> the day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
by our brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> then to
fall in and ſteal upon them.</p>
                        <p>Now that our brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> may not be looked upon with
the prejudice of ſtrangers, we hope this firme Union of this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Covenant will beare it out: There is a Committee of our own
Nation, the moſt of which are Parliament men, ſuch to whom they
have committed the truſt and care of their Religion, Lawes, and
Liberties, joyned with them, without whoſe concurrence, nothing
that concernes us is to be tranſacted. And to free us of all unjuſt
ſuſpition, which if our minds are not ready to conceive, yet the
malicious mouthes of our Adverſaries, and theirs, are ready to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt,
that notwithſtanding their Declaration they have ſome fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
and ſecret ends, which may prove prejudiciall to our Rights
and Happineſſe: It is hereby made known to us, that they have
freely engaged themſelves, by an Article of the late Treaty betwixt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113334:76"/>
the Nations, to give the publike Faith of the Kingdome of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
unto the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> that neither their entrance
into, nor continuance in this Kingdom, ſhall be made uſe of to any
other ends than expreſſed in the Covenant, and that Treaty ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to by the Commiſſioners of both Kingdomes, which they
are reſolved, to the honour of God, and of this Nation, to keepe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violate.</p>
                        <p>And they declare, that they are ſo far from deſiring harme or loſſe
to any of their Brethren of <hi>England,</hi> that their ſincere and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
intentions are not to adde fuell, nor bring oyle, but water to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
theſe lamentable combuſtions and fires, which they have
with ſo much duty and love laboured to quench: That their taking
of Armes is not to make Warrs (if they be not neceſſitated) but
to obtaine a better grounded and more durable Peace, for enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Religion and Liberties in all the three Kingdoms: and that

omitted in that former Relation, but very obſervable in their
ſaid March,<note place="margin">Three or 4. memorable Contingents in the <hi>Scots</hi> March.</note> which were theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that on <hi>Thurſday Ianuary</hi> the twenty fifth, their
Army had a hard and difficult March, in reſpect of a very great
thaw,<note place="margin">1. A great thaw, much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the <hi>Scots</hi> march.</note> after much froſt and ſnow upon the ground at that time,
which ſo ſwelled the waters (whereof there were not a few in
their way, that oftentimes it came up to the middle, and ſometime
to the arme-pits of their Foot, inſomuch that the horſe paſſed with
little leſſe difficulty; which though it was not without much ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:113334:76"/>
and danger, yet (bleſſed be God) without the leaſt harme or
dammage to the meaneſt Souldier.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Glemham</hi> alſo did intend (to hinder the <hi>Scots</hi>
March and advance forward) to cut <hi>Feltam-Bridge;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. A Bridge which would much have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded the <hi>Scots</hi> March, not ſuffred to be cut down as intended.</note> but the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and workemen which he brought thither for that purpoſe, were
ſo affrighted and amazed, by reaſon of the exclamation and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Countrey, women upon their knees, that while Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
went into a Houſe to refreſh himſelfe, they all ſtole away, and
before he could get them to returne again, he received an alarm from
the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Horſe, which made himſelfe alſo to fly away with ſpeed
to <hi>Morpeth,</hi> but there alſo he ſtayed not long, but Marched to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo the great ſtorm of Snow, which in, reaſon, the <hi>Scots</hi> could
not but expect would encounter them in the way (eſpecially at that
time of the yeare) and might have killed many of their Foot,<note place="margin">3. The contrary effects of the great Snow in the Scots march.</note> did
not (by Gods providence) hurt any of them: but contrariwiſe did
greatly hinder the enemy, from putting in execution their wicked
reſolutions, to plunder and drive away all the Cattle and goods, and
burning up of all the Corne of the whole Country, where the <hi>Scots</hi>
ſhould paſſe, that ſo they might ſtarve their Army.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, that there was ſo great a Froſt (the like whereof had not

               </note>
the River of <hi>Tweed</hi> freezed ſo ſtrong and thick, as that the whole
Army of our brethren the <hi>Scots</hi> and all their Ammunition which
was at a place called <hi>Kelſo,</hi> marched moſt ſafely, upon the ice, which
otherwiſe could not poſſibly have come over the River in a long
time after, and that with difficulty and danger too. But their forces
have thus happily paſſed on to <hi>Alnwick,</hi> the Lord Marqueſſe of <hi>Argyle</hi>
marched to <hi>Cocquet-Iſland,</hi> which was yeilded to him at the firſt
ſhot which they diſcharged againſt the Towne,<note place="margin">Gods evident hand of good Providence going along with the <hi>Scots</hi> Army.</note> though they had 70
Souldiers within it, 7 pieces of braſſe Ordnance, and victuals al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
for a yeare. And were not here remarkable teſtimonies and
cleare demonſtrations of Gods ſpeciall good hand of Providence,
guiding and guarding this bleſſed Army ſo ſafely and ſecurely, in ſo
imminent and eminent dangers, and difficulties, as theſe
were? Yes, moſt aſſuredly, and none, queſtionleſſe, but a meer

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOur Letter is come to my hands, which I take kindly from you:
I ſhould deſire to exchange lines oftner with you; I thank you
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:113334:80"/>
for your newes. I had Letters this day from my Lord <hi>Admirall,</hi> for
the <hi>Maria</hi>-Pinace to ride before this Town. We are yet in ſafety
(bleſſed be God) but daily braved by the Enemy, yet hitherto they
have not dared to faſten upon this Town: And I have obſerved, that
they have never come before this place, or neer it, but we have ſtill
worſted them; we have alwayes taken priſoners, horſes, armes,
wounded or ſlain ſome of them. On Thurſday laſt we took ſixe men
and Horſe, wherof one was a Cornet. On <hi>Saturday</hi> wee tooke two
men, Horſes and Armes, ſhot a Captaine, who lyes languiſhing
at <hi>Rumſey,</hi> and wounded three men more. The Lord bee ſtill our
defence and refuge, and give us thankfull hearts for his preſervation o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us. This poor County of <hi>Hampſhire</hi> having had its ſhare of blood
and miſery, in this ſad Tragedie of our Nation, that there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
left any thing for man or beaſt therein.</p>
                  <p>I perceive you have received knowledge of a treacherous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
for the delivery of this Town, but leſt you ſhould bee miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed
therein, I will give you a briefe account thereof. Some
few daies before Chriſt-tide laſt, the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> marched
with his Army from <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> towards <hi>Southampton,</hi> with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to face it, (as we were informed) but he came not within two
Miles thereof, to outface it, but marched to <hi>Redbridge,</hi> (the way
into the New Forreſt) brake it downe to hinder us of Proviſion
from thence; after ſo horrible an Act, he faced about, and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his old quarters again, without attempting any further at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement.</p>
                  <p>The next day here arrived a Letter from one Mr. <hi>Iaſper Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
(ſometimes an Atturney of this Town, but run away before my
comming hither, for Malignancy) directed to Mr. <hi>R. Maſon,</hi> a
Merchant of this Towne, intimating that this <hi>Cornelius</hi> was the
day before with the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> before this Towne, and was the
meanes of diverting the Lord <hi>Hoptons</hi> intent of attempting this
place, and tells Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> he had made choice of him to deliver
an incloſed Letter to me, with all ſecreſie, which I received, (yet
the ſaid <hi>Cornelius</hi> was an unknowne man to me) by his Letter he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates,
that then was a fit time for me to doe his Majeſty good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and that I was not the man I was formerly; meaning (as I
conceived) that the government of this Towne was impoſed upon
my honoured friend, Colonel <hi>Norton</hi> (which I long ſued to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
thereof) and by it he thought I was a diſconted perſon, and ſo
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:113334:81"/>
fit to be wrought upon; but he was deceived, I being never bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
pleaſed then to be eaſed of ſo great a burthen, which I had
borne long enough, (though it pleaſed his Excellency to require my
ſervice with a more ſutable command to my diſpoſition, made
me Serjeant Major to Colonell <hi>Norton,</hi> which pleaſed me farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
after the receit of this Letter, I inſtantly acquainted my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
and Maſter Mayor therewith, we all agreed I ſhould ſhew a
ſeeming complying, the better to bottome their deſigne, and to
find out what malignant party they had made in this Town. I forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
gave him a copie of a Character to explaine his minde more
fully. To which he replied, That by the command of his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
he did in the name of His Majeſty, and his Countrey, and
two Lords (which he named) offer me a thouſand pounds in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
a preſent imployment of more value and honour, than at
preſent I had, His Majeſties pardon under the great Seale, and
his favour, if I would be a meanes to reduce the Towne of <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
to His Majeſtie; I returned a ſeeming complying Anſwere,
and demanded the one thouſand pounds in hand, or the moity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and aſſurance given me for the reſidue, the imployment named,
&amp; the Pardon ſent me; this performed, he ſhould ſoon ſee what I
would ſay to it. In the interim my Colonell acquainted my Lord
Generall, and Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> with the offer made by <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius;</hi>
wherein I continued the Treaty to regaine time, untill Sir
<hi>William Waller</hi> had finiſhed his buſineſſe at <hi>Arundel,</hi> and drawne
his Army this way, and then to have drawne the Enemy hither, in
hope of gaining this place, whileſt Sir <hi>William</hi> might have fallen
behind them in this place of advantage, and ſo to have deceivd ſuch
treacherous corrupters. I continued the Treaty, untill I had his
Majeſties Signe Manuall for a Pardon ſent me, and afterwards the
Pardon it ſelfe; but I could get no money, but ſtrong engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of honour to performe with me, when the worke deſired
was effected. I whiled out a moneths time with them, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
of eight Letters, Maſter <hi>Robert Maſon</hi> being ſtill the man
they employed to bring theirs, and receive my Letters, whom they
had bound to ſecrecie by an Oath, before I knew thereof, who
brought me the copy thereof, hoping to have gained me to the like,
ſaying he had no engagement all this time on me, neither by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
nor promiſe, to performe with them; and which I ſtill
delayed (which put the Projectors to a jealouſie that I was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:113334:81"/>
all to them) yet to draw them ſtill on, I framed ſome offers, in the
nature of Articles, for my ſelfe and this Towne (to which the Lord
<hi>Hopton</hi> ſubſcribed that upon his honour he would performe them:)
but I ſtill preſſed for the money, but could not obtaine it; they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
I would <hi>Craford</hi> them as <hi>Poole</hi> did; yet Maſter <hi>Maſon</hi>
offered me to become bound for it, which I accepted of: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he could performe, on <hi>Friday</hi> laſt was ſevennight, he earneſtly
preſſed me to declare my reality in the deſigne. I ſaw the man in a
diſtracted extaſie, by his over-zealouſneſſe and raſhneſſe for them,
having no aſſurance of me, my bowels pittied him, his wife, and
many children, told him plainly, I never intended to be a villaine and
traytor, to betray a truſt committed to me, and the lives and goods
of ſo many innocent people to be made a prey to cruelty, and told
him I have revealed it from the beginning to my Colonell.</p>
                  <p>Then he begged I would conceale his name; I told him, I could
not, but in compaſſion of his condition, gave him leave to goe to
his houſe (being but three Houſes from mine,) in which time I
went foorthwith to acquaint my Colonell, with what had hapned
betweene Maſter <hi>Maſon</hi> and my ſelfe; wee concluded inſtantly to
ſeize his perſon, and cauſed all the gates to be ſecured: but yet hee
eſcaped from us, and could not be found, although we ſearched care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
for him; ſince we heare he is at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
and imployed in matter of truſt. In all the time of our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I could not diſcover that he had any confederates of any Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
with him, but had undertaken it, to carry it alone. But I
was grieved, that I was conceived by the adverſe part, to be a fit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
for them. But now they have tryed me, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
they will never doe the like, but to revenge themſelves on
me: But I will to all the world declare, and maintaine my faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to my Countrey, and Cauſe I have undertaken, and cleare my
unfeigned reputation.</p>
                  <p>Thus much I thought good to ſay unto you, that you may give a
ſatisfactory teſtimony of that deſigne in my behalfe, if you heare it
falſely reported. And I ſhall be ready to requite you, in vindicating
of truth, and acknowledge my ſelfe,</p>

and therein to give them a ſeeming Victory therein, and thereby to
raiſe up their inſtant and inſolent ſwelling thoughts to an extream
pitch of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Arrogancy,</hi> inſomuch, that their <hi>Mercurius Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licus,</hi>

(our Brigade being quartered at <hi>Midhurſt</hi>) our Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<hi>Browne,</hi> received Orders from Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> to
advance toward <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> to a Towne called <hi>Trafford,</hi>
which accordingly he did, with incredible ſpeed, almoſt at an
houres warning, and that night arrived there, which we found to be
a ſmall Village, not above ſeven or eight houſes to quarter all our
men, there we met with much hardſhip, ſtaying for Orders till
the Lords day following; Upon <hi>Monday</hi> the 25. we marcht for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to joyne with Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> maine Body, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
we did, and that night were appointed to Quarter at
<hi>Westmean,</hi> three miles diſtant from the maine Body, where wee
found a Partee of the Enemies Horſe, when our Quarter-maſters
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:113334:100"/>
entred the Towne, which occaſioned ſome action, though not much
conſiderable, we onely tooke a Quarter-maſter priſoner; The next
day, which was <hi>Tueſday,</hi> we lay ſtill, onely our Scouts brought in
ſome Priſoners, 6 Troopes incountring with 16 of the Enemies,
put them to flight, and brought away 3 of them priſoners; The
day following we diſcovered the Enemy, who tooke ſome few of
our men that were ſtragling from their Colours, and ſoone after ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in a great Body upon the hill, on the left hand of the Towne,<note place="margin">The Enemies plot to ſurpriſe us at Church prevented.</note>
intending (as ſome Priſoners confeſſed) to take us at Church, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Faſt day, but it pleaſed God, who foreſaw the Plot, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the danger, directing us to keepe the Faſt, the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when we lay ſtill at <hi>Midhurſt,</hi> ſo that we were provided
to entertaine them, and drew our men into a Body neere the Town;
which done, Orders came to march away, which accordingly we
did, in the <hi>Forlorne-Hope,</hi> expecting the enemy every houre to fall
upon us, ſo that wee were forced to make a ſtand, a mile or more
from the Towne in extreame danger, till Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
came up from <hi>Eaſtmean</hi> to joyne with us, then we marcht along
till we came neere to <hi>Cheeriton,</hi> to a place, called by ſome, <hi>Lambo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough-field,</hi>
where we quartered all night, the Enemy lying upon
<hi>Sutton-Common,</hi> and ſome part of them neerer to us, ſo neere, that
the Sentinels could heare one another talke.</p>
                        <p>Upon <hi>Thurſday</hi> morning, a commanded Partee was ſent to view
the Enemie, which they did, and encountered with a Forlorne-hope
of the Enemies, and behaved themſelves very bravely, ſo that day
was ſpent in skirmiſhes, where much gallantry, and true valour
was ſhewed by our Horſe, eſpecially two men, whoſe names I do
not well remember,<note place="margin">A brave skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh between us and the Enemy.</note> to the perpetuall honour of the Actors, and
great admiration of the Spectators; by whoſe meanes a conſiderable
Partee was once engaged, and the Enemy came on with a great
Body, which appearing, we diſcharged one Gun, which did ſuch
execution in our ſight, that they all fled.</p>
                        <p>This day a Councill of Warre was called by both parties, both by
us and the Enemy, as ſince we are informed, and the ingagement
was ſuch,<note place="margin">A Councill of War called on both ſides.</note> that of neceſſity they muſt give battaile, or retreat with
much diſhonour, the next morning we prepared for the Worke, and
having ſought to God for aſſiſtance, we did addreſſe our ſelves to the
Service; in the firſt place, a Forlorne-hope was drawn out of our
Brigade, foure Files out of a Company, led on by <hi>Captaine Tomſon,</hi>
                           <pb n="189" facs="tcp:113334:100"/>
a ſtout man, who were ſent to take poſſeſſion of a wood, which lay
on the right hand betweene us and the enemy, which they obtained
with eaſe in the Enemies ſight; but ſuch was their policy, that they
fore-ſeeing the neceſſity of our gaining the wood, if ever we gave
battell to them in that place, planted their Drakes on the farther ſide
of the Wood, which they diſcharged upon our men ſo thicke, that
the place was not tenible, though the greateſt part of Musketeers,
and ſome others, were drawn up to them, ſo that they were forced
to retreat in one houres ſpace,<note place="margin">The fight fiercely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</note> which gave great encouragement to
the Enemy, who preſently came on with their maine body of horſe,
very powerfully, and were met as couragiouſly, yet being of the
greater number (for our whole body was not then together) forced
ours to a diſorderly retreat, at which time the day was doubtfull, if
not deſperate,<note place="margin">The day at this time ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doubtfull.</note> our Foot all the while was engaged on the left wing,
to drive the Enemy from the hedges, where our men played their
parts gallantly, and drove them from hedge to hedge by degrees, till
they had forced them to the top of the hill; our Horſe doing little for
the ſpace of an houre after their retreat, onely ſome Parties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring
with each other; at which time our Noble Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<hi>Browne,</hi> (who was ever known to be a valiant man, and
muſt be lookt upon as a ſpeciall inſtrument in the worke,)<note place="margin">Major Gen. <hi>Browne</hi> brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charges the Enemies horſe.</note> drew
off 100 men from the hedges, and in his own perſons led them on
to charge the Horſe, which they did moſt gladly, &amp; couragiouſly, and
forced the enemies horſe to wheele about, whereupon our body of
horſe came on againe, and that very manfully, at which time they
charged quite through the enemies body, and put them to a rout, ſo
that they were forced to retreat to the top of the hill, where they firſt
appeared, this was about two of the clock in the afternoon, at which
time they began to retreat,<note place="margin">The Enemies put to the rout retreat.</note> and ſent their carriages away, their body
of foot followed after, the horſe and ſome few foot onely, being left
to face and to fight with us; at the laſt it pleaſed God to raiſe up the
ſpirits of ſome few, not above 300 and to put ſuch courage into them
as to adventure out of the cloſings, to charge the maine body upon
the plain, which they did ſo reſolutely, that they put them al to flight,
our horſe purſued them 2 miles at the leaſt,<note place="margin">The Enemy put totally to flight.</note> til the enemies horſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
their own foot, who cried out (as the countrey people ſaid) Face
them, face the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, once more face them; which they did, but to ſmall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
for our horſe came up, &amp; at the firſt charge they were all routed
again &amp; fled, our horſe purſuing them til they overtook the foot, routed
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:113334:101"/>
them likewiſe, and diſperſed them ſeverall waies, ſom fled to <hi>Baſing</hi>
ſome to <hi>Alton,</hi> and ſome to <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> &amp; by the way they cryed out
the Kingdoms loſt, the Kingdoms loſt, &amp;c. and when they left
<hi>Alsford</hi> where they had long quartered, they ſet the towne on fire
at both ends, which doubtleſſe had burt to the ground, but that our

moſt of the infantry toward <hi>Andover,</hi> Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> with a

and ſo to <hi>Redding,</hi> it being in the night, and ſo the eaſier for them
to eſcape, and the harder for our forces to diſcover the way they
went; yet we took ſome of their carriages which were going to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dover;</hi>
and purſuing the flying enemy to <hi>Alſford,</hi> about 200. of the

            <p>Now when Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> came to <hi>Wincheſter</hi> the <hi>Mayor</hi>

like their ancient famous and unvanquiſht predeceſſours,<note place="margin">The Kentiſh mens brave behaviour in this fight.</note> even as if
they had been again to ſtruggle with the <hi>Norman Conquerour,</hi> for a

to their eternall renowne and indelible honour, like ſo many ancient
<hi>Romane Conquerours;</hi> who of their voluntary accord went upon
the forlorne-hope, beat the enemy with impregnable courage, from
the hedges, which they had lined with ſtore of musketeers, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the paſſage to a wood which ſtood our forces in great ſtead (as
was forementioned in the deſcription of the fight) and ſoon after by
Gods providence turned the ſcale of the daies honour (which before
hung on equally indifferent termes) and put the enemy to the rout.
And here before I conclude the relation of this famous victory,<note place="margin">Obſervations upon the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</note> give
me leave, good Reader, for thy fuller content and delight herein,
to give thee theſe few materiall obſervations thereon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the enemy made himſelfe ſo ſure of routing Sir <hi>Will.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>Waller,</hi> as that their commanders had Commiſſions, ready ſigned, in
their pockets, to raiſe forces in <hi>Kent,</hi> a County which is (as I toucht
before) reſolved to ſacrifice it ſelfe, to deſtroy thoſe accurſed <hi>Cormo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,</hi>
and defend their ancient rights, which <hi>William the Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
could not gaine from them; and are therefore reſolved that <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Queene Mary</hi> ſhall purchaſe them at a deere rate, if ſhee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the word which the enemy had, and which the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Parliament</hi> forces had, was one and the very ſame; GOD WITH
US. And God indeed the moſt righteous Judge, ſhewed who took
his ſacred name in vaine, they or we; and for whom, he graciouſly
ſtood, by the ſucceſſe of the battell.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, how miſchievous and wicked the enemy is in his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
(if God did not curb and prevent them) in that when they ſaw
they could not keep the Towne of <hi>Alsford,</hi> but that their <hi>Iriſh</hi> were
put to the ſword, they ſet the Towne on fire in two or three ſeverall
places; but it was happily and ſeaſonably quenched by the care and
induſtry of the <hi>Parliaments</hi> forces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:113334:103"/>
Fourthly, that they were ſo inhumane and cruell, that the poore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Countrymen whom they compelled to take armes for this fight, they
moſt mercileſly drove up with their horſes, and by ſhooting at
them and beating them, either forced them to fight or to be ſlaine
and dye.</p>
            <p>And leſt our malignants might report (as indeed they did at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>

               </gap>ſt not purſue him, let the wiſe and impartiall
Reader judge the truth thereof by theſe ſubſequent materiall occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
which, <hi>de facto,</hi> were thus.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, at <hi>VVincheſter</hi> the Mayor of the Towne, the very next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſent word to Sir <hi>VVilliam VValler,</hi> that the gates of the City
were open for him, and his comming expected, there being onely
100 in the caſtle whom an hundred of ours might eaſily keep in.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that the keeper of the priſon in <hi>VVincheſter</hi> was ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
with feare of Sir <hi>VVilliams</hi> comming, that he preſently ſet open
the priſon doores, and ſet 80 priſoners at liberty (taken as 'twas ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
at <hi>Rumſey</hi>) who came all to Sir <hi>VVilliam VValler.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that the enemy fled in ſuch feare and confuſion, that 50.
priſoners of the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſide (whom they had taken in the fight)
were by the enemies ſuffered to eſcape and return to their colours.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, that upon an alarum which they had at <hi>Andover,</hi> they
fled and left the Towne to the <hi>Parliaments</hi> forces whither Sir <hi>VVill.
Belfore</hi> comming,<note place="margin">The Lady <hi>Hopton</hi> and a traine of 200. taken by Sir <hi>Will. Belfore</hi> together with mony &amp; plate.</note> he heard that the Lady <hi>Hopton</hi> (wife to Sir <hi>R. Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>)

<hi>VVilliam Belfore;</hi> ſo was not the Honourable <hi>Lady Fairfax</hi> uſed at
<hi>Bradford</hi> in <hi>Yorkeſhire,</hi> though afterwards ſhe was onely and barely
ſent home.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, the taking of the ſaid <hi>Lady Hopton,</hi> ſo neer <hi>Redding,</hi> put
the garriſon at <hi>Redding</hi> into ſuch an affright and terrour that on the
3. of <hi>March</hi> the ſaid enemy quitted that great garriſon Town, and
the like in other garriſons alſo about <hi>Oxford</hi> and thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, that Sir <hi>VVilliam VValler</hi> purſued the enemy to <hi>Saliſbury,</hi>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:113334:103"/>
entred that Towne, and tooke there neere upon 500 Armes, and
made all the <hi>Cathedrall men</hi> run for feare of after-claps.</p>

to raiſe men for <hi>Hopton;</hi> Which partie went preſently after to
<hi>VVeymouth</hi> for farther deſignes. And now falſe and foul mouth'd
malignants judge, even ye your ſelves whether <hi>Hopton</hi> was not
ſoundly beaten, to ſuffer all this without leaſt reſiſtance, all this while
and ſo long away?</p>
            <p>One thing more of moment,<note place="margin">The <hi>Iſle of Wights</hi> memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and commendable Act of love to ſir <hi>VVilliam VVallers</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> I may not here pretermit for the
honour of the inhabitants of the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> neer <hi>Portſmouth, viz.</hi>
That ſince this routing of <hi>Hoptons</hi> forces, as aforeſaid, they not only
ſupplyed Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> army in a very large manner with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualls

ſent forth a partee which fell upon one of their quarters, at a place

               </note> But the Vigilant Colonell having timely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of his comming, ſallyed out of the Town to meet the
Enemy; after a little facing one another, Colonell <hi>Lambert</hi> warily
perceiving that the Enemy were too numerous a partee for him to
encounter with, thought it not ſafe to advance beyond his Works,
whereunto he diſcreetly retreated, and there maintained the fight
very valiantly, and beat off the aſſailants with their loſſe, having kil'd
and wounded ſo many that the Enemy was forced to a haſty retreat,
which the Valiant Colonel ſoon perceiving, purſued them therein,
at leaſt 6 miles, in which Action Colonell <hi>Lambert</hi> took 200 horſe

            <p>About the 8th. of this inſtant, we had certain Information by

worthy the obſervation, in what manner it was effected, which in
briefe was thus. It was ſent by parcells at 3 ſeverall times; the
firſt time, ſeverall barrels of Powder, Match, Flax, Brimſtone, and
ſome quantity of Money, were ſent by honeſt Carriers, with their
pack-horſes, about 14 in number; which were conveyed with a
guard of 60 Horſe:<note place="margin">A ſtrange mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake by night both by the Enemy and our Forces, yet the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition got ſafe to <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter.</hi>

paſt along) eſpied a fire in ſeverall places in a ſmall compaſſe, as they
conceited, which (out of ſodaine fear) they took to be the Enemy;
The Enemy alſo eſpied the ſame fire, and conceived that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Forces were there. The Parliaments Forces upon their fear,
wheeled about quite out of the way: the Enemy by reaſon of their
fear, haſtily retreated from them; but the honeſt Carriers (not
knowing, or once dreaming, but that the convoy of the <hi>Parliaments</hi>
Forces was before them) drove on their Horſes till they came to
one of Colonell <hi>Maſſeys</hi> outmoſt Garriſons, where the Ammnition
was joyfully received, and preſently convoyed into <hi>Glouceſter;</hi> but
the convoy turned to <hi>VVarwick</hi> with (onely) hopes (which bleſſed
be God afterward proved true) that the Ammunition came ſafely
to <hi>Glouceſter.</hi> The ſecond time alſo all that was ſent came ſafely
to them, without danger or diſturbance. The third time, when all
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:113334:106"/>
that was appointed for <hi>Glouceſter</hi> was ſent away, was alſo moſt
ſafely conveyed by Colonell <hi>Beare,</hi> who went with his Valiant
Troopes without fear of the fierceſt Enemie; who now had need
looke about them that they be not frighted with a worſe feare than

            <p>About the 10. alſo, of this inſtant <hi>April,</hi> came certaine intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence

the enemies leaving behind them all their armes and ammunition
and good ſtore of proviſion and rich plunder, all which was divided
among the ſouldiers to their great refreſhment and encouragement.

                  <head>A Letter ſent from the Right Honourable, the Lord
Fairfax, to the Committee of both Kingdomes: concerning
the great Victory, lately obtained (by Gods bleſſing)
at Selby in Yorkeſhire.</head>

                     <salute>My Lords,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>ACcording to the Orders ſent to mee and my Sonne from your
Lordſhips, we have now joyned our Forces together; and though
the Enemy held all the paſſages from the Eaſt-riding to the West, and
by that meanes intercepted divers of our Letters, and thereby became
acquainted with our appointments, and ſo endeavoured to prevent
them which forced me to decline <hi>Selby,</hi> and make a paſſage over the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:113334:108"/>
River, tenne miles below it, in <hi>Marſhland,</hi> where my Men and
Carriages being paſſed with ſome difficulty, on Sonday and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
laſt, I inſtantly marched with the whole Army, conſiſting of two
thouſand Horſe and Dragoones, and two thouſand Foot, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts,
to <hi>Ferry-Bridge,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Selby,</hi> where Colonell <hi>Iohn Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſyſs</hi>
(commanding in chiefe in <hi>Yorkeſhire</hi>) then lay, with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of fifteene hundred Horſe, and 1800 Foot, as themſelves confeſt,
though reports made it much more numerous.</p>
                  <p>Vpon Wedneſday, our Forlorn-hope of Horſe beat in a partee of the
Enemies Horſe, and followed them into the Towne, taking divers of
them priſoners, and the day being farre ſpent, I quartered the Army
within a mile of <hi>Selby</hi> that night, and drew them out againe early
the next morning, and then with the Foot in three Diviſions,
one led up by my ſelfe, a ſecond by Sir <hi>Iohn Meldrum,</hi> and a third
by Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Needham,</hi> fell upon the Towne, to ſtorm it in
three places altogether, where the Enemy received us with much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and made ſtrong reſiſtance for two houres, or thereabouts; but
in concluſion, my owne Foot Regiment forced a paſſage by the River
ſide, and my Sonne with his Regiment of Horſe ruſhed into the Town,
where he was encountred by Colonell <hi>Bellaſyſs,</hi> and the Enemies Horſe;
but they being beaten backe, and M. <hi>Bellaſyſs</hi> himſelfe wounded, and
taken priſoner, and our Foot entred on al ſides the Town, the Enemy was
wholly routed; and as many as could, ſaved themſelves by flight, ſome
towards <hi>Cawood,</hi> ſome towards <hi>Pontefract,</hi> and the reſt towards
<hi>Yorke,</hi> over the River by a bridge of Boates laid by themſelves; We
purſued them every way, and tooke in the Towne and chaſe, the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
Ordnance, Armes, Ammunitions, and Colours mentioned in
the Liſt incloſed.</p>
                  <p>Of my owne men, I loſt in the fight divers gallant Commanders and
Souldiers, and very many ſore wounded; And indeed, all my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
both Commanders, and Common ſouldiers, behaved themſelves
with as much courage as ever I obſerved in men.</p>
                  <p>All which we muſt acknowledge to God alone, who both infuſeth
courage, and gives Victory where he pleaſeth: I ſhall now, I hope, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to raiſe more Forces in the Countrey, and improve this Victory that
God hath beſtowed on us, to the beſt advantage. This being all for the
preſent, untill further occaſion, I reſt</p>

            <p>About the 20. of this inſtant <hi>April,</hi> came certaine intelligence
by letters to the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Scotch-Commiſſioners,</hi> from our loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

<hi>Hartlepoole</hi> and <hi>Durham,</hi> where they found reaſonable good
quarter for their horſe, reſolving to abide thereabout till they made
the enemy either fight or fly. Thoſe quarters they kept till about the
10. or 12. of <hi>April,</hi> when as (after a faſt kept the day before) they

his ſouldiers to decreaſe upon the approach of danger, hee drew as
many forces as could be ſpared out of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and <hi>Lumley-caſtle</hi>
to uphold his ſtrength of foot; but finding all would not doe, and
not a litle plunged &amp; perplexed at the news from <hi>Selby,</hi> and that the
noble Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> had obtained ſuch a full, conſiderable, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
victory, which was on the 11. of <hi>April;</hi> He upon the 13. of
the ſame was now enforced to remove his whole force and ſtrength,
and that in great haſt too, and left <hi>Durham</hi> to our <hi>Brethren of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and leaving behind him his troubleſome luggage and proviſion
and great quantity of victuals, and directed his march <hi>Weſtward.</hi>
The noble and vigilant Generall <hi>Leſley</hi> omitted no time in purſuite of

being now by this time ready to joyne with the ever honoured

            </p>
            <p>And it was enformed to the <hi>Parliament</hi> about the 22 of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

cloſe, and to ſit upon his skirts as ſoone as any advantagious op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity

was forthwith ſent from the <hi>Parliament</hi> and the <hi>Committee of both

and to attend this <hi>Prince Robbers</hi> removes, and by waiting for all
advantages, if it were poſſible, to force him to fight (which 't was

and therewith an order was made immediately for a ſpeedy ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>About the 25. of this inſtant, came letters to the <hi>Parliament</hi>

            <p>And about the 26. of this inſtant, came letters out of the <hi>North</hi>

got all their Muskets, and about 7 pounds in money, and impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

were nothing but tumults in <hi>London,</hi> and unruly Voting, which
was the cauſe that they themſelves had deſerted that pretended

That they conceived their Lordſhips at <hi>Oxford</hi> were not ſo
great ſtrangers to their proceedings, as not to know that their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
into <hi>England</hi> was not intended, till all other meanes were
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:113334:112"/>
firſt aſſayed and diſappointed. That they will not deny the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Parliament</hi> to ayde them; and that not onely out of pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to ſee <hi>England</hi> bleed, but out of ſenſe of the danger of their
owne Religion and Lawes, they had thus, as a maine cauſe, taken
up Armes at this preſent; that they hold not the invitation of the

are wanting thence, or others are gone beyond the Seas, (having ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wilfully deſerted the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or been expelled thence for

for Reformation of Religion, for redreſſe of grievances, and the
happy ſettlement of the great affaires of that Kingdome, and which
was indicted by his Majeſtie for theſe ends, &amp; is ratified by a ſpeciall
Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> not to be raiſed without adviſe and conſent of
both <hi>Houſes,</hi> as null and void; and that thoſe who ſtay in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
are not a ſufficient number without them at <hi>Oxford,</hi> is more
than they can apprehend. And as they are more deepely affected
with unfeined griefe, for theſe unhappy differences betweene his
Majeſtie and his Subjects, and more ſenſibly touched with the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of their Brethren, than deſirous to judge of the Lawes and

his owne colours and two battering pieces; he ſent a trumpet to
fetch off the body of Colonell <hi>Strangewayes,</hi> and tooke one away
whom they ſaid was the man: Theſe two Captaines likewiſe infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that the enemy had made above a 1000 great ſhot againſt the

they had formerly ſaved out of their ſea-allowance. They did alſo

My Lord and the ſhips with him, determined to ſpare them

But God afterward corrected their daring and preſumptuous cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The garriſon being much encouraged by this good ſucceſſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to proſecute their former purpoſe of ſallying out, and in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
thereof, the 300 men were ſent ſafely on ſhore, though to

other places about 6 miles from <hi>Lyme,</hi> that the Enemies opinion of
our landing men in thoſe parts might draw off the horſe, whereby
the ſally might be more ſecure and advantageous. And ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
immediately after, the ſhips and boates were ſent out, at a
time ſignified from the Towne by ſhooting off a gun from <hi>Daves-Fort;</hi>
and giving an alarum on the <hi>Eaſt-ſhoar,</hi> they obtained
what was in deſigne. For, all the day long 4 or 5 troopes of horſe
and ſome hundreds of Foot attended the moving of the ſhips and
boates, from whence divers great ſhot and ſmall ſhot played on
them, which forced the Enemy to caſt up a breſt-worke by the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
for their defence.<note place="margin">The Enemy was miſtaken &amp; fruſtrated of his hopes.</note> Now, the Enemy miſtooke our intention,
ſuppoſing that theſe boats had in the night taken men out of the
Towne with purpoſe to ſet them on ſhore, to get proviſions into
the Town; or to fall on the reare and thereby thinking the Town to
be weakned; and therefore on the ſame day appointed by the Town
for they ſally aforeſaid, they aſſaulted the Town with great fury,
from about 6 at night, to about 8 of the clocke, in all which time,
there was ſuch a continuall peal of ſmall and great ſhot, that the
Town ſeemed to be all on a flame; Twice the Enemy made an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
retreat,<note place="margin">A very furious Aſſault upon the Towne, bravely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</note> appearing each time in a body of about a 1000 men.
The third aſſault was moſt violent the Enemy advancing with brave
reſolution and being as gallantly received by the Townſmen. A
litle after 8 of the clocke there was a remitting of the former fury,
and about 9 almoſt a generall ſilence. There were ſlain of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in this aſſault (as ſome of the Town clearly computed) at leaſt
400;<note place="margin">The number of the ſlain in this Aſſault.</note> and of the garriſon, not above 6 or 7 at the moſt killed and
wounded, whereof Major <hi>Townſend</hi> was one, who was ſhot in
the head, but was alive at the firſt relation hereof. Among the ſlain
of the Enemies, there was found one Gentleman that came that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
from <hi>Exeter</hi> with letters for <hi>Oxford,</hi> whither he would fain
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:113334:129"/>

                           <note place="margin">The enemies be fooled in reckoning without their hoaſt.</note> but God prevented
him, both in his journey and newes, and the letters were found in
his pocket and ſent to <hi>London,</hi> the principall thing imparted in them
being, That they found the wayes to <hi>Oxford</hi> began to be obſtructed;
that the <hi>Queene</hi> was better (I hardly believe it) than formerly, and
much comforted in Doctor <hi>Miroons</hi> comming unto her. But to
proceed.</p>
                        <p>At laſt there was a parley ſent to the Towne,<note place="margin">The enemies ſtomacke, now come downe.</note> the Enemy now
deſiring leave to bury their dead, which before they had ſcorned.
And about this time came ſome more reliefe to the Towne by Sea;
in the afternoone of which day, the Enemy had fired the Towne,
yet but;<note place="margin">The enemies rage in firing the Towne.</note> houſes burnt; and afterward againe another part of the
Towne was fired, which flame and combuſtion increaſed ſo as to
burn down twenty new houſes there.</p>
                        <p>And now, you may eaſily judge the ſtate of poor <hi>Lyme,</hi> but if
you had ſeene it, as it was continually before us, your eyes certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
would have beene much affected, conſidering that ſuch brave
and gallant ſpirits, very worth a whole nation, indeed, ſhould bee
the ſubjects on which the rage and madneſſe of a baſe and cruell

                        <p>And to manifeſt this the more cleerly, I may not here omit, that
at the late ſtorming of this Town, one woman ſhot off 16 muskets

very few had either the comfort of convenient lodging, or food our

                        <p>Upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> morning, a Partie of the Enemies Horſe, having

                        <p>Before our Foot could get backe, (which was about two or three

and had, in many ſmall Bodies, beſpread themſelves,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:113334:141"/>
that their Armie did extend two miles (as its judged) in length:
yea, by the improving of this opportunity, they had by divers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
of <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> ſo lined the bedges &amp; ditches betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and us, that our Souldiers could not aſſault them, without ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great apparent prejudice. We were compelled to draw up our
Army, and to place it in <hi>Battalia,</hi> in a large Field of Rie, where the
height of the Corne, together with the ſhoures of raine which then
fell, proved no ſmall inconvenience unto our Souldiers; yet being on
an hill, we had the double advantage of the ground, and the wind.
Here the noble Commander, Generall <hi>Leſſey,</hi> exerciſed his Martiall
abilities, with unwearied activity and induſtry: He haſted from
place to place, to put all his Forces in Battell array, which hee did

                        <p>How goodly a ſight was this to behold, when three mighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
each of which conſiſted of above 20000 Horſe and Foot,
did with flying Colours prepare for the Battell, and looke each other
in the face.</p>
                        <p>The Poſture of our Army, when drawne up, was this: Moſt
of Generall <hi>Leſley</hi> his Horſe, together with the Horſe of the Lord
<hi>Fairfax,</hi> made the right wing. The Earle of <hi>Mancheſters</hi> Horſe,
with ſome of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Horſe, were the left wing. Generall <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleyes</hi>
Foot were on the right hand, the Earle of <hi>Manceſters</hi> Foot
were on the left hand of the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> his Foot, who were the
Body. There were three or foure Brigads placed for a Reſerve.</p>
                        <p>Our Army being thus marſhalled, toward ſixe or ſeven of the
clock, we advanced about 200 paces toward the Enemy; Our Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
(which had played one or two houres before, from the top of

                        <p>Upon our coole and recollected thoughts, ſuch of us as deſired

done for the Kingdome: And he often earneſtly intreated them, to
give the honour of their Victory unto God alone. He alſo further
told them, that although he could not poſſibly that night, make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
for them, according to their deſerts, and neceſſities; yet,
that he would without faile, endeavour their full ſatisfaction in that

they long faſted, and were faint; yet they would willingly want
three dayes longer, rather than give off the Service, or leave his
Lordſhip.</p>
                        <p>That might we kept the Feild, when the Bodies of the dead were

when the naked bodies of thouſands lay upon the ground, and
many were not altogether dead, but lay groaning and gaſping

                        <p>We judged that the number of the ſlaine was at the leaſt 3000 of

bury the dead Corps) told us, they, for certaine, buried 4150 bodies,
and we beleeve (as its moſt probable) they were beſt able to know
the truth, by the burying of them. Of which 4150, two thirds
were aſſured to be Gentlemen, and perſons of quality, that is almoſt
2000; which (as reverend Maſter <hi>Aſh</hi> ſaid) was the more eaſily
believed, by reaſon of the very white and ſmoth skinnes of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dead bodies in the field apparently ſeene when they were ſtript.
And that thoſe of quality, ſlain in this fight, might be taken away and
have a more honourable buriall than the reſt, if their friends pleaſed;
Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> was deſired (as was credibly enformed) to goe

them, forced for haſte, to returne diſorderly to the fight, and ere

            <p>Upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> the Enemy went out of the Town, according to

according to command, went from place to place, to prevent
the doing of any wrong to the Enemies, as they marched away.
That morning very early, as I ſhould have told you before, all the
Souldiers in the Royall Fort, which is a curious and ſtrong worke,
poſſeſſed with needleſſe feare, did run away, and left their Armes
behinde them.</p>
            <p>The fourth part of them, at leaſt, who marched out of the Town
were women, many very poore in their apparell, and others in
better faſhion. Moſt of the men had filled, and diſtempered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with drink; the number of the Souldiers, as we conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured,
was not above a thouſand, beſides the ſick and wounded
perſons.</p>
            <p>When the Enemies were departed, our three Generalls went
together into the City, attended with many of their Officers. The
firſt houſe they entred, was the <hi>Minster-Church,</hi> where <hi>A

having private notice thereof in their march that way diſpatched
600 Horſe thither preſently, 300 whereof were to come in upon
one ſide of the Town, and the other to wheele about and to come in
by the other way upon the Enemies Rear; upon the comming in of
the firſt party of the Enemies, ours began to retreat, and the Enemies
thinking they fled began to follow them; But inſtantly they were
ſet upon by our other party, which wheeled about upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

               <note place="margin">Eze. 32. 2, 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>Our proud Enemies were like young Lyons

over them, with a company of many people, who brought them up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:113334:158"/>
all the beaſts of the land had been filled with them;</hi> as thoſe inhumane

I will remember his Wonders of old and of late,<note place="margin">Pſal. 77. 11, 12. 14, 15.</note> I will meditate alſo of

ſtrength among the people; Thou haſt with thy ſtrong arme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed

(as the ſame Pſalmograph,<note place="margin">Pſal. 118. 8, 9.</note> ſweetely) to truſt in the Lord, than
to put confidence in man: Yea it is better to truſt in the Lord, than to
put confidence in princes. And who (then) would not feare thee, O

            <p>Finally, therefore (good Reader) to ſhut up all, all that I can ſay
herein, (having ſaid ſo much already in my two former parts of this
