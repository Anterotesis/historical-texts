            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> it was then that <hi>your</hi> grace, in the session of the land, and Committee of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, there taking notice of these enormous wrongs, did doe me justice. Much about the same time, when some Ministers had maimed my rents, to strengthen their own stipends: <hi>your</hi> reverence, sitting in the commission of the Kirk, were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to take my part against them, and patrocinate my cause. By <hi>your</hi> highnesse also, sitting then at the helm of the State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when a grievance for the pressure sustained by me, was in all humility put in before the said Committee of Estates, was I maintained against the crueltie, and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of those, did overrate me in the exaction of publick dues, And finally, when by the oppression of some ill affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted countrey men, under pretext of Committee acts, my vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals, and tenants had suffered extreme prejudice, streight upon the presenting of a petition thereanent, whereof at least a hundred, at several times were tabled: <hi>your</hi> wisdome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied the plaintif, and did for my cause redresse the injuries done unto him.</p>
            <p>That with these benevolences; as the most eminent effects of your ingenuitie, I should (as affairs then ruled) be gratified by <hi>your</hi> liberalitie, was from day to day, my constant expectation; being always perswaded to the greater probability of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of them, that in many sound, and wel-grounded opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mine, long before that time, <hi>you</hi> frequently jumped with me; for when I openly said, that Presbyterie was like to turn to a Hydral Episcopacie, and that the gallantry of the <hi>English</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would never comport with such a government (which Speech was thought should have been asserted by all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and Gentlemen of <hi>Scotland) you</hi> out of <hi>your</hi> goodness, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them all (being sensible of the heavie yoke of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratical
<pb facs="tcp:99635:4"/>
tyrannie of the Kirk) were pleased to justify my sayings. Besides this, when the intending of one thing, and pretending of another, was by me a thousand times foretold to prove destructive unto <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that the cause of God could not produce Diabolical effects: <hi>Your</hi> holiness, amongst the Zelots of the Nation, did give way to beleeve the truth of both. And when moreover I avouched, that money should never be held in such estimation, that either to honestie, or a good name, any summe, however so great, ought to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: <hi>Your</hi> discretion, amidst many of the Ecclesiastical Armie, did in very <hi>deed</hi> acknowledge the veritie of the saying, although verbally <hi>you</hi> denyed it. And at last, when to be charitable to distressed men, whose misery could not with reason be imputed to their own fault, was by me represented to be an especial act of goodness, <hi>you,</hi> out of <hi>your</hi> love, amongst the <hi>Scotish</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants condescended to it.</p>
            <p>Whereby most seriously perpending the manifold, or rather <hi>innumerable</hi> testimonies of your <hi>goodness, holiness, grace, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, wisdome, liberalitie, reverence, mercie, pietie, generosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, magnificence, love,</hi> and other unexpressible <hi>respects,</hi> I have perceived to flow from <hi>your highness</hi> in behalf of me, whether I applyed my self to the <hi>Nobilitie, Souldierie, Gentrie, Clergie,</hi> or <hi>Burger</hi> degree of the <hi>Consistorian partie</hi> of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I must needs promise (in acquital of these <hi>incom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cially in the facility of contriving expressions for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, the mind of man is able to afford. He plainly setteth down the analogie, that ought to be betwixt things, and words; and that, to make a perfect Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, things semblable in nature, should be signifyed by words of a like pronunciation. He proveth all hitherto known tongues, to be full of imperfection, both by reason of the insufficiencie of their Alphabets, and for that there are many common things, which cannot, without circumlocution, be expressed by them. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth the learned Languages with one another: giveth freely his opinion of all vernacularie tongues: and demonstrateth an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal defect in all, and each of both the one, and other, because of the common necessity they are driven unto, of mutual borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for conveniencie of elocu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Author also, in this Book, utterly rejecteth the vulgarly received opinion of the origin of Languag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, and very neatly twits the opposers of those curious arts, where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n there is no harm. He confuteth that disproportion in matter of number twixt words, and things, wherewith the smattrers in knowledge, would cloak their inability of giving unto every thing its proper term: and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb facs="tcp:99635:5"/>
how for the advancement of Learning, and Vertue, &amp; clearing the mind of all prejudicat tenets, the brains, and heart should be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of malice, and wilful ignorance, the two plagues of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: the bad acquitals, he hath received from some great men of his own Countrey, he but glanceth at, to incordiat other his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, with more respect in times coming, to men of no lesse desert: &amp; declareth what injury, to that deity, unto which the heavens are subservient, is done by those lazie Sciolists, who frequently seek after supernatural causes, where the natural is obvious to the eyes of our understanding.</p>
            <p>The Author likewise, setteth forth in this Book, the possibility of framing a new <hi>idiome</hi> of far greater perfection, then any hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto spoken, and that the performance of such an undertaking will without doubt exceedingly conduce to the benefit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of all ingenious Schollars. By its Logopandocie, or comprehension of all utterable words, and sounds articulat, he evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceth the universality of the proposed Language, and by infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reason proveth whilst there is no other world, but this, the impossibility of forming any other such.</p>
            <p>Lastly, The Author, after his delivery of a genuine and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right gloss, on three passages of <hi>Solomon, Terence,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> in confutation of some Scholiasts, Idolizers of corrupt antiquitie, who had mis-interpreted those texts, concerning the nature of new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, most manifestly avoucheth, that exquisit inventions will never be wanting, so long as good spirits are extant on the earth: and, in concluding this his first Book with sixtie and six several advantages, this Language hath above all other, exposeth to the view of the judicious Reader, many inestimable secrets, worthie the perusal of the best wits of the time.</p>

            <head>The first BOOK OF THE INTRODVCTION To the Universall Language, intituled NEAUDETHAUMATA. OR Wonders of the new SPEECH, which, as a Preface thereto, comprehendeth its most necessary <hi>Prenoscendas,</hi> together with some Miscellanie Articles concerning the AUTHOR himself.</head>
            <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ords are the signes of things; it being to signifie that they were instituted at first: nor can they be, as such, directed to any other end, whether they be articulate or inarticulate.</p>
            <p n="2">2, All things are either real or rational: and the real, either naturall or artificial.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There ought to be a proportion betwixt the sign and thing signified; therefore should all things, whether real or rationall, have their proper words assigned unto them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Man is called a <hi>Microcosme,</hi> because he may by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and words containe within him the representatives of what in the whole world is comprehended.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:99635:6"/>5 Seeing there is in nature such affinity 'twixt words &amp; things, (as there ought to be in whatsoever is ordained for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) that Language is to be accounted most conform to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which with greatest variety expresseth all manner of things.</p>
            <p n="6">6. As all things of a single compleat being, by <hi>Aristotle</hi> into ten Classes were divided; so may the words whereby those things are to be signified, be set apart in their several storehouses.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Arts, Sciences, Mechanick Trades, notionall faculties, and whatever is excogitable by man, have their own Method; by vertue whereof, the Learned of these latter times have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly digested them: Yet hath none hitherto considered of a mark, whereby words of the same Faculty, Art, Trade, or Science should be dignosced from those of another by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sound of the word at the first hearing.</p>
            <p n="8">8. A Tree will be known by its leaves, a stone by its grit, a Flower by the smel, Meats by the taste, Musick by the ear, Colours by the eye, the severall Natures of things, with their properties and essentiall qualities, by the Intellect: and accordingly as the things are in themselves diversified, the Iudicious and Learned men after he hath conceived them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, sequestreth them in the Severall cels of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing each in their definite and respective places.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But in matter of the words whereby those things are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, no Language ever hitherto framed, hath observed any order relating to the thing signified by them: for if the words be ranked in their Alphabeticall series, the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by them will fall to be in severall predicaments; and if the things themselves be categorically classed, the word whereby they are made known will not be tyed to any Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betical rule.</p>
            <p n="10">10. This is an imperfection incident to all the Languages that ever yet have been known, by reason whereof, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Tongues are said to be hard to learn; and when obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned easily forgot.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The effigies of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the likenesse of a Bull, should be liker to that of <hi>Io</hi> metamorphosed into a Cow, then to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99635:6"/>
statue of <hi>Bucephulus,</hi> which was a horse: and the picture of <hi>Alcibiades</hi> ought to have more resemblance with that of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolanus,</hi> being both handsome men, then with the Image of <hi>Thersites,</hi> who was of a deformed feature: just so should things semblable in Nature be represented by words of a like composure: and as the true intelligible species do present unto our minds the similitude of things as they are in the object; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven so ought the words expressive of our conceptions so to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or vary in their contexture, as the things themselves which are conceived by them do in their natures.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Besides this imperfection in all Languages there is yet another, That no Language upon the face of the earth hath a perfect Alphabet; one lacking those letters which another hath, none having all, and all of them <hi>in cumulo</hi> lacking some, But that which makes the defect so much the greater, is, that these same few consonants and vowels commonly made use of, are never by two Nations pronounced after the same fashion; the French A with the English, being the Greek <hi>Hra</hi>; and the Italian B with the Spanish, the Hebrew Vau.</p>
            <p n="13">13. This is that which maketh those of one dominion so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful in the <hi>idiome</hi> of another; and after many yeers abode in a strange land, despair from attaining at any time to the perfect accent of the language thereof, because as the waters of that stream cannot be wholesome; whose source is corrupted; nor the superstructure sure, whereof the ground-work is ruinous: so doth the various manner of pronouncing one and the same Alphabet in severall Nations, produce this great and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble obstruction in the Discipline of Languages.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The G of the Latin word <hi>legit,</hi> is after four several manners pronounced by the English, French, Spanish, and Dutch: the Ch likewise is differently pronounced by divers Nations; some uttering it after the fashion of the Hebrew Shin, as the French do in the word <hi>chasteau, chascun, chastier, chatel</hi>; or like the Greek Kappa, as in the Italian words, <hi>chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere, chiazzarė, chinatura</hi>; or as in <hi>Italy</hi> are sounded the words <hi>ciascheduno, ciarlatano</hi>; for so do the Spanish and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish pronounce it, as in the words <hi>achaque, leche, chamber, chance:</hi> other Nations of a gutteral flexibility, pronounce it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99635:7"/>
the fashion of the Greek χ. Nor need we to labor for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in other letters; for there is scarce any hitherto recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, either consonant or vowel, which in some one and other taking in all Nations, is not pronounced after three or four se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral fashions.</p>
            <p n="15">15. As the Alphabets are imperfect, some having but 19 letters, others 22. and some 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. few exceeding that number: so do the words composed of those Letters in the several Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, come far short of the number of things, which to have the reputation of a perfect tongue, ought to be expressed by them.</p>
            <p n="16">16. For supply of this deficiencie, each Language borrows from another; nor is the perfectest amongst them, without being beholden to another, in all things enunciable, bastant to afford instruction: many Astronomical and Medicinal terms have the Greeks borrowed from the Arabians, for which they by exchange have from the Grecians received payment of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words naturalized in their Physical, Logical, and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical Treatises. As for the Latin, it oweth all its Scienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick dictions to the Greek and Arabick: yet did the Roman Conquest give adoption to many Latin words, in both these languages, especially in matters of military discipline, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Law.</p>
            <p n="17">17. And as for all other Languages as yet spoke, though to some of them be ascribed the title of original Tongues, I may safely avouch there is none of them which of it self alone is able to afford the smattring of an elocution fit for indoctrinating of us in the precepts and maxim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of moral and intellectual vertues.</p>
            <p n="18">18. But which is more, and that which most of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth the sterility of all the Languages that since the Deluge have been spoke, though all of them quintesenced in one, capable of the perfections of each, yet that one so befitted and accommodated for compendiousness and variety of phrase, should not be able, amidst so great wealth, to afford, without circumlocution, the proper and convenient representation of a thing, yea of many thousands of things, whereof each should be expressed with one single word alone.</p>
            <p n="19">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:99635:7"/>19. Some Languages have copiousness of discourse, which are barren in composition: such is the Latine. Others are compendious in expression, which hardly have any flexion at all: of this kind are the Dutch, the English, and Irish.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Greek hath the agglutinative faculty of incorporating words; yet runneth not so glib in Poesie as doth the Latine, though far more abundant. The Hebrew likewise, with its auxiliary Dialects of Arabiek, Caldean, Syriack, Aethiopian, and Samaritan, compoundeth prettily, and hath some store of words; yet falleth short by many stages of the Greek.</p>
            <p n="21">21. The French, Spanish, and Italians, are but Dialects of the Latine, as the English is of the Saxon Tongue; though with this difference, that the mixture of Latine with the Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, Moresco, and Gotish Tongues, make up the three first Languages; but the meer qualification of the Saxon with the old British, frameth not the English to the full, for that, by its promiscuous and ubiquitary borrowing, it consisteth almost of all Languages: which I speak not in dispraise thereof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I may with confidence avere, that were all the four a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid Languages stript of what is not originally their own, we should not be able with them all, in any part of the world, to purchase so much as our breakfast in a Market.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Now to return from these to the learned Languages; we must acknowledge it to be very strange, why, after thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of yeers continual practice in the polishing of them by men of approved faculties, there is neither in them, nor any other Tongue hitherto found out, one single word expressive of the vice opposite either to Temperance or Chastity in the defect; though many rigid Monks, even now adays, be guilty of the one, as <hi>Diogenes</hi> of old was of the other.</p>
            <p n="23">23. But that which makes this disease the more incurable, is, that when an exuberant spirit would to any high researched conceit adapt a peculiar word of his own coyning, he is bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Incivility, if he apologize not for his boldness, with a <hi>Quod ita dixerim parcant Ciceronianae manes, Ignoscat De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenis genius,</hi> and other such phrases acknowledging his fault of making use of words never uttered by others, or at least by such as were most renowned for eloquence.</p>
            <p n="24">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:99635:8"/>24. Though Learning sustain great prejudice by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of liberty to endenizon new Citizens in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Languages, yet do I conceive the reason thereof to proceed from this, That it is thought a less incongruity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press a thing by circumlocution, then by appropriating a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle word thereto, to transgress the bounds of the Language; as in Architecture it is esteemed an error of less consequence to make a circuitory passage from one room to another, then by the extravagancie of an irregular sallie, to frame projectures disproportionable to the sound of the house.</p>
            <p n="25">25. Thus is it, that as according to the largeness of the plat of a building, and compactedness of its walls, the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master contriveth his roofs, platforms, outjettings, and other such like parts and portion of the whole: just so, conform to the extent and reach which a Language in its flexions and compositions hath obtained at first, have the sprucest Linguists, hitherto been pleased to make use of the words thereto belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.</p>
            <p n="26">26. The Bonification and virtuification of <hi>Lully, Scotu</hi>'s Hexeity, and Albedineity of <hi>Suarez</hi> are words exploded by those that affect the purity of the Latine diction; yet if such were demanded, what other no less concise expression would comport with the neatness of that language, their answer would be <hi>altum silentium</hi>: so easie a matter it is for many to finde fault with what they are not able to amend.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Nevertheless, why for representing to our understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings the essence of accidents, the fluency of the form as it is <hi>in fieri</hi>; the faculty of the Agent, and habit that facilitates it, with many thousands of other such expressions, the tearms are not so genuine, as of the members of a mans body, or utensils of his house; the reason is, because the first inventers of Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, who contrived them for necessity, were not so profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly versed in Philosophical quiddities, as those that succeeded after them; whose literature increasing, procured their excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion beyond the representatives of the common objects, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their forefathers.</p>
            <p n="28">28. I have known some to have built houses for necessity, having no other aime before their eyes, but barely to dwell
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99635:8"/>
in them; who nevertheless in a very short space were so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, that after they had taken pleasure to polish and adorn, what formerly they had but rudely squared, their moveables so multiplyed upon them, that they would have wished they had made them of a larger extent.</p>
            <p n="29">29. Even so though these Languages may be refined by some quaint derivatives and witty compositions; like the stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king forth of new lights and doors, outjetting of Crenels, ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of prickets, barbicans, and such like various structures upon one and the same foundation; yet being limited to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain basis, beyond which the versed in them must not pass, they cannot roam at such random as otherwise they might, had their Language been of a larger scope at first.</p>
            <p n="30">30. Thus albeit Latine be far better polished now, then it was in the days of <hi>Ennius,</hi> and <hi>Livius Andronicus,</hi> yet had the Latinists at first been such Philosophers as afterward they were, it would have attained to a great deal of more perfection then it is at for the present.</p>
            <p n="31">31. What I have delivered in freedome of the learned Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, I would not have wrested to a sinister sense, as if I meant any thing to their disparagement; for truly I think the time well bestowed, which boyes in their tender yeers employ towards the learning of them, in a subordination to the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things that in them are couched.</p>
            <p n="32">32. But ingenuously I must acknowledge my averseness of opinion from those who are so superstitiously addicted to these Languages, that they account it learning enough to speak them, although they knew nothing else; which is an errour worthy rebuke, seeing <hi>Philosophia sunt res, non verba</hi>; and that whatever the signes be, the things by them signified ought still to be of greater worth.</p>
            <p n="33">33. For it boots not so much, by what kind of tokens any matter be brought into our minde, as that the things made known unto us, by such representatives, be of some considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble value: not much unlike the Innes-a-court-gentlemen at <hi>London,</hi> who usually repairing to their commons at the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a horn, are better pleased with such a signe (so the fare be good) then if they were warned to courser cates, by the sound of a Bell or Trumpet.</p>

Another reason prompteth me thereto, which is this, That in this frozen Climate of ours, there is hardly any that is not possessed with the opinion, that not only the three fore-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Languages, but a great many other, whom they call Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals (whereof they reckon ten or eleven in Europe, and some fifty eight more, or thereabouts, in other Nations) were at the confusion of Babel, immediately from God, by a miracle, infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into men; being induced to believe this, not so much for that they had not perused the interpretation of the Rabbies on that text, declaring the misunderstanding whereunto the builders were involved by diversity of speech, to have proceeded from nothing else, but their various and diserepant pronunciation of one and the same Language, as that they deemed Languages to be of an invention so sublime, that naturally the wit of man was not able to reach their composure.</p>
            <p n="35">35. Some believe this so pertinaciously that they esteem all men infidels that are of another faith; whilst in the mean while, I may confidently assever, that the assertors of such a tenet, doe thereby extremely dishonour God, who doing whatever is done, by nature, as the actions of an Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor (as an Ambassador) are reputed to be those of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign that sent him, would not have the power he hath given to nature to be disclaimed by any, or any thing said by us in derogation thereof.</p>
            <p n="36">36. Should we deny our obedience to the just decree of an inferiour judge, because he from whom his authority is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, did not pronounce the sentence? Subordinate Magistrates have their power, even in great maters; which to decline, by saying, they have no authority, should make the averrer fall within the compass of a breach of the Statute called <hi>scandalum magnatum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="37">37. There are of those with us, that wear gowns and beards longer then ever did <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Aesculapius</hi>; who when they see an Eclipse of the Sun or Moon, or a comet in the aire, straight would delude the commons with an opinion that those things are immediately from God; for the sins of the people; as if no naturall cause could be produced for such like apparitions.</p>
            <p n="38">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:99635:9"/>38 I saw once a young man, who for his cunning convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the Feats of Leger Demaine, was branded, by some of that Fry, for Sorcery, and another (for being able, by vertue of the Masson word, to make a Masson, whom he had never seene before, without speaking, or any other apparent signe, come, and salute him) reputed, by many of the same Litter, to have had a familiar, their grosse ignorance mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them, to call that supernaturall, or above the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reach of meere man, whereof they knew not the cause.</p>
            <p n="39">39 By which meanes, Mathematicall Thaumaturgies, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall magick, secrets of nature, and other Philosophicall mysteries, being esteemed to be rancke Witch-craft, they ruine the best part of Learning, and make their owne unskill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes Supreame Judge, to passe an Irrevocable sentence upon the Condemnation of knowledge.</p>
            <p n="40">40 The matter notwithstanding would be of lesse danger, were this the worst: but to this ignorance of theirs, is conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant so much wickednes, that when an action of any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary performance, is done, although by a man of a most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable conversation &amp; to a very good end, such as the curing of the diseased, or releeving men out of apparent peril, yet if the cause thereof be unknowne to them, they will not be so charitable, as to attribute the effect to a good Angel, albeit their faith obliege them to beleeve, that the Spirits belonging to any of the nine celestiall orders, are, for the atchievement of such masteries, in nothing inferior to the infernall Demons: but instead of <hi>Gabriell, Raphaell, Michaell,</hi> and such good Spirits, by whom (I think) it is more prob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="41">41 Truly, those two qualities of Ignorance, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes conjoyned, are of such pernicious consequence, that no Nation, or Common-wealth, wherein they get footing, is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99635:10"/>
able long to subsist, for rapine, coveteousnes, and extortion, flowing from the one, as from the other, doth all manner of Basenes, Pusillanimity, and cowardize, ignorance affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth the Braine, and wickednes the Heart: Yet both the Braine, and Heart of a common weale, by the mischei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously vnskillfull, and illiterately, malicious, are equally depraved.</p>
            <p n="42">42 For remedy of so generall a Calamity, seeing universa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity hath its existence in individualls, would each amend but one, the totall would be quickly rid of this Lamentable infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p n="43">43 Therefore, since ever I understood any thing, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the welfare of the Body of a government, consisteth in the intirenes of its noble parts, I alwayes endeavoured to employ the best of my Brain, and Heart towards the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Honour of that Country, unto which I did owe my birth.</p>
            <p n="44">44 In prosecuting whereof, as the heart is <hi>primum vivent</hi> so was it my heart, which, in my younger years, before my braines were ripened for eminent undertakings, gave me the courage for adventuring in a forrain Climat, thrice to enter the Lists against men of 3 severall nations, to vindicate my native Country from the Calumnies, wherewith they had aspersed it, wherein it pleased God so to conduct my fortune, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had disarmed them, they in such sort acknowledged their Error, and the obligation they did owe me, for sparing their Lives, which justly by the Law of Arms I might have taken, that in Lieu of three enemies, that formerly they were, I acquired three constant Friends, both to my selfe, and my compatriots, whereof, by severall gallant testimonies, they gave evident proofe, to the Improvement of my Countreys credit, in many occasions.</p>
            <p n="45">45 As my Heart, hath been thus devoted to the love of my native soile, so have my Braines, to the Honour thereof discharged so much duty, that betwixt what is printed, and what ready for the presse, I have set forth above a hundred severall Bookes, on Subjects never hitherto thought upon by any.</p>
            <p n="46">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:99635:10"/>46. Let no man think, that I have spoke this in hope of future benefit, or by way of regret,<note place="margin">S. d.

            <p n="47">47. Could any man imagine, I should have been singled out amongst all those of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to, suffer most prejudice, without a Cause; that the wickedest of all the Land, should be permitted to possesse the best part of my Inheritance, vnder colour of a law by meer iniquity: and other, little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then he, to gape after the remainder, without any fault of mine.</p>
            <p n="48">48. who would think, that, some of my Tenants (whilst I was from home) being killed, and neer upon three thousand pound sterlin worth of Goods taken from them, by a pack of villaines, who could pretend for their robery no other excuse, but that they had been plundered by others, no reparation or justice should be granted, although oftentimes demanded: that I should be extorsed, in matter of publique dues, beyond any of my neighbours: that a garrison should be placed within my house, and kept there ten months together, to my almost utter undoing, upon no other pretence, but that the stance thereof is stately, and the house it selfe of a notable good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, and contrivance, and in the mean while, a party both of horse and foot remain nevertheles quartered upon my lands till the remotest Highlands should pay their sesse-mony: that neighbor Garisons, besides my own, should by parties inforce me, upon their Governours bare tickets, to furnish them with what provisions they pleased, and yet nothing thereof be allowed unto me, although I presented a Bill to that purpose to the Scots Committee of Estates, as I did forthe quartering of severall Troops of horse, for many months together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any allowance.</p>
            <p n="49">49. These grievous pressures with many other, and as

many more I have sustained by the ministry of the Land, whereof I make account in the large treatise of my Aporrexises to give notice more at length, have occasiond this digression in a part, which likewise having proceeded from a serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the two aforesaid scurvie quallities, that move the Inhabitants of this Ile to run every foot to superna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ural causes, engageth me to say, that as it is a maxim in Philosophy, that <hi>entia non sunt multiplicanda sine necessitate.</hi> So: that it is no lesse in congruity to avouch, that a thing hath miraculously been done by God, or that for atchievement thereof the help of an evill Spirit (because of his being reputed of more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then man) hath been required thereto, when, in the mean while perhaps, the performance of it, by secondary means of an ordinary working is obvious to any that have the dexterity to open his eyes to see the truth.</p>
            <p n="50">50. For which cause, they are much to blame, that think it impossible for any man naturally to frame a language of greater perfection then Greek, Hebrew, or Latine.</p>
            <p n="51">51. For who, instead of affording the true cause of a thing, unnecessarily runs to miracles, tacitely acknowledgeth that God naturally cannot do it: wherein he committeth blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, as that Souldier may be accounted guilty of contumacie and disobedience, who rejecting the Orders wherewith an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Officer is authorized to command him, absolutely refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth compearance, unless the General himself come in person to require it of him.</p>
            <p n="52">52. As there is a possibility such a Language may be, so doe I think it very requisite such a Language were, both for affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding conciseness, and abundance of expression.</p>
            <p n="53">53. Such as extoll those Languages most, are enforced some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to say, that <hi>Laborant penuria verborum</hi>; and thereunto immediately subjoyn this reason, <hi>Quiae plures sunt res quam verba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="54">54. That is soon said; and, <hi>ad pauca respicientes facile <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiant.</hi> But here I ask them, how they come to know that there are more Things then Words, taking Things (as in this sense they ought to be taken) for Things universal; because there is no word spoken, which to the conceit of man is not able to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99635:11"/>
represent more individuals then one, be it Sun, Moon, Phoenix, or what you will, even amongst Verbs, and Syncategoremati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal signes, which do onely suppone for the modalities of things: therefore is each word the sign of an universal thing; <hi>Peter</hi> signifying either this <hi>Peter,</hi> or that <hi>Peter</hi>; and any whatever name, surname, or title, being communicable to one and many.</p>
            <p n="55">55. Thus though both words and thoughts, as they are signs, be universal; yet do I believe that those who did attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute less universality to words then things, knew not definite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the full number of words taking words for any articulate pronunciation.</p>
            <p n="56">56. Nay, I will go further: There is no Alphabet in the world, be the Calculator never so well skill'd in Arithmetick, by vertue whereof the exact number of words may be known; because that number must comprehend all the combinations that Letters can have with one another: and this cannot be done, if any letter be wanting; and consequently, by no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet as yet framed, wherein (as I have already said in the twelfth Article) there is a deficiency of many letters.</p>
            <p n="57">57. The Universal Alphabet therefore must be first concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, before the exactness of that computation can be attained unto.</p>
            <p n="58">58. Then is it, when having couched an Alphabet materia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of all the words the mouth of man, with its whole imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is able to pronounce, and bringing all these words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the systeme of a Language, which, by reason of its logopan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochie, may deservedly be intituled, <hi>The Universal Tongue,</hi> that nothing will better merit the labour of a Grammatical Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metician, then, after due enumeration, <hi>hinc inde,</hi> to appariate the words of the Universal Language with the things of the Universe.</p>
            <p n="59">59. The analogie therein 'twixt the signe and thing signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed holding the more exactly, that as, according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> there can be no more worlds but one, because all the matter whereof worlds can be composed, is in this: so can there be no Universal Language, but this I am about to divulge unto the world, because all the words enunciable are in it contained.</p>
            <p n="60">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:99635:12"/>60. If any officious Critick will run to the omnipotency of God for framing more worlds, (according to the common saying, <hi>Nothing is impossible to God,</hi> that implies not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction) so must he have recourse to the same omnipotent power for furnishing of man with other speech-tools then his tongue, throat, roof of the mouth, lips, and teeth, before the contexture of another Universal Language can be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</p>
            <p n="61">61. That I should hit upon the invention of that, for the furtherance of Philosophy, and other Disciplines and Arts, which never hitherto hath been so much as thought upon by any; and that in a matter of so great extent, as the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of all the things in the world, both in themselves, actions, ways of doing, situation, pendicles, relations, connexions, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick interpositions, and all other appurtenances to a perfect elocution, without being beholding to any Language in the world insomuch as one word, will hardly be believed by our fidimplicitary Gown-men, who, satisfied with their predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors contrivances, and taking all things litterally, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, blaterate, to the na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="62">62. But, poor souls, they understand not that in the passage of <hi>Solomon</hi> is meant, that there is no innovation in the essence of natural things; all transmutations on the same matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into forms, which, as they differ from some, so have an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential uniformity with others preexistent in the same kind.</p>
            <p n="63">63. And when it was said by <hi>Paul, Beware of Philosophers,</hi> he meant such Sophisters as themselves, who under the vizzard of I know not what, corrupt the channels of the truth, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert all Philosophy and Learning.</p>
            <p n="64">64. As for the sayings of <hi>Terence,</hi> whether <hi>Scipio</hi> couched them, or himself, they ought to be inferred rather as testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of neat Latine, then for asserting of infallible veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>

            <p n="69">69. For as I ascribe unto my self the invention of the Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sotetrail Trigonometry, for facility of calculation by represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of letters and syllables; the proving of the equipollencie and opposition both of plain and modal enunciations by rules of Geometry, the unfolding of the chiefest parts of Philosophy by a continuated Geographical allegory; and above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred other several books on different subjects, the conceit of so much as one whereof never entered into the brains of any before my self (although many of them have been lost at <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi>-fight:) so am I confident, that others after me, may fall upon some strain of another kind, never, before that, drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med upon by those of foregoing ages.</p>
            <p n="70">70. Now to the end the Reader may be more enamored of the Language, wherein I am to publish a Grammar and Lexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, I will here set down some few qualities and advantages peculiar to it self, and which no Language else (although all other concurred with it) is able to reach unto.</p>
            <p n="71">71. First, There is not a word utterable by the mouth of man, which in this language hath not a peculiar signification
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99635:13"/>
by it self; so that the allegation of <hi>Bliteri</hi> by the Summulists, will be of small validity.</p>
            <p n="72">72. Secondly, Such as will harken to my instructions, if some strange word be proposed to them, whereof there are many thousands of millions, deviseable by the wit of man, which never hitherto by any breathing have been uttered, shall be able, although he know not the ultimate signification there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to declare what part of speech it is; or if a Noun, unto what predicament or class it is to be reduced; whether it be the sign of a real or notional thing, or somewhat concerning me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick Trades in their Tooles, or tearmes; or if real, whether natural or artificial, compleat, or incompleat; for words here do suppone for the things which they signifie; as when we see my Lord Generals picture, we say, there is my Lord General.</p>
            <p n="73">73. Thirdly, This world of words hath but two hundred and fifty prime radices, upon which all the rest are branched: for better understanding whereof, with all its dependant boughs, sprigs, and ramelets, I have before my Lexicon set down the division thereof (making use of another allegory) into so many Cities, which are subdivided into streets, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into lanes, those into houses, these into stories, whereof each room standeth for a word; and all these so methodically, that who observeth my precepts therein, shall at the first hearing of a word, know to what City it belongeth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently not to be ignorant of some general signification thereof, till after a most exact prying into all its letters, finding the street, lane, house, story, and room thereby denotated, he punctually hit upon the very proper thing it represents in its most specifical signification.</p>
            <p n="74">74. Fourthly, By vertue of adjectitious syllabicals annexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Nouns and Verbs, there will arise of several words, what compound, what derivative, belonging in this Language to one Noune or to one Verb alone, a greater number then doth pertain to all the parts of speech, in the most copious Language in the world besides.</p>
            <p n="75">75. Fifthly, So great energy to every meanest constitutive part of a word in this Language is appropriated, that one word
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99635:13"/>
thereof, though but of seven syllables at most shall comprehend that which no Language else in the world is able to express in fewer then fourscore and fifteen several words; and that not only a word here and there for masteries sake, but several mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of such; which, to any initiated in the rudiments of my Grammar, shall be easie to frame.</p>
            <p n="76">76. Sixthly, In the cases of all the declinable parts of speech, it surpasseth all other Languages whatsoever: for whilst others have but five or six at most, it hath ten, besides the nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
            <p n="77">77. Seventhly, There is none of the learned Languages, but hath store of Nouns defective of some case or other; but in this Language there is no Heteroclite in any declinable word, nor redundancie or deficiencie of cases.</p>
            <p n="78">78. Eighthly, Every word capable of number, is better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided therewith in this Language, then by any other: for instead of two or three numbers which others have, this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth you four; to wit, the singular, dual, plural, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual.</p>
            <p n="79">79. Ninthly, It is not in this as other Languages, wherein some words lack one number, and some another: for here each casitive or personal part of speech is endued with all the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
            <p n="80">80. Tenthly, In this Tongue there are eleven genders; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in likewise it exceedeth all other Languages.</p>
            <p n="81">81. Eleventhly, Verbs, Mongrels, Participles, and Hybrids, have all of them ten Tenses, besides the present; which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, no Language else is able to attain to.</p>
            <p n="82">82. Twelfthly, Though there be many conjugable words in other Languages defective of Tenses, yet doth this Tongue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of no such anomaly, but granteth all to each.</p>
            <p n="83">83. Thirteenthly, In lieu of six Moods which other Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have at most, this one injoyeth seven in its conjugable words.</p>
            <p n="84">84. Fourteenthly, Verbs here, or other conjugable parts of speech, admit of no want of Moodes, as do other Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
            <p n="85">85. Fifteenthly, In this Language, the Verbs and Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99635:14"/>
have four voices, although it was never heard that ever any other Language had above three.</p>
            <p n="86">86. Sixteenthly, No other Tongue hath above eight or nine parts of speech; but this hath twelve.</p>
            <p n="87">87. Seventeenthly, For variety of diction in each part of speech, it surmounteth all the Languages in the world.</p>
            <p n="88">88. Eighteenthly, Each Noun thereof, or Verb, may begin or end with a Vowel or Consonant, as to the peruser shall seem most expedient.</p>
            <p n="89">89. Nineteenthly, Every word of this Language declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or indeclinable hath at least ten several synomyma's.</p>
            <p n="90">90. Twentiethly, each of these synomyma's, in some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the signification, differeth from the rest.</p>
            <p n="91">91. One and twentiethly, Every faculty, science, art, trade, or discipline, requiring many words for expression of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, hath each its respective root from whence all the words thereto belonging are derived.</p>
            <p n="92">92. Two and twentiethly, In this Language the opposite members of a division have usually the same letters in the words which signifie them; the initial and final letter being all one, with a transmutation only in the middle ones.</p>
            <p n="93">93. Three and twentiethly, Every word in this Language signifieth as well backward as forward; and however you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the letters, still shall you fall upon significant words: whereby a wonderful facility is obtained in making of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams.</p>
            <p n="94">94. Four and twentiethly, There is no Language in the world, but for every word thereof, it will afford you another of the same signification, of equal syllables with it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or ending, or both, with vowels or consonants as it doth.</p>
            <p n="95">95. Five and twentiethly, by vertue hereof, there is no Hex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amater, Elegiack, Saphick, Asclepiad, Iambick, or any other kind of Latine or Greek verse, but I will afford you another in this Language of the same sort, without a syllable more or less in the one then the other, <hi>Spondae</hi> answering to <hi>Spondae, dactil</hi> to <hi>dactil, caesure</hi> to <hi>caesure,</hi> and each foot to other, with all uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity imaginable.</p>
            <p n="96">
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:99635:14"/>96. Six and twentiethly, As it trotteth easily with metrical feet, so at the end of the career of each line, hath it the dexterity, after the manner of our English and other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naculary Tongues, to stop with the closure of a rime; in the framing whereof, the well-versed in that Language shall have so little labour, that for every word therein he shall be able to furnish at least five hundred several monosyllables of the same termination with it.</p>
            <p n="97">97. Seven and twentiethly, in translating verses of any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naculary Tongue, such as Italian, French, Spanish, Slavonian, Dutch, Irish, English, or whatever it be, it affords you of the same signification, syllable for syllable, and in the closure of each line a rime, as in the original.</p>
            <p n="98">98. Eight and twentiethly, by this Language, and the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thereof, we may doe such admirable feats in numbers, that no cyphering can reach its compendiousness: for whereas the ordinary way of numbring by thousands of thousands of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of thousands, doth but confuse the hearers understanding; to remedy which, I devised, even by cyphering it self, a farre more exact manner of numeration, as in the Treatise of Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick which I have ready for the Press, is evidently apparent; This Language affordeth so concise words for numbering, that the number for setting down whereof, would require in vulgar Arithmetick, more figures in a row then there might be grains of sand containable from the center of the earth, to the highest heavens, is in it expressed by two letters.</p>
            <p n="99">99. Nine and twentiethly, what rational Logarithms doe by writing, this Language doth by heart; and by adding of letters, shall multiply numbers, which is a most exquisite se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</p>
            <p n="100">100. Thirtiethly, the digits are expressed by vowels, and the consonants stand for all the results of the Cephalism, from ten to eighty one, inclusively; whereby many pretty Arithmetical tricks are performed.</p>
            <p n="101">101. One and thirtiethly, in the denomination of the fixed Stars, it affordeth the most significant way imaginary: for by the single word alone which represents the Star, you shall know the magnitude, together with the longitude and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99635:15"/>
both in degrees and minutes of the Star that is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by it.</p>
            <p n="102">102. Two and thirtiethly, by one word in this Language, we shall understand what degree or what minute of the degree of a sign in the Zodiack, the Sun or Moon, or any other planet is in.</p>
            <p n="103">103. Three and thirtiethly, as for the year of God, the moneth of that yeer, week of the moneth, day of that week, partition of the day, hour of that partition, quarter and half quarter of the hour, a word of one or two syllables at most in this Language will express it all to the full.</p>
            <p n="104">104. Four and thirtiethly, in this Language, also, words expressive of herbs, represent unto us with what degree of cold, moisture, heat, or driness they are qualifyed; together with some other property distinguishing them from other herbs.</p>
            <p n="105">105. Five and thirtiethly, in matter of Colours, we shall learn by words in this Language the proportion of light, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or darkness commixed in them.</p>
            <p n="106">106. Six and thirtiethly, in the composition of syllables by vowels and consonants, it affordeth the aptest words that can be imagined, for expressing how many vowels and consonants any syllable is compounded of, and how placed in priority and situation to one another. Which secret in this Language, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding necessary, for understanding the vigour of derivatives in their variety of signification.</p>
            <p n="107">107. Seven and thirtiethly, for attaining to that dexterity which <hi>Mithridates</hi> King of <hi>Pontus</hi> was said to have, in calling all his soldiers of an Army of threescore thousand men, by their names and surnames, this Language will be so convenient, that if a General, according to the Rules thereof, will give new names to his souldiers, whether Horse, Foot, or Dragoons, as the French use to do to their Infantry by their <hi>noms de guerre,</hi> he shall be able, at the first hearing of the word that represents the name of a souldier, to know of what Brigade, Regiment, Troop, Company, Squadron, or Division he is; and whether he be of the Cavalry, or of the Foot; a single Souldier, or an Officer, or belonging to the Artillery or Baggage: which device,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99635:15"/>
in my opinion, is not unuseful for those great Captains that would endear themselves in the favour of the Souldiery.</p>
            <p n="108">108. Eight and thirtiethly, in the contexture of nouns, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouns, and preposital articles united together, it administreth many wonderful varieties of Laconick expressions, as in the Grammar thereof shall more at large be made known unto you.</p>
            <p n="109">109. Nine and thirtiethly, every word in this Language is significative of a number; because, as words may be increased by addition of letters and syllables; so of numbers is there a progress <hi>in infinitum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="110">110. Fourtiethly, in this Language every number, how great soever, may be expressed by one single word.</p>
            <p n="111">111. One and fourtiethly, As every number essentially differeth from another, so shall the words expressive of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall numbers, be from one another distinguished.</p>
            <p n="112">112. Two and Fourtiethly, No Language but this hath in its words the whole number of letters, that is, ten vowels, and five and twenty consonants; by which means there is no word escapes the latitude thereof.</p>
            <p n="113">113. Three and fourtiethly, As its interjections are more numerous, so are they more emphatical in their respective ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of passions, than that part of speech is in any other Language whatsoever.</p>
            <p n="114">114. Four and fourtiethly, The more syllables there be in any one word of this Language, the manyer several significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it hath: with which propriety no other Language is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed.</p>
            <p n="115">115. Five and fourtiethly, All the several genders in this Language, are as well competent to verbs as nouns: by vertue whereof, at the first uttering of a verb in the active voice, you shall know whether it be a god, a goddess, a man, a woman, a beast, or any thing inanimate, (and so thorow the other five genders) that doth the action: which excellencie is altogether peculiar unto this Language.</p>
            <p n="116">116. Six and fourtiethly, In this Language there is an art, out of every word, of what kind of speech soever it be, to frame a verb; whereby, for expressing all manner of actions, a great facility is attained unto.</p>
            <p n="117">
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:99635:16"/>117. Seven and fourtiethly, To all manner of verbs, and many syncategorematical words, is allowed in this Language a flexion by Cases, unknown to other Tongues, thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present unto our understandings more compendious expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons then is possible to afford by any other means.</p>
            <p n="118">118. Eight and fourtiethly, Of all Languages, this is the most compendious in complement, and consequently, fittest for Courtiers and Ladies.</p>
            <p n="119">119. Nine and fourtiethly, For writing of Missives, Letters of State, and all other manner of Epistles, whether serious or otherways, it affordeth the compactest stile of any Language in the world, and therefore, of all other the most requisite to be learned by States-men and Merchants.</p>
            <p n="120">120. Fiftiethly, No Language in matter of Prayer and Eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations to Almighty God, is able, for conciseness of expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to compare with it; and therefore, of all other, the most fit for the use of Church-men, and spirits inclined to devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="121">121. One and fiftiethly, This Language hath a modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the tense, whether present, preterite, or future, of so curious invention for couching much matter in few words, that no other Language ever had the like.</p>
            <p n="122">122. Two and fiftiethly, There is not a proper name in any Country of the world, for which this Language affords not a peculiar word, without being beholding to any other.</p>
            <p n="123">123. Three and fiftiethly, In many thousands of words belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to this Language, there is not a Letter which hath not a peculiar signification by it self.</p>
            <p n="124">124. Four and fiftiethly, The polysyllables of this Language do all of them signifie by their monosyllables; which no word in any other Language doth, <hi>ex instituto,</hi> but the compound ones: for though the syllabical parts of <hi>exlex</hi> separately signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie as in the compound; yet those of <hi>homo</hi> doe it not, nor yet those of <hi>dote,</hi> or <hi>domus,</hi> as in the whole: and so it is in all other Languages except the same: for there are in the Italian and Latine Tongues, words of ten, eleven, or twelve syllables, whereof not one syllable by it self doth signifie any thing at all in that Language, of what it doth in the whole; as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99635:16"/>
               <hi>adolescenturiatissimamente, honorificieabilitudinitatibus, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="125">125. Five and fiftiethly, all the Languages in the world will be beholding to this, and this to none.</p>
            <p n="126">126. Six and fiftiethly, there is yet another wonder in this Language, which although a little touched by the by in the fiftie eighth article of this Preface, I will mention yet once more; and it is this, That though this language have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of all other, it is impossible any other in time coming sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass it, because, as I have already said, it comprehendeth, first, all words expressible; and then, in matter of the obliquity of the cases and tenses, the contrivance of undeclinable parts; and right disposure of vowels and consonants, for distinguishing of various significations within the latitude of letters, cannot be afforded a way so expedient.</p>
            <p n="127">127. Seven and fiftiethly, the greatest wonder of all, is, that of all the Languages in the world, it is easiest to learn; a boy of ten years old, being able to attain to the knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in three moneths space; because there are in it many facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations for the memory, which no other Language hath but it self.</p>
            <p n="128">128. Eight and fiftiethly, sooner shall one reach the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of things to be signified by the words of this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, then by those of any other, for that Logarithms in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of absolute numbers, so do the words thereof in their initials respectively vary according to the nature of the things which they signifie.</p>
            <p n="129">129. Nine and fiftiethly, for pithiness of proverbs, oracles, and sentences, no Language can paralel with it.</p>
            <p n="130">130. Sixtiethly, in Axioms, Maximes, and Aphorisms, it is excellent above all other Languages.</p>
            <p n="131">131. One and sixtiethly, for definitions, divisions, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions, no Language is so apt.</p>
            <p n="132">132. Two and sixtiethly, for the affirmation, negation, and infinitation of propositions, it hath proprieties unknown to any other Language, most necessary for knowledge.</p>
            <p n="133">133. Three and sixtiethly, in matters of Enthymems, Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisms, and all manner of Illative ratiocination, it is the most compendious in the world.</p>
            <p n="134">
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:99635:17"/>134. Sixtie fourthly, Negative expressions are more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiously uttred in this Language, then in any other in the world.</p>
            <p n="135">135. Sixtie fifthly, The infinitant terms by this Tongue are in one single word expressed, which succinctness is by no other Language afforded.</p>
            <p n="136">136. Lastly, There is not any phrase whatsoever, which, for being peculiar to one Speech, and consequently in all other to be improperly taken (wherewith each known Tongue in the world is most variously stored) hath, when translated from its original <hi>idiome,</hi> the denomination of Graecism, Latinism, Scotism, Anglicism, and so forth; but in this universal Language is so well admitted, that, in losing nothing of its genuine liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it beareth along with it, without any diminution either of sense or expression, the same very emphasis in the stream, which it had at the spring, the like whereof is in no other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to be found.</p>
            <p n="137">137. Besides these sixty and six advantages above all other Languages, I might have couched thrice as many more, of no less consideration then the aforesaid, but that these same will suffice to sharpen the longing of the generous Reader, after the intrinsecal and most researched secrets of the new Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Lexicon which I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What large Donatives have been bestowed on learned men for their encouragement to Literature, he specifyeth by eight several examples: and by seven more, the indefatigable pains taken by eminent Schollars of former ages in the prosecuting of their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; all which the Author is pleased to display before us, the better thereby to extoll the gifts of the intellectual part: and where he transiently lets fall a word in praise of his own elucubrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he excuseth it by the necessity of avoiding a greater evil, subjoyning thereto for better illustration, three specious presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of a King, a Prophet, and a Saint, all divinely insp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon, after forty years custom, being habituated thereunto, he found himself at last (to his great regret) insensibly plunged into inextricable difficulties, in the large field whereof, the insatiable Creditor to make his harvest, by the ruine of that Family, struck in with his sickle, and by masking himselfe with a vizard, composed of the rags of the Scotish Law, in its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest sense, claims the same right to the whole inheritance, that <hi>Robinhood</hi> did to <hi>Frankindals</hi> money, for being master of the

purse wherein it was. Those wretched, and unequitable cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, indefatigably prosecuted by merciless men, to the utter undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Author, and exterminion of his name, have induced him, out of his respect to antiquity, his piety to succession, and that intim regard of himself, which by divine injunction ought to be the rule, and measure of his love towards his neighbour, to set down in this parcel of his Introduction, the cruel usage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he hath been served these many years past, by that inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble race, the lamentable preparatives, which, by granting their desires, would ensue to the extirpation of worthie pedigrees, and the unexemplifyable injustice thereby redounding to him, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was in any thing obliged to them. The premisses he enlargeth with divers quaint, and pertinent Similies, and after a neat appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling of Usury, in its holiday garments, he deduceth from the Laws, and customs of all Nations, the tender care that ought to be had in the preservation of antient Families: the particulars whereof, in matter of Ordonance, he evidenceth by the acts of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> the Decrees of the <hi>Decemvits,</hi> and statutes of the <hi>Twelve Tables:</hi> And for its executional part, in the persons of <hi>Q. Fabius, Tiberius</hi> the Emperor, and the <hi>Israelitish</hi> observers of the sacred institution of Jubilees. By which enarration, nothing is more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inferred, then that seeing both Jews, and Gentiles, Painims, and Christians, in their both Monarchical, and Polyarchical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, have been so zealous in their obsequiousness to so pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a mandate, that the present age being no less concerned in the happy fruits thereof, then the good dayes of old, the splendid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of this Isle should be pleased, not to eclipse their commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, by innovating any thing in the Authors case. Who decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phering the implacability of Flagitators, by shewing how they throw in obstacles, retarding their own payment, thereby tacitly to hasten his destruction; and hinting at the unnatural breach of some of his Fiduciaries, he particularizeth the candor of his own endeavours, and nixuriencie to give all men contentment, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course whereof, in all its periods, very well deserveth the serious animadversion of the ingenious Reader.</p>

The Author desires to have the prolixity of the disgression for this cause excused, that who would encounter with such an adversary, must step a little aside to cope with him aright. He walks in no known tract, his actions are arbitrary, and passion directs his motions: and where he finds evasions suitable to his hypocrisie, <hi>Proteus</hi> never transformed himself into so many shapes, as he will doe for his own ends.

            <p n="4">4. For though I did put in these subsequent reasons, against the disuniting, and adjectitious provision of the aforesaid two Churches.</p>
            <p>First, that both parishes togither are but three miles long, and one of the churches therof (called the Kirk of <hi>Cullicudden</hi>) seated in the middle (or near by) so that the dwelling house of the remotest parishioner of either of the parishes, will not be above a mile and a half distant from that church, and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 40 miles of that place, and that in a plain country, there are of those whose dwelling house in the parish, is sixteen miles distant from the parish Kirk.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Secondly, that there are not thirty six ploughs labouring in both, and when acknowledged to be united, they shall be found the least parish in the Country, both for rent, people, and bounds.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Thirdly that these two have been but one parish (by all appearance) from the beginning; for <hi>Cullicudden</hi> is built af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fashion of a Church, but that other (now called <hi>Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>michel</hi>) is in its edifice like but to a Chappell.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And forsooth, it was nothing else but a Chappel, which one of my predecessors, in the time, that the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion was universally professed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> caused to be built for his own ease of devotion.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:99635:37"/>8. For having a prety summer dwelling adjacent thereto, within the precinct of the parish of <hi>Cromartie,</hi> and three miles distant from the church thereof, he chused rather, then weekly to go so far to hear mass, and other such liturgies, as, on the Sundays, and many festivall days, are amongst the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Romans</hi> till this hour in use, to be at the charge of that petty Fabrick, and the maintenance of a Chaplain, whereby, with the lesse labour to exercise his devotion at his own doores.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat is to be last in the execution, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly first in the intention, the Author, conform to that order, begun this Isagogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Treatise, as is apparent by the first Book thereof, intituled, <hi>The Wonders of the new Language:</hi> but in the continuation of the matter, thorow all the Books following, he quits that Analytical method, and betakes him to the Compositive, wherein <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority</hi> in cause, hath its <hi>citeriority</hi> in description. Thus therefore, as in the third Book were deduced Reasons, why the impediment mentioned in the second, should be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; so to the fifth, hath the Author reserved the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his regret, for want of remedy against such inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as under which in the fourth, he had discovered a pressure. In a word, the third block which doth lie in the way of the Authors excellent undertakings, is the lack of redress, after Petition put in, for the wrongs he had sustained. Yet doth he not insist so long thereupon, as on the former; because the Court before which he did address himself, was somewhat more homogeneal; and that to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Kirks authority in <hi>civilibus,</hi> he conceived it to be no Heteroclitism. Both Iudicatories were constituted the Epitomes and Abridgements of greater ones; the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and Assembly: that, passing under the name of a Committee; and this, of a Commission. But truly, such was the influence the Ecclesiastical party in this, had
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99635:50"/>
over the Secular in that, in imitation of the larger Bodies, which they represented, who had the same ascendent, and subordinacy, in rule, and dependencie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he was thereby plunged into the more lamentable sufferings, the higher the exclamations against the Consistorian Clergie on all sides soared to this <hi>Picrologie,</hi> that no good aspect was to be expected from a conjunction of so malevolent Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. After the enumeration of many grievous losses from Souldiers, and others, which the Author, contrary to the Laws of the Nation, and Equity it self, was enforced to undergo without reparation, he falls in the next place to discuss the Flagitator, whose poyson, by reason of its uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality of diffluence on all his best endeavours, requireth a careful administration of Antidotes to be set down in each of all the six Books of this Introduction. To this purpose, in several particulars, he instanceth their impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cability, their unnaturality, and unconscionableness; he discloseth three plausible overtures most untowardly reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them; and in amplification of their cunning and rigour, hath a learned disceptation concerning Prodigality and Covetousness: he bringeth against them arguments both from Conscience and Law, in its supremest Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and with sentences of a vigorous and strong impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, most accurately illustrates them. The tender care should be had of ancient Houses, he again inculcates: and lastly, to perswade the Publike to exoner him of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned burdens, he ratiocinates <hi>a minori ad majus,</hi> of Monopolies, in ampler benefits granted to men of no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, wherein he needeth not doubt to have furnished matter abundant, for the satisfaction of the impartial Reader.</p>

            <p n="1">1 THe publike Pressures, which in <hi>Scotland</hi> I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd to undergo, (in matter of Tax and Loan, monthly maintenance, additional Sess-money, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient Quarters, constant and assistant quartering Horse, Foot, and Dragoon-Levies, besides neer 3000 <hi>l.</hi> sterling worth of goods, as it stands upon Record, under the hands of those Gentlemen authorized for Commissioners, to take upon Oath and Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the just account of their losses, most basely and unworthily (whilst I was absent from the Country) robbed and plundered from my Tenants: against whom, no pretext of quarrel could be had, but the love of their means, they being never sufferers, but for their innocencie, and too conscionable neighbourhood) did extend to so vast a proportion, that my Lands thereby were more sadly dealt with then those of any Subject within the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; and my self, from time to time, brought under the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance of such exorbitant Impositions, as would have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

insupportable to any of the Country, though of a free estate.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="4">4. This disorder of Order-monging multitudes (without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice be it spoke of a well-disciplined Souldiery) together with the specious pretences that some have grasped at, to do iniquity by a Law, hath truly run in such an over-flowing speat and inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of violence against me, that what by the cruelty and high hand of neighbouring Flagitators and others,<note place="margin">

Conscionably therefore to talk thereof, in some of the most civil parts of the world, it is thought unjust, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of debt, like a hereditary disease, should be derived to Posterity, but onely transmitted to those, that from the indebted receive a benefit equivalent to the debt; conscience requiring that each one be a faithful Administrator to his Posterity of the means, which from his Predecessors he hath received: nothing being made lyable to his own debt, but his own conquest; his Personal deservings, and nothing else being that, which ought to expiate his personal faults.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Hence it followeth by the same equity as aforesaid, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither any of my fore-fathers, nor yet my self, were obliged in so much as one farthing to any of those Creditors; that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently neither their estate, nor mine, should be affected with the burthen, which concerned us not, but onely the means of him that was the Party-contractor; whereby the whole shire of <hi>Cromartie,</hi> and Baronry of fishery in <hi>Scotland</hi>; ought clearly to be mine, for having belonged to my Progenitors five hundred

            <head>The project of the sixth Book, intituled, PHILOPONAUXESIS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Author in the first five Books having very posedly digested the causes promptive to the removal of all obstacles impediting the exposal of his brain-endeavours, doth in this sixth and last of his Introduction, prove that the concession of these his just demands, will prove conducible to all industrious negotiations and employments whatsoever. And whereas by the Usurer the contrary was upbraided, he retorts back the dart of that obloquie on whence it came, and sheweth what innumerable prejudices have redounded to Merchandizing, Scholarship, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, Mechanism, Nobility, Gentry, Disport, Exercise, and, in sum, to all the persons, professions, and diversions of honest men, of what degree or quality soever, by the Gangrene wherewith Usury and Avarice hath seized upon the Land, since the domination of Hypocrisie over its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. He declareth likewise much of these calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in behalf of all those fore-named Vocations, Arts, Disciplines, Recreations, and those that plied all or either of them, to have occurred by reason of his own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar pressures under the Foenoratory yoak. And therefore, to extricate him out of those impesterments, and dis-intangle his estate from the intricacies wherein the Flagitator keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it involved, he sues the Supreme Authority, and begs the favour of a Judge whose qualifications he delinectes.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99635:63"/>
He solveth all the Scruples that oppose his suit, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonstrateth the grant thereof to endanger the preparative of no incidence for the like in any time to come. Finally, he knowing that any man in a chamber, desirous to enjoy the light of the sun, would be offended at him, who, by holding the windows shut, should detain him in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; as also be displeased with such a one as would keep fast the door against that person did intend to present him with a rich Diamant; Seeing the expansion of a door and window-leaf is able to admit the brightness of the one, and wealth of the other: He expects that the State, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering how easily he may be disburdened of the aforesaid letts, and how upon their removal dependeth an illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and enrichment of the Minde in the knowledge of divers exquisite things, will not wittingly lose a matter of so great concernment, for the not-performance of so mean a task: for when Utility may be obtained with ease, and the steps to Profit trod upon with facility, it needeth not to be imagined, where Wisdom superiorizeth most, that such conveniences will be set at nought, and omitted. In hopes therefore of a gracious retribution, and with a stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous assurance of a plenary discharge of his promise, The Author very daintily closing this sixth Book, puts a Catastrophe to the whole Introduction; the publishing of the Book it relates to, depending totally upon the removal of the often-aforementioned impediments, then which the Author asks no more for helps: for, <hi>Qui impedimenta tollit, praestat adminicula.</hi>

although there were not three therein, which were not of mine owne purchase, and all of them together (in the order wherein I had ranked them) compiled (like to a compleat nose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay) of flowers, which in my travels I had gathered out of the gardens of above sixteen several Kingdoms) by having their thoughts plunged, and totally immersed, in an extraordinary care for these things, which with little expence, and less labour, were obtainable about our owne doors: all which books (had not that worthy and most consciencious Gentleman Col. <hi>Tho.

            <p n="69">69. For if we consider the Land which I claim title to, as the undoubted inheritance of my predecessors, it is a land which

            <p n="70">70. If again I be looked upon as one who for any personal courtesie done to my self, was never obliged to any one of them who call themselves Creditors: how I have obliged every one of them by having given to each a hundred times more then ever I had received from them all together: how withal I am willing to renounce my right to any thing that ever was acquired by my father: and how lastly I am content not onely to pass by the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any title to those many several lands of my progenitors within the Shires of <hi>Cromartie</hi> and <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> which in his own time he heritably disponed away and abalienated; but also to discharge them of the vast sums of money many of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully pilled out of my rents ever since my fathers decease; I am certainly perswaded no compatriot of mine by such reasons will pretend to the like; or if it happen he should, (which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he cannot) that offer which I make to the Publike, beyond the reach of common imitation, will quell the ambition of that suit, the obtaining whereof totally dependeth upon examples he is not able I suppose to follow.</p>
            <p n="71">71.

            <p>THat I (whilst a prisoner) was able to digest and write this Treatise, is an effect meerly proceeding from the courtesie of my Lord General <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> by whose recommendation to the Councel of State, my Parole being taken for my true imprisonment, I was by their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour enlarged to the extent of the Lines of <hi>Londons</hi> Communication: for, had I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as before, coopt up within Walls, or yet been attended still by a Guard, as for a while I was, should the house of my confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have never been so pleasant, or my Keepers a very Paragon of discretion, and that the conversation of the best Wits in the world, with affluence of all manner of Books, should have been allowed me for the diversion of my minde; yet such an antipathie I have to any kinde of restraint,
<pb facs="tcp:99635:75"/>
wherein my self is not intrusted, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all these advantages, which to some spirits would make a Jay I seem more delicious then Freedom without them, it could not in that eclipse of Liberty lie in my power to frame my self to the couching of one sillable, or contriving of a Fancie worthy the labour of putting Pen to Paper, no more then a Nightingale can warble it in a Cage, or Linet in a Dungeon.</p>
            <p>Here must I not forget the obligation I owe to that most generous Gentleman Captain <hi>Gladmon,</hi> for speaking in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to my Lord General; which gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in him (upon so small acquaintance) shall assuredly be remembred by me, with a stedfast resolution to embrace all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities wherewith Fortune shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent me, for performance of the best offices I can, in testimony of my thankfulness.</p>
            <p>The kindly usage of the Marshal-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Captain <hi>Alsop,</hi> whilst I was in his custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I am bound in duty so to acknowledge, that I may without dissimulation avouch, for courtesies conferred on such as were
<pb facs="tcp:99635:75"/>
within the Verge of his authority, and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to those by whom he was intrusted with their tuition in that restraint, That never any could by his faithfulness to the one, and loving carriage to the other, bespeak himself more a Gentleman, nor, in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of that Military place, acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with a more universally-deserved ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause and commendation.</p>
            <p>The enumeration of these aforesaid courtesies, will not permit me to forget my thankfulness to that Reverend Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Mr. <hi>Roger Williams</hi> of <hi>Providence</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> for the manifold favours wherein I stood obliged to him above a whole mont, before either of us had so much as seen other, and that by his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and earnest sollicitation in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, of the most especial Members both of the Parliament and Councel of State; in doing whereof, he appeared so truely gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that when it was told him how I, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got notice of his so undeserved respect towards me, was desirous to embrace some sudden opportunity whereby to testifie the
<pb facs="tcp:99635:76"/>
affection I did owe him, he purposely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed the occasion of meeting with me, till he had (as he said) performed some accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able office worthy of my acquaintance: in all which (both before and after we had conversed with one another) and by those many worthy Books set forth by him, to the advancement of piety and good order (with some whereof, he was pleased to present me) he did approve himself a man of such discretion and inimitably-sanctified parts, that an Arch-Angel from heaven could not have shewn more goodness with less often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>

            <p>ALthough you have been detained all along this little Tractate, upon the particulars of a private family, and that the Author, as the first sight, doth thereby seem to mind rather his owne profit, then your instruction: yet so much confidence is reposed in your ingenuity, that it is credibly thought, you will not expect great apologies from him, whose best endeavours, you know already, have been much devoted to your service; especially for that your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the future establishment of his fortune (all things being well considered) appeareth every whit as great as his owne: for albeit in the eyes of the vulgar, most of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of an estate seemeth to accrue to him that enjoyeth it; yet if the fruition thereof in his person, be but a mean to a further end, communicable by many thousands, unto each of whom is of it exposed as plenary a possession as to himself, his share must needs, by that account, in regard of theirs of so great a number, be but very little: herein therefore is it evident, that the Reader in the Authors settlement is as much concerned as himself; for who desireth any thing, is also desirous of the means whereby it is to be attained unto. Thus there being no possibility of the Authors publication of excellent Treatises, unless he be reseated in the estate of his predecessors, the Reader, of whatever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, with whom literature is in any estimation, should
<pb facs="tcp:99635:77"/>
concur with, assist, and help him forwards to the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of those his just demands, if not for any love to the Author, yet his owne sake at least, and that for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which thereby may redound to himself, which (to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue things aright) must needs be of more importance, then any interest the Author can have in the means of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors; for what can the Author and his posterity suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of damage by the want of his estate, comparable to the prejudice sustainable by the many Readers and their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, through lack of his writings? unless one would think that the goods of Fortune are more highly to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed then those of the Minde; the contrary whereof hath been very clearly evidenced, in many several passages of the fore-going Tractate.</p>
