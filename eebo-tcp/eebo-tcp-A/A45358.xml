            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>TO prefix your Name to the present Treatise I could give many Reasons that induced me, did I not know that you are more delighted in doing Worthy Things than to have the Praise of your Actions re-echoed and repeated from others. And
<pb facs="tcp:49482:3"/>
since my choice and affection hath thus far led me, I am the less soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous of the various Censures that a Discourse of this nature may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably meet withal: For even the clearest Reason does often lose its force when it meets with strong and inveterate Prejudices. However I have done my endeavour to make things appear plain and easie, and the better to comply with an Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive and Philosophical Age, have made use of such Principles as the best and choicest Philosophy could afford me; which as it is not in the least derogatory to my Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, so was highly necessary to make good one great end of the Christian Religion, in delivering us from the Power of the Dark Kingdom, whose very Existence some smatterers in Philosophy have the Confidence to deny. Whether I please others or not I am not much concerned, having the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb facs="tcp:49482:3"/>
of pleasing my self, in taking the opportunity of a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Acknowledgment of your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny favours towards me, who am,</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE ensuing Treatise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Discourse of the Dark side of Providence, or of that Rebellious Polity that proudly opposes it self against the Kingdom of Light; I am obliged to give some Account as well of the Work it self as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in writing it. As for the Design of it, it is no other than what is good and laudable, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to shew our Sceptical and staggering Religionists that there is a very Potent and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse party of Incorporeal Agents, that entring into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Confederacy against
<pb facs="tcp:49482:5"/>
God, and being cast out of the Mansions of Light, have formed themselves a Kingdom in the Aereal Regions, and not content with this Power and Dominion among themselves, have studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously endeavoured ever since the Creation to deprave and corrupt Mankind, and to enlarge their own Empire by the Accession of frail man, whose weakness they abuse and triumph over, and strive by all means to keep him fast within their clutches, that if at least they must be miserable, they may make others so and have companions in their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the Work it self, I must confess I have fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it in a lax and diffuse man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, not endeavouring to prove the Existence of Spirits either good or bad, but supposing them both in Being already, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb facs="tcp:49482:5"/>
taking many other things for granted which are already either made good by divers Learned Authors, or may evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently be deduced from the principles of true and sound Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy: As likewise purposely omitting many otherwise mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial proofs of some heads in this Discourse, being willing to bring the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> into as small a compass as may be. Nor have I been wanting to confirm my Discourse in the most material parts of it by the Testimony of the Sacred Scriptures, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times added the Suffrage of some of the Ancient Fathers, in such speculations as otherwise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps would have seemed over nice and curious. And lastly (which in a Discourse of this nature could not well be preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted) I have briefly resolved the Question of <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:49482:6"/>
shewed the possibility of such detestable Confederacies with wicked Spirits, and answered the strongest and most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Objections I could meet withal against it. That which at the present seems to me to be most liable to Exception is, the Introduction of the Spirit of Nature, which by Corporealists is looked upon at the same rate with an <hi>Occult Quality,</hi> and brought in rather as an <hi>Asylum</hi> of Ignorance than a <hi>Philosophical</hi> Truth. To which I have this to reply, That the ground and reason of using that <hi>Hypothesis</hi> arose partly because I saw it maintainable by rational and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Arguments, and partly through a natural propensity of my own whereby I am prone to think, that whatever boasts may be made by the followers of <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who
<pb facs="tcp:49482:6"/>
have dismembred and disjoyned the Ancient <hi>Atomologie</hi> from the Doctrine of Spirits or the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical part of it, there is not one considerable <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> in the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Philosophy that can be solved by the mere and solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry principles of Matter and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For a conclusion of the whole, I have drawn such Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences as may most effectually perswade men from Sin and Vice, by which they infallibly entertain Communion and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety with the Dark Kingdom, and to assert themselves under a higher and more propitious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, by the sincere practice of true and unfeigned Piety and Religion.

            <head>The Introduction.</head>
            <p>IT was observed long ago by <hi>Epictetus,</hi> that there were some Persons that would deny the plainest and most evident Truths, and this state and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he terms an <gap reason="foreign">

this is really no better than an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (as the Philosopher calls it) a mere Brutishness or Bestiality. Under one of these heads I must needs comprehend all those who boggle and startle so much at the Notion of an Incorporeal Being. For my own part I cannot but think that great Wit <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> delivered a most certain Truth, when he said, that the Notion or Conception of the Soul is much more plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than that of the Body. But when men are either so monstrously confounded in their Intellects, so as not to be wrought upon or convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the force and strength of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and Reason, or wholly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over to the gratification of their Lusts and Passions, I do not much wonder that they should have such dull Hallucinations about the clearest things, or that they should entertain such cross and untoward Opinions, and so disagreeing with all those that ever had a sober and right use of their Reasons and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49482:10"/>This Age hath produced too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny over-confident Exploders of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Substances; and he that shall talk of the Existence of Devils and evil Spirits, their Possessions of the Bodies of men, of Ghosts and Apparitions, and the feats and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of Witches, shall be confuted with a loud laughter or a supercili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous look, as if these things were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the delusions of a distempered Imagination, and owed all their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Reality to the dreams and fancies of melancholick persons. Or if the matters of fact be too no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious to be gainsaid, then these Corporealists will not stick to affirm with a late Author, that they <hi>believe, there are many thousands of Spirits, made of an Incorporeal matter, too fine to be perceived by the Senses of men; and that these Spirits may play mad pranks amongst us.</hi> A thing much more worthy of laughter and the character of folly, and all one as if a man should go about to perswade that the little Motes or Atoms that fridge and play in the Beams of the Sun shining through a Crany, should
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49482:11"/>
by a common consent unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into a living heap, and speak and act either ludicrously or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievously with the standers by. This is really nothing else but a disease of the Mind, and I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured in this small Treatise so far to discourse of the Existence of the <hi>Dark Kingdom,</hi> and the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thereof, and have laid down such Arguments, as being well weighed and considered, may be subservient to the releasing and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting free such heavy and dull Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions from the distemper they labour under.</p>

               <p>That the Lapse and Revolt of the Angels from the Blessed life of God, consists mainly in debasing their higher and nobler Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by enslaving and subjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to their Inferior and more material Powers.</p>
               <p>HE that will speak of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels like a Philosopher, looks upon their Souls like those of men, to be of an Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous

nature, including within the latitude and comprehension of their Essences an <hi>Intellectual</hi> and <hi>Plastical</hi> life. The Perceptive part is indeed the flower of the Soul, discrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all Impressions made in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Sensorium</hi> by the various objects of Sense, and being Life and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in a very high degree contains in it the principles and seeds of all manner of Wisdom and Knowledge: But the <hi>Plastick</hi> part or Formative Power is wholly employed in the modification of matter, conserving the vital motions, and faithfully transmitting the Impressions of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Objects upon the Instruments of Sense to the seat of Perception. And that this holds good in Angels, their vital union with matter suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently demonstrates. For although we should fancy the Vehicles or Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Angels to lie in a lax and diffuse manner without any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Organization or Characteristical <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> yet it is most probable that the seat of Perception is restrained to some particular place in that heap of living Air. Wherefore God
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49482:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
creating no Power or Faculty in vain, but that at some time or other it should be called forth into Act, did graciously allow to these embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died Spirits their <hi>Perige's</hi> or Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Placid Motions of their Congenit Bodies in due measures and proportions, as well as their <hi>Apoge's</hi> or Recessions from matter. Which innocent delight was in a sort ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to their condition and the circumstances of their Natures. For the most Intellectual and resined operations of their Minds depending somewhat upon the motions of the Matter of their <hi>Vehicles,</hi> it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible they should always attend with an equal Intensenefs and Vigour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those high and remote speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without any the least lassitude or dulness; partly because profound Contemplations do very much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haust and debilitate the Spirits or Ethereal matter, which is the most immediate Instrument of Sense and Cogitation, both in the Souls of men and Angels; and partly from the necessary imperfection of their Natures, which are made with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49482:13"/>
and regard to the Plastick as well as Perceptive powers of life, which require an abatement and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of the superior Faculties, as well for the supply and recruit of their Vehicles, as to be a pleasant repast, after which the Intellectual life becomes more ardent, sublime and vigorous in the exercise of all its most perfect operations.</p>
               <p>Wherefore this being the state of things, the Defection and Eclipse of those once bright and glorious morning Stars, must be attributed to the luxuriant growth of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick life, which taking deeper root by a fond carelesness and indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, diffuses every way such poison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and noxious Ferments as choak the Emanations of a Divine life, till at last they become wholly dead to that better principle, whose act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and inspirations so long as they heeded, they remained perfectly happy. The experiment is every where obvious in the world, and we see men by letting themselves loose to all manner of wretchedness and debauchery, through the potent
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49482:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and enormous lasciviency of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily life, quite lose the relish and grateful sense of true Goodness and Nobility; and the edge and acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their <hi>Criteria</hi> is so far taken off, that they have no right discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination between Virtue and Vice, Good and Evil. And though it be true, that the Angels by sinking into the brutish life, have not bereaved themselves of their Reason and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Sagacity (sith that That is a kind of middle principle, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways follows the prevailing part, indifferently either purveying for the satisfaction of a petulant Lust or slavish Passion, or else acting under the conduct and guidance of a more Celestial Nature) yet have they to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally extinguished that noble Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the flower and summity of the Souls of men and Angels; which a learned person calls <hi>Boniformem ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae facultatem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49482:14"/>
an object, diffuses an ineffable joy and pleasure through all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of the Soul. Nor do we by this make God the cause and Author of sin: for though it be true that the Animal faculties in Angels and men, together with their respective objects, be a part of God's Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet their sin proceeded from themselves, through an undue and disharmonious connection of those principles, and consists in the abuse of his Fatherly indulgence by a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful immoderation and excess.</p>
               <p>Nor will this seem strange to any that will but consider what S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Iude</hi> speak of the fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; to give some light to which places, I shall set them down in the Original, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49482:16"/>
this Kingdom or Government of theirs took its beginning and rise from their lapse and revolt from God at the Creation of the World; when 'tis most probable that some mighty Leader or Chieftain among the Orders of Angels inspired the breasts of Myriads with pernicious and rebellious counsels against God, attempting to frame and erect a Principality of his own in opposition to the Soveraignty and Dominion of the Almighty; and being cast out of the Mansions of Light and Happiness, with all his wicked ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, for this their bold and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious attempt of invading Heaven it self, he hath notwithstanding kept so much of his ancient Grandeur, as to be the Head and Prince of all those whom he drew into that Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous confederacy.

the Tenuity or Grossness of their Bodies, and by consequence they are liable and obnoxious to harm and injury from those of their own Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which, considering the mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vousness of their natures and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions (each ones particular Lusts being the grand rule and measure of his Actions) would certainly breed an infinite Ataxy and confusion amongst them, and at last the ruine and destruction of their Kingdom, if not prevented by some external restraint and discipline. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they being all so deeply lapsed into the Animal life, whose very foundation is self-love and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the irregular Exertions of their sensual Appetites, their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which, though perfectly subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to their brutish Faculties, yet, is no whit abated or diminished by their degeneracy, would not fail of moulding them into a Body Politick, and enacting by their general consent and approbation for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and security of their usurped Dominions, all such Laws and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Provisions as might both se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

there are Principalities, Powers, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions and Thrones, and other names of Offices; which we can neither name, nor I suppose <hi>Paul</hi> himself while in this earthly Body would enumerate. Now if there be Thrones and Dominions, Principalities and Powers, they must of necessity have Subjects, and those that fear and serve them, and such as may be protected by their strength.

And this is also plain, for that wheresoever the doctrine of the Gospel was received and established, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the downfal of the worship of Daemons and of Magical Arts: and one God was worshipped with a detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Daemons; whose Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> Porphyry <hi>acknowledges was broken by the coming of</hi> Christ.</p>
               <p>In a word, our most Holy <hi>Iesus</hi> in all things opposed and walked ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly contrary to the Powers of Darkness, chastising by his humility

the pride of that great <hi>Lucifer,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting by his innocency and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the iniquity and uncleanness of the Black Society, and withdrawing abused mortals from the madness of Polytheism and Idolatry, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting their hearts to the worship of the One only true God, who made Heaven and Earth. So that by the coming of <hi>Christ</hi> and the propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his most holy Doctrine throughout the world, men are brought from bondage and slavery to true liberty and freedom, from tyrannical and cruel Taskmasters, to the obedience of a mild and gentle Prince, and from the lowest dregs of misery to the height of happiness and felicity.</p>

reassembling his dispersed Troops, and reuniting his broken and shatter'd Forces, he resolves to regain that by policy which he could no longer maintain and keep by open strength. Wherefore casting and revolving in his mind many deep and direful Machinations, he finds nothing offering greater plausibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of success, than to turn those Engines that so sorely batter'd his strongest holds, against the possessors of them, and to make the Gospel which was intended for the utter ruine and extirpation of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to be subservient to the erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and raising him a new Empire over mankind. And now the great Prince of Darkness walks in <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade,</hi> and puts on the beautiful Robes of an Angel of Light, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears amongst the Sons of God, and raises up the depths of the accursed policies of Hell, to make fruitless and of none effect the grand intent and purpose of our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the propagation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.

principles and worse lives, to disse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Heresies, and raise Schisms and divisions among Christians; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to extinguish that mutual love and charity which our Lord made the badge and character of his Disciples, and by degrees to bring on a general depravation and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in manners.

                  </gap>, the subtle machinations, the thoughts and counsels of the heart of Satan.</p>
               <p>And with what successfulness he hath managed these artisices, let the Histories of the Christian Church in all Ages, even to this very day bear witness. For no sooner were the storms of persecution a little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd, and the Sun of peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity shone with gentle beams up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the professors of the Gospel, but this Arch-enemy and deceiver was busie in sowing Tares, which too soon became fruitful, and grew up to a plentiful crop of Iniquity and licentious disorder. It is a sad face of things that <hi>Eusebius</hi> describes,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>When the lives of Christians degenerated, through too much liberty, into softness and sloth, and Christians hated and reproached one another, and with those weapons of the tongue inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and fought with one another; when Bishops set upon Bishops, and people raised seditions against people; when hypocrisie and shews of piety filled all places, then by little and little the judgments of God, as they are wont, began to visit us; and when we used no means to appease God, but multiplied sin upon sin, as if God did not respect or consider our sins, and so there was nothing left among Christians but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, emulations, hatred, enmity, ambition, tyranny, — then,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And the succeeding times were no whit better, till at length the Man of sin arose, by whom the Infernal King wrought an effectual deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Christian Church, and revived the lively Image of <hi>Pagan</hi> Superstition and Idolatry. And though Reformed Christendom have cast off that yoke of Superstition and Idolatry, yet they labour under In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine Dissentions, and crumble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

to Schisms and Factions, and (which is to be lamented, even with tears of bloud) provoke and exasperate, nay and frequently persecute one another through a bitter and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate zeal, for those things which all parties agree are no way essential to the Salvation of a Christian. Here one crying out zealously for <hi>Paul,</hi> there another for <hi>Apollos,</hi> and yonder a third for <hi>Cephas,</hi> and in the mean time condemning all others that will not follow their cry as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, persons only sit, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable burdens, to be sent out of this World, to try their fortunes in the next; as if there were no other way to Heaven, but by joyning with this or that particular Sect and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of men. Now what are all these evils but various devices and stratagems of the Dark Kingdom to undermine the Gospel, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat our Lord (if it were possible) of the success of all the pains he took in the Redemption of the World? How prosperously does the Cause of Darkness thrive, when men shall damn one another for opinions, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49482:31"/>
bite and devour one another for trifles? When they shall profess Christianity, and yet live like Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens?</p>
               <p>Now when God looks down from Heaven and beholds all those Sacred methods and ways of recovering men out of the hands of the Devil undervalued and despised; when he sees men wilfully shut their eyes against those bright rays of Truth that encircle them, then in a just judgment he suffers them to fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of Satan, and to be led away (as the Apostle speaks) <hi>with strong delusions,</hi>

               <p>FOR the Possession of the Mind by such strong falshoods as shall lead to all Impurity of life and actions, may be as real a work of the Devil (though not so visible) as his inacting their Bodies. And if it might as well conduce to the interest and advantage of his Kingdom to make such visible discoveries of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, by acting in the Bodies of men; there is no question but such Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would be infinitely more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent than they are. For the frame and temper of the Mind being the peculiar object of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it is certain that a man may lapse so far into wickedness and vice, as to forfeit this Care, and to turn
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49482:32"/>
himself out of her Protection, and then he comes into the dominion of, and becomes a prey to the invisible Harpyes. And though these bodily vexations and infestations by evil <hi>Daemons</hi> may sometimes befal others, yet they are more infrequent, and permitted by Providence for ends and purposes not readily discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by us. But when they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised upon deplorably wicked and profligate persons, those <hi>Daemons</hi> seise upon and use but what is their own. Now that there have been such real Possessions of men by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils hath been so fully attested by unprejudic'd persons in all Ages, that he cannot escape the suspicion of having imbibed some Atheistical principles that shall have the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to deny them.</p>
               <p>But because there are many so staggering, fluctuating and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in their Religion, that they can hardly be perswaded to believe the existence of such Spirits, or the asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation and confederation of men with these foul and unclean <hi>Daemons,</hi> and that the Scriptures speak of Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,

Witches and Magicians, by which we understand persons that combine with, and are confederate with impure Spirits, I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to take off this grand Objection against those Sacred Writings, by shewing the possibility of the thing, that there have been in all Ages of the World such as have practised and entred into Familiarity with wicked <hi>Daemons,</hi> and that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are not therefore to be derided and exposed by profane Wits when they speak of these things, as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact and Reality, since true and genuine Philosophy asserts the same, and the wisest and most learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed persons among the Heathens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it, and that the Arguments and Objections against it are weak and frivolous, and betray the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and unskilfulness of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>

               <p>THE Devil is not contented to abuse mankind at a distance, as it were, by all those ways and arts and illusions in offering tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from without, and thereby se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them from their obedience to God; but in all Ages those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Spirits have made use of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable subjects, with whom they have entred into a nearer union and stricter confederation; being first initiated into those hellish mysteries by some External solemnities, by which they surrender themselves to the will and power of those Aiery tyrants, and by seeming for a time to command, render themselves Vassals to the mockery, cruelty, and unbridled lusts and passions of those malicious Goblins for ever. And such persons are properly called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians, Wizards and Witches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:49482:34"/>Nevertheless it must here be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that there have been (and doubtless are) a kind of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancers</hi> or <hi>Magicians,</hi> who are not like the common sort, not only grosly sunk and debauched in their lives, but also knowingly do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to evil Spirits as such, for the gratification of their Lusts;) but more refined Ones, who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>Theurgists,</hi> such as being in some measure freed from the grosser Vices, and thinking to have to do only with good Spirits; yet being proud and vain-glorious, and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonders, and to transcend the generality of mankind, are by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Nemesis,</hi> justly exposed to the illusions of the Devil or evil Spirits, cunningly insinuating here, and apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accommodating themselves to them. Now such as these may have the assistance of wicked Spirits (though they know them not to be so) in the performance of many strange and wonderful things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any such solemn compacts as those fouler and grosser Sorcerers enter into. And though <hi>Porphyry</hi> and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49482:34"/>
some others did distinguish these two sorts, so as to condemn indeed the grosser, which they called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> or <hi>Goety,</hi> but allowed the other which they termed <hi>Theurgie,</hi> as lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable and honourable, and as an art by which they received Angels, and had communication with the Gods: Yet S. <hi>Austin</hi> assures us they are both damnable,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.Dl.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> and bound to the observation of false and silthy Devils instead of Angels: which he further proves by relating a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable story out of <hi>Porphyry,</hi> of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Chaldean</hi> who (good man) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that all his endeavour to purge his Soul by these <hi>Theurgick</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrations was frustrate, by reason a great Artist envying him this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, adjured the powers he was to deal with by holy Invocations, and bound them from granting him any of his requests. Of this sort were probably <hi>Zoroaster, Apollonius Tya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, Apuleius,</hi> and some others of later times.</p>
               <p>For a more distinct and orderly procedure in this Chapter, I shall consider these three things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:49482:35"/>1. First, the account which the Scriptures give of Magick or Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft. In the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> a severe punishment no less than Death it self is ordained for Necromancers, Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards and Witches, and such as have commerce with familiar Spirits, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.27. And the people of <hi>Israel</hi> are expresly forbid to consult with any such, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.31. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.10, 11.</p>
               <p>Now it seems very dilute and insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid to direct the intention of these Laws only against Juglers, Miracle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers or Impostors, as if it were impossible in the nature of the thing that there should be any confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men with evil Spirits, and that all those strange effects per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Necromantick Arts, and truly supposed to be brought to pass by the assistance of those <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, malicious and deceitful <hi>Daemons,</hi> with whom the Magicians are confederate, are only Prestigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous delusions and tricks, as it were, of <hi>Leger du maine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For first, the reason of the Law it self shews it to be of a higher and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49482:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
greater importance, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.12. <hi>For all that do these things are an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord: and because of these abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee.</hi> And surely nothing can be a greater and more hainous wickedness, than for a man to forsake the guidance of an Almighty Providence, and have recourse upon all occasions to those wandring Goblins, who intend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less than the destruction of all those that have to do with them.</p>
               <p>And that which adds a further confirmation of the greatness and Majesty of this Law is, what the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves saw before their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that is, the opposition made against <hi>Moses</hi> by the Magicians of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>; whose mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were not Juggles and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures done by sleight of hand, but real things produced and effected by the assistance of evil Spirits. For had they been otherwise, they might still have gone on, and not cried out, <hi>This is the finger of God,</hi> when a power transcending theirs restrained and overruled them. And indeed
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49482:36"/>
whoever considers aright the frame of the Polity and Kingdom of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, how far those evil <hi>Daemons</hi> have degenerated from all Goodness and Righteousness, and how studious they are to promote and disseminate a Spirit and Nature of Wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Vice, and withal how dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and implacable foes of mankind, and how ready at all turns to wait upon either the fond curiosity or more deliberate and designed pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of those that will be tampering with them, will not easily allow the concernment of these Laws to be so low and trifling as to look only at Juglers, Cheats and Impostors. But there having been such among the <hi>Pagans</hi> who surrounded the <hi>Iews,</hi> as really practised Sorcery, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into familiarity with wicked Spirits, it is certain that such are here likewise meant by <hi>Moses.</hi> And therefore</p>
               <p>In the second place, the words themselves do properly bear that sence: For <hi>Mecaseph</hi> denotes alike Magicians and Inchanters, and both these are called in Scripture <hi>Melahe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sim,</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:49482:36"/>
which word is from <hi>Lahas su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surravit,</hi> because those persons did by whispering or muttering converse with or desire the assistance of <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other word <hi>Ob</hi> will best be explained by <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Now as the Sacrifices offered up to the true God of <hi>Israel</hi> were Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rites, and those that did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of them did thereby enter into a Covenant with God to become his servants, and obey his Laws; so the

Aiery Principality hath Mimically observed the same thing, and those that offered Sacrifices to <hi>Daemons</hi> were supposed by partaking of those Sacrifices to enter into a stricter league and familiarity with those evil Spirits. And as all Covenants between God and Men have been performed by certain sensible Rites and Ceremonies (the nature of man in these Earthly Bodies requiring that it should be so) in like manner have all the mutual compacts and sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulations between wicked men and Devils been transacted by some sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible ways and signs or other. If therefore in all confederations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween men and superior and invisible Powers there have been some Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and visible Ceremonies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by these Consociations have been ratified and confirmed, why should we startle so much at the intimacy and familiarity of an impure and foul Spirit with a Wizard or Witch? Nay though there should intervene to complete the Hellish Contract some such External Rite as the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bloud from those wretched

persons by the wicked <hi>Daemon?</hi> For the drinking of bloud hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been made use of by Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and other wicked persons as the strongest Sacrament and Tye of a mutual Confederacy that could be imagined: Thus <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Valerius Publicola</hi> relates, that the Conspirators against <hi>Brutus</hi> and his fellow Consul bound themselves one to another by a great and horrible Oath, drinking the Bloud of a man, and shaking hands in his Bowels whom they would Sacrifice. And that the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> and <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> made use of the like Ceremonies is recorded by <hi>Eusebius, Epiphanius,</hi> and others; whose impious Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions gave occasion to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens to object <hi>Thyestean</hi> Banquets against the Christians.

flour, and so making bread of it. And what reason have we to think that there may not some such damnable solemnity be used in the compacts between Magicians and these silthy <hi>Daemons?</hi> The result of all then is this; If there have been Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Compacts between men and Devils transacted and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by sensible signs, then there may still be an Agreement or Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy between an evil Spirit and a Witch.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, we are to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, <hi>That there are divers Degrees of these lapsed Spirits, and that they sute themselves according to the tempers and constitutions of the persons they deal withal.</hi> This I have in part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready discovered, but shall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute it a little further: wherefore though the whole Army of these wicked Spirits that rebelled against God (how numerous soever) be cast down from the Ethereal Regions, and confin'd within the Atmosphere of the Earth, partly by a Divine Decree, and partly urged by the Fatal necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their degenerate natures, yet

their propensions and inclinations are not all alike, but are as various and different as those of mankind. <hi>Psellus</hi> from <hi>Marcus</hi> the Eremite (a skilful <hi>Daemonist</hi>) relates six kinds of <hi>Daemons</hi>; the first Fiery,<note place="margin">

And all
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49482:40"/>
these <hi>Daemons</hi> (saith he) hate both Gods and Men, but some worse than others.</p>
               <p>But whether there be just so many kinds is not at all material, certain it is, that among that degenerate crue their Humours and Passions are various and different, and so are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the undertaking different Employments, according as the great <hi>Divan</hi> or superior Council of Darkness shall order and allot them. And these <hi>Daemons</hi> take care to sute themselves to the tempers of those they have familiarity withal; and the Devils with whom <hi>Apollonius</hi> conversed might be far different from those fouler and grosser Fiends that attend a wicked Sorceress, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sucking her bloud, and nestling in her loathsome rags.</p>
               <p>To carry on this a little higher; A deep Contemplator that considers the frame of the World, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Beings contained therein, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their mutual relations, affections and dependences upon one another, shall find that there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sympathy running through the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49482:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Universe, whereby Superior things act upon Inferior; and this is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued through the whole material Creation by that Plastick nature that pervades the whole, and being life and activity, and consequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal, acts fatally and Magical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is, without any express con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness of what it does. From hence arises a kind of union that combines and makes a continuation between all things in Nature, which the <hi>Platonists</hi> signified, when they said the whole World was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the great Magician</hi> or Inchanter, and this they called <hi>Natural Magick,</hi> that is, the Concords and Discords, or Sympathies and Antipathies of Nature, as may be seen in several instances. Now as in Nature there is such a Conspiration, so likewise in Moral Agents, whereby things are carried by a certain Assimilation, according to the temper and disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind: Thus wicked men do by a kind of harmony or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of Nature invite and draw wicked Spirits to their Association; and this Magnetism is raised and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorated
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49482:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by a deep grounded exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitancy of the Passions and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; so that a person deeply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersed in Envy and Malice, and edged with a sharp desire of Revenge, does as naturally call and solicite an evil <hi>Daemon,</hi> as the cries and shrieks of dying Beasts will gather the rest of the same Species to their assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any greater difficulty in conceiving that an impure Spirit may thus be solicited into a confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy with a Witch (being otherwise sufficiently prompted to such villany by their own wicked natures) than that an evil <hi>Daemon</hi> should be called down by certain Charms and Previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Consecrations to inhabit an Image. For this latter S. <hi>Austin</hi> cites a passage out of <hi>Hermes Trisme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gist</hi>;<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Wherefore our Fathers erring exceedingly in Incredulity concerning the Deities, and never penetrating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the depth of Divine Religion, they invented an Art to make Gods, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they joyned a Virtue out of some part of the Worlds Nature, like to the other: and conjoyning these two, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

they could make no Souls, they framed certain Images, whereinto they called either Angels or Devils, and so by these mysteries gave these Idols power to hurt or help them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus far shewed that there have been in all Ages such persons as we call Witches or Magicians, not only from the account which the Holy Scriptures give of them, but from the Nature and Reason of the thing it self, and by rational evidence made good the possibility of a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration between Men and wicked <hi>Daemons</hi>; there remains no more now but to answer those Objections, and refute the Arguments, in which some so mightily triumph, that they think nothing is more plain than that Witchcraft is a mere Fiction and Imposture, and a ridiculous piece of non-sence, which it is greatly to be feared is thus far improved to cast a contempt upon the Sacred Scriptures, and to explode the Being of Spirits as Creatures rather existing in mens Brains and Imaginations, than any where else in the Universe, and by degrees to make Religion a meer cheat and delusion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> THis Objection proceeds either from ignorance, or misunderstanding the nature and powers of the Soul, whose union with the Body is not by Cogitation and Will (for then there might be an actual separation whenever men pleased) but fixed in some lower Power, which chains and links the Soul to the Body, even against her will in acute and sharp Diseases: And this union is upon certain terms and conditions, which so long as they continue unbroken and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, the Soul is confined to her Earthly mansion and habitation; but when these laws and conditions shall be infringed either by external violence or the prevalency of a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, or some other enormous and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49482:42"/>
extreme disorder and perturbation in the Body, then she dislodges, not by explicit Will and Counsel, but by Necessity and Constraint, because the Body is no longer tenantable or capable of her reception; and then ensues that which we properly call Death, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Par.</hi> 1. <hi>Ar.</hi> 6.</note> which (as that acute Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> rightly concludes) never happens through any defect or fault of the Soul, but only because some of the principal parts of the Body are depraved and corrupted: And the difference (he says) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Body of a living Man, and that of a dead one, is much what the same as between a Watch or any other <hi>Automaton</hi> (that is, any kind of Machine that moves of it self) wound up, having of it self the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal principle of those Motions for which it was instituted, with all things requisite for its action; and the same Watch or other Engine when it is broken, and the principle of its Motion ceases to act.</p>
               <p>From hence it will appear, that there is no impossibility in the thing, nor any such inextricable difficulty
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49482:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in conceiving how the Soul may actually separate from the Body for some time without ensuing Death. For the further clearing of which there are these two things required; 1. To shew how the necessary Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of life may be conserved and kept up while the Soul is separate from the Body. 2. To consider what those things are which may cause a Temporaneous disunion and disjunction of the Soul from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>First then it will not seem at all strange that the principal Functions of life should be performed for some time without the presence of the Soul to them who will admit of the principles of the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, which supposes that the Soul contributes nothing to any of those Motions in the Body, which depond not upon actual Will and Cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And if withal we suppose Brutes to be but Machines or <hi>Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata,</hi> it will be very clear that all those Motions which we call Vital in the Body may be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the actual presence of the Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:49482:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>But if this seem harsh and irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to them, who imagine bare Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanism to be an incompetent cause for the production of such effects; and that the <hi>Systole</hi> and <hi>Diastole</hi> of the Heart which later Anatomists have found to be a Muscular Constri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Relaxation, and the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Bloud through all parts of the Body, must proceed, not from a Mechanical but Vital principle: They may be pleased to consider that in Nature there is a certain <hi>Vis Plastica</hi> (or rather Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self is it) a <hi>Plastick Power,</hi> or Inconscious, Incorporeal life, which passing through the Universe, governs all the Motions of Matter every where, according to such laws fatally imprest upon it, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles the enmities and contrarieties of particular things, bringing them into one general Harmony in the whole, and strikes the first and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimental lineaments in the formati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Bodies of Animals; and lastly, may be particular Souls or Spirits be so far rapt and drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to consent, as to work strange ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49482:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not only upon their own, but upon separate and distant Bodies: Now by this Hylarchical principle or Plastick nature, so many of the vital motions of the Body may be kept in play as shall render it as fit and convenient for the Inhabitation of the Soul at its return, as it was when she dislodged and separated from it.</p>
               <p>In answer to the second particular it may be said, that it is possible the Soul may be rapt from this Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial Body, and carried to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and distant places, from whence she may make a Postliminiar return, by either of these two ways: 1. From a vehement affection or deep imagination piercing into the very lowest of her Powers. 2. By the assistance and activity of a more potent Spirit.</p>
               <p>While a House is standing whole and entire, the occupier of it may go out and in and still keep the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session; but when it is either thrown down and broken by an external vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or falls to pieces through the rottenness and consumption of its
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49482:44"/>
parts, he must lye in the streets, if he cannot get another dwelling: Such is the condition of the Soul in respect of the Body, whose princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal parts in which consist the safety of the whole being corrupted, she hastes away, never to return till it be rebuilt; But while they remain firm and safe, she may be carried out by strong and powerful affections, and re-enter and dwell there as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Nor is any Desire or Velleity whereby many will say they would fain go out of their Bodies to some distant place, though without any more potent affection than to try the experiment, enough to cause a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but it must be so strong and vehement, and so far imprint it self upon the imagination, as to reach that Plastick Faculty by which the Soul is connected to the Body, and these cords being loosened and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, she may without any difficulty pass into the open Air.</p>
               <p>And he that considers the strange and wonderful effects of Imagination even upon these our Earthly Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, will have no reason to doubt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49482:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but the same Power may extend to a Temporary disjunction of the Soul from the Body. Common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence shows how the <hi>Pica</hi> or longing of a pregnant Woman will by a keen Fancy stamp and impress the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the thing so passionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired upon the Child in her womb. I will not take upon me to maintain the truth of all those strange effects attributed to the strength of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by <hi>Fienus,</hi>

                  </gap> or Disjunction of the Soul from the Body without ensuing Death was possible.

               <p n="2">2. It is affirmed that there have been persons bodily acted and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed by evil Spirits: which is not only attested by the many relations of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Daemoniacks,</hi> that is, men possessed with Devils, or infested by them, recorded in the holy Scriptures in our Saviours time, but confirmed by later Writers of unexceptionable credit and veracity, that it were a perfect piece of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to go about to deny and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face them. And I do not doubt but a curious Observator may find some fresh instances even in our own Times; But this hankering after the bare Mechanical causes of things, and not acknowledging any higher prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple than Matter and Motion in the Universe, the very dregs of Atheism, hath cast so much dust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some mens eyes, that those effects which really proceed from the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Energy of Incorporeal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49482:48"/>
are by them ascribed to Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy and madness, or some other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily disease. Though it be true which is asserted by a very learned Author of our own, that the <hi>Iews</hi> in our Saviour's time, as they did not suppose all Mad-men to be <hi>Daemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acks,</hi> so neither all <hi>Daemoniacks</hi> Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; we reading of Devils cast out from others besides Mad-men; and of a Woman which had a Spirit of <hi>infirmity</hi> only, and was bowed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and could not lift up her self, which is said by our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> to have been <hi>bound by Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which purpose this learned person gives a notable instance of a Demoniacal possession out of <hi>Ferneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> a very experienced Physician, who was an eye-witness thereof: A young man of a Noble Family, who was strangely convulsed in his Body, having sometimes one member, and sometimes another, violently agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, insomuch that four several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were scarcely able to hold him; and this at first without any distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in his head, or crazedness in his brain. To whom <hi>Fernelius,</hi> with
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49482:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other skilful Physicians being called, applied all manner of remedies; Blisters, Purgations, Cupping-glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Fomentations, Unctions, Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and strengthning Medicines; but all in vain. The reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is thus given by the same <hi>Ferneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Quoniam omnes longe aberamus, &amp;c.</hi> i.e. Because we were all far from the knowledge of the Truth. For in the third Month it was first plainly discovered to us, that it was a certain <hi>Daemon,</hi> who was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all this mischief. He manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself by his speech, and by unusual words both in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> (though the Patient were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ignorant of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue) and by his revealing many of the secrets of those who stood by, especially of the Physicians, whom also he derided for tormenting the Patient in that manner with their frustraneous Remedies.</p>
               <p>By which it is apparent, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fancied remoteness and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, nor yet the sublimity of their natures is any bar to these wicked Spirits from having Communication
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49482:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with us Mortals, and that this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is vainly urged against the Being of Witches.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But to give it all the strength that may be, it is further answered, that it is not necessary to suppose the Grandees of the Airy Principality to trade with Witches, but that the Souls of extremely wicked persons after their release from the Body may do those feats. For whether we suppose that such as in this life have incorporated themselves into the Dark Society by all manner of villanous and flagitious actions, are, when loosened by Death from their Terrestrial Bodies, the Vassals and Slaves of those crafty <hi>Daemons,</hi> whose cursed inspirations and counsels they so eagerly followed, and so by them are employed in these abominable offices; Or whether the proclivity of their own Natures to all enormous wickedness, may not induce them to attempt Familiarity and Society with Sorcerers and Witches, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since those radicated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed habits of Vice contracted in this life are rather heightned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49482:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
than any way diminished or abated by the releasement from the flesh, and consequently it may be accounted by them a pleasant sport and pastime to tempt and inveigle such desolate and forlorn Mortals: Either of these ways are sufficient to beget a probability, that those <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars</hi> of Witches to whom they have linked themselves, may be no other than humane Souls deeply sunk and drowned in wickedness.</p>

               <p>Now though I am as far from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving credit to Poetical fictions as any, and do as little believe that a Magician can cause the Moon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend from Heaven, as that <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> once brought her into his sleeve, or that the charms of a Sorceress can make the world torpid &amp; benumm'd, stop the motion of the Earth, bring a paleness over the Stars, or turn Day into Night; yet I see no reason that should move me to think that a

Magician or Sorcerer by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of wicked <hi>Daemons</hi> cannot work a real Miracle, but that all those supernatural effects which they are at any time the causes of should be mere Juggles and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures.

of the whole world; God thereby recommending an Heavenly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which should heal the disorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and distempered minds of men, and correct and amend their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, restoring decayed Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and bringing them from the Tyrannous Kingdom of Satan to the meek and holy Government of his Son <hi>Iesus.</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> THis Objection to weak and impotent minds may seem to carry a great force with it, but to a Judgment devoid of Prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session and Prejudice, it will appear but like an ill planted Ordnance that makes indeed a great noise, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hits the Fort its murtherous load aimed at; as will be very manifest by these several and distinct replies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is a superior Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that keeps evil Spirits within certain bounds and limits, till men
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49482:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by such wicked practices tamper with them, and call them to a nearer familiarity and society. For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this <hi>Daemonarches,</hi> the Head and Prince of Devils, seem to have the Aerial Regions assigned to him as his Kingdom (whence he is called the Prince of the Power of the Air) yet is not this Power infinite and unlimited, but restrained and curbed by the Kingdom of Light, that is, by those Holy Angels who never revolted from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Heaven, and whom God has made to preside over those Apostate Legions. Now though the malice of these accursed Spirits be infinite, and their thirst and desire to deface and spoil the fair and irreprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible beauty of the works of Gods hands unlimited; yet are they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually under the inspection of higher and nobler Beings, who care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preserve those severe Laws and restraints Divine Providence hath put upon them, at which though their untamed hearts swell with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and rage, yet can they not flye from. And so much was confessed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49482:54"/>
by the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> that the <hi>Daemons</hi> who with an unwearied di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence range over Earth and Sea, — <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> are subdued and conquered by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine scourge. But when men either through a fond curiosity, or to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their wicked Lusts and Passions, shall hanker after a more intimate Familiarity, and begin to tamper with these <hi>Daemons,</hi> they willingly and readily offer themselves, for no other end but to beguile and ensnare, and at last ruine and destroy those who deserting Divine Providence had their recourse to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this Providence secures mankind from general outrages and devastations by evil Spirits. So that it is not in the power of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Darkness to depopulate the Earth, by offering violence to the inhabitants of it; nor can they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge the world, thereby to destroy Man and Beast; they cannot alter the fixed and established Laws of the Universe, nor invert the seasons of the year. For there is a chain of Government that runs down from

and its Agents is under a strict confinement and restraint, and they cannot bring a general mischief upon the world without a special permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a superior Providence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the exploits of wicked Spirits upon particular persons may be permitted for diverse good causes and reasons. As 1. To humble them for some sin; as in the case of those grievous and notorious sinners in the Apostolical time, who were delivered up to Satan, it is said, they were vexed and tormented by bodily pains and diseases inflicted by those evil Spirits, and that to bring them to a sincere repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of their Errors. But without any such judicial proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this envious Explorator or searcher for faults, when in his walk or ranging to and fro upon the Earth, he meets with a Christian professor, or pious person fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sin, then he is said, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, (as in the case of S. <hi>Peter, Luke</hi> 22. 31.) to require him of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to have him delivered up to him (for every sin gives the Devil a

more or less right and claim) as to a <hi>Lictor</hi> or Executioner, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to sift and shake him terribly, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by real possessions or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise bodily infestations, and the crafty Spirit may at the same time gratifie the impotent revenge of an accursed Hag. To this purpose it is observable what Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> recites out of the <hi>Hierusalem Targum</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.14.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Annot. in</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5.</note> supposed to be said to the Serpent by God, <hi>Cùm silii mulie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris praecepta legis deserverint, nec mandata observaverint, tu</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> the Serpent) <hi>firmus cris, &amp; percutiens eos in calcaneo eorum aegritudine affici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; When the children of the woman shall for sake the commandments of the law, thou shalt be strong, and shalt strike them on the heel, and inflict sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon them.</hi> 2. To try their faith and patience, as in the case of <hi>Iob,</hi> upon whom the envious Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter laid fore afflictions to battle (if he could) his faith in the Divine Goodness.

morbos citant, somniis animos terrent, mentes furoribus quatiunt, ut homines his malis cogant ad eorum auxilia de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currere,</hi> i. e. <hi>insinuate themselves into the bodies of men, and lying hid in their bowels, annoy their health, raise diseases, terrifie their minds with dreams, and shake them with madness, that they may compel them by these mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs to flye to them for help.</hi> But <hi>Origen</hi> says expresly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Contr. Cels. l.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 398.</note> that there are <gap reason="foreign">

this would be so far from being, that it would not so much as appear; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as Virtue cannot be, unless there be some Rival in the overcoming of whom it may exert and shew its strength. For as victory cannot be gained without a fight, neither can Virtue consist without an Enemy. Since then God has given Virtue to man, he hath likewise on the contrary appointed him an Enemy, lest Virtue languishing in idleness should lose its Nature. Whose very Reason lies in this, That it may be confirmed and strengthened by being shaken and enfeebled; nor can it any other way arrive to the highest pitch, unless being always tost by a detruding hand, it found its safety in a constant course of contending. For God would not have man attain Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Blessedness by easiness and soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. He therefore being about to give Virtue, gave an Enemy first, who should instil Lusts and Vices into the minds of men; who should be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of errors, and the contriver of all mischiefs; that where as God calls man to Life, he on the contrary should hale and lead them unto Death.

               <p>HAving now dispatched the most material Objections against the opinion of Witchcraft, I now come to the last part of my design, which is to draw some Practical Conclusions from this whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course in reference to the conduct of mens lives and manners; And</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:49482:61"/>First, since we have so clear a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Powers of Darkness, whose united and combined Forces are so potent and terrible in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the growth of sincere Piety and Religion, we should be strong in God, and couragiously resist them, being <hi>stedfast in the Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Divine Providence having placed us in this lower World, where we are surrounded with Enemies, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs not by this, our ruine and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, but that our contest should end in Victory, and our warfare crowned at last with Immortal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Felicity. Wherefore though our Enemies are tall and mighty Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and from the reason of their Natures have many advantages over frail Flesh and Bloud; yet such is the Constitution of things, and such the Arms we are furnished withal for the Combate, that as <hi>David</hi> through a great Faith and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Divine Assistance, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over the mighty Champion of the <hi>Philistines</hi> with a Sling and a Stone; so by a firm Trust reposed in the same Aid, we may overthrow

and become Victorious over all the Infernal Powers that desie the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the God of <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here therefore lies the Field of Gallantry and Honour, here are the <hi>Olympia</hi> of the Soul, wherein she strives and wrestles, not with Flesh and Bloud, but with the strong and subtle Forces of Hell and Darkness, not for a Garland of Flowers, but for Wreaths of Immarcessible Glory.

Then shall thy Soul with joy and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph be lifted up above the perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fate of this Inferior World, and be able to repress and extinguish the Incantations and Allurements of the Mundane Spirit through the might and power of a Divine Principle.

The Blessed <hi>Iesus,</hi> who in the days of his flesh by his Soveraign Command ejected Legions of Infernal Spirits out of their usurped Holds in the Bodies of men, and by his glorious Resurrection cast down the Prince of Darkness from his unjust Empire and Dominion in the World, maintains the same Righteous Cause still, and carries on a successful War against those Apostate Spirits, in which whosoever will persevere with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and resolution, shall at the last reap the joyous Fruits of his Victory and Patience, and receive from the hands of the glorious King of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness a Beautiful and Immortal Crown of life and blessedness.</p>

of our lives, we need not fear the numerous Armies and Troops of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> those evil <hi>Daemons</hi> that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble and unite themselves for our Ruine and Destruction. For he that loves God has presently the Invisible Guards of Heaven to pitch their Tents about him.</p>

                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 3.</note>For, (as <hi>Arnobius</hi> excellently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses against the <hi>Pagans) the first and only God is a sufficient Object of Divine veneration; that God (I say) who is the Father and Lord, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and Governour of all things; and in worshipping him, we worship all that is to be worshipped, and adore all that is fit to be adored, and pay our obsequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Venerations to all that require them of us. For since we hold us fast to the Head of Divinity it self, from whom all the Divinity of the most exalted Beings is derived, it were a vain thing to disperse our worship upon many and single persons, especially when we are in great measure ignorant both of their natures and names, and can have no clear knowledge of their numbers. But as in Earthly Kingdoms, when we pay our worship and service to the King
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49482:65"/>
himself, there is no need of offering the same by name to all who are attendants in the Royal Family; for asmuch as whatever Honour belongs to them, is tacitly acknowledged to be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that done to the King: after the same manner the holy Angels being a Royal Progeny, and deriving their Beings from the first and principal Head of all things, although they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no worship from us by name, yet know well enough that they are honoured likewise in common with their King.</hi> So that when by a strong Faith and the Holiness of our lives we have made God our Friend, the Heavenly Hosts are at the same time reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to us, and we are acknowledged by them as members of their society, and they lend us their kind and friendly assistance in countermining the designs of the Dark Kingdom against us. Neither is there any Christian that is ever left to his own naked and solitary Effort in this War with the powers of Hell, but is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and succoured with a mighty strength, even the Bright Armies and Legions of Heavens Almighty
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49482:66"/>
King. This, this is the Power that will at last prevail and subdue all things to it self, and the whole Kingdom of Darkness with all its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Associates shall be plunged into an Everlasting pit of Horror and Confusion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It concerns us carefully to avoid and mortifie those more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and Intellectual Vices, such as Pride, Malice, Faction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which link and conjoyn men fast to the Dark Kingdom. For though these sublimated Iniquities, and spiritual Wickednesses are not so much nor frequently taken notice of as the grosser pollutions of the Body, yet are they no less dangerous than the other, as being near a kin to the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical nature. Hell it self is as well a state of Life and Being as a Place; and when the Soul is overrun with hatred and envy, with deep anxiety and cruel despight, she is then really drawn into a living Hell, and the Devils nature perfectly formed in her. There is a certain Magical Sympathy running through this Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior World, which powerfully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49482:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
every thing like it self, and strives to assimilate and convert it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its own nature; thus every piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Vice seeks the enlargement of it self by a contagious Affriction of all capable Subjects; and the Dark or Worldly Spirit is diffused far and wide, and pulls and draws by hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den strings all those Beings that are predisposed to a Cognation and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinity with it; and thus are mens Souls often suck'd in by this Infernal and Powerful Nature before ever they think they are in any danger. Awake then O man from this drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy and deadly state, and prepare and purge thy heart from all such poisonous and hellish Passions; Let that universal Goodness which hath distilled its fruitful nature upon all the capacities of things, enlarge and widen thy Soul for a due reception of a Sacred Influence from above; that the holy life of God may revive within thee, which being of a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Birth and Extraction, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly carry up the Mind and Spirit to its own Fountain and Original.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:49482:67"/>Fifthly, A true survey of the Dark Kingdom and the Powerfulness thereof, cannot but beget in the hearts of all sincere Christians a great chearfulness and firm trust in God's Providence. There are some that think God is best served with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure look and melancholick counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as if the heart and life of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion lay in being dull and mopish, and as it were ever despairing of good; whereas this is only an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial and mechanical thing, or at best a Religion that men have fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and patched together out of their own distempered Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The <hi>Iews</hi> say that the Spirit of Prophecy will not rest upon a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick man; and the Sacred Writings inform us, that <hi>David</hi>'s Harp did sometimes dispossess <hi>Saul</hi> of his dull and Melancholick Devil, intimating surely to us, that God takes the greatest pleasure in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and serene Mind, that goes on in a chearful dependence upon that Almighty Providence that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circles all things both in Heaven and Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:49482:67"/>There are some Tempers and Constitutions of Bodies more adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and disposed to the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Assaults of the Devil than others, and consequently have more need of a due care and inspection over them. Thus though the most lucid Discoveries in Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces owe a great deal to a moderate Tincture of Melancholy (whence <hi>Aristotle</hi> observes, that such Persons have in some measure been Divinely affected in the Prediction of Future Events) yet when this Humour shall become ungovernable, and exceed the bounds of Reason, clouding all the Intellectual powers of the Soul, in this Dark and horrid Confusion there is no doubt but evil and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Spirits may insinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and taking the advantage of this Distemper, may produce such effects as no natural account can be given for. But I would not be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken; for it is not for a light and fantastick Spirit that I plead, since the devoutest Christian in the highest and most enravishing chearfulness and joy of his Mind, is then most
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49482:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
composed, grave and serious. I would only promote the Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that men should <hi>rejoyce in the Lord always,</hi> notwithstanding all the discouragements thrown in their way by the Powers of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: For this Divine joy and sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Mind is the state of Angels, and an Emblem of Heaven, whose bright and clear Mansions are never overspread by any black and dismal Clouds, but a perpetual and youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spring, an inexhausted source of pure Joy and Pleasure abides there for ever.</p>
