         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

deliuered me, with great
charge to imbrace it as my chéefe
instruction. My Companion that
went with me, he had one like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
the rest of the witnesses,
they had séene how common they
were, and in what reuerence and
authority they estéemed them: yet
these men would with shamelesse
faces deny it, yea, and if they
might haue béene so credited,
would haue sworne against it.</p>
            <p>This manifest reproofe, they
would not graunt vnto: but Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Campion</hi> taketh vpon him
to wrest it according to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
by answering that the booke
was not so ill as they tooke it for,
nor deserued any such iudgement
of preiudice.</p>
            <p>Now he thought he could not
be taken tardie, but supposed his
argument to passe vnreprooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>For that in the new imprinting
of this Booke, such matters as did
<pb facs="tcp:13305:16"/>
most sharply touch them,<note place="margin">Maister Campion aunswered this poynt subtilly: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in the last edition of the booke, the cheefe matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them selues were abridged.</note> were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged,
thinking none of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

but héerin Maister <hi>Campio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot
himself, for so slie an aunswer
could not couer so foule a blemish.
When they had notably conuicted
them of these matters, which with
obstinacie they styll denied: they
came to the intent of their secrete
comming ouer into this Realme,
which was for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> death of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty,
and ouerthrow of the whole
Realm, which should be by dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
rebellion, &amp; forraine hostili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sum wherof, in bréefe is thus.
This little Iland, God hauing so
bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifullie bestowed his blessings
vpon it, that except it prooue false
within it selfe, no treason whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer,
can preuaile against it, &amp; the

by reason y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> all his atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pts
haue prooued of no effect: he hath

against God &amp; their Prince:
so y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> when a foraine power shall
on a suddaine inuade this Realm,
the Subiectes thus seduced, must
ioyne with these in Armes, and so
shall the Pope attaine the sum of
his wish. But now let vs examin
eche matter with our selues, &amp; sée
into the bowels of this traiterous
action: yea, let vs before we passe
any farder, resolue our selues how
this secrete Sedition shoulde be
brought to passe. The people must
be first reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled from their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to imbrace the lawes &amp; decrees
of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Pope, then, they must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to forsake their duety and
allegeance to her Maiesty, because
she is excommunicated out of the
Popes Church, and he hath fréede
them of any obedience they should
vse to her: so that they may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
resist against her, and take
weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of defence in this behalfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13305:17"/>
But now, what are they that
must take vpon them, to win the
hearts of the people in this sorte?
they are no straungers, for if the
Pope should sende them on this
businesse, he might hap to faile, as
he hath doone before: for, the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and vnlearned, ignorant in
their language, doubtfull of their
intent, and beside hard to be wun
by those they know not, would
rather appeach them openly, then
agrée with them in this priuilie.
And if so be they might light vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
some, easie to be intreated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their Faithe is not stayed:
they might chaunce vpon some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
whose faithfull hearts to
their Soueraigne, would embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
them rather to die vpon such
a Traitour, then once they would
heare a motion, to offer them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.</p>
            <p>No, no, the Pope was well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
that these affayres would
not be so slightly dispatched, and
<pb facs="tcp:13305:17"/>
therfore such a doubtfull matter,
required farre more dilligent
Messengers.<note place="margin">The onely cause why the Pope hath kept his two Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries at <hi>Roome</hi> and at <hi>Rheimes</hi> so long: for that none might better mooue secret r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:13305:24"/>
one <hi>Thomas Nowell,</hi> whom I

lying there, named Maister
<hi>Woodwarde,</hi> of whom I could

            <p>This Préest,<note place="margin">This Preest was the first, that euer I heard to name the treason.</note> hauing my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe

he feared would bee vtterlye

            <p>For (quoth he) the Popes

As for your twaine, the
best counsell that I can giue you,
is to enter into Préesthood, and so
you may be able to benefit your

it is to be doubted, that there will
be great want of men of the

they breake their vowe made to

the sentence of death was
pronounced on them.</p>

Angelles and of men, satisfying
my selfe to dye, as becommeth a
true Christian and Catholique
man.</p>
            <p>As for the Treasons which
haue beene layde to my charge,
and I am come héere to suffer
for: I desire you all to beare
witnesse with me, that thereof I
am altogether innocent.</p>
            <p>Wherevpon, aunswer was
made to him by one of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell,
that he might not séeme to
deny the obiections agaynst him,
hauing béene prooued so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
to his face, bothe by
sufficient witnesse and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>Well my Lorde (quothe
he) I am a Catholique man
and a Préeste, in that faithe
haue I liued hytherto, and in
that faithe I doo intend so dye,
<pb facs="tcp:13305:49"/>
and if you estéeme my religion
Treason, then of force I must
graunt vnto you as for any other
Treason, I will not consent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>Then was hee mooued as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his Trayterous and hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
offence to the Quéenes
moste excellent Maiestie: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
he aunswered: Shée is my law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Princesse and Quéene, there
somewhat he drew in his woords
to himselfe, whereby was gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that somewhat hee would
haue gladly spoken, but the great
timeritie and vnstable oppinion
of his conscience, wherein he was
all the time, euen to the death,
would not suffer him to vtter it.</p>
            <p>Héere is with iudgement, a
déepe point and high matter to be
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered, that this man, alwayes
directing the course of his life to
a vaine glorious imagination,
and alwayes couetous to make
himselfe famous: at this instant
<pb facs="tcp:13305:49"/>
made a perfect discouerie of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p>For béeing somewhat learned,
all matters whatsoeuer, as you
haue heard before, he bare away
with a magesticall countenaunce,
the visor of vanitie, aptly fitting
the face of onely hipocrisie: what
was sounde he would make So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisticall,
what was the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
trueth of it selfe, he would
carry in his own conceit, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
the people with a pleasant
quirk, or some such stuffe, onely
to purchase him credit and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And he was not to learne, to
set a couragious countenaunce on
euery such slight reason: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he peruerted many, deceyued
more, and was thought suche a
Champion, as the Pope neuer
had the like.</p>
            <p>But nowe beholde the man,
whom neyther Racke nor Rope
should alter, whose faithe was
<pb facs="tcp:13305:50"/>
such as he boasted inuincible: feare
had caught holde on this braue
boaster, and terrour entred his
thoughtes, whereby was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
his impudent dissimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Nowe let it with patience bée
mooued a lyttle, that the outward
protestations of this man, vrged
some there present to teares, not
entring into conceyte of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
hipocrisie: to make a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
definition of this perillous
deceiuer, not by coniecture, but
by proofe it shall be thus aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edmund Campion,</hi> as it is by
men of sufficient credit reported,
at what tyme he spent his studie
héere in Englande, bothe in the
Hospital, and also at the vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of <hi>Oxenford:</hi> was alwaies ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to a meruailous suppose in
himselfe, of ripe iudgement, pro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt
audacitie, &amp; cunning conueyaunce
in his Schoole pointes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through,
<pb facs="tcp:13305:50"/>
he fell into a prowde and
vaineglorious iudgement, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to be eloquent in phrase, and
so fine in his quirkes and fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
coniectures: that the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
he wun by his smoothe deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
some other affecting his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt
imaginations, he charmed
with subtilitie, and choaked with
Sophistrie.</p>
            <p>The learned, who behelde his
practises and peremptory order of
lyfe, pittying his follie, &amp; wishing
him a more stayed determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
loathed his manners, yet
looued the man, because Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Charitie wylled them so to
doo.</p>
            <p>Nowe this glorious <hi>Thraso,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
by his Lybeiles made him
selfe famous, and vnder shewe
and suppose of great learning,
(though in deede béeing approoued,
found verie simple, to the spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
giuen of him) subdued ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to affecte him verie much:
<pb facs="tcp:13305:51"/>
when he was taken, he knew it
stoode him vpon, not to loose the
credit ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly he had wun secretly,
wherefore in his former ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
manner, bothe in Prison, at
his Araignement, yea, and at his
death, he continued the same in
all points, which the foulnes of
his Treasons blemished euery
way.</p>
            <p>Now indéede, as our English
nation is bothe loouing and pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
so, many séeing the giftes of
God, so well bestowed on the
man, and by him applyed to so
great abuse, through naturall
kindnesse bemoned his case, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
be had not fallen in so trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
a cause.</p>
            <p>This poynt, least some should
haue vsed to a wurse coniecture,
I thought good in bréefe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to manifest.</p>
            <p>Then was mooued to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
his Treasons and haynous
offences against the Quéenes
<pb facs="tcp:13305:51"/>
Maiestie, which impudentlie he
styll denied, séeming to vtter
woordes on the behalfe of one <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardson,</hi>
one likewise of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned
Traitours, taking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
his conscience that it was not
he: which hath béene prooued to
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, for that it is known,
howe this <hi>Richardson</hi> is he, who
distributed <hi>Campions</hi> Libels and
Bookes abroade, &amp; when he was
put to his oath, whether it was he
or no, he refused to sweare on his
behalfe.</p>
            <p>Pray with them in Englishe,
as he was desired, he would not,
but sayde his <hi>Pater noster</hi> in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,
&amp; desired all those of the house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
of Faith, to saye one <hi>Credo</hi>
for him.</p>
            <p>Many indirect aunsweres he
made, as when he was mooued to
aske the Quéene forgiuenesse, and
when the Preacher requested him
to shewe some signe of a penitent
sinner, when shortlie he replyed:
<pb facs="tcp:13305:52"/>
You and I, we are not of one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
After a fewe silent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to him selfe, the Carte was
drawen away, and he committed
to the mercie of God. There he
hanged tyll he was dead, when
béeing cut downe, he was bowel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and quartered, according as it
was appointed by Iustice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Raphe Sherwin</hi> seemed a man of
better iudgement, more learned,
and more obedient, he sayde the
Lordes Prayer in English, belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
in God that made him, in
Christe his sonne that saued him,
and in the holie Ghost that sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
him: and according to the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> desired Iesus,
that he would be to him Iesus, as
much to say, as his Sauiour and
Redéemer. He lykewise confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him self a Catholique man, &amp; a
Préest, intending to die in that
faith. But when the Treasons
were mooued to him, he lykewise
séemed to make deniall thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13305:52"/>
He asked the Quéenes Maiestie
forgiuenesse, and desired that shée
might long liue and raigne ouer
vs. Then was read to him the
Booke of the aduertiseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which
before had béen read to <hi>Campion,</hi>
and after a fewe prayers he lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
ended his lyfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander Brian</hi> séemed more
obstinate and impious, vsing very
little signe of repentaunce, and
hartie humilitie: he vsed many
prayers to him selfe, and spake
very little woorthy the rehearsall.
Iustice béeing executed on him, he
and <hi>Sherwin</hi> were quartered,
according as <hi>Campion</hi> had
béene before them. God
graunt that the offences
of these, may be a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to all other.</p>
