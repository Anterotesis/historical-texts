         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An exhortation made to the
Honourable House of Commons
and Reverend Divines of the Assembly,
By M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. NYE before hee read
the COVENANT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Great and solemn work (honourable and
Reverend) this day is put into our hands
let us stir up and awaken our hearts unto
it. Wee deal with God as well as with
men, and with God in his greatnesse and
excellency, for by him wee swear, and at the same
time we have to do with God and his goodnesse, who
now reacheth out unto us a strong and seasonable arme
of assistance. The goodnesse of God procuring succour
and help to a sinfull and afflicted people, (such are we)
ought to bee matter of fear and trembling even to all
that hear of it, <hi>Ier.</hi> 33. 9. We are to exalt and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
him this day who is fearfull in praises, sweare
by that Name which is Holy and Reverent, enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Covenant and League that is never to be forgotten
by us nor our posterity, and the fruit I hope of it shall
be so great, as both we and they shall have cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
it with joy; and such in Oath as for matter,
persons, and other circumstances; the like hath not been
in any age or Oath we read of in sacred or humane Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
yet sufficiently warranted in both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97236:3"/>
The parties ingaging in this league are three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
famous for the knowledge, &amp; acknowledgment
of Christ above all the kingdomes in the world; to swear
before such a presence, should mould the spirit of man
into a great deal of reverence; what then to be engaged,
to be incorporated, and that by sacred Oath, with such
an high and honourable Fraternity? An Oath is to be
esteemed so much the more solemne, by how much
greater the persons are that sweare each to other: as in
heaven when God sweares to his Son, on earth when
Kings swear each to other, so in this businesse, where
Kingdomes sweare mutually.</p>
            <p>And as the solemnity of an Oath is to bee measured
by the persons swearing, so by the matter also that is to
be sworn to; God would not swear to the Covenant of
works, hee intended not to honour it so much, it was
not to continue, it was not worthy of an Oath of his:
but to the Covenant of grace, which is the Gospell, he
swears and repents not of it. God swears for the salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of men, and of Kingdomes: And if Kingdomes swear
what Subject of an Oath becommeth them better then
the preservation and salvation of Kingdomes, by esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
the kingdome of a Saviour amongst them, even
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who is a Mediator
and Saviour for Nations as well as particular persons?
The end also is great and honourable, as either of the
former <hi>two is better then one,</hi> saith he who best knoweth
what is best; and from whom alone every thing hath
the goodnesse it hath. Association is of divine Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring,
not only the beginning of Creatures, but the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of them together: the cluster as well as the grape is
the work of God: consort and harmony amongst men,
especially amongst saints, is very pleasing unto the Lord
If when but two or three agree &amp; assent upon any thing
<pb facs="tcp:97236:3"/>
on earth, It shall be confirmed in heaven: and for this,
because they gather together in his name, much more
when two or three Kingdomes shall meet and consent
together <hi>in his name and for his name, that God may
bee one, and his name one amongst them,</hi> and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
amidst them. That prayer of Christ seemeth to
proceed from a feeling sense of his own blessednesse:
<hi>Father, that they may be one, as thou in me, &amp;c.</hi> Unity
amongst his Churches and children must needs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be very acceptable unto him: For out of the more
deep sense desires are fetcht from within us, the more
pleasing will be the answer of them unto us, Churches
and Kingdomes are dear to God, his patience towards
them, his compassion over them, more then particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
persons, sheweth it plainly. But Kingdomes willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
engaging themselves for his Kingdome, his Christ,
his Saints, the purity of religion, his worship, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
in all particulars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in all humility sitting
down at his feet to receive the law and the rule from his
mouth, what a price doth hee set upon such? Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when (as we this day) sensible of our infirmity,
of an unfaithfull heart not, steddy with our God, but
apt to start from the cause, if we feel the knife or the
fire: who binde our selves with cords, as a sacrifice to
the hornes of the Altar. We invocate the name of the
great God, that his vowes, yea his curse may bee upon
us, if we do not this, yea though we suffer for so doing
that is, if we endeavour not so farre as the Lord shall
assist us by his grace, to advance the Kingdome of the
Lord Jesus Christ here upon earth, and make Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
once more the praise of the whole world, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the contradictions of men.</p>
            <p>What is this but the contents and matter of our
Oath? What doe we covenant? What do we vow? Is
<pb facs="tcp:97236:4"/>
it not the preservation of Religion, where it is reformed
and the Reformation of Religion, where it needs? Is
it not the Reformation of three Kingdomes, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
universall, Doctrine, Discipline, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in whatsoever the Word shall discover unto us? To
practise, is a fruit of love; to reforme, a fruit of zeale;
but so to reforme, will bee a taken of great prudence,
and circumspection in each of these Churches. And all
this to be done according to Gods Word, the best rule,
and according to the best reformed Churches, the best
interpreters of this Rule. If <hi>England</hi> hath obtained to
any greater perfection in so handling the word of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
and truths, that are according to godlinesse
as to make men more godly, more righteous: And if
in the Churches of <hi>Scotland</hi> any more light and beauty
in matters of Order and Discipline, by which their
Assemblies are more orderly: or if to any other Church
or person it hath been given better to have learned
Christ in any of his wayes then any of us; wee shall
humbly bow, and kisse their lips that can speak right
words unto us in this matter, and help us into the nearest
uniformity with the word and minde of Christ in this
great work of Reformation.</p>
            <p>Honourable and Reverend Brethren, there cannot be
a more direct &amp; effectuall way to exhort and perswade
the wise, and men of sad and serious spirits (and such
are you to whom I am commanded to speak this day)
then to let into their understandings the weight, and
worth, and great importance of the work they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
unto. This oath is such, and in the matter and
consequence of it, of such concernment, as I can truly
say, it is worthy of us, yea of all these Kingdomes, yea
of all the Kingdomes of the world, for it is swearing
fealty and allegeance unto Christ the King of Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:97236:4"/>
and a giving up of all these Kingdomes, which are his
inheritance, to be subdued more to his thron, and ruled,
more by his Scepter, upon whose shoulders the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is laid, and <hi>in the increase of whose Government and
peace there shall be no end, Esay</hi> 9. Yea, we finde this
very thing in the utmost accomplishment of it, to have
been the Oath of the greatest Angel that ever was, who
setting his feet upon two of Gods Kingdomes, the one
upon the Sea, the other upon the Earth, lifting up his
hand to heaven, as you are to doe this day, and so
swearing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10 The effect of that oath you shall finde
to be this, that the Kingdomes of the world become the
Kingdomes of the Lord and his Christ, and hee shall
reigne for ever. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11, His Oath was for the full and
finall accomplishment, this of yours for a graduall, yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
a great performance towards it.</p>
            <p>That which the apostles and primitive times did so
much and so long pray for, though never long with
much quietnesse enjoyed, that which our Fathers in
these latter times have fasted, prayed and mourned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
yet attained not; even the cause which many dear
Saints now with God, have furthered by extreamest
sufferings, poverty, imprisonment, banishment, death,
ever since the first dawning of Reformation: That and
the very same is the very cause and work that wee are
come now, through the mercy of Jesus Christ, not only
to pray for, but swear to. And surely it can be no other,
but the result and answer of such prayers and teares of
such sincerity &amp; sufferings, that three Kingdomes should
be thus born, or rather new born in a day; that these
Kingdomes should be wrought about to so great an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
then which nothing is higher, for to this end
Kings raigne, Kingdomes stand, and States are upheld.</p>
            <p>It is a speciall grace and favour of God unto you
<pb facs="tcp:97236:5"/>
Brethren, Reverend and Honourable, to vouchsafe you
the opportunity, and to put into your hearts (as this
day) to engage your lives and estates in matters so much
concerning him and his glory. And if thou should doe
no more but lay a foundation stone in this great work,
and by so doing engage posterity after you to finish it,
it were honour enough: But there may yet further use be
made of you, who now are to take this oath, you are
designed as chief master Builders and choice instruments
for the effecting of this setled Peace and Reformation;
which if the Lord shall please to finish in your hands, a
greater happinesse on earth, nor a greater means to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
your glory and crown in heaven, you are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of. And this let me further adde for your encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of what extensive good and fruit in the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of it, this very oath may prove to be, we know not.
God hath <hi>set his Covenant like the Heavens,</hi> not onely
for duration, but like also for extension: The Heavens
move and roule about, and so communicate their light,
and heat, and vertue, to all places and parts of the
earth; so doth the <hi>Covenant</hi> of God, so may this gift
bee given to other Covenants that are framed to that
pattern. How much this solemne League and oath may
provoke other reformed Churches to a further Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of themselves; what light and heat it may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
abroad to other parts of the world, it is only
in Him to define to whom is given the <hi>utmost ends of the
earth for his inheritance,</hi> and worketh by his exceeding
great power great things out of as small beginnings.</p>
            <p>But howsoever, this I am sure of, it is a way in all proba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bility
most likely to enable us to preserve &amp; defend our
religion against <hi>our common enemies,</hi> and possible a more
sure fundation this day will be laid for ruining Popery
<pb facs="tcp:97236:5"/>
and Prelacy, the chief of them, then as yet we have
been led unto in any age.</p>
            <p>For Popery, it hath been a Religion ever dexterous
in fencing and muniting it self by association and joynt
strength, all sorts of Professors amongst them are cast
into Fraternities and Brother hoods, and these Orders
carefully united by Vow one with another and under
some more generall notion of common dependancie.
Such States also &amp; Kingdomes as they have thus made
theirs; they endeavour to improve and secure by strict
combinations and leagues each to other, witnesse of
late yeares that <hi>La Sainte ligue,</hi> the holy league. It
will not bee unworthy your consideration, whether
seeing the preservation of Popery hath been by Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
and Covenants, God may not make a League
or Covenant to be the destruction of it: Nay the very
rise of Popery seemeth to bee after such a manner by
Kings, that is, Kingdomes assenting and agreeing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
by some joynt Covenant (the text saith <hi>with one
minde,</hi> why not then with one mouth) to give their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and strength unto the Beast, and make war against
the Lamb. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. where you read the Lamb shall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
the Beast, and possibly with the same wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
hee is the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, hee
can unite Kings and Kingdoms, and give them one minde
also to destroy the Whore and bee her utter ruine, And
may not this dayes work be a happy beginning of such
a blessed expedition?</p>
            <p>Prelacie another common enemy, that we Covenant
and swear against, what hath it been, or what hath the
strength of it been, but a subtile combination of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
men formed into a policy or body of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
framing themselves into Subordination and
Dependencie one upon another; so that the interest of
<pb facs="tcp:97236:6"/>
each is improved by all, &amp; a great power by this means
acquired to themselves, as by sad experience we have
lately found: The joynts and members of this body, you
know were knit together by the sacred engagement of
an Oath, the Oath of Canonicall obedience as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it: You remember also with what cunning and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie
they endeavoured lately to make this Oath and
Covenant more sure for themselves and their posterity.
And intended a more publike, solemn and universal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
then since Popery this cause of theirs was
ever maintained or supported by. And questionlesse,
<hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> also must at last have been brought
into this holy league with <hi>England.</hi> But blessed be the
Lord, and blessed be his good hand the Parliament, that
from the indignation of their spirits against so horrid
a yoke, have dashed out the very brains of this project,
and are now this day present before the Lord to take
and give possession of this blessed Ordinance, even an
Oath and Covenant as solemne and of as large extent as
they intended theirs; uniting these three Kingdoms into
such a League and happy combination, as will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
preserve us and our Reformation against them,
though their iniquity in the misteries of it should still
be working amongst us. <hi>Come</hi> therefore (I speak in
the words of the Prophet) <hi>let us joyne our selves to the
Lord,</hi> and one to another, and each to all, <hi>in a perpetual
Covenant that shall not be forgotten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are now entring upon a work of the greatest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and concernement, to us, and to our posterity after
us, that ever was undertaken by any of us, or any of our.
Forefathers before us, or neighbouring Nations about
us; if the Lord shall blesse this our beginning, it will
bee a happie day, and we shall be a happy people. An
Oath is a duty of the first commandment, and therfore
<pb facs="tcp:97236:6"/>
of the highest and noblest order and rank of duties,
therefore must come foorth attended with choycest
graces, especially with these two, humility, and fear.
Fear, not onely of God, which ought to bee in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
measure, <hi>Gen. 31. 53. Iacob</hi> swear by the feare of
his father <hi>Isaac,</hi> as if hee coveted to inherit his fathers
grace, as well as his fathers God: But also feare of an
Oath, it being a dreadfull duty, and hath this peculiar,
it is established by the Oath of God, I have sworne that
unto mee every tongue shall sweare, <hi>Isa</hi> 45. 23. It is
made the very Character of a Saint, hee feares an Oath
<hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 2.</p>
            <p>Humility is another grace requisite, set your hearts
before God in an humble obedient frame; <hi>Deut. 6. Thou
shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him, and sweare by
his Name.</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was sensible of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
even in the very act of this duetie, <hi>Rom</hi> 1. 9,
<hi>I call God to witnesse whom I serve in my spirit;</hi> Although
it be a work of the lips, yet the heart and the whole man
must be interessed if we expect this worship to be acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable,
<hi>Psal. 119 108. Accept the free will offering of my
mouth, and teach me thy judgements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Also it must bee done in the greatest simplicity and
plainnesse of spirit, in respect of those with whom wee
Covenant. We call God as a witnesse betwixt us who
searcheth the heart: <hi>With him is wisedome and strength,
the deceived &amp; deceiver is his, Iob</hi> 12. 19. He hath wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to discover, and strength to punish, if our hearts
be not upright to our Brethren in this matter. Let us be
contented with this, that the words of our Covenant be
bands, it may not be so much as in the desire of our harts
that they should become snares, no not to the weakest
and simplest person that joyneth with us. In the whole
work make your addresse unto God, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did to his
<pb facs="tcp:97236:7"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> there bee the like fear and jealousie
over: your spirits, <hi>Gen. 27. 12. My Father peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver, and
I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I take liberty with more earnestnesse to presse this care
upon you, because I have observed Oaths and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
have been undertaken by us formerly, and by the
command of authority, the fruit whereof, though great
yet not answered our expectation; the Lord surely
hath been displeased with the slightnesse of our hearts
in the work. I beseech you bee more watchfull, and
stirre up your hearts with more industry this day then
ever before: As it is the last Oath you are likely to take
in this kinde, so it is our last refuge, <hi>tabula post naufra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium.</hi>
If this help not, wee are likely to remaine to our
dying day an unhappy people, but if otherwise, <hi>You will
indeed sweare with all your hearts, and seek the Lord with
your whole desire, God will bee found, and give you rest
round about, 2 Chor.</hi> 15, 15.</p>
            <p>And having sworn, and entred into this solemne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
to God and man, make conscience to doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
otherwise it is better thou shouldest not vow
<hi>Ecclesiast.</hi> 5. As it is said of fasting, it is not the bowing
down of the head for a day, so of this solemne swearing
it is not the lifting up of the hand for a day, but an honest
and faithfull endeavouring after the contents of this
Covenant all our dayes, A truce breaker is reckoned up
amongst the vilest of Christians, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 3. so a
Covenant-breaker is listed amongst the worst of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 31, But hee that sweareth and changeth
not, though he swear to his hurt, that is, he that wil keep
his Covenant and Oath though the contents of it prove
not for him, nay possibly against him, yet hee will keep
it for his Oaths sake, such a one <hi>shall have his habitation
with the most High, and dwell in his Tabernacle, Psal.</hi> 15.
<pb facs="tcp:97236:7"/>
And as for you, Reverend Brethren, that are Ministers
of the Gospel, there is yet another obligation will lie
upon you, let us look to our selves, and make provision
to walk answerable to this our Covenant for the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
sake; it will reflect a great aspertion upon the truth
of the Gospel, if wee should bee false or unconstant in
any word or purpose, though in a matter of lesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
as you can easily collect from that apology
of <hi>Paul 2 Cor.</hi> 1 17, 18. how much more in such a
case as this is, if we should bee found to purpose, nay
more, to vow, and covenant, and swear, and all this,
<hi>according unto the flesh, and with us there should be,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>withstanding
all these obligations, <hi>yea, yea, and nay, nay?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we may all who take the Covenant this day, he
constant, immoveable, and abound in this work of the
Lord, that we may not start aside, or give back, or goe
on uncomfortably, there is a twofold grace or qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to bee laboured after.</p>
            <p>1 Wee must get courage, spirits that are bold and
resolute. It is said in <hi>Haggai,</hi> that <hi>the Lord stirred up
the spirit of Zerubbabel Governour of Iudah, and the spirit
of Ioshua the High Priest, and the spirit of all the remnant
of the people, and they came, and did work in the house of
the Lord,</hi> the vvork of Gods house: Reformation-work
especially, is a stirring work; read Stories, you finde not
any where Reformation made in any age, either in
Doctrine or Discipline, without great stirre and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.
This was foretold by the same Prophet. Chap. 2.
vers. 7. the promise is, <hi>Hee will fill his house with glory</hi>
but what goeth before, vers 6, <hi>Yet once it is a little while
and I will shake the Heavens, and the Earth, and the Sea,

vvhen they had done so, complained of the brethren to
the Rulers, as men <hi>that turn the world upside down, ver.</hi> 6
Read also <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 27, 30. 31. In such a work therefore
men had need bee of stout, resolute, and composed spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
that vve may bee able to goe on in the maine, and
stirre in the middest of such stirres, and not bee amazed
at any such doings. It may possibly happen, that even
amongst your selves there vvill bee out cryes, Sir, you
vvill undo all, saith one, you vvill put all into confusion
saith another, if you take this course, saith a third, vve
can expect nothing but bloud: but a vvise States-man,
like an experienced Sea-man, knovveth the compasse of
his vessel, and though it heave and tosse, and the passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
cry out about him, yet in the middest of all hee is
himself, turneth not aside from his work, but steereth on
his course. I beseech you let it be seriously considered,
if you meane to doe any such work in the house of God
as this is; if you meane to pluck up what many yeares
agoe was planted, or to build up what so long agoe was
pulled downe, and to goe thorough with this work, and
not bee discouraged, you most begge of the Lord this
excellent spirit, this resolute stirring spirit, otherwise
you will bee out spirited, and both you and your cause
slighted and dishonoured.</p>
            <p>2 On the other hand wee must labour for humility,
prudence, gentlenesse, meeknesse. A man may bee very
zealous and resolute, and yet very meek and mercifull:
Jesus Christ was a Lyon, and yet a Lambe also; in one
place hee telleth them hee commeth to send <hi>fire on the
<pb facs="tcp:97236:8"/>
earth:</hi> and in another place rebuketh his Disciples for
their fiery spirits, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 54: There was the like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
in <hi>Moses,</hi> and in <hi>Paul,</hi> and it is of great use, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in this worke of Reformation. I have not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
any disputes carried on with more bitternesse in
mens writings, and with a more unsanctified heat of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
yea and by godly men too, then in contraversies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
discipline, Church Government, Ceremonies,
and the like. Surely to argue about Government with
such ungoverned passions, to argue for Reformation
with a spirit so unreformed, is very uncomely Let us
be zealous, as Christ was, to cast out all, to extirpate
and root out every plant his heavenly Father hath not
planted; and yet let us doe it in an orderly way, and
with the spirit of Christ, whose servants we are, <hi>The ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle to all men,
apt to teach, patient, in meeknesse instructing those that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,</hi>
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 24 25. We solemnly engage this day our
utmost endeavours for Reformation; let us remember
this, that too much heat, as well as too much coldness,
may harden men in their wayes, and hinder Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>Brethren, let us come to this blessed work, with such
a frame of heart, with such a minde for the present, with
such resolutions for the time to come; let us not bee
wanting to the opportunity God hath put into our
hands this day; and then I can promise you, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>Consider this day and upwards, even from this day,
that the foundation of the Lords work is laid. Consider it,
from this day will I blesse you, saith the Lord.</hi> Nay, we
have received as it were the first fruits of this promise,
for as it is said of <hi>some mens good works they are manifest
beforehand, 1 Tim.</hi> 5. Even so may be said of the good
work of this day, it is manifest before hand, God

hath as it were before hand testified his acceptance;
while wee were thinking and purposing this free will
Offering, he was protecting and defending our Armie,
causing our enemies the enemies of this work to flie

this Oath and Covenant shall be <hi>Iudahs</hi> joy, the joy
and comfort of this whole Kingdome, yea, of all three

            <p>Jesus Christ King of the Saints govern us by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,

a little; it were both sin and shame
to us in this so acceptable a time, in this
day, which the Lord hath made, to bee silent and to
say nothing: If we should hold our peace, wee could
neither be answerable to God, whose cause and worke
is in hand; nor of this Church and Kingdome, unto
which we have made so large profession of duty, &amp; ow
much more; nor to our Native Kingdome, so abundant
in affection toward you; nor to our own heart, which
exceedingly rejoyce to see this day: We have greater
reason then the leprous men sitting in a time of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie
at the gate of <hi>Samaria,</hi> to say one to another,
We do not well, this day is a day of good tydings, and
we hold our peace? it is true, the <hi>Syrians</hi> are not yet

this day, being sincerely performed and faithfully
pursued, shall put to flight, not onely the <hi>Syreans</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians,</hi>
but all other enemies of the Church of God,
of the Kings honour, and of our liberty and peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97236:10"/>
For it is acceptable to God and well pleasing in his
sight, when his people come willingly in the day of his
power (and how shall they not be willing in the day of
his power?) to enter a religious Covenant, with him
and amongst themselves whatsoever be the condition
of the people of God, whether in sorrow and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before deliverance, or in rejoycing &amp; thanksgiving
after deliverance? this is it, which the Lord waits for at
their hands, which they have been used to performe, and
with which hee hath been so well pleased, that it hath
been the fountaine of many deliverances and blessings
unto them. When a people beginneth to forget God, he
lifteth up his hand against them and smitteth them: And
when his people, humbled before him, lift up their hands
not only in supplication, but in covenant before the most
high God, he is pleased (such is his mercy and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
compassion) first, to lift his hand unto them, saying,
<hi>I am the Lord your God,</hi> as we have it three times in two
verses of the 20. of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and next he stretcheth out
his hand against his enemies and thers. It is the best
work of Faith, to joyn in Covenant with God, the best
work of love and Christian Communion to joyn in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with the people of God; the best work of the best
zeal, to joyn in Covenant for Reformation, against the
enemies of God and Religion; the best work of true loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie,
to joyn in Covenant for the preservation of our
King and Superiours; and the best proof of naturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
(and to be without naturall affection, is one of the
great sinnes of the Gentiles) to joyn in Covenant for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of our Native Countrey, Liberties, and Lawes;
Such as for these necessary ends to withdraw and are
not willing to enter into Covenant, have reason to enter
into their own hearts and to look into their Faith, love.
zeal, loyalty, and naturall affection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97236:10"/>
As it is acceptable to God, so have we for it the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
and example, not onely of the people of God of
old, of the Reformed Churches of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the
Low Countreyes; but of our owne Noble and Christian
Progenitors in the time of the danger of Religion,
which is expressed in the Covenant it self. The defect
was; They went not on throughly to enter in a solemne
Covenant; an happinesse reserved for this time; which
had they done, the corruptions and calamities of these
dayes might have been prevented: And if the Lord shal
bee pleased to move, loose, and enlarge the hearts of his
people in his Majesties Dominions to take this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
not in simulation, nor in luke warmnesse, as those
that are almost perswaded to bee Christians, but as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
the people of God, it shall bee the prevention
of many evils and miseries, and a meane of many and
rich blessings, spirituall and temporall, to our selves, our
little ones, and the Posterity that shall come after us for
many Generations.</p>
            <p>The neere and neighbouring example of the Church
and Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is in this case worthy of
our best observation: When the Prelates there, were
grown by their rents, and Lordly Dignities, by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
power over all sorts of his Majesties subjects,
Ministers and others, by their places in Parliament,
Councel, Colledge of Justice, Exchequer, and High
Commission, to a monstrous dominion and greatnesse,
and like Gyants, setting their one foot on the neck of
the Church, and the other on the neck of the State,
were become intolerable insolent; and when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God through their oppression in Religion, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Lawes, and what was dearest unto them, were
brought so low, that they chused rather to die, then to
live in such slavery, or to live in any other place, rather
<pb facs="tcp:97236:11"/>
then in their own native Countrey; Then did the Lord
say, <hi>I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people, and
I have heard their groaning, and am come downe to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them.</hi> The beginnings were small, and contemptible
in the eyes of the presumptuous enemies, such as use to
be the beginnings of the greatest works of God; but
were so seconded and continually followed by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
evidences of Divine Providence, leading them
forward from one step to another, that their Mountain
became strong in the end. No tongue can tell what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
filled the hearts, what teares were poured forth
from the eyes, and what cryes came from the mouthes
of many thousands in that Land, when they found an
unwonted flame warming their breastes, and perceived
the power of God raising them from the dead, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for them a new world wherein should dwell Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Righteousnes. When they were destitute both
of moneys and munition, which next unto the spirits
and armes of men, are the sinews of Warre, the Lord
brought them forth out of his hid treasures; which was
wonderfull in their eyes, and matter of astonishment
to their hearts: When they were many times at a pause

his joynts to loose, and all his Cardinals and Prelates

            <p>When the Reformed Churches, which by their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have been exciting us to Christian Communion and
Sympathie in this time of the danger of Religion and
distresse of the Godly, shall heare of this blessed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
for uniformity in Religion according to the
word of God and the defence thereof; it shall quicken
their hearts against the heavinesse of oppressing sorrows
and feare; and be no other than a beginning of a Jubilee
and joyfull deliverance unto them, from the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
yoke and tyrannie.</p>
            <p>Upon these and the like considerations wee are verie
confident, that the Church and Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi>
will most chearfully joyne in this Covenant, at the
first motion whereof, their bowels were moved within
them? And to give testimony of this our confidence,
we who are Commissioners from the Generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
although we have no particular and expresse Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
for that end, not from want of willingnesse, but
of foresight) offer to joyn our hearts and hands unto
it, being assured that the Lord in his own time wil against
all opposition even against the gates of Hell, crown it
with a blessing from Heaven. The word of God is
for it, as you have been now resolved by the consent and
testimonie of a Reverend Assembly of so many godly,
learned, and great Divines. In your own sense and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
you will find, that although while you are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted

other times, when upon seeking of God in private or
publike, as in the evening of a wel spent Sabbath; or day
of Fast and Humiliation your disposition is more spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
and leaving the world behind you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you have found

with this work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is a good testimony that our designes
and wayes are agreeable to the will of God, if we affect
them most when our hearts are furthest from the world
and our temper is most spirituall and heavenly, and least
carnall and earthly. As the Word of God, so the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the people of God in all the Reformed Churches
are for us, and on our side: It were more terrible then an
Army to hear that there were any fervent supplications
to God against us; blasphemies, curses, and horrid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations
there be, proceeding from another spirit,
and that is all. That Divine Providence also which hath
maintained this Cause, and supported his Servants in a
marvellous manner unto this day, and which this time
past hath kept things in an equall ballance and vicissitud
of successe, will we trust from this day-forth, through
the weight of this Covenant, cast the ballance and make
Religion and Righteousnesse to prevail, to the glory of
God, the honour of our King, the confusion of our
common enemies, and the comfort and safety of the
people of God: Which he grant, who is able to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
any thing that we can ask or think.</p>
