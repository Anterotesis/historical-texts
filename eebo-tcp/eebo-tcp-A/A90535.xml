         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> came from Bazing upon ſome

            <p>That Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> came into the houſe of Bazing, ſome time
after the ſtorm: on Tueſday the 14 of October 1465. and
tooke a view, firſt of the workes which were many, though
not finiſhed, and of too great a compaſſe, for ſo few men
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113254:3"/>
to keepe. Sir <hi>Robert Peake</hi> the Governour ſwearing to him
that they had but 300 fighting men in all, the circomwalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being aboue a mile and a halfe-about, there were in
both houſes 16 cornyards great and ſmall; the ould houſe
had ſtood as it is reported 2. or 300 yeares, a neſt of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
the new houſe ſurpaſſing that in beauty and ſtatelineſſe:
and either of them ſit to make an Emperours court.</p>
            <p>The roomes before the ſtorme (it ſeemes) in both houſes
were all compleatly furniſhed; proviſions for ſome yeares
rather then moneths, 400 quarters of wheat: Bacons divers
Roomes full, hundreds of flitches of bacon, Cheeſe pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>portionall,
with Oatmeale, Beefe, Porke, Beare divers ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
full, and that very good.</p>
            <p>A bead in one roome furniſhed that coſt 1300l. Popiſh
bookes many, with Copies and ſuch utenſils that in truth,
the houſe ſtood in its full pride, and the enemy was p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

that it would be the laſt peece of ground that would be
taken by the Parliament, becauſe they had ſo often failed
our forces, that had formerly appeared before it. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
roomes, and about the houſe, there were ſlaine, in
view 74. and only one woman, the daghter of Docter <hi>Grif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fith,</hi>
who came forth railing againſt our ſouldiers for their
ruffe carriges towards her father, who indeed did remember
to him his former malignancy, there lay upon the ground
flaine by the hands of Major <hi>Harriſon</hi> (that godly, and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Gentleman) Major <hi>Guffle</hi> a man of great account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, and a notorious Papiſt, and Robinſon the
player, who a little before the ſtorme, was knowne to be
mocking, and ſcorning the Parliament, and our Army, 8. or
9. Gentlewomen of ranke running forth together were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by the common ſouldiers ſomwhat courſly, yet
not uncivilly, they left them with ſome clothes upon them,
their plunder continued till Tueſday night in this manner,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:113254:3"/>
1 For the goods, the ſouldiers ſeaſed upon the firſt goods
of which there were ſeverall ſorts; one ſouldier had ſixſcore
peeces in gould for his ſhare, others plate, others Iewels, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt one got 3. baggs of ſilver; who (being not
able to keepe his own councell) it grew to be common pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
amongſt the reſt, the fellow himſelfe had but one halfe
Crowne left for himſelfe at laſt.</p>
            <p>There were ſome Cabinets of Iewels, and other rich trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
next to that, the ſouldiers ſould the wheat to the
Countrey people, and the p<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ey held a while to the Country
People, but afterwards the market fell, and there was ſome
abatements for haſt.</p>
            <p>After that they ſould the houſhold ſtuffe, whereof there
was good ſtore, and they loaded away many Carts; and
continued a great while fetching out all manner of houſhold
ſtuffe till they had fetched out all the ſtooles, Chaires, and
other lumber, all which they ſould to the Country people,
by peecemeal which was admirable: that in all theſe great
houſes there was not one Iron bar left in all the windowes,
ſave only what was in the fire before night.</p>
            <p>And the laſt work of all was the lead, and by Thurſday
morning, they had hardly left one gutter about all the houſe.</p>
            <p>2. For the fire, what the ſouldiers left the fire tooke hold
on, joy was more then ordinary, leaving nothing but bare
walles and Chimnies in leſſe then 20 houres, and occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the neglect of the enemie in quenching a fire ball of
ours.</p>
            <p>We know not how to give a juſt account of all that
was within, for we have not 200 Priſoners, and it may
be 100. ſlaine, whoſe bodies ſome being covered with
rubbiſh, came not to our view, only riding to the houſe on
Tueſday night, we heard divers crying in valts for quarter,
but our men could neither come to them, nor they to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:113254:4"/>
But amongſt thoſe that we ſaw ſlaine one of their officers
lying on the ground ſeeming ſo exceeding tall was meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
and from his great toe to his head cronw was 9. foot in
length meaſured by a Gentleman of an ordinary ſize, who
was then preſent, There was in all (in the houſe) about 500.
beſides ſome that before got out of the houſe.</p>
            <p>And it is reported there are ſome vaults that are farr un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ground for their popiſh prieſts, of which cattle there
were divers, but none came to our hands, how many of them
we killed we know not.</p>
            <p>3. Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> ſpent ſome time in conference with the
Ma<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ques of Wincheſter, and Sir <hi>Robert Peake</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
one of Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> neighbours when he lived in the
pariſh of Sepulchers.</p>
            <p>The Marques being preſſed by him, by way of argument,
broke out and ſaid that, <hi>if the King had no more ground in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
but Bazing houſe; he would adventure as he did; and ſo
maintaine it to his uttermoſt;</hi> (meaning with thoſe papiſts)
and the Marques ſaid himſelfe <hi>that Bazing houſe was called
Loyalty.</hi> But he was ſoone ſilenced in the queſtion betweene
the King, and Parliament, only hoping that <hi>the King might</hi>
have a day againe.</p>
            <p>4. We ſee who are his Majeſties <hi>deer friends, and truſty,
and well beloved coſens, and Councellers;</hi> the Marques being
the popes devoted vaſſall.</p>
            <p>5. And thus the Lord was pleaſed in a few houres to
ſhew us, what mortall ſeede all earthly glory growes upon,
and how juſt and righteous the waies of God are, who takes
ſinners in their own ſnares; and lifteth up the heads of his
deſpiſed people.</p>
            <p>1. This is now the 20 Gariſon, that hath been taken in, by
this Army this ſummer; and I believe moſt of them the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
of the prayers, and the trophies of the faith of ſome of
Gods ſervants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:113254:4"/>
2. The Commander of this Brigade, having ſpent much
time with godly prayer, the night before the ſtorm, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
fights without ſome Texts of Scripture to ſupport
him; And this time he reſted upon that bleſſed Word
of God written in the 115. Pſalm, and the 8. verſe. <hi>They that
make them are like unto them, ſo is every one that truſteth in
them.</hi> Which with ſome Verſes going before was now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed.</p>
            <p>3. Whereas the Houſe had ordered, that the Country
people ſhould carry away thoſe buildings, God Almighty
had decreed that before hand, nothing remaining but a blaſt
of Winde, to blow down the tottering Wals and chimnies.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſſe this providence of God hath a double voice, the one
unto the Enemy, the other unto us, the Lord h<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

a penny, and I hope they will have full meaſure, and running o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
I wiſh that the payment and recruiting of this Army, may
not be ſlighted. It is an eaſie matter to grieve God in our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lests

            <p>Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> preſented the Marqueſſes own Cullers, which
