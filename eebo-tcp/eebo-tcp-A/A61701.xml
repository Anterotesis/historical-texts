            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THough I have alwaies known, and look'd upon you, as a moſt zealous man in the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> perſuaſion, yet I ſhould never have imagin'd, that your zeal would have tranſported you ſo far, as to induce you, to pronounce an Anathema againſt all thoſe of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> who now ſerve the <hi>moſt Chriſtian King</hi> in the War, wherein he is engag'd againſt the <hi>Dutch.</hi> Mean time, you know, that you have run into this ſtrange Extremity, in the Letter you were pleas'd to write from <hi>Borne,</hi> of the 15<hi>th.</hi> of the laſt Moneth, which yet came not to my hands till within theſe two daies. You, at the firſt daſh, tell me, it is a matter you cannot be ſufficiently aſtoniſhed at, That any Officer, who makes Profeſſion of <hi>our</hi> Religion, whether he be <hi>Swiſſe,</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> or of what other Countrey ſoever, ſhould preſume to fight againſt our <hi>dear Brethren in Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and make it their Buſineſs to deſtroy that <hi>Sanctifi'd Republick, which has alwaies been the Refuge and Sanctuary of thoſe of the Reformed Religion, and to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101606:4"/>
which all Proteſtants are in the higheſt manner oblig'd.</hi> You, afterwards, make it your moſt earneſt entreaty to us, That, out of the tenderneſs we ought to have of our Salvation, we ſhould <hi>quit our Employments, and enter our Selves into the Service of the</hi> Dutch, <hi>ſo to expiate the Sin we have committed in ſerving againſt them.</hi> You ſolemnly declare to us, in Fine, That, if we do not, upon ſight, follow this advice of yours, we are a ſort of damn'd Wretches, never to be retriev'd out of the deplorabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>I ſhould not have been much ſtartled, if I had receiv'd ſuch a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the Miniſter of ſome Country Village, or from ſome perſon whoſe abilities rais'd him not above the ordinary Rate of men. But I muſt acknowledge my ſelf ſurpriz'd, as much as man can be ſo, to ſee that you, <hi>Reverend Sir,</hi> who are a <hi>Profeſſor of Divinity,</hi> and have the reputation of being one of the moſt experienſed men of <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> eſpecially upon the ſcore of <hi>Politicks,</hi> ſhould write me a Letter fraught with things very ſtrange and extravagant, and Maxim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with ſound Sence, and Reaſon, and contrary even to the end you have propos'd to your ſelf, which is, doubtleſs, the preſervation and propagation of our <hi>Reform'd Religion,</hi> and of the Churches which profeſs it. I undertake to make a clear juſtification of the truth of the things which I advance, and to let you ſee the Miſtake you lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and with what injuſtice you have ſo ſlightly pronounc'd the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Condemnation, againſt all thoſe of the <hi>Reform'd Religion,</hi> who ſerve the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King,</hi> in the War which he is now concern'd in againſt the, <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To that end, it is my deſign, to ſhew you, ſomewhat at large, of what nature the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Dutch</hi> is, and what <hi>ſanctity</hi> is to be attributed to their <hi>Republick</hi>; and thence it will appear, how highly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101606:4"/>
the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are concern'd to wiſh the preſervation of it. And when that is done, I ſhall afterwards prove, That though the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were the moſt <hi>reform'd</hi> of all People, in their <hi>Religion,</hi> as well as in their <hi>morality</hi>; yet you would not have any reaſon, to condemn either thoſe private Perſons of their Perſuaſion, who ſerve againſt them; or yet thoſe of your <hi>Cantons,</hi> who have ſupply'd the moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> King with Forces, upon this occaſion.</p>
            <p>I muſt acknowledge, That if we conſider the <hi>Dutch</hi> Confeſſion of Faith, and the Cathechiſm they uſe; it cannot be denyed, but that they profeſs the ſame Religion, with that which is received at <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> and in your <hi>Proteſtant-Cantons.</hi> But in the mean time, this is to be noted, That though they make an external Profeſſion of the ſame Religion with yours, yet their Conduct and Deportment do evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrate, that they make not any account of it, or that they believe it not at all. To that end, it is requiſite, that I make a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er enquiry into things, and go to the very ſource, and give you a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, by what Degrees, and by what Means, this Religion was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the State, and the different Conduct which the <hi>States-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> have obſerv'd, in reference thereto.</p>
            <p>I am of opinion, in the firſt place, That there is not any neceſſity of my telling you, that <hi>Religion</hi> was neither the cauſe, nor the pretence, of the diſturbances, revolutions, and ſeditions of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi>; and that it was not upon that ſcore, that the People of ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, after they had carried on the War againſt their Prince, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, reſolv'd at laſt to degrade him, and to ſhake off the yoke of his Dominion over them.</p>
            <p>The great Lords of the Country, as the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Count of <hi>Egmont,</hi> and Count <hi>Horne,</hi> were extreamly exaſperated, to ſee, that Cardinal <hi>de Granvelle,</hi> a Forreigner, and a perſon of very obſcure Parentage, had the management of all things, and was the ſupreme Arbitrator of all Affairs; and to think, that they themſelves had not any authority in the Government. They maintained in the mean time, That the ſaid authority belong'd to them, of Right, upon the ſcore of their merit, that of their birth, that of the great Eſtates they were poſſeſs'd of, and that of the Services they had done the State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:101606:5"/>The Eccleſiaſtical party were moſt highly disguſted, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, That their Abbeys, their Priories and their Benefices were to be aboliſhed, for the Raiſing of a Revenue for the new Biſhopricks, which had been erected; as alſo for that they had ſet over them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Perſons, who devour'd their annual profits, and who cenſur'd their Conduct, and their Manners. To which they added another grievance, That, according to the deciſions of the moſt learned Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers of the Country, it was an impi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty, to convert the Goods of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Perſons to any other Uſe, than that whereto they had been deſign'd, by the Wills of thoſe, who had made the donations of them.</p>
            <p>The Magiſtrates of Cities and Corporations made their Complaint, That they had deny'd audience to the States, who had deſir'd a free Aſſembly, that there might be a common conſultation, about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, moſt likely to promote the remedying of their grievances; and that there had been new and inſupportable impoſitions laid upon them, not only without the Conſent of the Eſtates, but alſo in ſpight of their oppoſition.</p>
            <p>The ordinary People loudly declar'd, That the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would have aboliſh'd the ancient form of their Government, to the ſubverſion of their Lawes and Cuſtomes, that he might thereby intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Tyrannical dominion, like that which he made Uſe of, for the Government of ſome Kingdomes of <hi>Spain,</hi> that of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the <hi>Indies.</hi> In a word, the <hi>Grandees,</hi> the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> the <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> and the common ſort of <hi>People,</hi> had all a particular occaſion of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; but they had alſo one which was common to them all. Above all things they had an extream horror for the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> which had been eſtabliſh'd amongſt them; out of a Fear, that under pretence of <hi>Religion,</hi> ſome deſign might be carried on, againſt the Liberties and Eſtates of all. It was for the ſame reaſon, that the Inhabitants of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> amongſt them, though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe two Countries ever had any deſign, to deſert the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Worſhip of the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Religion.</p>
            <p>Moſt part of the Inhabitants of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> were, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ſtrongly inclin'd to the profeſſion of the ancient Religion; and yet they could not endure, that any man ſhould be put to death,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101606:5"/>
upon the ſcore of any Religion whatſoever.

Howe're it were, whether out of pity to others, or by way of precaution for themſelves, thoſe People, who were extremely jealous of their liberty, and for the conſervation of their Lawes and Cuſtomes, which, at beſt, are but Temporal things, contributory to the conveniences of the preſent life, could yet much leſs endure to be depriv'd of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, which rela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the year 1566. The greateſt Lords of the Country, and ſeveral Gentlemen, conſiderable upon the ſcore of their extraction, of whom moſt were <hi>Catholicks,</hi> entred into an Alliance, for the preſervation of their municipal Laws, and for the abrogation of the ſanguinary E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts which had been made for the Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Inquiſition.</hi> In purſuance of this firſt Treaty of union, was it, that they preſented to <hi>Margaret,</hi> then Governeſs of the <hi>Law-Countries,</hi> that famous Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, which occaſion'd the firſt inſurrections, and which procur'd them the denomination of <hi>Beggars,</hi> which was then given them, and which they could not get off for a long time: After the Treaty of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> all the <hi>Catholick</hi> Provinces, ſave only that of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into an Alliance with thoſe which were already confederated, for the ſecurity of their Lawes, their Privileges, and their Liberty. The Alliance of Union, and Armes, which they had contracted, againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> was immediately publiſh'd in <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and confirm'd by the ſolemn Oaths of the Clergy, the Nobility, the Gentry, the People, and of the Senate it ſelf.</p>
            <p>In the year 1578. The Eſtates, as well of the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Perſuaſion, being aſſembled at the <hi>Hague,</hi> did unanimouſly declare, That King <hi>Philip</hi> was deveſted of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality of the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1579. The Eſtates being aſſembled at <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> made a new Union, from which they took the name of the <hi>Vnited Provinces.</hi> And in the 13<hi>th</hi> Article of that Treaty, it is expreſly order'd, That every man ſhall be allow'd the liberty of Religion, without any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of perſecution to any one, upon that occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:101606:6"/>All theſe Treaties of Alliance, which the Provinces, as well <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi> as <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> had made together, for their mutual defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> make it evidently appear, That the deſign of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing a new Religion was neither the ground nor motive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Prince <hi>William</hi> himſelf, in his <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Apologies,</hi> did alwaies openly proteſt, as did alſo the States in theirs, That they had not taken up armes for Religion, and that the Provinces had not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, in order to the profeſſion of any one particular Religion. So far was it from this, that it is certain, all the Treaties, as that of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and the Union of <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> all the Declarations of the Arch-Duke <hi>Matthias,</hi> and of the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> do loudly eſtabliſh the free Exerciſe of all Religions, and in expreſs terms, forbid the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing and Perſecuting of any man upon that occaſion.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, though they had not, at the beginning, any reflection by way of conſcientious motive, for the having of any one publick Religion, yet could they not forbear eſtabliſhing it afterwards, out of a pure intereſt of State.

many Creatures, whom he made ſure to his Party, by an inviolable Bond; and as many irreconcileable Enemies to <hi>Philip,</hi> who was the cruel Perſecutor of all thoſe upſtart Profeſſors of Religion.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Prince <hi>William,</hi> who had all this while con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceal'd his Sentiments for Religion, took a very convenient op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to lay by the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> perſuaſion, which he had till then profeſs'd, and to embrace that of the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> He was in <hi>Germany,</hi> at his Brothers, the Count of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> and had been forc'd by the Intreaties of many of his Relations, and ſome Friends, baniſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rated Provinces would rather have enclin'd him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſume the yoke of their ancient domination. It was his Fear, and with reaſon, That when the diſpute ſhould be only about the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, the Lawes, and the Cuſtoms, and in a word, things of a temporal Concern, King <hi>Philip</hi> coming to ſatisfie his Subjects, or the Subjects to recede from their Rights for the obtaining of a Peace, it would be no hard matter to ſee thoſe people reconcil'd to their Prince. Whereas, on the other ſide, having diſpos'd the confederated Provinces, to embrace a new Religion, he thereby put an inſurmountable obſtruction to their reunion with <hi>Philip.</hi> He knew that That Prince, who with an implacable fury perſecuted all thoſe who had renounc'd the ancient Religion, would reſolve rather to loſe the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> than to grant his Subjects the free Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of a new Religion. There had been a Report ſpread about, that preſently upon his Return into <hi>Spain,</hi> after he had order'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of ſome men eminent for their Learn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101606:7"/>
ſo cruel an execution; and was a ſpectator of it, as if it had been a delightful Show.</p>
            <p>Many perſons therefore, amongſt the Inhabitants of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> having embrac'd the new Religions, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> engag'd them by the Bond of Conſcience, and by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair or Pardon, to maintain the Change he had made, that ſo they might not relapſe under the power of their ancient Maſter. Happy was it, for the proſecution of his deſign, that he had made this advantage of that Liberty of Conſcience, which he had given to all ſorts of perſons; but perceiving withal, that that unbounded Liberty, without the eſtabliſhment, and preference, of ſome one Religion, occaſion'd a great confuſion in the Government, he thought it neceſſary to make choice of one, which ſhould be the pub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ick, and predominant Religion, and the Religion of State. Yet had he not as yet abſolutely pitch'd upon what he intended, nor determin'd which Religion he ought to embrace; whether that of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that of the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> or that of the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi>; all thoſe three Religions not making any acknowledgment of the Popes Authority, or the juriſdiction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. But he had afterwards ſome reaſons, which oblig'd him to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine upon the choice of one, as well for his own private Concern, as for that of the State. The Sect of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> was the leaſt conſiderable upon all accounts, and was not much to be fear'd, as well by reaſon of the diviſions wherewith it was ſhaken, as by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its Sectators, who, for the moſt part, were perſons of a very obſcure condition, and of their Sentiments, by which they are not admitted to Magiſtracy, or the Uſe of Arms. For which reaſon, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> could not make any Uſe of them, as being not proper for his Deſign. He aſpir'd to the principal charge of the State; and that Religion permitted not its Diſciples to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe any kind of Magiſtracy. He needed the aſſiſtance of Arms, to maintain and make good the Change he had made in the State, and the new form of Government which he had eſtabliſh'd; and the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> would not have Arms uſed upon any occaſion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lutheran</hi> Religion was very conſiderable, by reaſon of the affection and Support of ſeveral Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> who had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd it, and highly protected thoſe who made profeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Prince <hi>William</hi> had more inclination for that Religion, in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101606:7"/>
which he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> been inſtructed from his Infancy, and he might very well hope for aſſiſtance and protection from the Electoral Houſe of <hi>Saxony,</hi> of which he had Married a Daughter, to his Second Wife. But on the other ſide, he hoped for more conſiderable aſſiſtances from the Princes who made profeſſion of our <hi>Reformed</hi> way of Religion. That which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had Eſtabliſh'd in <hi>England,</hi> was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conformable to ours, as to the Doctrine, and differ'd from it, only as to the Form of Government, and the Uſe of Ceremonies. The <hi>Elector-Palatine,</hi> who was then the moſt powerful Prince of the Empire, did abſolutely profeſs the ſame Religion. The King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> and the Admiral <hi>Caſtillon,</hi> and a conſiderable number of the Lords and Gentlemen, and a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous people of <hi>France,</hi> made a publick profeſſion of it. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> therefore, hoping to engage all thoſe Princes, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of one and the ſame Religion, to give him powerful aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for the corroboration of the new Republick, thought fit to make choice of that Religion for himſelf, and the State. Beſides, as that Religion was more contrary to that of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, than the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> ſo he thought it more fit for the Common-wealth, which he had founded, out of an averſion to the Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Domination of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Inhabitants of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> having a ſtrong averſion for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to perſuade them, That there was no likelihood, that a people ſo corrupted, ſhould have received directions from God, to ſerve him purely, by the Worſhip of the true Religion. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards endeavour'd to inſinuate to them, That our <hi>Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> which was more different from theirs, was, doubtleſs the beſt, and moſt acceptable to God.</p>
            <p>There comes into my mind, upon this occaſion, what I have Read in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Indies,</hi> That they could not by any means diſpoſe a great number of perſons of that Country, to be converted to the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made a profeſſion of it. For, as thoſe poor people had ſeen them commit ſuch Cruelties, as they had never ſeen any example of before, ſo they had a horror for their Religion, upon a ſuppoſition that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd them with ſuch barbarous Sentiments. They could not be mov'd with the hope of Celeſtial Felicity, after they had been told, that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> together with all good Chriſtians, would have their abode in that happy place. They ſaw no charms in the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101606:8"/>
of Paradice, ſince they were to be partakers of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hem with a Nation ſo barbarous; and they could not believe, that the Felicity, which they put them in hopes of, could ſecure them from the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of ſo inhumane a people. In a word, they could not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to embrace a Religion, which was to conduct them, after their death, to live eternally in the company of a people, which, according to their Sentiment, was the moſt wicked of any upon Earth.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> having exercis'd, in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> as ſtrange Cruelties, as thoſe of his Country had done in the <hi>Indies,</hi> the Inhabitants of <hi>Flanders</hi> and no leſs an averſion for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> then the <hi>Indians.</hi> And as all the rigorous puniſhments, which had been inflicted upon the people of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> were imputed to the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Religion; ſo the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> did cunningly make uſe of that prejudgment, to induce them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a Religion, contrary to that of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which had made them endure ſo many Calamities.</p>
            <p>It was in the Year 1572. that that Religion, which was receiv'd in your <hi>Proteſtant-Cantons,</hi> at <hi>Geneva,</hi> in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> and in the Churches of <hi>France,</hi> was eſtabliſhed in the Confederated Provinces, for the only publick Religion. And yet they put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in it, which you will think very conſiderable, if you conſult the Sentiments of your firſt Reformers, thoſe of the Doctors who were their Succeſſors, and the conſtant practice of your <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant-Cantons,</hi> and of all the Eſtates of the Reform'd Religion. For you know, that in all the Countries, where thoſe of our Religion are the Maſters, they do not ſuffer the exerciſe of any other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor allow, in all their Territories, a place of habitation, to thoſe who profeſs a different one; whereas the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> did not only permit the exerciſe of all ſorts of Religions, but did alſo reject as Tyrannical, all the Laws, whereby there was any preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made for Uniformity of Sentiments, upon that occaſion, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to them the name of <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> ſo odious amongſt them.</p>
            <p>And this Liberty of Conſcience, was, as I have already obſerv'd, Eſtabliſh'd, not only by the Writings of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> by the Peace of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> by the publick and particular agreement, which was made for Religion, under the Regency of the Arch-Duke <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi>;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101606:8"/>
by the Union of <hi>Vtretcht</hi>; and by ſeveral Treaties which have been made with the Cities of the Country. If I miſtake not, methinks it may be affirmed, that the Confederated Provinces were of our <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> in particular, while the, Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was Eſtabliſh'd for all ſorts of Perſons, and the exerciſe of all Religions was publickly permitted; and it was ſo till the Year 1583. All the Regulations which the <hi>States-General</hi> have made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards for Religion, and the Conduct they have been guided by, in reference to that, are ſo far from proving them to be of our Religion, that they make it evidently appear, that they never were, nor are not at all of it. And this, Sir, is what I deſign to juſtifie to you in the firſt Letter, which I ſhall write to you upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.

            </opener>
            <p>IF you have ſeriouſly reflected on what I have written in my firſt Letter, I conceive you will readily make this acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> were not of the <hi>Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> as long as there was not any ſuch Eſtabliſh'd by any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Decree; and that all the <hi>Sectaries</hi> had as much liberty there, as thoſe of the <hi>Reformed Perſuaſion.</hi> I know well enough, that that Liberty of Conſcience, which had been Eſtabliſh'd by so many Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and by ſo many publick Acts, was abſolutely forbidden, by the Regulation which the <hi>States-General</hi> made in the Year 1583. Take here, in expreſs terms, what it contains.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Since there has been a permiſſion granted, by the Vnion of</hi> Utrecht, <hi>to amplifie, to abridge, and change, ſome Articles, when ever the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and ſecurity of the</hi> Provinces <hi>ſhould ſeem to require it, the</hi> States, <hi>attentively conſidering the</hi> XIII. <hi>Article, have unanimouſly ordain'd, and appointed, That the exerciſe of any Religion ſhall not be henceforward receiv'd, other then that which is publickly taught in the</hi> United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, <hi>which is the</hi> Reformed Religion. <hi>With this proviſo however, That if any Provinces, Members, or Cities of the</hi> Popiſh <hi>Religion ſhall be willing to enter into this Alliance, they ſhall be continu'd in the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of their Religion, conditionally, that they ſign and ſubſcribe the other Articles of this Alliance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To render this Ordinance of no effect, I might tell you, what was alledg'd, as ſoon as ever it was paſt, by the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and all thoſe who were not of our <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi> Their complaint was, That it had been made, contrary to all manner of Juſtice and Reaſon, contrary to the Stipulated Faith of all the Treaties, which the Inhabitants of the ſame Provinces had made, and of thoſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101606:9"/>
which the Provinces had made mutually one with an other. They maintain'd, That, having united themſelves together, for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Laws and Privileges of the Country, it was a great injuſtice, to make an Eſtabliſhment of one ſingle Religion, to be the publick Religion, and to deprive the others of the exerciſe of theirs, and not to allow them any part in the Government of the State.</p>
            <p>But, above all others, the <hi>Catholicks</hi> thought it very ſtrange, that they, having taken up Arms againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> only for the defence of their Liberty, ſhould not be allow'd the free exerciſe of their ancient Religion, as if they had ſpent all their labour, only to deprive themſelves thereof, and to acquire Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for others, and to make the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, and to raiſe that only into the Throne. Nor did the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the other Religions, think they had leſs cauſe, then the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> to be diſſatisfy'd and diſguſted, at that Ordinance, which took away the exerciſe and abſolute freedom of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They urged, That from the time of their firſt intertexture of the intereſt of Religion, with that of the State, in the conteſt which they had with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> Liberty of Conſcience had been Eſtabliſh'd by ſo many publick Decrees, that they could not be violated, without extremity of injuſtice.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> without concerning himſelf much at the complaints of the one or the other of the aggrieved Parties, did, for his own private intereſt, and for that of the Republick, proſecute his deſign of making an Eſtabliſhment of our <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> to be the only <hi>Publick Religion,</hi> of which all thoſe, who ſhould pretend to any concern in the Adminiſtration of the Government, were oblig'd to make their profeſſion. He had a jealouſie of the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> upon the ſcore of his being afraid, that they might employ their credit, to diſpoſe the people to reſettle themſelves under the domination of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Nor had he any greater liking to the adherents of the other Religions, by reaſon of their being odious to all the reſt of the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> As therefore thoſe who profeſs'd our <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> were the beſt-affected to him, ſo he thought it convenient, to entruſt them with all the Authority, for the management of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:101606:10"/>Now, Reverend Sir, be your ſelf pleas'd to judg, whether theſe Provinces deſerve to be called of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> for this reaſon, that, out of pure intereſt of State, and without any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, they have made an Ordinance for the Eſtabliſhment of one ſingle Religion, excluſively to all the reſt?</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing I ſhould grant, that whatever is alledg'd by the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> againſt that Ordinance, is groundleſs, and irrational, and that they had the juſteſt Reaſons in the World to make it; yet I maintain, that the bare making of it is not a ſufficient inducement, for any one to affirm, that this State is of the <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi> I cannot forbear acknowledging, that this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance does ſo expreſsly comprehend the ſentiment of all our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, that if the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> had been as careful in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, as the <hi>Elector-Palatine,</hi> your <hi>Protéſtant-Cantons,</hi> and the City of <hi>Geneva</hi> are, it could not be deny'd, but that their State really and truly is of our <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi> But I think, Sir, that you do know, and if you do not know it, I ſhall make it ſo clearly appear to you, that you ſhall not in the leaſt doubt of it, That this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance has been ſo far from being put into execution, that they have always practic'd, and ſtill do practice, what is directly contrary to the Contents thereof.</p>
            <p>By this Ordinance, there is an expreſs prohibition of allowing any other Religion then the <hi>Reformed,</hi> in the <hi>Provinces</hi>; and yet we there find the publick exerciſe of many other Religions, beſides the <hi>Reformed,</hi> not to ſay of all thoſe who were deſirous to have it. And that you may not doubt of it, I ſhall here give you a ſhort Catalogue of the Religions in that Country, which have an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable liberty of celebrating their Myſteries, and ſerving God, as they themſelves think fit.</p>
            <p>Be pleas'd then to know, that beſides thoſe of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, there are <hi>Roman-Catholicks, Lutherans, Browniſts, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, Arminians, Anabaptiſts, Socinians, Arrians, Enthuſiaſts, Quakers, Borreliſts, Armenians, Muſcovites, Libertines,</hi> and others. And there are in fine ſome whom we may call <hi>Seekers,</hi> becauſe they are ſtill ſeeking out for a Religion, and do not profeſs any of thoſe which are already Eſtabliſh'd. I give you no account of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the <hi>Perſians,</hi> in regard that, as they are not Sects o
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101606:10"/>
               <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſo what I might ſay of them would ſignifie nothing to the ſubject I have in hand. And ſince I am well ſatisfy'd, that there are not any <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> but what are in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſome other Sea-Port-Towns, there is no conſequence deduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thence, for the Reſidence of any ſuch in the other Cities of that Country. Nor ſhall I ſay any thing of the <hi>Armenians</hi> and <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> who are all of the <hi>Greek</hi> Religion. And as I conceive, that there are only ſome Merchants of the one, and of the other of thoſe Nations, and that none of the Natives of the Country do profeſs their Religion; ſo I do not think there is any perſon, that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the liberty which is given them, to ſerve God, according to the Ceremonies and Precepts of their Religion. And whereas, of all the other Religions, and Sects, we find a great number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, born in that Country, who make an open and publick profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, I conceive you will not take it amiſs, that I ſhould here in few words, give you an account of the Opinions, of all the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, which are in this Country.</p>
            <p>As to the Doctors and Profeſſors of our Religion, I queſtion not but you know, that they alſo differ amongſt themſelves, in many things. <hi>Voëtius,</hi> and <hi>des Marets</hi> have, by their diſputes, diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſhumour'd all the Province of <hi>Holland,</hi> where they have been ſo violent, one againſt the other, that if men would believe either the one, or the other, they muſt, upon pain of Damnation, ſtick to the ſentiment of the one, and reject that of his Adverſary. <hi>Voëtius</hi> did, and ſtill does maintain, That it is Sacriledge, to leave the Eccleſiaſtical Revenues at the diſpoſal of Slothful Paunches, which are not any way ſerviceable to Church or State; That thoſe who are known by the name of <hi>Lombards,</hi> are not to be called, or admitted to the Lord's Supper, inaſmuch as, lending out Money at Intereſt, they exerciſe a profeſſion forbidden by the word of God; That the Sabbath-Day is to be very carefully and Religiouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd; That we ought not to Celebrate any Feſtival-Day, no not <hi>Eaſter, Whitſuntide,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>; That when we ſpeak of the Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, or Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> we are not to give any one the name of <hi>Saint,</hi> and that we are not to ſay, Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Saint <hi>John,</hi> Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> but to ſay down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, <hi>Peter, Paul, John,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi>; and that all the Faithful ought to follow a ſevere kind of life, to retrench themſelves from the greateſt part even of the moſt innocent enjoyments of life,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101606:11"/>
that they may the better work out their Salvation with Fear and Trembling.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, <hi>des Marets</hi> is oppoſite to <hi>Voetius,</hi> almoſt in all theſe things, and hath argu'd againſt his Sentiments, with ſo much Animoſity, as if their Diſpute had been about thoſe points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which are moſt important, and moſt neceſſary to Salvation. And I think they had not yet ended their Diſpute, if <hi>Cocceius</hi> had not publiſh'd ſome Opinions, which were diſpleaſing to both; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they thought fit to agree together, in order to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of them.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Cocceius</hi> was a Profeſſor of the Univerſity of <hi>Leiden,</hi> very well skill'd in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, who read the Scripture with a continual attention, and has therein diſcover'd many things, which were not before known to any one, and hath penetrated into the myſtical and profound Sence of it. In all the Prophecies of the Old and New Teſtament, he almoſt every where finds the Reign of Chriſt, and that of Anti-Chriſt, which is oppoſite thereto. He has diſpos'd the oeconomy of the Old and New Teſtament after a way not known before, and ſuch as had not yet been Eſtabliſh'd by any Doctor. He is the firſt that has diſcover'd, and taught, the difference there is, between the Government of the Church before the Law, and that under the Law, and that after the Law. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, That before the Law, the <hi>Promiſe</hi> took place; during which time of the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> the Church was free. That to the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> God had added the <hi>Law,</hi> which, having been at firſt repreſented in the Decalogue, contains only an abridgment of the Covenant of Grace, and the Commandments of Faith, Repentance, and the Gratitude we owe to God; as it appears by the ſence of the Preface, and of all the Commandements in particular. He adds, That after the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of the Golden Calf, God, to Chaſtize his people for the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which they had committed, had given them a Law, conſiſting of Ceremonial and Carnal Commandements, which were not good; having impos'd upon them a Yoke, by the Eſtabliſhment of his Ordinances and Ceremonies. Whence it comes, that the Law had been made, in appearance, a <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> promiſing life to thoſe, who ſhould obey his Commandments, and denouncing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction and death againſt thoſe, who ſhould tranſgreſs them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:101606:11"/>It is alſo another perſuaſion of his, That the Commandement concerning the obſervation of the Sabbath-Day, was one of thoſe Ceremonial and Carnal Commandements, which have been abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> During all the time before <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had paid the Father the price of our Redemption, he affirms, That all the Faithful were ſav'd, by the Security which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had given for us; That the forgiving of Sins did not take place, otherwiſe than by a connivance of Grace, in as much as They were only under the Promiſe; the payment, or ſatisfaction, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not been yet made by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That the Law being added, as an obligation, did reproach the People with their ſins, and put them into a mindfulneſs thereof by the Sacrifices; and that it is upon that ſcore that the Ancient people were under ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and in fear of death, till ſuch time as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> having, by his Blood, paid the Ranſom of our Sins, the Obligation, which was in force againſt them, being cancell'd, we have fully and perfectly obtain'd the pardon of our ſins. He is of Opinion, in fine, That there is to ſpring up in the World a Reign of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which will aboliſh the reign of <hi>Antichriſt</hi>; and that, when they who ſhall have corrupted the Earth ſhall be deſtroy'd, the Church ſhall be in a happy condition in the World; And when there ſhall be a reſtauration of the Reign of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> before the End of the World; and that after the Converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of all Nations, the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> ſhall ſcatter the rayes of its meridian light and glory, into all Parts of the World. He believes Her to be the Celeſtial <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> which is deſcrib'd in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> the Emblem whereof repreſents to us the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, ſuch as ſhe ought to be in her greateſt Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour upon Earth, and not that which is to triumph in Heaven.</p>
            <p>I thought my ſelf oblig'd to give you an account of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sentiments of this Divine, becauſe he has a great number of followers; as alſo for this Reaſon, That <hi>Voetius</hi> and <hi>des Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets</hi> condemn his Opinions as Heretical; nay indeed repreſent him as a <hi>Socinian,</hi> in many things. They affirm, That he is an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator, and give him the title of <hi>Scripturarius</hi>; as if it were a great crime, to be cloſely addicted to the Scripture, and to make it the moſt important of our Studies. There are many other Divines, eſpecially ſuch as have ſtudied under the Profeſſors, whom I have before named, who obſtinately oppoſe his Sentiments, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101606:12"/>
to perſecute, and to procure the condemnation of all his Diſciples.</p>
            <p>It is not requiſite that I ſhould give you any account of the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> it being notorious to all the World, what their Sentiments are.</p>
            <p>You know alſo, what the Opinions of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> are. The famous <hi>Confeſſion</hi> which they made at <hi>Auſbourg,</hi> in the Year 1530, has made a ſufficient diſcovery of them to all the World. True it is, that moſt of their Doctors have Opinions very different from their firſt Confeſſion. They are divided amongſt themſelves, upon the ſcore of very diſconſonant Sentiments. But as that diverſity is found only in thoſe of them who are in <hi>Germany,</hi> I ſhall ſay nothing of it. They who are in this Country, keep cloſely enough to the Sentiment of their firſt Doctor. Only obſerve here, in what they differ from thoſe who are in <hi>Germany, Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Sweden.</hi> They do not uſe Auricular Confeſſion; Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y have neither Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, nor Altars, in their Churches; Their <hi>Miniſters</hi> wear no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal habits; They have not the ſeveral Orders of <hi>Prieſts, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, Arch-Deacons,</hi> and <hi>Superintendents,</hi> or <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as they have in moſt other Parts.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Arminians</hi> took their denomination from <hi>Arminius,</hi> their firſt Doctor, who was a famous Profeſſor in the Univerſity of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi> They would rather be called <hi>Remonſtrants,</hi> by reaſon of the Book, which they preſented to the <hi>States-General,</hi> in the Year 1611. to which they had given the Title of <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> and which comprehended the principal Articles of their Belief. You know the Five remarkable Points, upon which they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> held in the Year 1618, in which were preſent ſome Divines of your <hi>Cantons,</hi> as alſo out of ſeveral Countries profeſſing the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> as <hi>England, Germany,</hi> and other plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s. After the death of <hi>Arminius,</hi> and in the time of <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> and of <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> a moſt Eminent Doctor amongſt them, they adopted many Errours of the <hi>Socinians.</hi> Nay moſt of them have deſerted the Opinion of their firſt Maſter, upon the Point of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> and Eternal <hi>Election. Arminius</hi> had taught, That God had Elected the Faithful, by the previſion of their Faith. And <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> is of Opinion, That God has not Elected
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101606:12"/>
any one from all Eternity, but that he does Elect the Faithful, in time, when they actually Believe. He ſpeaks only in very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ambiguous terms of the Preſcience of God, which was the great Fortreſs, in which <hi>Arminius</hi> ſecur'd himſelf. Theſe ſame <hi>Arminians</hi> of the preſent time believe, That the Doctrine of the Trinity of Perſons, in One only Eſſence, is not neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; That there is not any Precept in the Scripture, by which we are commanded to adore the Holy Ghoſt; nor any Example, or Indication, by which it appears, that the Holy Ghoſt has been ador'd; That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is not a God equal to the Father; That Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by which we are ſaved, hath not been commanded, nor took any place under the Old Covenant. Moſt of them do make it their ſtudy to avoid that Expreſſion of the Satisfaction of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt. Epiſcopius,</hi> in the mean time affirms, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has, by his Paſſion and Death, ſo far ſatisfy'd God, as to render him Propitious to all Mankind, and ready, henceforwards, to receive all men into his Communion; provided they, by Faith, embrace that Propitiation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; So that God being no longer diſpleas'd, there is no Enmity remaining, but what proceeds from Men, refuſing to entertain the grace of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They very earneſtly preſs the Toleration of all the Opinions of thoſe who profeſs <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion; maintaining, That all Chriſtians agree in the moſt Important, and, ſuch as they call, the moſt Eſſential and Fundamental Points of Religion; That it has not been hitherto decided, by an Infallible Judgment, who they are amongſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who have embrac'd the Trueſt and Pureſt Religion, and ſuch as is moſt conformable to the Word of God; That to the effect all may be mutually united, to make up one and the ſame Body or Church, and that they ought to love one another as Brethren, and not to have any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity or animoſity one againſt another, upon the ſcore of their diſſenting in ſome Points of Religion, eſpecially ſuch as are not of the moſt conſiderable. That men ought not to force any one to condemn, and renounce his own Sentiments, or to approve and follow thoſe of another. They ſay, That heretofore amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> and the <hi>Eſſeni,</hi> of whom the Sects were very different, and had moſt dangerous Opinions, were however tolerated by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and all receiv'd into the Temple, to preſent thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Sacrifices and Prayers to God, and to perform all the other Functions of Religion. If <hi>Arminius</hi> were to come into
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101606:13"/>
the World again, certainly, he would not own moſt of thoſe who bear his Name, to be his Diſciples. And yet there are ſome amongſt them, who have not added any thing to his Sentiments. But they all agree in this point, That all Chriſtians ought to be Tolerated; either that all-together they might make up but one and the ſame Church, or that every one may be allow'd the liberty of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Browniſts</hi> have many great Aſſemblies in the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. They are a ſort of people ſeparated from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, and from all the other <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches, which they think to be corrupted, not as to the Doctrinal Points of Faith, concurring in that reſpect, with thoſe of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Religion of <hi>Holland, Germany,</hi> and other places, but as to the Form of Government. They equally condemn <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Government, and that of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> by <hi>Conſiſtories, Claſſes,</hi> and <hi>Synods.</hi> They will not joyn with our Churches, for this reaſon, as they ſay, that they are not aſſur'd of the Converſion, and Probity of the Members, whereof they conſiſt, becauſe they therein ſuffer Sinners, with whom men ought not to communicate; and that in the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Sacraments, the good contract impurity in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the wicked. They condemn the benediction of the Marriages, which are celebrated in Churches by the Miniſters, maintaining, That, being a Political Contract, the confirmation of it depends on the Civil Magiſtrate. They would not have their Children to be baptiz'd, who are not Members of the Church, or are not as careful, as they ought to be, of the Children that have been baptiz'd. They reject all Forms of Prayers; nay they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That the Prayer, which our Lord has taught us, ought not to be recited as a Prayer, but that it was given us to be the Rule and Model, by which we ought to frame all thoſe, which we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to God. They reject the Uſe of Bells, and Churches, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as they ſay had been Conſecrated to Idolatry.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Independents</hi> are a brood of the <hi>Browniſts. John Robinſon,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, is the Father of all thoſe who are in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. They believe, That every Church, or, as they call it, every particular Congregation, has in it ſelf, radically, and eſſentially, whatever is for its conduct and government, and all Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Power and Juriſdiction. That ſuch a Church, or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101606:13"/>
is not ſubject either to one, or more Churches, or to their Deputies, or Aſſemblies, or Synods, or to any Biſhop; Or that any one Church, or Aſſembly has any power over any other Church whatſoever. That every particular Church ought to manage its own affairs, without any dependence on any other; and hence it comes, that ſuch as follow theſe S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntiments, have the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Independents.</hi> And though they do not think there is any neceſſity of aſſembling Synods, yet they affirm, That if any be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, there ought to be a conſideration of their reſolutions, as of the counſels of wiſe and prudent men, whereto a certain ſubmiſſion is due; and not as definitions, and eſtabliſhments, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring conformity and obedience. They are willing to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that one or more Churches may be aſſiſtant to another Church, as to advice, and admonition; nay that they may reprove it, if there be any offence; yet not upon the account of any ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour authority, which has any power of Excommunication, but as a Siſter-Church, declaring, That ſhe cannot have any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with ſuch a Church as hath offended, and does not demean her ſelf, according to the Rules and Commandements of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe are the Particular Sentiments of the <hi>Independents,</hi> in reference to the Government of the Church. Their very Name had render'd them very odious even to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>; but the Confeſſion of Faith, which their Brethren of <hi>England</hi> publiſh'd, when they aſſembled at <hi>London,</hi> in the Year 1651. has made it appear, That they have not otherwiſe any particular ſentiment, as to matter of Doctrine, but that in reference to that, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in all things with thoſe of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Religion. I have hitherto given you an account of but Three or Four different <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions,</hi> or rather <hi>Perſuaſions</hi>; but this Letter being come to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Length, I will adjourn what I have to ſay of the other Sects of this Countrey, to the next opportunity I ſhall have to write to you, remaining, in the mean time,</p>

            <p>I Am now, according to my promiſe, to give you an account of all the different Sects, or Religions, which are in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. They, who, in other places are called <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> are known, in theſe Provinces, by the denomination of <hi>Mennonites,</hi> and have deriv'd that Name from <hi>Menno,</hi> a Man born at a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of <hi>Friezland,</hi> in the Year 1496. Not that the ſaid <hi>Menno</hi> was the firſt Father of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in this Country; but that he, having rejected the Enthuſiaſmes and Revelations of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and their Opinions concerning the new Reign of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which they pretended to eſtabliſh upon Earth by force of Arms, has broach'd certain new doctrines, which his Followers have embrac'd, and perſiſted in to this day.</p>
            <p>Their Tenets are theſe; That the New Teſtament only, and not the Old, ought to be the Rule of our Faith.</p>
            <p>That in ſpeaking of the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> there is no neceſſity of uſing the terms of <hi>Perſons,</hi> or the <hi>Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the firſt Productions of the Creation, as to Mankind, were not created in a ſtate of Juſtice and Holineſs.</p>
            <p>That there is no ſuch thing as Original Sin.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did not take Fleſh of the ſubſtance of his Mother, <hi>Mary,</hi> but of the Eſſence of the Father; or that the Word was changed into Man, or that he brought it from Heaven, or that it is not known whence he took it.</p>
            <p>

            <p>That it is not lawful for <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to ſwear, to exerciſe any charge of Civil Magiſtracy, or to make Uſe of the Sword, not even to puniſh the wicked, or to oppoſe force with force, or to engage in a War, upon any account, or occaſion.</p>

            <p>Theſe <hi>Mennonites</hi> are divided into ſeveral Sects, upon very slight occaſions. Of theſe Sects, there are two of a conſiderable ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereof one is that of the ancient <hi>Mennonites</hi> of <hi>Flanders</hi>; The other, that of the <hi>Mennonites</hi> of <hi>Friezland.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> exerciſe Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline, with extraordinary ſeverity, and excommunicate thoſe of their Sects, for very trivial miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages. They are of a perſuaſion, That it is not lawful to eat, or drink, or to have any communication, no, not as to the Concerns of a Civil Life, with thoſe who are Excommunicated. They, by that means, make a diviſion between Husbands, and their Wives; Children, and their Parents; maintaining, That all the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Friendſhip and Society are to be cancell'd with thoſe, whom the Church has anathematiz'd.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of <hi>Friezland</hi> receive into their Communion ſuch as have been rejected by the other Sects of the <hi>Mennonites</hi>; and they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſo great a relaxation in their diſcipline, that they entertain all ſorts of polluted perſons into their ſociety; and for that reaſon are they called <hi>Borboritae,</hi> or <hi>Stereorarii.</hi> But as there are, even

amongſt them, ſome more ſcrupulous than others, ſo they alſo are parcell'd into divers S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cts, upon very ſlight, and trivial occaſions. I ſhall only give an account of one, by which a judgment may be made of the reſt. There is one Sect of them called <hi>Mamillarii,</hi> upon this ſcore, That a Young Man had taken the freedom to put his hand into a Young Maids Boſome, whom he was then court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and, within a few dayes, to marry. Some amongſt them maintain'd, That he ought to be Excommunicated; and others condemning that ſeverity, there happ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n'd a Schiſme. They, who would not have the Young Man to be Excommunicated, were called <hi>Mamillarii.</hi> There are daily diviſions, and ſeparations amongſt them; and aſſoon as they chance to be ejected out of one Society, they find a reception in ſome other.</p>
            <p>Many amongſt the <hi>Mennonites</hi> have embrac'd moſt of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> or rather thoſe of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> concerning the Divinity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They generally preſs that Toleration of all Sects, which is ſo earneſtly recommended by the <hi>Arminians.</hi> It is their perſuaſion, That they ought not to expell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of their aſſemblies, any man who leads a devout life, and acknowledges, That the Holy Scripture is the Word of God, though the ſame Man does not agree with the others, in many things which are accounted Articles of Faith.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101606:15"/>
               <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the glory of his Divinity. They are further of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that having been confirm'd in their Faith by the reading of the Word of God, and by the Books which have been written againſt them, they make it their earneſt and humble Suit to that great God, That, if they are in any error, he would diſcover it to them, that they may renounce it, and give his Truth the glory. Their converſation is holy and without reproach, as far as men can judg by what they ſee; and that converſation is abſolutely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell'd according to the Precepts of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; and it externally appears, that ſince they are not much concern'd for the things of this World, their care is the greater, to perform the works of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and Charity, and to promote the Salvation of their Souls. They wholly employ themſelves in the reading of the Word of God, in which they are ſo well vers'd, that moſt of them ſeem to have it by heart. In the Aſſemblies they make for their exerciſes of Piety, all that are preſent have the liberty of ſpeaking. One amongſt them begins to read a Chapter of the Scripture; and when he has read ſeveral Verſes of it, till he has come to a full Paragraph, he who reads, and they who hear, do reſpectively give their Sentiments, concerning the ſence of the words, which have been read to them. But what is moſt ſurprizing, is, that though the greateſt part of them be illiterate, and men of no ſtudy at all, as being Merchants, or Tradeſmen, yet they all ſeem to have a particular Talent, for the underſtanding, and expoſition of the Holy Scripture. Nay it is reported, that the Learned amongſt them, who have written Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, or Annotations, upon the Holy Scripture, have every where done very well, ſave only in thoſe places, where their own prejudgments have engag'd them to accommodate the Scripture to their own Erroneous Sence. So that it may be ſaid of them, as I think I have heard it heretofore ſaid, of <hi>Origen, Vbi benè, nemo meliùs, ubi malè, nemo pejùs; Where he had done well, no man could have done better; and where he had done ill, no man could do worſe.</hi>

            <p>Having given you this Summary account of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> my next work is to give you that of the <hi>Arrians.</hi> Thoſe laſt are very numerous in this Country, and many amongſt the <hi>Socinians</hi> have embrac'd their Opinions. You know what were the Sentiments of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> concerning the Birth of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, That the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Intellect,</hi> and the <hi>Word of God,</hi> had
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101606:16"/>
had been created before all the Creatures; That God had made Uſe of it, in the old Teſtament, as of an Interpreter of a Mediator, when he had ſomething to declare, to the <hi>Patriaerchs</hi> and <hi>Prophets.</hi> That that word, <hi>had,</hi> by a voluntary annihilation, animated the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, as the Spirit of Man animates his Body, the Word having taken Fleſh only, without Soul, and without Spirit. Nay they were alſo of a perſuaſion, That all the Souls of other men were Spirits, ſubſiſting before the Bodies, and that they aſſum'd not the name of Souls, till ſuch time as they actually animated their Bodies. <hi>Chriſtopher Sandius,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Poland,</hi> Son to a Councellor of the Elector of <hi>Brandeburgh,</hi> was the Reſtaurator of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Sect in this Country. His habitation, for ſome Years paſt, has been at <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> Among other works, he has written two Books which I have ſeen, whereof one is entituled, <hi>The Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall Interpretations of the Four Evangeliſts.</hi> The other is, <hi>An Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Hiſtory,</hi> in which he proves, or pretends to prove; <hi>That all the Doctors, commonly called the</hi> Fathers of the Church, <hi>who flouriſh'd from the time of the Apoſtles, to that of</hi> Arrius, <hi>had the ſame Sentiments as he had, concerning the Myſtery of the Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Borrelliſts</hi> had their name from one <hi>Borrell,</hi> the Ringleader of their Sect, a man very Learned, eſpecially in the <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Tongues. He was Brother to Monſieur <hi>Borrell,</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador from the <hi>States-General,</hi> to his moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Majeſty. Theſe <hi>Borreliſts</hi> do, for the moſt part, maintain the Opinions of the <hi>Mennonites,</hi> though they come not to their Aſſemblies. They have made choice of a moſt auſtere kind of Life, ſpending a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of their Eſtates, in Alms-giving, and a careful diſcharge of all the Duties incumbent upon a Chriſtian. They have an averſion for all Churches, as alſo for the Uſe of the Sacrament, publick Prayers, and all other external Functions of God's Service. They maintain, That all the Churches which are in the World, and have been ever ſince the death of the Apoſtles, and their firſt ſubſequent Succeſſors, have degenerated from the pure Doctrine which they had Preach'd to the World; for this reaſon, That they have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the infallible word of God, contain'd in the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, to be expounded and corrupted, by Doctors, who are not infallible, and would have their own Confeſſions, their Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſms, and their Liturgies, and their Sermons, which are the works of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, to paſs for what they really are not, to wit, for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101606:16"/>
the pure word of God. They hold alſo, That men are not to read any thing but the word of God alone, without any additional explication of men. Another perſuaſion they have, is, That if there ſhould be any Aſſembly, wherein men would content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the bare reading of the word of God (however the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who might be deſirous to be receiv'd into it, may demean themſelves) provided they acknowledg the Holy Scripture to be the Word of God, they ought to be receiv'd into its Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> or <hi>Quakers,</hi> who affirm, That what they ſay, or do, is by Divine Inſpiration, maintain, That the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ought to be explicated, according to the light of that Divine Inſpiration, without which it is but a dead Letter, written to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and not to perfect and ſpiritual men; and that it is not the true, only, and perfect Word of God, or the Compleat and Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Rule of Faith. They maintain, That their own private Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is the true, internal, and ſpiritual Word of God, the Rule and the Judg of the Scriptures: That men ought to hearken to, and follow that Spirit, and not the words of the Scripture. That a man has, within himſelf, and in his own Spirit, an infallible Teacher, who, if he hearkens to him, will inform him of all he is to believe, or do, in orer to his Salvation. That they who heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to that Spirit are united to God, and that ſuch union makes them Gods. When they are in their Aſſemblies, they continue a long time in a ſitting poſture, without ſpeaking, and many times with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as ſtirring, for the ſpace of one or two hours; and there is nothing heard of them, unleſs it be ſome ſighs and groans, till ſuch time as ſome one among them, feeling the agitation and ſtirring of the Spirit, riſes up, and ſpeaks the things which the Spirit commands him to ſpeak. Nay many times, the Women are ſenſible of thoſe motions of the Spirit, which occaſion their ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or holding forth, in the Congregation of their Brethren. In their ordinary diſcourſes, they ſpeak of their Ecſtaſies, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, and will be always ſure, to add very ſevere cenſures of all other Chriſtians. They very vehemently declaim againſt Vices, and with great earneſtneſs preſs the mortification of the Fleſh. They challenge all thoſe who are in the Aſſembly, and conjure them to ſpeak, if there be any one that has ought to object againſt what the Spirit has inſpir'd them to deliver. And this occaſions the frequent
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101606:17"/>
diſputes and quarrels, which happen amongſt them. Nay it comes to paſs ſometimes, that after they have for a good while expected the coming, and inſpiration of the Spirit, not any one amongſt them being ſenſible of its heat and motion in himſelf, they depart from the place where they were Aſſembled, without any one's having held forth.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Libertines,</hi> they ſeem to have each of them his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sentiment to himſelf. But moſt of them are of this perſuaſion, that there is only one Spirit of God, which is univerſally diffus'd, and lives in all Creatures. That the Subſtance and Immortality of our Souls, is not any thing but that Spirit of God. That God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is not any thing but that Spirit. That mens Souls die with their Bodies. That Sin is not any thing. That it is but a ſimple opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which immediately vaniſhes, provided there be no account made of it. That Paradiſe is but an illuſion, a pleaſant <hi>Chimera,</hi> which the Divines have invented, to engage men, to embrace that which they call Virtue. That Hell alſo is but a vain Fancy, which the ſame Divines have fram'd, to divert men from that which they call Sin; that is to ſay, to hinder them from being happy in doing what they pleaſe. They affirm, in fine, That Religion is only an invention of Politicians, to keep the people, by the fear of a Divinity, in a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to their Laws, in order to the better Regulation and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, there are in this Country a vaſt number of perſons, as I know there were heretofore in <hi>England,</hi> who go under the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>Seekers.</hi> It is the acknowledgment of theſe people, That there is one true Religion, which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has brought us from Heaven, and which he has reveal'd to us in his Word; but they maintain withal, That that true Religion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which we ought to profeſs, in order to the attainment of Salvation, is not any one of thoſe Religions, which are Eſtabliſh'd amongſt <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> They have ſome particular exception to make againſt every one of thoſe Religions, and they condemn them all in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. In a word, They have not pitch'd upon any one determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Religion, as being ſtill concern'd upon the <hi>Seeking</hi> account. They read and meditate the Holy Scriptures with great attention. They pray to God with a fervent Zeal, That he would illuminate them in the knowledg of that Religion, which they ought to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101606:17"/>
in order to the ſerving of him according to his Will, and for the acqueſt of that everlaſting Felicity, which he has promis'd his Children.</p>
            <p>I ſhould not think, that I have given you an account of all the Religions and Perſuaſions of this Country, if I ſhould omit the ſaying of a word, or two, of an Illuſtrious and Learned man, who, as I have be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n aſſur'd, has a great number of Followers, and thoſe, ſuch as keep cloſely to his Sentiments. He is a man, by birth a <hi>Jew,</hi> whoſe name is <hi>Spinoſa,</hi> one that has not abjur'd the Religion of the <hi>Jews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> nor embrac'd the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion: So that he continues ſtill a moſt wicked <hi>Jew,</hi> and has not the leaſt tincture of Chriſtianity. Some Years ſince he put forth a Book, entituled, <hi>Tractatus Theologo-Politicus,</hi> wherein his principal deſign is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all Religions, and particularly the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and to introduce <hi>Atheiſme, Libertiniſme,</hi> and the free Toleration of all Religions. He maintains, That they were all invented, for the advantage and conveniences, which the Publick receives thereby, to the end that all perſons ſubject to Government may live honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and obey their Magiſtrates, and that they may addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Virtue, not out of the hope or expectation of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward after death, but for the intrinſick excellency of Virtue in it ſelf, and for the advantages which accrue to thoſe who follow it, in this life. He do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s not, in that Book, make an open diſcovery of the opinion which he has of the Divinity, but he does however ſo far inſinuate it, as that we may gueſs at his meaning, whereas in his Diſcourſes, he boldly affirms, That God is not a Being endow'd with Intelligence, Infinitely-Perfect, and Bliſsful, as we imagine him to be; but that he is not any thing elſe, but that Virtue of Nature, which is diffus'd into all the Creatures.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Spinoſa</hi> is now living in this Country. His Reſidence was, for ſome time, at the <hi>Hague,</hi> where he was viſited by the <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> and all others who pretended to more then ordinary Curioſity; nay by ſome young Ladies of Quality, who pride themſelves in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ingenious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then is requiſite for their Sex. His followers are ſomewhat cautious in diſcovering themſelves, becauſe his Book, before-mention'd, does abſolutely ſubvert the very Foundations of all Religions, and has been condemn'd by a publick Edict of the <hi>States-General,</hi> and a prohibition put upon the Sale of it; and yet
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101606:18"/>
it is publickly Sold. Amongſt all the Divines, of whom there is a great number in this Country, there has not ſtood up any one, that has preſum'd to write againſt the opinions which this Author advances in the afore-ſaid Treatiſe. And I am the more ſurpriz'd thereat, for this reaſon, that the Author, making a diſcovery of his great knowledg of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, as alſo of all the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, of all the Cuſtoms of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of the Heatheniſh Philoſophy; the Divines of the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot ſay, but that the Book does well deſerve, that they ſhould take the pains to refute it. For if they ſtill continue ſilent, men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear affirming, that either they are defective in point of Charity, in ſuffering ſo pernicious a Book to be ſcatter'd up and down without any Anſwer thereto, or that they approve the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of that Author; or that they have not the courage and abilities to oppoſe them.</p>
            <p>And thus, Reverend Sir, have I given you an acccount of the different Sects of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> which are in this Country, and which have all, in a manner, the freedom of Exerciſing the Religions which they profeſs. I leave you to make thereupon what reflections you ſhall think fit. It will be no hard matter for me, to deduce, from this diverſity of Sects, ſuch convincing Reaſons, as ſhall prove what I have before advanced, to wit, <hi>That the States-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral are not of our Reformed Religion.</hi> In the firſt place, it cannot be affirmed, that this State is of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Religion, upon the ſcore of the number of thoſe who make profeſſion of it. For, though it cannot be preciſely known, what number there are of perſons profeſſing the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> way of <hi>Reformation,</hi> which is commonly called the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> in theſe Provinces, yet this is ſtill out of all queſtion, That the number of thoſe who are not of it, is incomparably greater than that of thoſe who do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it. Having thereupon conſulted ſome of the Inhabitants, they have aſſur'd me, That there may be a Tripartite Diviſion made of the people of theſe Provinces, and that the three parts may be ſomething towards an equality. The one is of the <hi>Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>; another, of the <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi>; and the third, of the <hi>Sectaries.</hi> I ſhould never have thought, that the number of the <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> had been ſo great. It is certain, that a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part of the Inhabitants of Great Cities, and the greateſt part of thoſe of the Campaigne, and of the Boors of that Country,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101606:18"/>
are <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi>; and there are aſſuredly at leaſt as many of thoſe of the <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi> And if we put together all the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> they alſo, doubtleſs, make up a third part of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of theſe Provinces. If therefore the Domination, and the Denomination, ought to be deduc'd from the greateſt part, thoſe of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> being, at moſt, but a third part of the people of this Country, cannot give the whole State the Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of being of the <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi> It cannot therefore be ſuch, upon any other account than this, that our <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> has been Eſtabliſh'd, and the others forbidden, by the publick Edict before-mentioned. It might indeed be granted, that it deſerv'd that name, if that Ordinance had been put in execution; but that having not been executed, the name cannot be juſtly given it. But that being a matter requiring much diſcuſſion, I ſhall wave it at this time, and make it the ſubject of my next to you; and ſo I ſhall make no addition to this, ſave only that of aſſuring you of my being,</p>

            <p>YOu have obſerv'd in my firſt Letter, That the <hi>States-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> have always given Liberty of Conſcience to all ſorts of perſons, and allow'd the publick exerciſe, in a manner, of all Religions.

            <p>While the free exerciſe of all Religions was permitted by all the publick Decrees, you will certainly acknowledg, That then the <hi>States</hi> were not yet of our <hi>Reformed</hi> way of Religion. For if you make this concluſion, That theſe Provinces were at that time of our Religion, becauſe there was a publick profeſſion of our Religion made in them, I ſhall, with the ſame reaſon, make this, That they were <hi>Catholicks, Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> becauſe, at that time, there was a publick Profeſſion made in them of all thoſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Let us therefore examine, what Ordinances theſe Provinces made afterwards, which might give them the name, which they are ſo deſirous to have, of our <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi> I have told you heretofore, That it was in the Year 1572. that our <hi>Reformed</hi> way of Religion, ſuch as it was taught at <hi>Geneva,</hi> in your Cantons, and in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> was receiv'd in theſe Provinces, for the only publick Religion. But the very Ordinance, which eſtabliſh'd our Religion to be the publick Religion, Did alſo openly confirm the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience</hi> of all ſorts of Religions, with an expreſs prohibition,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101606:19"/>
for the Diſturbing or Moleſting of any Perſon whatſoever upon that account.</p>
            <p>The difference there upon this Score, between the <hi>States-General,</hi> and all the other Eſtates of our <hi>Reformed</hi> Religion, was ſo great, that I cannot imagine you ſhould think the one and the others to be of the ſame Religion. The <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd it by a publick Decree, That the free Exerciſe of all Rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould be permitted. The <hi>Elector Palatine,</hi> the City of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> and your <hi>Cantons</hi> did not, in any part of their Territories, permit the Exerciſe of any Religion, ever ſo little different from ours. I queſtion not but that you know, the <hi>Elector-Palatine</hi> did, at the beginning, follow the Confeſſion of <hi>Auxbourg,</hi> which was received in all his Dominions; and that, ſince that time, having embrac'd our <hi>Reformed</hi> way of Religion, and having est<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>bliſh'd it in his Country, he order'd all the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who would not make profeſſion thereof, to depart out of it. It is doubtleſs, no ſmall trouble to the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> to ſee that moſt of his Subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cts are <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that there are many of them <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and but very few of the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> reformed way of Religion. But, as you know, it is not above ſixty years ſince that Electoral Houſe began to make profeſſion of our Reformed Religion, yet ſo, that he could not oblige his Subjects, either his embrace the ſame, or to quit that which they had profeſs'd for a long time before. <hi>John Sigiſmond,</hi> who died in the Year 1619. and was Grandfather to the Elector now reigning, was the firſt Renouncer of the <hi>Lutherane</hi> Religion, which he and ſome of the Anceſtors had till then prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſs'd, and firſt the Profeſſion of our <hi>Reformed</hi> way. He publiſh'd a Confeſſion of Faith, in the Year 1614. In the Preface of it, he ſaies, That it was about eighty Years, ſince <hi>Joakim,</hi> he <hi>Second,</hi> had renounced the Ceremonies of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; But that having retain'd a Doctr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne upon the Point of the Euchariſt, which was not conformable to the Truth, and ſome other things in the Temples, which were not allowable, he had apply'd, himſelf to the correcting of all Abuſes, in order to a full and perfect Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And yet the greateſt part of his Subjects, having, near fourſcore years before, embrac'd the <hi>Lutherane Religion,</hi> he was ſo far from obliging them to quit it, and to embrace the Profeſſion of ours, that, in many parts of his Territories, nay even at <hi>Berlin</hi> it ſelf, which is the principal City of his Reſidence, he has
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101606:20"/>
not the Liberty of having the particular Exerciſe of our Rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gion, for any but himſelf and thoſe of his Houſhold. No doubt but he wiſhes that he could follow the example of other Eſtates, who do profeſs it, in not permitting the Exerciſe of any o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her in all his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
            <p>There is not any neceſſity of my telling you, That there never was, either at <hi>Geneva,</hi> or in your <hi>Cantons,</hi> any permiſſion, I do not ſay of the Exerciſe of our Religion, but even of Habitation, for thoſe whoſe profeſs a Religion different from ours. That being ſo, I aſſure my ſelf, of your being perſuaded, that one and the ſame Religion cannot inſpire thoſe who profeſs it, with ſentiments that are contradictory, and with an abſolutely oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Conduct and deportment.</p>
            <p>There may be ſome in the World, who would ſay, That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of State obliged the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> the City of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and your <hi>Cantons,</hi> to proceed one way, and that the ſame intereſt of State obliges the <hi>Vnited Prvinces</hi> to take a quite different Courſe, in the ſame caſe, and upon the ſame Oceaſion. But I do not imagine, that you approve that ſtrange Maxim of ſome Politicians, who accommodate Religion to the Intereſt of State; and I hope, you will acknowledge, that they, who do ſo, have not any at all. At the very time that our Religion was eſtabliſh'd by a publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, Liberty of Conſcience was alſo ſolemnly confirm'd, by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Vtrecht.</hi> Nay it is expresſly granted, That, as to matter of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Every Seignory or Province, ſhould make ſuch regulation as it thought fit, according to its own cuſtomes.</hi> It is therefore manifeſt, That the united Provinces cannot be ſaid to be of the <hi>Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> according to the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> way, but only from that time, and by Reaſon of the Regulation which they made in the Year 1583. But if, as I think I have evidently made it appear, the States have no other ground than that, from which they may have the demonination of being of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> methinks I ſhall without much ado, make it further appear to you, that they have not any at all.</p>
            <p>If then the Decree they made, by which it was expresſly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, That there ſhould not be the permiſſion of any Religion amongſt them, but of ours only, does juſtly give them the Name
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101606:20"/>
of a State of that <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> the continual Conduct which they have hitherto obſerv'd, in a conſtant Practice of what is quite contrary to the Ordinance, does, if I miſtake not, deprive them of the Name, which they pretended to, by its Eſtabliſhment. I do not think, Sir, that you will undertake to maintain, That for a State to be of our <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> it needs do no more, than make a Decree, by which it declares a Reſolution to profeſs it, and not to permit in its Territories the Exerciſe of any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; when, inſtead of a ſincere Accompliſhment of what had been reſolved by its Decree, it is ſo far from performing of any thing of it, that it acts d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rectly to contrary thereto. I do not imagine you will pretend, That State to be of our Religion, by Virtue of a Decree, which it makes, and never did put in Execution. You will tell me, That the <hi>States-General</hi> are of our Religion, becauſe they affirm it, and make a publick Profeſſion thereof. And I, on the other ſide, maintain, that That is not ſufficient, for their aſſuming a name which they do not deſerve, ſince they deſtroy the external Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they make of it, by a Practice quite oppoſite, and very odious to all thoſe of the Religion. If they permitted in their Country but one or two Religions, whoſe Sentiments were not much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from ours, and that in ſome of the leſs principal, and leſſer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Points, there would be no great Cauſe for men to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at it. It might be urged, That Prudence and Charity oblig'd them, to have ſome Complyance for Chriſtians, who, as to the principal Part, retain the ground-work of Faith, though they have not received ſuch Illuminations from God, as might create a Belief of all our Myſteries. But is there any thing in the World ſo ſurprizing, as our finding, That the States give an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited liberty to all Sorts of Religions, inſomuch, That in the very Province of <hi>Holland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>,</hi> there are more diſcover'd and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd Sects, than there are in all the other Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and that there is not any Maſter-Heretick, who has a mind to frame a n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w Sect, but is there kindly received, to teach and propagate his Religion, and to make a publick Profeſſion thereof?</p>
            <p>Some Years ſince, <hi>John Labadie,</hi> the Apoſtate, having been depos'd and excommunicated by the <hi>Walloon-Churches</hi> of this Country, addreſſed himſelf to the <hi>Heer Van Beuninghen,</hi> deſiring to be taken into his Protection, <hi>Van Beuninghen</hi> makes him this Anſwer, <hi>That as long as he was willing to continue in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101606:21"/>
Communion of the</hi> Walloon-Churches, <hi>he was oblig'd to ſubmit to their Ordinances and Diſcipline; but that if he would frame a new Sect, he ſhould participate of the Protection which the States granted to all ſorts of Religions.</hi> I do not queſtion but you know the ſaid perſon, and are, doubtleſs, able to judge, That it was not out of any Scruple of Conſcience, that he thought it not convenient, to eſtabliſh his Sect in this Countrey. He had amongſt his Devotes, the Illuſtrious Gentlewoman, Mrs. <hi>Mary de Schurmans,</hi> and other young Ladies, of more than ordinary quality; but being in ſome Fear, That their Relations might get them out of his Society, which began to be cry'd down, and to appear very ſcandalous; he thought it his better way, to ſettle himſelf elſewhere, with his ſanctified Company of both Sexes, whom he took along with him. Had he thought it convenient, to make his Abode in this Country, he would have augmented the Number of Sects, which have their Eſtabliſhment here, and made ſome Additions to the Religions, which have a publick Liberty in theſe parts.</p>
            <p>But though this <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> is of ſo great a Latitude as I have told you, yet I am in ſome ſuſpenſe, whether you know it to be ſo comprehenſive, as to extend to the countenancing and protecting of thoſe <hi>Hereticks,</hi> whom you would ſentence to death, if they were amongſt you. This I am ſatified you know, That, above a hundred years ago, your <hi>Canton,</hi> and the Republick of <hi>Geneva,</hi> condemned <hi>Michael Servetus,</hi> and <hi>Scipio Gentilis,</hi> to be bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nt alive, for the erroneous Opinions they held, concerning the Trinity. The principal Errours, upon which they were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, are much the ſame, or, at leaſt, are not more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, than thoſe which the <hi>Socinians</hi> maintain, upon the ſame Myſtery of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion. Do you not then wonder at the extraordinary difference there is, between the Conduct obſerv'd by your <hi>Canton,</hi> and the Republick of <hi>Geneva,</hi> towards thoſe two ancient <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and that which the States obſerve, in reference to the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who propagate the ſame Hereſies, or others that are equally pernicious? <hi>Geneva,</hi> and your <hi>Canton</hi> could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the one, <hi>Servetus,</hi> and the other, <hi>Gentilis</hi>; and paſs'd their judgment, that they both deſerv'd death. The <hi>States-General</hi> do, without any Scruple, ſuffer a great number of <hi>Socinians,</hi> moſt of whom are born and brought up amongſt them, and never had the leaſt thought of doing them any harm, upon the ſcore of their Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:101606:21"/>Your <hi>Canton,</hi> and the City of <hi>Geneva</hi> would have thought themſelves guilty of a great Crime againſt God, if they had not, by death, taken off theſe two <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>States-General</hi> have, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, done all that lay in their Power, to countenance and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them.</p>
            <p>Not many years ago, the Books of the <hi>Socinians</hi> were very ſcarce. Amongſt thoſe which had come forth into the World, as they had been printed in very remote places, and but very few Copies had been taken off, ſo were there not any to be had, but at very dear Rates; nay moſt of them were not to be had at all. The <hi>States-General</hi> have out of their ſpecial Favour and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and out of an unparallel'd tenderneſs of Conſcience, found out a Remedy for that inconvenience. To satisfy the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and thoſe who were deſirous to become their Proſelytes, they have permitted the works of Four of their principal Doctors to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, at <hi>Amſterdam</hi>; to wit, thoſe of <hi>Socinus, Crellius, Slichtingi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and <hi>Wolfogenius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this very time, there is publickly ſold at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> that Library of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> in Eight Volumes, in folio, which coſts but a hundred <hi>Guilders.</hi> Not many years ſince, two hundred Piſtols would not have purchaſed one part of thoſe Works, which at preſent may be had altogether for leſs than ten. True it is, That not long ſince, there was burnt at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> a certain book of the <hi>Socinians</hi>; but it was done, no doubt, upon the very Intreaty of <hi>William Bleau,</hi> for whom it had been printed. Not many dayes after that publick Execution, he publickly expos'd the very ſame Book to ſale, and the more to recommend the ſale of it, and to enhaunce the Price of it, he had got an Advertiſement put into the Title-Page, that it was the very ſame Book, which had been, by Order of the <hi>States,</hi> condemn'd to be publickly burnt, by the hand of the common Executioner.</p>

No doubt but you know, that the <hi>Jews</hi> are very numerous in this Country; that they have an abſolute Liberty, and their Synagogue, in which they make their Aſſemblies for the Service of God, and that there never was the leaſt Thought of driving them hence, or putting any one of them to death.</p>
            <p>You know alſo, better than I do my ſelf, what you did at <hi>Berne,</hi> in reference to ſome <hi>Mennonites,</hi> who were found in your Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. They gave them the dreadful name of <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to render them odious, and abominable to all your people. You caſt them into Priſon, and you there kept them a long time, out of the Zeal you had for your own Religion, and the averſion you had to theirs; nay, for a certain time, you would not ſet them at liberty, in order to their departure, with what they had, into ſome other Parts. But at laſt, you granted them that Favour, and it is not unlikely, that you did it upon the Intreaty of the Magiſtrate of <hi>Roterdam,</hi> who writ to you a very preſſing Letter on their Behalf. Some years before, the Canton of <hi>Schasfhouſe,</hi> had alſo baniſh'd out of their T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Mennonites,</hi> and thought they had done them a kindneſs, in permitting them to take along with them what effects they had, into ſome other parts. Nay, I have been alſo aſſured, that not many Years ſince, a certain Number of <hi>Mennonites</hi> being, to their Misfortune, found in the Canton of <hi>Zeurich,</hi> they were taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to cuſtody, and had indictments drawn up againſt them, on theſe two Capital Crimes.</p>
            <p>There were at that time ſome Comapnies raiſing, upon ſome extraordinary occaſion which the Magiſtrates had, for the ſafety
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101606:22"/>
of the Country. The <hi>Mennonites</hi> would have excuſed themſelves, from being liſted in thoſe Companies, alledging, That they did not believe a Chriſtian could, with a good Conſcience, bear arms, upon any occaſion whatſoever. They preferr'd however, voluntarily to lay down what money ſhould be required of them, for the payment of ſuch Perſon, as might be put in to ſerve in their ſtead. They would moreover engage them to oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Oath, to be faithfull to the State, and to obey their Magiſtrates. They acknowledged, That they were in Conſcience, oblig'd to that Duty, and that they ſhould be very careful in the diſcharging of it; They promis'd to do ſo, and declar'd, that they conceiv'd themſelves as deeply engag'd, by their bare word, as if they had confirm'd it with a ſolemn Oath; But that they could not be induc'd to take any, for this Reaſon, that they believed, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had commanded ſuch as profeſs'd <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> ſimply to ſay, <hi>Yea,</hi> for the affirming of a thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Nay,</hi> for the denying of it, expresſly forbidding them to ſwear, upon any occaſion whatſoever.</p>
            <p>The Magiſtrate of <hi>Zurich,</hi> judging that thoſe two Errours were pernicious to the State, paſs'd this Order againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors thereof, <hi>That within Fiftee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Nay, there is at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> That <hi>Chriſtopher Sandius,</hi> of whom I have heretofore ſpoken to you, who makes an open and publick Profeſſion of being an <hi>Arrian,</hi> and he has many Diſciples.</p>
            <p>If therefore you will ſeriouſly examine the thing, I think you will meet with but little Encouragement, to maintain, That
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101606:23"/>
thoſe Governments, which follow ſo contrary a Practice, one to the other, upon a matter of Fact ſo important, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Religion, can, in the mean time, be of the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. I do not Imagine, that you will approve or what ſome affirm, upon this occaſion, <hi>That in things which are indifferent, two States may demean themſelves, the one, this way, and the other, that way, and be both in the mean time of the ſame Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Things <hi>indifferent,</hi> as to practicability, are, if I am not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, ſuch as may, or may not be done, or be done after one manner, or after another quite different manner, yet, all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offending God. But I am not eaſily to be perſuaded, that the things we now ſpeak of can be called <hi>Indifferent.</hi> For I pray, tell me, Was it not well done by your Magiſtrate, and by that of <hi>Geneva,</hi> when they burnt theſe two ancient <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and this laſt <hi>Jew</hi>? If it was well done, it was not therefore a thing <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> and they could not have omitted the doing of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offending God. If they did well in their procedure, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks you cannot deny but that the <hi>Dutch</hi> do very ill, in tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating and protecting the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who, as to the main, hold the ſame Errours, as thoſe ancient Hereticks; unleſs you would haply affirm, That there are ſome things in reference to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which may be done after one way in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and after another way in the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> For, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend, how one and the ſame Religion, can incline ſome of thoſe, who profeſs it, to do things directly contrary to thoſe which the others do.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I do not think, that you will be ſo confident, as to affirm, that it was a thing indifferent, for your Magiſtrate, and for him of <hi>Geneva,</hi> to put thoſe two unforunate Hereticks to death. You have too great a reſpect for your Lords, and Superiours, to charge them with the <hi>Odium</hi> of ſo rigorous an Execution, if they had not been thereto oblig'd by the Precepts of their Religion. If the Magiſtrates of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> are of the ſame Religion, as yours, why does it not induce them, to follow the ſame Practice, in reference to the ſame Hereticks, or others, who are yet more dangerous?</p>

ſufficient to give him the denomination of being of it, as well as you.</p>
            <p>But if the Magiſtrates did acquit themſelves of the Devoir, whereto the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> does particularly oblige Magiſtrates, I ſhould make no difficulty to grant them the Privilege of Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to the State which they govern, the Name of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they profeſs. I believe, you will grant me, That the <hi>Reformed</hi> Magiſtrates, are, after the Example of your <hi>Cantons,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to obſtruct the Eſtabliſhment, and publick Exerciſe of falſe Religions; and the Magiſtrates themſelves of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> cannot be ignorant, of what their own Confeſſion of Faith, review'd, and approv'd by the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> preſcribes to them, upon this occaſion. The xxxvi. Article, in which men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of Magiſtrates, ſaies expresſly, <hi>That it is their Duty, to remove Idolatry, and the falſe ſervice of God, to endeavour the deſtruction of</hi> Antichriſt, <hi>and to advance the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot imagine therefore, that you ſhould endeavour to maintain, That the <hi>States-General</hi> do conſcientiouſly acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of what they are olig'd to by their charge of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, after what I have ſaid to you, of the Liberty, and Indulgence they grant, to ſo many different Sects, which, by their erroneous opinions, ſubvert the principal Myſtery of our own Religion.</p>
            <p>If you conſult your own Sentiments, and thoſe of your Collegues, and of all your Miniſters, and if you follow the Practice of all your own Churches, you are oblig'd to exclude out of your Communion all thoſe Magiſtrates, who give that Liberty to all ſorts of Sects and Perſuaſions. How then can you think, that thoſe Magiſtrates, whom the Ordinances of your own Churches permit not to communicate with you, can give the Name of your Religion, to the State which they govern? Nay there are ſome Magiſtrates at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and <hi>Rotterdam</hi>; two of the principal, and moſt wealthy Cities of <hi>Holland,</hi> who make a publick and open Profeſſion, of their being <hi>Arminians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:101606:24"/>The Sieur <hi>Adrian Patius,</hi> who is one of the Magiſtracy of <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> is alſo an <hi>Arminian,</hi> and his Religion hinders not his exerciſing the Charge of Ambaſſadour from the <hi>States-General,</hi> at the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Court, where he at preſent is.

            <p>Upon the Summing up therefore of all I have ſaid to you, I am apt to think, that you cannot ſtill have the ſame Opinion of the <hi>States-General,</hi> and continue your calling them a <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify'd Republick.</hi> Could you repreſent to your ſelf that ſtrange <hi>party-colour'd, Chequer-work of Religion,</hi> which is to be ſeen in thoſe Countries, I ſhould hardly believe, that you could perſiſt any longer, in the good Sentiments you have for this State. I am ready to acknowledg, That the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are oblig'd to it, for the liberty they have, to live there, without any fear, in the exerciſe of Religion. But are not all ſorts of <hi>Hereticks</hi> equally oblig'd to it, for the liberty they have, to live there quietly, in the exerciſe of their Religions? If this State has been a Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary to thoſe of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> all <hi>Hereticks</hi> have alſo found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge there, as well as the others.</p>
            <p>In the General <hi>Diet</hi> held in <hi>Poland,</hi> in the Year 1658. it was Order'd, by a Publick Decree, That all the <hi>Socinians</hi> (who were very numerous in that Country, and had their Principal Seat there) ſhould be ſent away thence, and that, after ſome time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd them for the diſpoſal of their Eſtates, they were to be for ever baniſh'd thence. The <hi>States-General</hi> did charitably receive all thoſe amongſt them, who took refuge in this Country; and it is particularly ſince that time, that they have notoriouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd, and multiply'd. If this <hi>State</hi> be the School of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Party,</hi> it is in like manner the School, the Damme, and the Nurſery of all <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Nay, I am in ſome ſuſpenſe, whether it may not be juſtly maintain'd, <hi>That Chriſtian Religion has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd more detriment, than advantage, by the eſtabliſhment of this State?</hi> And poſſibly, for the ſame intereſt of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi>

            <p>IF I am not miſtaken, I have, by irrefragable reaſons proved, That the <hi>States-General</hi> cannot be ſaid to be of the <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi> But you will ſay, If they are not of our Religion, what Religion may they be ſaid to be of? I muſt confeſs they are of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> if, to be ſo, there needs no more, than an external profeſſion of it, no more, than to have ordain'd, by a publick Decree, That our Religion ſhould be the <hi>Religion of State,</hi> and that all thoſe, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o would have any concern in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſhould make publick profeſſion thereof, and that there ſhould be publick Schools for the Teaching of it.

               </gap>on. But if, as I think, I have made it ſufficiently appear, This State follows a practice quite contrary to all Governments of that Religion; and does, by its Conduct, and its own Confeſſion of Faith, and the publict Decree, whereby it eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd our Religion to be the <hi>Reli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If you are pleas'd to remember, Reverend Sir, what I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto told you all-along, you will find it manifeſt, That as <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> was eſtabliſhed by the firſt Ordinances which they made in this Country; ſo it may be ſaid, with reaſon, That this State conſonantly to its own Principles, is, and ought to be, of all <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> And if it be of <hi>all Religions,</hi> it may well be ſaid, That it has not any particular Religion, nor indeed that it has not any at all. True it is, That there is one of them, which is very common to moſt of the Inhabitants of the Country, to wit, that of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Votaries,</hi> in theſe parts, and, there is no queſtion to be made, of his being better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſerv'd here, than the true God is by moſt <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> If we conſider the whole courſe of Life, amongſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the earneſtneſs, and application, wherewith they are addicted to <hi>Commerce,</hi> we cannot forbear acknowledging, That the only deſign they ſeem to have, is to grow rich, and heap up Money. There comes into my mind, upon this occaſion, what I read in an <hi>Italian</hi> Relation, of a certain Voyage of the <hi>Dutch</hi>; That being come into the Cities of <hi>Japan,</hi> out of which there had been an expulſion of all the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the Inhabitants of the Country having ask'd them, whether<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were <hi>Chriſtians</hi>; they confidently anſwer'd, <hi>Siamo Holandeſi, non Siamo Chriſtiani. We are Hollanders, we are not Chriſtians.</hi> And indeed their deportment ſince, as well in the <hi>Indies,</hi> as in ſome other remoto places, makes it evidently appear, that they are extreamly concern'd for the advancement of their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,</hi> and not any thing at all, for that of <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All other ſorts of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as well <hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi> as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> (the <hi>Dutch</hi> only excepted, if they may be admitted among the latter) make the Colonies they have, in thoſe remote parts of the World, promotive to the advancement of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> by cauſing it to be Preached to the Infidels. This we ſee practic'd by the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> with ſo great Zeal, by the great number of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries, whom they ſend into the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and into the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, to Preach the Goſpel, and to Convert thoſe People, to the Faith of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Nay this is alſo done by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who ſend Miniſters of the Goſpel, into all parts where they have Colonies, and order all the Directors of their Companies, not to ſpare any thing, for the advancement of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and the converſion of Infidels. And ſo indeed, as well the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks as the Proteſtants, make Uſe of Commerce, as of a means, to adv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nce the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, and to bring thoſe Idolatrous People to his Faith.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Dutch,</hi> on the contrary, out of a deteſtable impiety, are abſolutely neglectful of all the Intereſts of <hi>Religion,</hi> in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> in the <hi>Levant,</hi> and other Places, where they have great Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that they may do nothing prejudicial to the Intereſts of their <hi>Commerce.</hi> They give expreſs and peremptory Orders to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors of their Companies, and the Commanders of great Places, to hinder the Unbelieving Inhabitants of thoſe parts, from coming
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101606:26"/>
to the knowledg of the Myſteries of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and being Converted to the Faith of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is their perſuaſion, That if ſome amongſt thoſe People, were once become <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they might, by the Converſation they ſhould have with other <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> come to the knowledg of that grand Myſtery of <hi>Commerce,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of ſome part of their <hi>Trade.</hi> They would rather ſee all thoſe People Periſh eternally in their Igno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ce, than to ſee their Eyes open'd, by the illuminations of Heaven, and that they ſhould ſhare with them in the advantages of their <hi>Commerce.</hi> Is it not a horrid thing, that the conſideration of a Temporal Intereſt and Concern, ſhould ſtifle all Sentiments of Piety, Charity, and the Zeal they ought to have, for the advancement of <hi>Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> in a ſort of people, who would paſs for <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> nay, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be of that diviſion of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who aſſume the Title of <hi>Reformed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We need only take an Obſervation of their Conduct, in thoſe Countries, to make a diſcovery, that they take not the leaſt care in the World for the ſettlement of Religion there, and that the only Concern they have to mind there, is to ſee their <hi>Commerce</hi> in a ſtou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing condition. You will be fully ſatisfi'd of the truth of what I tell you, when you ſhall have underſtood ſome of the remarkable Actions, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> have done in the Cities of <hi>Japan,</hi> and in some other Cities of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were in the Territories of the Emperor of <hi>Japan,</hi> many <hi>Portugueze-Merchants,</hi> and a very great number of perſons born in the Country, who were <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and had been converted by the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and other <hi>Catholick-Emiſſaries.</hi> The <hi>Dutch,</hi> who do all they can, to be alone in thoſe remote places, and to get all other <hi>European</hi> Natives out of them, that all the Trade may be at their ſole diſpoſal, found a means to make all the <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> odious to the Emperor, that ſo he might have an occaſion to Baniſh them out of his Dominions. To that end, they inform'd him, that thoſe <hi>Catholicks</hi> had the <hi>Pope</hi> for their Head, to whom they render'd an implicite obedience, ſo far, as that he did diſpenſe with, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them of that ſubjection which they ought to their lawful Sovereigns. Conſequently to this, they repreſented to that Prince, that it was dangerous for him, to have in his Country ſo great a number of Subjects, who acknowledging elſewhere a Sovereign Power, ſuperior to his, might, upon the reception of ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

from it, rebell againſt him. That Prince, having, by this malicious information, conceived a very great Diſtruſt of all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in general, reſolv'd upon an abſolute extermination of them, and that not any one ſhould ever be ſuffer'd to live in his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories.

World, you are not ſo to look upon, as if that ſo deteſtable an Agreement made with the Emperour, was the private de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of a certain number of <hi>Dutch Merchants,</hi> reſident in thoſe Parts: but you are to conſider what they did, as done by the expreſs Order of the Directors of the Company eſtabliſh'd in that Country, who have ratify'd it, and promoted the execution of it. All the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who are return'd into this Country ſince that Treaty was made, having publiſh'd it, all that have any concern for Vertue and Chriſtianity in theſe Provinces have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd themſelves much aſtoniſh'd thereat. The Miniſtry made ſome ſtirr about it, and there have been ſeveral Acts made, in their Synods, in order to the making of Remonſtrances and Complaints thereof to the <hi>States-General.</hi> I cannot preciſely tell, what Reſolution tha <hi>States-General</hi> have yet taken thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but I know, that they have not taken any, for the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off of ſo Impious and ſo Scandalous a Treaty. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, in this very caſe, may juſtly create a belief, That they are of the Sentiment of that Renegado <hi>Jew, Spinoſa,</hi> of whom I have already given you an account, though he has not any thing of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>It is that Author's deſign, in his Treatiſe, called <hi>Tractatus Theologo-Politicus, pag.</hi> 62. of the <hi>Latine</hi> Edition, to prove, That <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> the <hi>Sacrament of the Euchariſt, Prayers,</hi> and all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Functions of Gods Service, which are, and ever have been common to all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in caſe they were appointed by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or his Apoſtles, of which he ſaies that he is not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd, were appointed, as he maintains, but only as external ſigns of the Univerſal Church, and not as things any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to Beatitude, or having any ſanctity in themſelves, and that they who live in Solitude are not oblig'd to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them; And that they who have their Habitations in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Countries, where the Exerciſe of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> is prohibited, are oblig'd to abſtain from thoſe Ceremonies, and may yet do well enough, in order to a happy life. To prove the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which he advances, he alledges the example of what the <hi>Dut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From whence it may be
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:101606:28"/>
deduc'd, That that Action, of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in <hi>Japan</hi> done, and maintain'd by a publick Authority muſt needs be impious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable, ſince this Author, who makes an open profeſſion of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme,</hi> makes, Uſe of it, as an irrefragable Reaſon, to prove, That all the external Services of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> are not at all contributory to, or advancive of ſatisfaction, and that men may be never the leſs happy, though they never mind them. But if, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to the Sentiment of that <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> you conſider that Action in it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what could you imagine in the World of greater horror, than that ſome <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If you have had any account of the dreadful Execution which was committed by the ſame <hi>Dutch,</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> in the Year 1622: it is impoſſible, but you muſt acknowledg, that there is not any conſideration of Religion able to divert them from the exerciſing of all ſorts of Cruelties, when the Diſpute is about their intereſt, and profit. There were not Twenty <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> in that place, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> had there a very gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They are taken into cuſtody, upon that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Conſpiracy; they are interrogated, not one amongſt them confeſſes any thing, and there could be no Diſcoveries made of their being guilty of it. But it was for the intereſt of the <hi>Dutch-Company,</hi> that they ſhould be ſo. That they might be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he ſeveral Tortures of Fire and Water were us'd, to make them acknowledg, what the <hi>Dutch</hi> would have them to ſay. After ſome reſiſtance of ſuch Cruel Torments, they were at laſt or'e-preſs'd by their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101606:28"/>
and confeſs'd whatever they deſir'd them. But after they had recover'd themſelves again, they diſown'd all they had ſaid in the midſt of their Torments; nay when they were juſt at the point of Execution, they call'd God to atteſt their Innocence, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought him to make it appear, after the death they were then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuffer. He who was the Commander of that place, and the unjuſt Judg who had condemn'd them, were nothing mov'd at, though fully convin'd of the Innocence of thoſe Priſoners.

            <p>Now, Sir, I would fain know, what you would ſay of ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane and ſo barbarous an Action? Will you ſtill allow thoſe to be good <hi>Reformed Chriſtians,</hi> who make no ſcruple to cut the Throats of their <hi>Brethren,</hi> profeſſing the ſame Religion as they do, for a little Worldly Goods, and for their own private Intereſts? This Tragical Story, is ſo well known all over the World, that there is not any <hi>Dutch man</hi> dares deny it. Nay an Author of their own Nation, one <hi>Aitzema,</hi> in his Book, entituled, <hi>The Lyon-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batant, pag.</hi> 211, 212, 213, 214, 215. Printed in the Year 1661. gives a very large and particular deſcription of it. And he makes out withal, how falſe, and unlikely the Accuſation brought in againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was, and confidently affirms, that it was fram'd, upon no other ſcore, than that they might have a pretence to put them to death, ſeize into their own hands all the effects of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Company,</hi> and, by that deteſtable impoſture, render themſelves Maſters of all the <hi>Trade</hi> of the <hi>Moluccoes, Amboyna,</hi> and <hi>Banda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame laſt-mention'd Author, does, in the ſame Book, <hi>page</hi> 113. Relate another Story of a greater Cruelty, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> exercis'd upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Banda.</hi> He ſays, That the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in order to their becoming Maſters of that Iſland, Maſſacred above Forty <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> and that, after they had bound living Perſons to dead Carkaſſes, they caſt them into the Sea, and afterwards poſſeſs'd themſelves of what they had, which amounted to above Five and Twenty Thouſand Pounds Sterling.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:101606:29"/>True it is, that they are ſomewhat to blame, who ſtill reproach the <hi>Dutch</hi> with thoſe two Actions, and particularly with that of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> ſince they have made a conſiderable ſatisfaction for it, in the Treaty which was concluded between them and the <hi>Protector<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in the Year 1654. For, the Parliament having enter'd into a War againſt them, which, amongſt other p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There would be a neceſſity of compiling a great Volume<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it were my deſign, to make a collection, of all the Cruel Actions, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> have committed in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and elſewhere, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pure intereſt of <hi>Commerce.</hi> But I am apt to think, that you will gladly ſpare me that Trouble, and will think, no doubt, that I have ſaid enough, and haply too much, upon a ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IT is no ſmall affliction to me, that I have given you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome things, concerning the <hi>Dutch,</hi> which certainly muſt have rais'd in you ſome diſguſt againſt me.

Though it were ſo, yet I do not think you have any reaſon to cry out, <hi>Arms, Arms,</hi> as you do, to excite and encourage all that are of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Perſuaſion, in <hi>Europe,</hi> to come in to their relief.

Were it a War upon the ſcore of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> do you think, that the one or the other Branch of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> that of <hi>Germany,</hi> and that of <hi>Spain,</hi> which are the natural E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of our <hi>Religion,</hi> and which ever have been the cruel Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of thoſe who profeſs it, would have openly undertaken the defence of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in this cauſe, againſt the intereſts of the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> of which, they make it their oftentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That they are the Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Nay, if it were an open and declar'd War, upon the account of <hi>Religion,</hi> you would ſoon find the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> deſerting the party of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and ſiding with that of their own <hi>Religion.</hi> The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> have yet another moſt conſiderable advantage, which would extreamly corroborat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> their Party againſt ours. They have the <hi>Pope,</hi> whom they all acknowledg to be the viſible Head of the Church upon Earth, who reunites them all for their Common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and would, with much more Zeal, publiſh a <hi>Croiſado</hi> againſt us, then ever he did any againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> And indeed, he has reaſon to have a greater animoſity againſt us, than againſt all the unbelieving people in the World. As he pretends to be the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Head of all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſo he conſiders thoſe who do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg him, as revolted Subjects, and Rebels to his Empire; whereas he looks on the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> as Strangers, who are out of his Juriſdiction, and not within the extent of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency.</p>
            <p>And as a King is more incens'd againſt his Subjects who
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101606:31"/>
have revolted from the obedience they owe him, then againſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemies, who are not within the Verge of his Dominions; So the <hi>Pope</hi> ſuffers the <hi>Jews</hi> in his Territories; and would never permit any of the <hi>Reformed Perſuaſion,</hi> to harbour in them. His <hi>Pontifical Dignity</hi> will not ſuffer him, ever to be reconcil'd to thoſe, who directly ſhock the authority, which he pretends to have over all <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may ſee by this, the great danger, into which thoſe of our Religion would be reduc'd, if your Zeal could enflame them ſo far, as to make a Party, in favour of the <hi>Dutch.</hi> Nay, I leave it to your own Judgment, whether it is any fault of yours, if your inconſiderate Zeal has not excited the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> to fall upon thoſe of our <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> in thoſe places, where they lye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to their mercy, and that they have not made it their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to exterminate them?</p>
            <p>But if your Zeal, without Knowledg, be injurious to all thoſe of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> in general, it is alſo very prejudicial to all your own <hi>Proteſtant-Cantons,</hi> and to your Allies in particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Aſſoon as ever you ſaw the firſt breaking out of this War. You your ſelf, Reverend Sir, in the City of <hi>Berne,</hi> and all your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, within the Extent of your Government, were continually cajoling the people by their Seditious Sermons, to make an Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection againſt thoſe of your Magiſtrates, who had given their judgment, That there ſhould be a Regiment of men granted to the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King</hi> out of your <hi>Canton.</hi> If men would have believ'd you, and all the Miniſters of your Country-Villages, it muſt have been accounted a very horrid Crime in you, to ſuffer your Soldiers to be employ'd in a War againſt your <hi>beloved Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Dutch.</hi> 'Twas this gave occaſion to your Magiſtrate, diſtracted by your Pulpit-bawling and by the clamours of the multitude, whom you had inflam'd into an Inſurrection, to write unſeaſonable Letters upon Letters, to the Officers of your Regiment, fraught with terrible menaces, if they ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rv'd in this War againſt the <hi>Vnited Provinces.</hi> Nay, you thought it not enough to put in a Charge againſt your own <hi>Canton,</hi> upon the account of its having granted Forces to his moſt <hi>Chriſtian Majeſty,</hi> and his not preventing their being employ'd againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but you
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101606:31"/>
muſt alſo Panegyrically celebrate the <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Zurick,</hi> and <hi>Schaffouſe,</hi> for their refuſal to give him any. I cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any reaſon you ſhould have to name <hi>Schaffouſe,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a poor little <hi>Canton,</hi> has but one half-Company in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but a hands-breadth of ground within its Juriſdiction, and can raiſe but Two Companies at the moſt. And you ſpeak of it, as if that refuſal of their Forces had been very detrimental to the Kings Affairs, and much retarded the Progreſs of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. And yet it is certain, in the mean time, That all the beſt qualify'd Perſons in the Councel of that <hi>Canton</hi> had promis'd to grant the Companies which the <hi>moſt Chriſtian King</hi> required of it. But One Factious perſon amongſt them occaſion'd the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Reſolution, upon this ſcore, that beſides his being a man abſolutely devoted to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> ever ſince his reception of a Preſent from them, when he ſojourn'd in this Country, he was out of hopes of getting the Command of a Company for one of his own Relations, that he might make ſome advantage thereby.</p>
            <p>But, as to the <hi>Canton</hi> of <hi>Zurick,</hi> I muſt acknowledg it to be powerful, and that it might have rais'd ſeveral Companies of good Soldiers. I know alſo, That its Councel conſiſts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of very good worth, ſuch as have Wit, and Honour, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and Conſtancy, if the thing had depended upon them; and they knew their own Intereſt much better, than to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd his <hi>Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> the Forces he had required of them. But the miſchief of it, as you know, is, That they are not the abſolute Maſters. The Sovereign Authority lies in the hands of the Councel of <hi>Two Hundred,</hi> conſiſting, for the moſt part, of much Heat, and little Proſpect, of much Obſtinacy, and little Reaſon. It is no wonder then, that, the Miniſters, having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd that multitude with the zealous Concern of <hi>Religion,</hi> they could not be diſpos'd, to grant Forces to his <hi>moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> though he ſhould have no Deſign to employ them againſt the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs further, Sir, That I am very much aſtoniſh'd, at your Undertaking, to make a confident juſtification of thoſe Two <hi>Cantons,</hi> for their having deny'd Forces to the <hi>most Chriſtian King</hi>; as alſo, that after you had blamed your own, for their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101606:32"/>
granted a Regiment, you ſhould undertake to vindicate all it did afterwards; either to have it recall'd, or to prevent its being employ'd against the <hi>Dutch.</hi> It will be no hard matter, for me, to make it appear to you, That this Conduct of yours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For inſtance, If it ſhould happen, that you were attack'd by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or the <hi>Emperour,</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by the <hi>Catholick-Cantons,</hi> or by ſome other Prince, of the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, you would deſire, That his <hi>moſt Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> would aſſiſt you againſt them, by vertue of the Alliance there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and him. If the King ſhould deny you the Forces you deſired, and alledge, That he could not aſſiſt you, being of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> againſt <hi>Catholick</hi> Princes, you would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of it, and affirm, That the Moſt <hi>Chriſtian King</hi> does not obſerve the Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Do you not further obſerve, That, by your indiſcreet Zeal, you deprive your ſelves of all the Advantages, which you might expect from the Alliance there is between You and the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King,</hi> by giving him juſt cauſe to deny you aſſiſtance, if you ſhould come to deſire it of him? If the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſhould enter into a War againſt you, upon the Pretenſions he has to the Country of <hi>Vaud,</hi> tell me, Whether you would be ſo preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous as to deſire aſſiſtance from the Moſt Chriſtian King?

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101606:32"/>
               <hi>Chriſtian King,</hi> did you, not Two Years ſince, when he openly undertook your protection, againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Baſil,</hi> who was going to give you ſome diſturbance. He had eſtabliſh'd a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Church, upon ſome part of your Territories, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that he had a right to do. The <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> had openly taken his part, by reaſon of the Concern of the <hi>Catholick Religion.</hi> The moſt <hi>Chriſtian King</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been inform'd, That he had not any Right to eſtabliſh that Church, upon your Territories, ſent a Meſſage to him, That if he did not reſtore things, to the condition they were in before, and forbear making any alteration, he would openly grant you aſſiſtance againſt him.</p>
            <p>You know, Sir, That the ſaid Prelate, ſtanding more in awe of the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King</hi>'s Indignation, than relying on the Succours of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> thought in his beſt courſe, to renounce his Pretenſions, and to give over diſturbing you. If the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King</hi> had done then, what you have done at the preſent, he would have been far enough from entertaining ſo much as a thought of protecting you, being of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> againſt a Biſhop, eſpecially in a Cauſe, wherein the Intereſt of the <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> was concern'd.</p>
            <p>You know alſo, That the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who have a particular Alliance with the <hi>Catholick Cantons,</hi> are oblig'd to aſſiſt them, in caſe they ſhould enter into a Warre againſt you, or againſt the other <hi>Proteſtant Cantons.</hi> Now it is manifeſt, That, upon ſuch occaſions, you cannot hope for any aſſiſtance, but from the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King.</hi> If therefore you would not have your Forces to ſerve his moſt <hi>Chriſtian Majeſty,</hi> againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who are not your Allies, meerly upon the ſcore of their profeſſing the ſame Religion, as you do, I do not ſee, how you can deſire the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King,</hi> to grant you Forces, to ſerve you, who are of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> againſt the <hi>Catholick Cantons,</hi> who are of his Allies, as well as you.</p>
            <p>You know further, That the City of <hi>Geneva</hi> is under the protection of <hi>France,</hi> ever ſince the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, who granted it thereto againſt <hi>Philibert-Emanuel,</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:101606:33"/>
All the Succeſſors of that King have continu'd their protection to the ſame City, againſt the Succeſſors of that ancient Duke, who are the troubleſome Neighbours, and in a manner the only Enemies, whom that Republick has any cauſe to fear.</p>
            <p>You ſee then, by this proceduce of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, of <hi>France,</hi> and the Kings who ſucceeded him, That though they were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry zealous for their <hi>Religion,</hi> yet they made no ſcruple, of giving their Protection to a <hi>Proteſtant-State,</hi> againſt a <hi>Catholick</hi> Prince. Had your Politicks been known in the World, thoſe Princes would not have become guilty, of what you think a great crime, That a King ſhould defend a State, profeſſing a Religion diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from his own, againſt a Prince, who is of the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with him. If this Maxim comes, once to eſtabliſh'd, you may very well fear, that the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King,</hi> having his Eves open'd by your illuminations, and following your example, may withdraw his Protection from <hi>Geneva,</hi> that ſo he may avoid the Reproach, which may be made to him, of having succour'd a City of the <hi>Hugu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>From this you may alſo take this further meaſure, That the implicite affection which you have for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> does expoſe you, as alſo the <hi>Proteſtant-Cantons,</hi> and your Allies, to an evident danger, of not receiving any more aſſiſtance from his moſt <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Majeſty,</hi> againſt a <hi>Catholick</hi> Prince, or State. If it ſhould ever happen, that you were concern'd in ſuch a War, the plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pretence of Zeal for Religion, would prove very prejudicial to you, in depriving you of the Aſſiſtance of the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King,</hi> who, certainly, is the greateſt, or, to ſay better, the only Support and Refuge that you can have. Your Injuſtice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and your Ingratitude, are ſo much the greater, in as much as you cannot deny, but that <hi>France</hi> has many times openly given its Protection to the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>Catholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You know, That, for a long time, it aſſiſted the <hi>Dutch,</hi> againſt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> even before there was any open War between the Two Crowns.</p>

Nay, the King of <hi>France</hi> is in a manner the only <hi>Catholick</hi> Prince, who allows the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> the Exerciſe of their <hi>Religion</hi> in his Dominions; whereas the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would never Tolerate, in his, the Exerciſe of any other <hi>Religion</hi> than the <hi>Catholick.</hi> And the <hi>Emperour</hi> has forc'd all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> out of his Hereditary Countries.

            </p>
            <p>In the mean, <hi>Reverend Sir,</hi> it appears by your deportment, That, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101606:34"/>
the Calamities, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> endure by the War, wherein he is now engag'd againſt them. Your Compaſſion is ſo great for their Miſery, that you think you have a diſpenſation, to forget all the Kindneſſes, which the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King</hi> hath done to thoſe of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and not ſo much as to reflect on thoſe he may yet do you, in giving you aſſiſtance againſt your Enemies. In a word, your Bowels do ſo yearn for thoſe poor Brethren of yours, the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that, provided their preſervation be ſecur'd, you do not much concern your ſelf, what may become of you, and all thoſe of the <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi> You are ſo blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infatuated, upon this ſubject, that, provided you demonſtrate your good Inclinations for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> you ſeem to be indifferent, that you are thought a bad <hi>Huguenot,</hi> and moſt wretched <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician.</hi> The <hi>Dutch,</hi> certainly, are the beſt <hi>Politicians</hi> in the World, for things relating to <hi>Religion,</hi> which they never made any other Uſe of, then that of accommodating it to the Intereſts of State. Nay they have alwaies been ſo little concern'd, at the danger of thoſe who profeſs'd the ſame <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> that they made no ſcruple at all, of entring into a War for their deſtruction, upon the pure ſcore of Money.</p>
            <p>Of which take this inſtance. I think you need not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, <hi>Reverend Sir,</hi> how that the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſent a certain number of Ships, to the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King,</hi> for the reinforcing of his Fleet, by which <hi>Rochell</hi> was then block'd up. That was, indeed, a War, upon the pure ſcore of <hi>Religion,</hi> in which the moſt <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King</hi> was engag'd againſt his Subjects, to get out of their hands the fortify'd places, which they were poſſeſſ'd of, and would keep, to ſecure the obſervance of the Edicts, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their <hi>Religion.</hi> All the whole party of the <hi>Reformed-Religion,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> were afraid, That as ſoon as the King ſhould have taken <hi>Rochell,</hi> he would abrogate the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and abſolutely take away the Exerciſe of the <hi>Calviniſticall Religion</hi> All the other <hi>Reformed Princes,</hi> and <hi>States</hi> had the ſame appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, inſomuch, that publick prayers were made in all parts for the preſervation of <hi>Rochell,</hi> as a City, on which depended the ſafety of all thoſe of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> They had the ſame thoughts in the <hi>Vnited Provinces,</hi> and prayers were made to God, in all Churches, that he would be graciouſly

               </gap>d, to preſerve <hi>Rochell,</hi> as the impregnable Fort of thoſe of the <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi> And yet the <hi>Dutch</hi> made no ſcruple of hiring out Ships, for money, to the then moſt <hi>Chriſtian King,</hi> to promote the Deſtruction of a City, which, according to the apprehenſions of all the World, was certainly to have conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thereto, that of our <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and of all thoſe who profeſs'd it in the Dominions of <hi>France.</hi> Was there ever ſeen any example of ſo deteſtable an impiety. That a State, which makes a boaſt of being of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> ſhould have made no Conſcience, for money, of contributing to the Ruine of a great People, who make profeſſion of the ſame <hi>Religion</hi>; and that at the very time, when, for the compleating of the Impiety, it order'd Prayers to be made to God, in the Churches, for their Preſervation? This puts me in mind of the Emperour, <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, who caus'd publick Prayers to be made, all over <hi>Spain,</hi> for the Liberty of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Second, whom he himſelf kept a Priſoner at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Caſtle of <hi>Saint Angelo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there are yet ſome particular circumſtances in this action of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> which do very much aggravate the horrour, and perfidiouſneſs of it. In the firſt place then, before the doing of any act of hoſtility againſt thoſe of <hi>Rochell,</hi> and before they had made any declaration of being enemies, they endeavour'd, by Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, to become Maſters of the Port. Though what I ſay ſeems ſtrange, and at ſome diſtance from credibility, yet is there not any thing in the world more true. An illuſtrious perſon amongſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the Author before by me cited, when I gave you an account of the affair of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> I mean <hi>Aitzema,</hi> in the Book en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled <hi>The Lyon Combatant,</hi> pag. 241. ſets down at large this Hiſtory, of the deſign which the <hi>Dutch</hi> had, to ſurprize <hi>Rochell.</hi> Take here in expreſs terms what he ſaies of it.</p>
            <p>On the fourth of <hi>July,</hi> in the Year 1625. <hi>Hautyn,</hi> Admirall of <hi>Holland,</hi> appeared before <hi>Rochell,</hi> with nineteen men of War. The Inhabitants of <hi>Rochell</hi> writ to him, as did alſo the Count <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Val,</hi> to let him know, what aſtoniſhment they were in, to ſee him in the poſture of an enemy, as being not able to imagine, that either the <hi>States,</hi> or the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> would have entred into a war againſt the <hi>Reformed Religion.

brought him the Letters, that he could not return them any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſtill he had had ſome conference with thoſe of the King's Councel. The next day he ſent them back to <hi>Rochell,</hi> with two of his own people, and told them, That he knew not whether they were come by the order of all the Inhabitants, or of ſome part of them only, and that he was going to ſend to them, to be aſſur'd of it; and that in caſe they continu'd in their ſubjection to the King, they were not to fear any harm. In the mean time, thoſe Deputies having left him, in order to their going to <hi>Rochell,</hi> he came up, with part of his Fleet, very near the City, which gave occaſion to two men of <hi>Rochell,</hi> whom he had kept aboard, to tell him, That he did not deal fairly. Monſieur <hi>de Soubize,</hi> having perceiv'd, that he was advanc'd with a good number of Ships, made him ſtand off, and one or two days after, he abſolutely defeated him, burnt his Vice-Admiral, and four or five Ships, and kill'd him five hundred men; ſo that the whole Fleet, being in great diſorder, got away as far as <hi>Nantes.</hi> And this was the unhappy ſucceſs, which that perfidious man had, who, under pretence of friendſhip, would have ſurpriz'd the City, and ſo betray'd it to the King.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Hauntyn</hi> had refitted his Fleet, he joyns that of the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King,</hi> commanded by Monſieur <hi>de Montmorency,</hi> who would fight that of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> aſſoon as he came in ſight of it. But news was brought him, That the <hi>Dutch</hi> Admiral would not be concern'd in the action; for this reaſon, no doubt, that he was afraid to be beaten once moro. <hi>Montmorency</hi> preſſes him, and conjures him, not to deſert him in ſo important an occaſion. He alledges for his Excuſe, as we find in <hi>Gramond, Hiſt, Gall. pag.</hi> 635, and 636. That without an expreſs Command from the States, he durſt not employ their Ships, to give a deciſive battel to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who were of the ſame Religion with his Maſters. Monſ. <hi>de Montmorency,</hi> being extreamly troubled, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> did, by their refuſal to fight, defeat him of the Fame, which he expected infallibly to acquire, by the Victory, was forc'd, after a fruitleſs application of intreaties, and promiſes, to make Uſe of an expedient, which ever prevails with the <hi>Dutch.</hi> He, with good palpable money, corrputed their whole Fleet, and engag'd the <hi>Admiral,</hi> the <hi>Commanders,</hi> and the <hi>Soldiers,</hi> by oath, to fight againſt thoſe of <hi>Rochell.</hi> So the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King's</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:101606:35"/>
Fleet, being reinforc'd with that of the <hi>Dutch, de Montmorency</hi> gave an abſolute defeat, to that of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> commanded by Monſ. <hi>de Soubixe:</hi> So that the Inhabitants of that City could not equip another, and from that very day loſt the Soveraignty of that Sea, which they had kept for ſome time. Whereupon, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Fleet, and that of the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King</hi> having the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute command of the Sea, his Land-Army undertook that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable work of the <hi>Digue.</hi> The City finding it ſelf depriv'd of all hopes of relief, ſurrender'd to the King, after the endurance of incredible inconveniences, by famine, during ſo long a Siege. If the <hi>Dutch</hi> had ſent in this aſſiſtance to his moſt <hi>Chriſtian Majeſty,</hi> by vertue of any Treaties of Allyance, which they had had with him, there would not have been any thing to quarrel at in the ſaid Action. But is it not an infamous thing, that, after they had plainly alledg'd their not being empower'd to fight againſt thoſe of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> without an expreſs command from the <hi>States,</hi> they ſhould nevertheleſs be lur'd in, by money, to do a thing, which they knew to be contrary to their duty, and might have contributed to the ruine of all thoſe who profeſs'd the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> if the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King</hi> had had any ſuch deſign, as ſome imputed to him? And by this, you may judge of the Friendſhip which the <hi>Dutch</hi> have for thoſe of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion,</hi> ſince they make no ſcruple, to hire out themſelves, and their Ships, to be aſſiſtant in their extermination.</p>
            <p>If you can, without paſſion, examine all I have written to you, concerning the <hi>Dutch,</hi> I am confident, you will not perſiſt any longer, in the good opinion you have hitherto had of them. But I think you will hardly be induc'd to loſe it, becauſe you are extremely propoſſeſſ'd in their favour. Mean time, ſince I look upon you, as a very juſt and rational Perſon, I hope you will not think it much, to aquaint me with the Reaſons, which you may have had, for your not being mov'd with thoſe which you have reciev'd from me. Shew me, that there is not any ground in all thoſe, by which I have pretended to prove, <hi>That the Vnited Provinces are not of the Reformed Religion, according to the Calviniſticall way of Reformation.</hi> Make it appear to me, that you have done well, in endeavouring to make an inſurrection in your <hi>Canton,</hi> about the Regiment, which you had rais'd for his moſt <hi>Chriſtian Majeſty,</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:101606:36"/>
and that all thoſe of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> ought to unite together, for the relief of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in the preſent War, between them and the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King.</hi> If you can prove all theſe things to me, I aſſure you, I ſhall ſubmit to your Reaſons. And I ſhall more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over give my thanks, for your deliverance of me, out of the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, in which I have hitherto continu'd, and for the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I ſhall receive from your documents. This I do sincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you, as alſo, that, howe'ere it may happen, I ſhall ever be,</p>
