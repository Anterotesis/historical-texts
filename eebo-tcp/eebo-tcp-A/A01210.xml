            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>e of them, that they would grant this
unto me, that as the thing was done out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
ſo the ſame to have happened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
in the heart of Adam, that there hee
was tempted by the ſeed of the Serpent to
have the guiding of his owne will and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
not to be ſo void of knowledge and
action, as to be ſubordinate unto God. That
I ſhould ſo thinke, two reaſons or cauſes doe
eſpecially move mee.</p>
            <p>The 1. is, that the <hi>Seed of the Woman</hi>
was to breake the head of the ſeed of the
Serpent; but as a naturall and living Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
whoſe head was broken, of that Seed
we doe not reade of any: but as even
then the Seed of the woman was ſpiritually
in the heart of Adam, ſo in the ſame manner
was the ſeed of the Serpent, for man at the
firſt was created good, not of God but of
nothing, and for that cauſe doth he turne
himſelfe alwayes from God, and bend
downewards to his owne nothing and
vanity againe; which nothing I with the
auncient Fathers, but eſpecially <hi>Taulerus,</hi>
doe judge to be ſinne, Satan, death, &amp; hell;
and this perhaps was that devill, inhabiting
in Adam, as alſo in <hi>Lucifer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other reaſon is this, which the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2767:5"/>
doth teſtifie of the Citie of God and
the Heavenly Ieruſalem, that Paradiſe to
be in us: but God alone and his omnipotent
Word is our Paradiſe, the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> and
the Temple wherein we inhabit, walk, ſerve,
pray, &amp;c. as wee are on the other part the
Temple of God and his Paradiſe. In like
man<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>er the <hi>Beaſt</hi> (which even now the whole
world both great and ſmall) doe worſhipp
in their hearts, of which the ſcriptures make
mention in the Apocalips, as alſo the Tree
of knowledge of Good and Evil is in us, for
the exterior world, &amp; whatſoever outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is to be ſeene or is done, is onely an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and a certaine ſignifying figure of the
true and interior nature: and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
true in all thoſe things which are ſeen
with the eye, that is ſubſtantiall; for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth
that the forme of this World periſh,
becauſe it is nothing elſe but an imaginary
world, and a figure of the right true eternal
and by it ſelfe the conſtant world; therfore
it is expedient that all theſe things in their
courſe be done over againe, which through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the Bible are related outwardly and
ſignificantly to have beene done, and yet to
this day after their manner, the Hiſtorie of
the Bible, <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and the Prophets, are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2767:6"/>
and truely of force, but all things
are brought into the truth by Chriſt, and it
it is expedient, that all the prophecies, which
have been from the beginning of the world,
which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of
his Saints, be againe reiterated: Therefore
that Tree was nothing elſe then the nature,
will, knowledge, and life of Adam, whereof
he ought not to eat. That is not to attribute
any part of it to himſelfe: But freely and
willingly ſubmitt himſelfe to God; and
know nothing but what God would know
in him; doe nothing but what God would
doe in him; ſpeake nothing but what God
would ſpeake in him, &amp;c. Whereby with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any impediment God might exerciſe
his Kingdome, will, nature, and power in
him, that being void of will, wiſdome, and
knowledge, he might have nothing of his
owne, or arrogate any thing to himſelf, this
God would, this was pleaſing to him, and
thus he commaunded. To this opinion the
<hi>German Divinity</hi> aſcents: <hi>Theologia Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manica,
3470. cap.</hi> Which ſaith that this tree
is nothing elſe but our owne will &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
of which alone in the Earthly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe
of the world of our hearts, we are not
to eate, but acount it is forbidden, unleſſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2767:6"/>
we deſire to dye, or eate death from it. And
now when Adam was fallen, and had eaten
of this tree, then was it planted in his heart,
&amp; the ſame was derived into all his boughts
and fruit, ſo that the ſame caſe, word, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
and interdict, is common to all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
we all have eaten death, vvhoſoever
are in Adam, and this uncorrected poyſon
have vve received from the Serpent, being
<hi>evill Egges of an evill Bird.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence may every man eaſily perceive,
hovv each man is the greateſt enemy to
himſelfe, and vvhat hee ought to eſteeme of
himſelfe, his vvill and underſtanding, vviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and knowledge, ſince it is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
ſeede, wiſdome, knowledge and head
of the Serpent, which by Chriſt is to bee
broken in our hearts: it behoveth that all
things (which Circumciſion in the old, and
Baptiſme in the new Covenant doth ſignify)
which are hereditary and naturall from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
ſhould dye in us: that we ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to unlearne, and put of all things, as
if they were death and the devill; that is
our will, wiſdome, and righteouſneſſe, &amp;c.
with which as with figleaves Adam ſtrove
to cover himſelfe: for this is ſinne, and the
ſtinge of ſinne and death, that is to eate of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2767:7"/>
this forbidden Tree, and to arrogate any
thing to a mans ſelfe, as his will, nature,
and underſtanding, or himſelfe; But alas,
alas who knowes this, or beleeves this, who
abandons or is weary of his owne will, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
or knowledge, when will men
give a farewell to them: Give a <hi>Farewll</hi>
ſay J, why every one delights himſelfe in
his own imaginations, &amp; ſweetly ſlumbring
recreats his ſoule in his own wiſdom, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
workes, &amp;c. the Tree is fayre to the
eye, and pleaſant to the taſt: Here all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
as Adam himſelfe doe taſte death;
But yet no man knowes, no man thinkes of
this, but every man judgeth it to be right,
and the fleſh eſteemeth it to be the Tree of
Life. That is to follow its owne pleaſure
and opinion of Good, which is falſe: To
know much, to finde out much, to learne
many ſciences, and finally to become a God;
Neither doe any conſider, that this was
Adams eſtate and morſell, that bitter morſel
of death.</p>
            <p>How doe we ſpeake and talke of Adams
miſery, and yet not marke that the ſame is
freſh in us; We can talke of his eating, and
wonderfully deteſt it, when notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we doe the ſame that he did.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:2767:7"/>
O man, who art thou that thus prepareſt a
ſtaffe for thine owne ſhoulders, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceſt
a Sentence againſt thy ſelfe, while
thou condemneſt thy Father Adam, and
yet conſidereſt not that thou thy ſelfe art
enſnared in his Nett.</p>
            <p>Here propound and conſider what our

in which wee ſo inſolently boaſt our ſelves,
yea and by which we imagine and ſuppoſe
that we can come unto God, when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

a Dominion over his pots,</hi> that none of them

ſince they were not their owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers;
the ſame is our condition: God alone
is called the God of underſtanding, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
wiſdome, &amp;c. wherefore hee alone
will know all things in us, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
nothing but himſelfe; if therefore
any man will taſte of the Forbidden Fruit,
and ſo know himſelfe, be made a God, be of

himſelfe, ſtand upon his owne bottome, and

together with <hi>Lucifer,</hi> he fall into the hell of
death, and like the Dragon be caſt downe
from Heaven, becauſe the Fruit of that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden

would know onely himſelfe in us, and
for that cauſe would have one to know no
other ſcience, eſteeming this only neceſſary
to life: and will teach the ſame to us, it ſo
be we will obediently attend him: That is
know onely God, praiſe him, pray to, and
heare him, which things I ſay he himſelfe
would worke in the obedient: For this

ſhall the <hi>Fall of Adam</hi> be repaired &amp;

            <p>Therefore the true and onely uſe of all
things, knowne alone to the regenerate and
new man is this: That I be altogether free
from all things, and alone ſubiect to God:
and being void of name, will, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
&amp;c, remaine nothing in my ſelfe, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
vindicate, deliver, or claime any thing to my
ſelfe (becauſe whatſoever I have, am, know,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2767:12"/>
doe, &amp;c. all are of God,) no more then the
Cow doth for her milke, the Tree for it
fruit, the Bird for its long; but wholy refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all things to God, and have know, doe
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ove, and be nothing but in him; Thus the
redeemed, free, and perfect Chriſtians, have,
know, doe, &amp;c. all things they poſſeſſe, wife,
children, life, knowledge, wiſdome, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
&amp;c. yea and themſelves altogether
freely in the Lord: neither doe they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
any thing to themſelves; even as if
they were nothing, had nothing, knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
for they know that God it is, who is,
hath, knowes, and doth all thoſe things
which they are, know, or doe; ſo the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
hath his wife in the Lord, that is doth
not challenge her to himſelfe as his owne,
but freely deſigneth her to God, whoſe ſhe
is, and from whom ſhe is lent unto him,
whom he is willing to reſtore whenſoever it
ſhal pleaſe God to requir her, &amp; as he never
challengeth her to himſelfe as his owne,
even ſo he ever enjoyes her in God, and in,
and for God, loves her; This <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>David</hi>
calls it, to ſing, rejoyce, marie, &amp; have in the
Lord: that is to reduce all things unto God,
in him, know, love, have, bee, doe all things,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2767:13"/>
neither detract any thing from God as my
proper owne and right.</p>
            <p>And whoſoever have not thus their
knowledge, Wife, Children, and themſelves
in the Lord, they offend in this: becauſe
they love them, it being a carnall Love out
of God; And ſo farre are <hi>all things unclean
to the unclean,</hi> that even his prayers are ſin
unto him, yea his praiſes of God, Faſts, Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Supplications, God deſpiſeth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Prophet: And although hee be
bountifull to the poore, yet he doth it in
vaine. Breefly, what he doth, he doth it in
vaine, it is not pleaſing but diſpleaſing unto
God: Whether hee love or hate his Wife,
Children, and Neighbours, whether hee
chyde or pray, all things are uncleane unto
him, Wife, Children, Feilds, Lands, Money,
povertie, riches, fame, infamy, life, deathknowledge,
learning, yea God himſelfe.
And laſtly, he is unfitt for any thing that is
good. By himſelfe, he is evill, ſinfull, and
nothing. And what ſhew of goodneſſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is in him, it is ſtained by an hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
eye and affection; Therefore its no
matter what he hath, knoweth, or doth, hee
is a Veſſell of no price, an evill Tree; unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2767:13"/>
for any good worke, ſince both
his mind and conſcience is depraved.</p>
            <p>Therfore before al things it is neceſſary,
that with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> they be <hi>born again,</hi>
that al things with them may bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n new
unto them, the fleſh muſt be changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſpirit, &amp; ſo ceaſe to be fleſh. For it
is ſo impure and every way deſirous of
its owne gaine, and ſo infected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
with the poyſon of ſinne, that it
draweth all things to it ſelfe, ſeeketh it
ſelfe in all things, and arrogateth that to
it ſelfe as its owne, which it knoweth, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
or doth, and hath all things under a
falſe pretence, &amp; out of a love to it ſelfe.
Neither doth it love any thing but what
is pleaſant and profitable for it ſelfe. But
a Chriſtian loveth an unprofitable, ſicke,
and loathſome Wife for God, and hath
her not for his pleaſure or profit only, but
for Gods will &amp; pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The naturall and fleſhly man doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but out of a love to himſelfe, and
whatſoever he doth, he hath an eye and
reflecteth upon himſelfe, and in what he
ſees, he can finde to delite himſelfe in, he
is willing to meddle with that.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:2767:14"/>
Hence it is that the houſe of ſorrow,
poverty, baniſhment, troubles, ſickneſſes
and reprehenſions, and whatſoever hee
ſees harſh unto him, he hates no leſſe
then the Devill doth the croſſe of Chriſt
Jeſus; But whatſoever is excellent, great,
pleaſant, bewtifull, &amp;c. to this he cleaves
as faſt as the clay to the wheele; Whereby
he may enjoy what he ſaw and deſired in
them.</p>
            <p>Breefly, he doth nothing but out of a
love to himſelfe, and in what he doth hee
challengeth the chiefe part to himſelfe;
I ſay, that in all his actions both with God
and Man, he reſpects nothing but his
owne profitt and pleaſure, which if he be
deprived off, he looſeth his cheerfulneſſe
and alacrity of ſpirit, and becoms ſorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
&amp; deſiſts to worke any further, what
therefore can be done by ſuch a man as
this but what is uncleane.</p>
            <p>But the regenerate man being borne
of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth quite contrary in all his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
he is deſirous of the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitt,
being altogether ſo affected and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
as God his Father; He doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but moſt freely ſubiected unto
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2767:14"/>
God, ſuffieth him to doe and care for
all things in him; ſo that it followes that
in this man is the meere nature &amp; work
of God; and he or rather God in him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paires
to the humble poore, ſicke, and to
to thoſe that are in the houſe of ſorrow,
to help and comfort them: by whatſoever
God hath either given him, or doth work
in him as his ſubſtance, milke, and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and in all thoſe things he lookes
upon no other thing but only God; who
rather in him only lookes upon himſelfe;
Neither is it the Man, but God in the
Man, who communicateth to other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities,
loves, prayes, heares, worſhipps,
honours, wills, and poſſeſſeth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Adam would know, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
labours for much knowledge, and ſo
<hi>Eates of the forbidden Fruit,</hi> that he may
live and become a great one, <hi>even God;</hi>
and for this only end the whole World
now a dayes applies it ſelfe to all ſtudies;
becauſe it deſires not to dye in obſcuritie
and oblivion, but to live and floriſh, not
in the lower degrees of eſtimation, but
in the chiefeſt ſeate of reputation and
honour, and with all to know all things
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2767:15"/>
that poſſible it can, that ſo it may be
made famous, and thereby be glorified
and delighted therein; wherefore every
day he works more and more to encreaſe
his knowledge, by which he may be more
and more emminent, greater, and more
like unto God; that if it were poſſible to
know more then God, that with <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi>
be might be equall with him; But
that this ambition was the fall of <hi>Lucifer</hi>
no man will conſider; but every man in
thoſe proſecutions, diſputations and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
for knowledg ſeeketh for life, when
indeed there is in them nothing but bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
death; which both in Lucifer, as alſo
in Adam moſt manifeſtly doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
            <p>Truely it is a wonder that of this <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
Tree of Death;</hi> every man ſhould
be ſo much deſirous to eate; Gods will is
that we know nothing, but what he will
know, write, and teach in us; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
void of all knowledge, prudence &amp;
wiſdome in our ſelves, wee become
fooles, wee remaine under him as fooles
and babes; but we buſie our ſelves about
the obtaining of many thouſands of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2767:15"/>
Sciences, and treaſure them up unto
our ſelves, as if in them our life conſiſted,
that like to God wee are ignorant of
nothing, and all fleſh deſireth rather to
be like unto God then to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, Gods will it is,
that before this bee, we as Chriſt was, be
deprived of every thing that is our own,
and be wholy ſubiect unto him: Have,
know, doe, love, bee nothing, but what
God hath, knowes, doth, loveth, is in us;
For by this privation and denyall, will
God draw us unto himſelfe, make us
like God, and teach all men wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in him, and not out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Therefore the knowledge of Chriſt
in Men is quite contrary unto this;
For hee hath knowne nothing, doth,
or wills to know nothing, but onely
God, this is his rejoycing, for this
only cauſe doth hee learne ſciences, or
rather doth God in him; And to
this with all his endeavoure and
ſtrength doth hee apply himſelfe: that
as in Adam hee was made ſomething,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2767:16"/>
even ſo in Chriſt and with Chriſt he may
be brought to nothing againe; and all his
knowledge and ſciences, even as it were
fooliſhnes &amp; deadly poyſon, he may vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
up againe, &amp; eſteem as nothing; that
he may wipe out of the tables of his heart
all human arrogancie, having action,
knowledge and ſcience: to the end that
nothing may remaine there, but only that
which God teacheth and by his owne
finger writeth.</p>
            <p>Breefly, a true Chriſtian is a <hi>certaine
bare naked thing, who with Socrates knowes
nothing but this, that he knowes nothing;
In theſe bleſsed and unknowing fooles, God
will know all things,</hi> if ſo it be, man know
how to empty himſelfe, and to caſt away
the baſenes of his old ragges; But the
fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for this onely cauſe doth learne that
it may be ſomething, or rather be all
things, know, have, and doe all things;
wheras the ſpiritual man learnes only for
this cauſe, that befor God he maj be made
nothing to himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; all other creatures
whatſoever, that thereby God may be all
things in him: know, have, doe, love, and
live in him; this is behoovefull to bee
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2767:16"/>
knowne; this is the true uſe of all things,
and for this only end ought we to labour
to know any thing.</p>
            <p>But every <hi>fleſhly minded man,</hi> who
belongs to the Kingdome of Satan, and
lyes captrivated under his power, thinkes
farre otherwiſe; and defendeth quite
contrary; and therefore is in the ſight of
God fooliſhnes, wickednes, ſinne, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;
From whence it is that he eſteemeth
their wiſdome to be fooliſhnes, their life
to be death, and righteouſneſſe ſinne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
their love no better then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the naturall man hath many
goods, wife, Children, life, riches, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
wiſdom, will, glory, honour, name,
and all things as his owne proper, theſe
he arrogates to himſelfe; to theſe he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
his minde; theſe are pleaſant, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
and deare unto him. But if they
be taken from him, and God exact his
owne, then the theefe appeares, neither
will hee willingly ſend them againe:
he turnes himſelfe, and ſeeketh for all
ſafegards and wayes of eſcape, and means
whereby he may retaine them ſtill, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2767:17"/>
award God the proper owner of them,
who now exacts them of him: the whole
World lyes ſick in this miſery, and thoſe
things that are Gods, are abuſed by men.
And what is common to all, or rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
from God, he labours as
much as in him lyes to make it his
owne, and whenſoever hee is to reſtore
it againe, he doth it very unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>But if it be ſo, that that which he hath
ſtolen from God, is now no longer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
or delitefull unto him, he then
ſurrenders it of his owne accord. And if
it ſo bee, God giveth it againe into his
own boſome, and if it be Gods will, hee
ſhall retaine it longer, yet will he not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it, if he be able to reſiſt it, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion;
if hee have it, it is with great
reſiſtance, ſo that before God he rather
wilfull caſts them away, then retaines
them.</p>
            <p>So is it that the fleſh, which hath all
things out of God, offends in all; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it apprehends al things out of God,
it neceſſarily followes, that although it
have all things, yet hath it nothing. For
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2767:17"/>
what can it have who wanteth God, the
eſſence of all things, and in whom all
things ſubſiſt: Surely they can be no
other then like <hi>Tantilus Sicicus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas.</hi>
Again, what can he want who hath
God, and in him all things, ſince that
God is all in all.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that often times thoſe that
ſeeme to have all things, have truely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and thoſe that have nothing, may
truely be ſaid to have all things.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, the <hi>new Man</hi> hath
nothing but only God, wherein he can
glory; neither doth he any way claime
any thing to himſelfe but God; As for
that which God gives him, he uſeth it
for Gods ſake as his guift and reward,
ready to render it every moment, as it
ſhall pleaſe God to exact it; For he can
willingly reſtore that which he did never
claime as his own, but as God did give,
or rather lend it unto him; ſo that he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
permits God at his pleaſure to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
it from him. Breefly, he uſeth all
things as the traveller doth his Inne, or a
freind money, committed to his cuſtody,
ready every houre to reſtore it back.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:2767:18"/>
This <hi>Paul</hi> tearmes ſo to have any thing
as not to have it, or as though thou hadſt
it not: (which in the eyes of the World is
accounted meere folly) that is that thou
arrogate nothing unto thy ſelfe; offend
in nothing willingly, forſake all things
and with God (as a true wife with her
huſband have all things common) Wife,
Children, Money, life, and all things elſe
he loveth in God, and for God; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
keeps them, loves them, hath them,
and takes them as lent from God; ready
to yeeld them to God againe, whenſoever
he requires them; all the guifts of God,
as Wife, Children, and all other things
he loveth only for the givers ſake, &amp; the
giver above all his guifts; and although
ſome things are contrary to his nature, as
the Croſſe, death, exyle, &amp;c. yet hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
all things alike, and this it is to have,
know, love, and marie in the Lord.</p>
            <p>But the world and worldly minded
men, are carried headlong unto the guifts
of God, as the Sow unto the Dunghill;
Never doe they any whitt reſpect the
giver but the guift; with the which they
committ adultery, challenging by right
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2767:18"/>
unto themſelves; and ſo long as it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pleaſant or profitable unto them, ſo
long they dearely eſteeme it: and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
will not permit God to have it
againe; whatſoever is contrary unto
them therin, that they unwillingly ſuffer,
though it come by divine providence;
unto them; for incontinently they looke
about them which way they may pull
their neckes out of the yoake: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whatſoever they undertake, doe,
ſpeake, &amp;c. that they altogether abuſe;
and in the abuſe it is altogether unfitt
for any good: untill they ceaſe to be that
which they are, and being tranſlated into
Chriſt, become in him new creatures.</p>
            <p>Here it will availe nothing to patch up
with God, for if thou ſtopp one hole, or
fill up one creviſt, an other will preſently
be made; therefore it is neceſſary that
men be borne againe, and altogether for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gett
this Tree of Knowledge of Good &amp;
Evill. And breefly, be quit contrary to
what he is or hath beene. He is fleſh born
of fleſh unto death, and therefore it is
behovefull, that he be made ſpirit borne
of ſpirit unto life. Which before he bee
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2767:19"/>
all things are uncleane unto him; as he
is himſelfe, although all things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are very good; yet are they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
&amp; evill unto him, as all things ſeem
blew to him that lookes upon them
through a blew perſpective: all things
degenerats into the nature of the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,
and therefore all things by Adam are
made vanity, although by themſelves (as
ever they have beene) they are good: For
all foode is ſavory according to the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
&amp; temperature that receivs it: even ſo
is every thing according as he that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth
and hath it, is cleane to the cleane,
uncleane to the uncleane; it cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
but that all things be unjuſtly
done, loved, prayed for, knowne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
which an unjuſt man doth love,
pray for, know, and retaine, as the very
words themſelvs declare; For how can it
be that a wicked man can doe any thing
juſtly, a fooliſh man ſpeak any thing wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
an unclean man doe any thing purely,
a lying man ſpeak any thing truely.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the <hi>naturall man,</hi> as before hath
been ſaid, is <hi>Fleſh,</hi> borne of the fleſh, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
of an uncleane nature, perverſe, &amp;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2767:19"/>
adulterous, the ſervant of Satan ſprong
of the <hi>Seede of the Serpent,</hi> ſeduced and
turned away by his word, and the tree of
knowledge; &amp; ſo infected with poyſon,
that betwixt <hi>Lucifer</hi> and Adam there is
no difference: for as al true Chriſtians are
of Chriſt the ſonnes of God, gods &amp; God
himſelfe, ſo are all the Sonnes of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
the Devill, being of the ſame kinred
&amp; ofſpring, appertaining to the ſame
Kingdome and covenant, as Princes and
Subiects to the ſame, being al in the ſame
eſtate of condemnation, neither is there
any remedy to preve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t this jayle; but that a
man <hi>put of the old man,</hi> ſo as he be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
man, but a new offſpring &amp; creature
born of God. Hence we may eaſily gather
what is the naturall prudence, juſtice &amp;
knowledge of man, to witt, fooliſhnes, ſin
and enmity unto God; becauſe that all
fleſh is an enimy unto God, freinds unto
Satan, and altogether of the ſame witt,
nature, wil, &amp; birth, &amp; as it were his fleſh
&amp; blood; In ſo much as he is nothing but
an enimy unto God; can perceive nothing
that is divine; would be nothing but with
out God, or rather his own God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:2767:20"/>
Attributing all that is good to himſelfe,
as Adam and Lucifer did, the Father of
the fleſh; theſe are the Fruits of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
Tree.</p>
            <p>But the Chriſtian is borne of God, is a
ſpirit and life, altogether of divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and nothing elſe but the Jmage of
God; or if you wil a viſible and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
God; who being made one with God,
is of the ſame nature: rich in love, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of the common profitt; attributing
nothing to himſelfe; like to God; free,
ſtrong, void of proprietie, ambition, and
anger.</p>
            <p>Breefly, or in a word, whatſoever can
be ſaid or may be ſaid of God, may in its
kinde be ſaid of the true Chriſtian, ſince
now it is not, he that lives but Chriſt
lives in him: Not now he is any thing,
but God is all things in him: that is,
whatſoever he ſpeakes, teacheth, hath,
wills, &amp;c. and although they unwillingly
carry the old man about them, yet never
doe they live unto him, but alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
earneſtly endevouring themſelves
againſt him, untill they have quit put
him out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:2767:20"/>
Therefore to conclude this chapter,
the true uſe of all things is knowne
only to the ſincere Chriſtians, and the
abuſe to the naturall man: Not yet ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified,
living in himſelfe: who can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
uſe, ſpeake, teach, doe, love, know,
have, or not have any thing truely; But
with all hath a defiled, both conſcience &amp;
minde.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that he is altogether unfitt
for any good work, like a black Collier;
and in all his actions like a ſtage player,
fooliſh, blinde, dumb, deafe, abſcene, and
wicked. In a word, whatſoever evill
man hath, or title can be invented, it's
proper unto him, untill he returne from
the Tree of Knowledge of Good and
Evill; unto the Tree of Life, and eating
thereof, and he be delivered from the
Kingdome of Darkneſſe into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Light: Otherwiſe the fleſh
doth alwayes retaine its proper nature,
and hath in all things a falſe and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cauſe and end, for which it doth every
thing that it doth. In a word, he alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
aimes at himſelfe, yea under a
pretence of God; although he thinke
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2767:21"/>
himſelfe to know, love, and deſire God
only for God, without any reſpect had
to himſelfe. No man hath yet truely
learned to know himſelfe, the fleſh
being ſo cunning and craftie to excuſe it
ſelfe, no man knowes whether or no hee
ſinnes in all his workes, ſo unſearchable
is the craftines of the heart; yea no man
truely underſtands, that in all his works,
as in his loving, doing, ſpeaking, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
praying, giving, willing, having,
poſſeſſing, &amp;c. he mortally ſinnes, untill
he be redeemed and pulled out of the
dregs of Adam, &amp; tranſlated into Chriſt,
he become a new Creature; Of which

As if it ſo were, that that nothing of
theirs were ſomething in it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>This is ſinne, this is that devill in all
our hearts, which ſtirreth up all ſinne in
us: For as ſoone as Adam by the inſtinct
of the Serpent fell away from God, and
returned unto his nothing again, he was
indeed made nothing: which thing Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
who before had fallen into his nothing,
did ſpinne and weave into the heart of
Adam, by the externall obiect of the tree;
and he made the Fruit of the Tree ſo
pleaſant to behould, that no ſooner they
beheld it, but they were inflamed with a
deſire to eate of that Fruit; For which
cauſe it is written <hi>(Ier. 9.)</hi> that death en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in by the windowes, that is by the
ſight of the eyes.</p>
            <p>And this moved the Schoolemen to
define ſinne to be nothing, that is, no
Creature of God: Neither that death
which it produced: both which came
into the world by the malice of Satan;
&amp; for the ſame cauſe ſinne brought man
back againe into his firſt nothing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Devill and Adam are run out of
the ſight of God; He not acknowledging
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2767:24"/>
them for his owne: neither having any
commerce or ſocietie with them: So
long as they doe not acknowledge their
vanity; therfore ſince man by ſin is made
nothing before God; and yet will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
himſelfe to be nothing, but
even then eſteeme himſelfe to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
it is neceſſary that ſo long he be
expelled out of the preſence of God, till
he be made nothing in his owne heart:
then doth God love his hand, and creates
him againe of nothing: For God knows
not how to create any thing of ſomthing,
but of nothing, for that is his nature: He
that yet is not nothing, hee cannot hope
that he ſhall be ſomething; wherfore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
thy ſelfe to Godward quietly, like
a liveleſſe trunke, as thou didſt in thy
creation: Suffer God to doe; Faſt, Feaſt,
and Reſt, and doe thou nothing at all;
leaſt it happen that thou be taken with a
deſire of the forbidden tree, or any other
thing; or eſteeme thy ſelfe to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

yet doth it not ceaſe to curſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne

is not Evill, but to doe Evill. If Adam
had not knowne good in himſelfe, God
had beene alone good in him, and he had
not arrogated any thing to himſelfe, but
had beene as free from pride therein, as a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2767:25"/>
bird is in her ſong, a horſe in his ſtrength,
a Cow in her milke, and a Tree in its
fruit; but aſſoone as he knew good, and
conſidered it what it was; as a bewtifull
woman doth her bewtie, he arrogated it
to himſelfe, and therein became a theefe
unto God.</p>
            <p>This God foreknew, and therefore
was unwilling that Adam ſhould know
good, that ſo he might walke in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie,
and be ignorant both of Good
and Evill: For this cauſe God ſaid unto
him, thou ſhalt not eate of it, as if he had
ſaid beware, leaſt thou thy ſelfe deſire to
know what is Good or Evill; but ſuffer
me to be all things, and be thou quiet in
all things, that that good which I am, and
deſire to worke alone, I may worke it in
thee, to my owne praiſe in thee, according
as I doe it in the reſt of the Creatures;
And thus hee was forbidden to know
Evill, for God knew, that aſſoone as
Adam had ſmelt what Evill was, it being
of its owne nature, like to him nothing,
would be pleaſing to him, and ſo it
would come to paſſe that he would deſire
and affect the ſame.</p>

            <p>Againe, the good which God doth in

contendeth that he hath done it himſelfe
being deceived with a preſumptious
opinion of his owne power and ſtrength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
this being the perverſe eſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into which Adam did fall willingly;
therfore after that Adam was fallen into
this perverſe wiſdome, by eating of the
forbidden Fruit, and his own arrogancie,
he was ſo depraved, that whatſoever hee
thinkes, ſpeakes, or doth, is diſpleaſing
unto God; and we all in him have eaten
death, and fallen into the ſame eſtate and
condition; but after we are raiſed from
death, and redeemed from it againe, by
means of Chriſt, there is the ſame reaſon
that the Tree of knowledge of Good &amp;
Evill, ſhould be alſo forbidden us, leaſt
afterward wee fall into the ſame eſtate
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2767:26"/>
againe: wherefore the next way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
unto God is this: that now Adam
with all his Children abſtaine from this
tree, that is, deny it, vomitt up the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
Fruit,</hi> and repent himſelfe of his
wit, as if it were fooliſhnes.</p>
            <p>But when we eate of the Forbidden
Fruit or Tree, God forgives us, but upon
this condition, that for ever afterward
we faſt, and alwayes repent our ſelves of
our firſt eating.</p>
            <p>This tree is planted in every one of
our hearts, &amp; is nothing elſe but our own
witt, reaſon, fleſh, knowledge, and will, to
which as long as we adhere, and are not
made fooliſh in our ſelves, and as little
Children, we can have no pardon from
God; wherefore we muſt either abſtaine
from this wiſdome, and become little
Children againe, or elſe want God; and
that prohibition of God, eate not of the
tree: if thou doe thou ſhalt dye; is the
ſame with that ſaying of Chriſt, except
ye renounce your ſelves, and hate your
owne life, ye cannot enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God; For what was ſpoken
unto Adam, the ſame alſo was ſaid unto
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2767:27"/>
us; neither is our eſtate to be amended
any other wayes then that of <hi>Adams;</hi>
the hearts of all are like to a veſſel which
ſmels of that matter and meate which
<hi>Adam</hi> did firſt power into it.</p>
            <p>Therefore as Adam declined from
God and inclined towards himſelfe, and
made himſelfe as it were a wiſe deaſter,
and admired himſelfe like a little God,
the ſame is alſo freſh in every carnall
heart.</p>
            <p>Now therfor, we muſt labour as it were
to goe backward, and that inbred witt of
Adams is to be rejected &amp; eſteemed of us
no otherwiſe then fooliſhnes.</p>
            <p>Here many things are to be unlearned,
and this we are to learne &amp; know, that
all our conceit &amp; opinion of wit is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhnes,
and that which ſeperates us from
God, and hinders us ſo that we cannot
attaine the true wiſdome indeed; and we
muſt labour to be freed from the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of our ſelves. And to this worke we
ſhould all apply our ſelves; to wit, quietly
to reſt our ſelves, not in knowledge, but
in God known; and ſo affect knowledge
only as an Index, which only ſhews and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2767:27"/>
paints out God unto us, and is of God;
That is the Fruit of the Tree of Life,
and not of the Tree of Knowledge of
Good &amp; Evil; to wit, that we permit God
to be, know, love, &amp; have all things in us,
ſo that he ſpeake, worke, know, and love
in us nothing but himſelfe, when, where,
and wherefore he will.</p>

have, teach, be; and will nothing at al, &amp;c.
He (I ſay) was offended at this.</p>
            <p>But if the matter be brought unto the
light of truth, we ſhall finde that all this
happened becauſe of us: even as a Father
forbids and detaines a Sword from his
Son, knowing that if he had it, he would
hurt himſelfe upon it, or otherwiſe abuſe
it; In the ſame manner God denyed
unto Adam, and alſo unto us, that Tree
of Knowledge, for our profit and good;
Neither did hee envy us therein, but
only did it to prevent the future evill,
into which he foreſaw we ſhould fall;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2767:28"/>
For he knew that aſſoone as Adam, like
God ſhould know Good and Evill, hee
would challenge the ſame to himſelfe, &amp;
deſire to be his owne God; otherwiſe
God had not cared though Adam had
eaten of that tree for ſatiety. For aſſoone
as Adam had eaten of it, there followed
thereupon ſelfelove, and arrogating all
things to himſelfe, praiſe, and all other
vices.</p>
            <p>So God in all his commandements
hath reſpect not ſo much to himſelfe as
to us and our ſalvation, which not he but
we enjoy: as <hi>Iob</hi> himſelfe doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
confeſſe, that God is neither hurt
by our ſinns, nor profited by our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
but ſtill remaineth an eternall,
perfect, and impaſſible God, to whom
nothing can be added or any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted;
though we try, yet can we not
make a Heaven, neither put the Sunne
out of them; nor dry up a Fountaine;
but all theſe things remaine in the ſame
eſtate and condition wherein God hath
placed them: He that aſſumes to throw
a ſtone againſt Heaven, it will fall upon
his owne head,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:2767:28"/>
Therefore we can make God neither
richer nor poorer, greater nor leſſer, no
he is no way advantaged by us, though
we all adhere unto him; only he hath a
care on us to helpe us; we never deſerve
to be what we are, therefore we ought to
attribute the cauſe of all our good to
him only, and give him the glory: he hath
an open hand more ready to give then
we are to receive; rich to all thoſe that
call upon him; Neither doth he deſire
any thing at our hands but only this: that
we quietly receive of him that which he
is willingly pleaſed to give, for he that
with quietnes doth not receive, can have
no h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pe that he ſhall receive; all our witt
we ought only to imploy to this end, to
the denying of our ſelves.</p>
            <p>This ſhould make us nothing, children,
Fooles, and proſtrate low at the feete of
God.</p>
            <p>And to the effecting of this denying
of our ſelves, all our knowledge ought
to be directed; but that knowledge only
which proceeds from God, can effect it;
it can make a man nothing, a Child, a
Foole, and caſts him downe at the feete
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2767:29"/>
of God; But that knowledge that puffs
up a Man, making him great and wiſe in
his owne conceit, ſuch being the wiſdom
of the World, comes not from God, but
is rather the Serpents Seed &amp; forbidden
fruit. Now every one that <hi>eateth of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
Tree,</hi> for no other cauſe eateth hee
thereof, but only that he may obtaine a
great name, honour, titles, and glory, that
he may have preheminence to bee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the light of the World. And by
this meanes he eateth death in ſtead of
life. This the holy Scriptures teſtify
unto us, for whereas we ought to know
and learne nothing, every man learnes to
know and be wiſe in all things.</p>
            <p>Now here ſome man might enquire,
why therefore did God create the Tree,
if he foreknew that both Adam and wee
would eate death thereof, and not rather
hinder our ſinne?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that God at the firſt made us
of earth, and aſſuredly did know that we
would not conſtantly abide in the eſtate
of our creation, and yet he ſuffred Adam
to take his courſe, &amp; make tryall of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
that forced through ſorrow &amp; death
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2767:29"/>
he might haſt to God again; for ſo it was
to be that God would create him againe
out of ſorrow, and make him againe a
new, not as before of nothing, but with
grace of himſelfe; this God foreſaw from
all eternity, and therefore ſuffred his fal,
and gave way that man ſhould firſt taſt of
the bitternes of death, before that he
would give him the ſweeteneſſe of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life, by which he might know the
better what he hath in God, and what
that life is compared with death, which
before he taſted.</p>
            <p>Beſides it was meete that God ſuffered
the freedome of ſinne, rather then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
it, as well for many other cauſes
as more ſpeciall for this, that otherwiſe
it had beene coaction and force, and not
libertie, and alſo the goodneſſe of God &amp;
his mercie, having no other obiect, could
never have been manifeſted in his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
Therfore it behoved that things
ſhould come thus to paſſe by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, and yeeld without neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or any fault in God; Read <hi>Brentius

            <p>THere is nothing under the Sunne but
it may be ſaid to be twofould, that is
Juſt and wicked, Good and Evill. Now
juſt, and alſo that which is evill and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
may in like manner be ſaid to the
twofould, the one according to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, and the other according to
the eſtimation and opinion of men.</p>
            <p>And now ſeeing God is a ſpirit, and
Men fleſh, contrary to the ſpirit, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
that all their judgements, wills,
knowledges, and actions, be contrary and
repugnant one to the other. Whence it
is, what man calleth good, right, ſweete,
light, life, knowledge, wiſdome, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
&amp;c. God eſteemes that to be evill,
wicked, bitter, darknes, death, fooliſhnes,
and ſinne, according as the Scriptures
teſtify of God and of the World.</p>
            <p>Therefore there is nothing in the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2767:30"/>
world but it may be called good or evil,
according as the judgement of men are
diſpoſed, to whom it is propoſed. What
God is unto the world, the ſame is the
Devill unto God; and ſo on the contrary;
So that nothing can be called Evill, but
all things are in their order right and
good, and evill and wicked, according
as the Touchſtone is, by which they are
examined.</p>
            <p>If I ſay, that the Word of God is falſe,
fooliſhnes and Hereſie, the ſame is true
in the judgement and opinion of the
world; and thus all things are twofould,
either good or evill; &amp; good is twofould,
as alſo evill: the one truely good or
evill in the ſight of God, the other appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
good or evill in the ſight of Men
or their opinion; ſo that there is a two-fould
faſting, praying, willing, &amp;c. to
witt, one that is really good in the ſight
of God, ſo as is God himſelfe, the author
and teacher of all goodneſſe; the other
in the ſight of the World good, but
in truth evill and wicked; for what ſeems
holy in the opinion of Men, is prophane
in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:2767:31"/>
So there is a twofould knowledge and
witt, the one divine of the Tree of Life,
the other humane of the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Good and Evill. Humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is a <hi>Fruit of the Forbidden Tree,</hi>
and the roote thereof is the Seede of the
Serpent, and ſo is mortall.</p>
            <p>Theſe are all the arts which Naturall
Men have found out, if no: without
God, yet ſurely not in God.</p>
            <p>Breefly, all witt and arts, which God
himſelfe doth not plant in the hearts of
Men, by the power of his ſpirit and
Word, but acquired and gotten out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
by the induſtry and helpe of men
are death it ſelfe, or rather a deaſter; if
man doe any manner of way, truſt or
hope in them, for they doe make man no
more acceptable to God, or any way
more righteous before him, then doe his
meate, drinke, or cloathes, for all theſe
things are out of man; and a certaine
ſuperſtition and worſhipping of a falſe
God, if thou reſteſt thy ſelfe in them;
thou mayſt ſeem to thy ſelfe to be nearer
unto God, becauſe thou knowes and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
many things, being more
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2767:31"/>
wiſe and accute then ſome ſimple good
man, who cares only to know God; But
in very truth, thou art no better then a
foole, who art ignorant of theſe; For by
how much thou art wiſer then others
hereby, by ſo much thou art worſe; For
ſince it is ſo, that all the knowledge of
this World, and all the righteouſneſſe of
the fleſh is <hi>Deviliſh,</hi> according as <hi>Sainct
James</hi> giveth this and other more oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious

            <p>It followes, that by how much a man
offends and growes higher, and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth

worſe and more <hi>Deviliſh,</hi> ſo that a good
and ſimple man, who cares and deſires
to know nothing but God, if he be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with him in reſpect of him, hee
may ſeeme to be a Saint or God, and one
of thoſe is worth a thouſand of others,
as holy Scriptures doe teſtify, one right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

wicked men.</p>
            <p>The other wiſdome, which in the eyes

This ſpringeth up in man out of the
ſeed of the Woman, and is given and
taught of God alone, being in its owne
nature, ful of love, working divine ſolace
and is called in the holy Scriptures the
Knowledge of God; becauſe it knoweth
nor acknowledgeth nothing but God;
This teacheth and profeſſeth only God
in the hearts of his ſervants; it arrogateth
nothing to it ſelf, but as it meerly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
God; So it renders all it receives, to
him againe; This renewes man, juſtifies
him, enlives him, and makes him like
unto God, but it is to be found in no
mans heart, but only in his who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a farewell to all Earthly pleaſures,
arts, will, and witt, becauſe that ſince it is
ſo that theſe two knowledges are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
one to another, as fire is to water,
it cannot be that they ſhould live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one heart, but the one will expell
the other, as the day the night, and the
night the day; wherfore all fleſhly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
will, and witt, muſt be quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,
and we muſt become little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and Fooles againe, according as
the holy Scriptures teſtify unto us, if we
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2767:32"/>
would have the true knowledge &amp; wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God to dwell in our hearts; For
God requires a free and empty ſoule,
which he would fill with his knowledge
and goodneſſe, and imbrace as a <hi>pure &amp;
unſpotted ſpouſe,</hi> poſſeſſed with no other
love but his: He would be the only Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Family, and cannot endure
Satan in his Kingdome to be neare unto
him, who is altogether light and void of
all darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>Now this wiſdome being humane,
and a Fruit of the forbidden Tree, ſo is
it fleſhly puffing up the poſſeſſor of it, ſo
as it makes him provide ſelfe-loving, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of his owne profitt, bould and
wicked.</p>
            <p>In a word, it makes a man a Lucifer,
and ſo contrary and abominable to God,
that he cannot or will not flow into his
ſoule.</p>
            <p>And indeed nothing ſo much hurts
man as his owne knowledge, witt, and
righteouſnes, &amp;c. which makes the word
of the everliving God to appeare foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhnes,
and God himſelfe, to ſeeme Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:2767:33"/>
Therefore as it hath already beene ſaid
of witt and knowledge, the ſame may
be ſaid of the will of God and man.</p>
            <p>The one cannot endure the other; No
more then the ſpirit can endure the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſh,
life death, fire water; Therefore the
wiſdome of God aymes at the utter
deſtruction of Adams life, nature, will,
and wiſdome, labouring to plucke us
from the duggs of humane wit, by which
we are nouriſhed.</p>
            <p>We muſt therefore learne to forgett,
and unlearne whatſoever Adam knew, or
doth know, wils, loves, &amp;c. and all things
muſt be made a new in Chriſt, this is the
wiſdome of God.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee how farre we are from
this, if a man have but onely a thought
to learne his way preſently, he thinkes it
is well with him, and without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
he doth ſweetly delite himſelfe
in his owne knowledge, art, and will, and
all men will be good Chriſtians, and if
God will, will compoſe whole bookes
and volumes of Chriſt, which they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe nor have knowne; and by this
meanes they doe ſo wearily imploy and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2767:33"/>
vex their minds through Satans motion,
with ſo many queſtions, arts, and idle
diſputations, that ſcarcely can they have
ſo much time as to thinke of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God; Whereas the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God is not learned by prying
into, running over, reading, or hearing
a company of doubtfull queſtions; as
the 1. <hi>Chapt.</hi> of the <hi>German Theologie</hi> &amp;
<hi>Taulerus</hi> in many places elegantly doth
teach; but by patient and obedient remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
hearkening and attending to that
which God doth work in us; For he that
would be divinely wiſe, and learne the
knowledge of God, its needfull that hee
heare and learn the ſame from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
he having detained it to himſelfe, ſo
that it can by no meanes be taught of
man; For as humane arts and ſciences
proceede from men, and is their worke;
ſo divine ſcience is from God, and is the
worke of his onely word.</p>
            <p>For as <hi>Iohn Stapitius</hi> ſaith in a little
booke of the love of God: that <hi>thoſe
things that cannot be knowne but by ſence
and experience, neither can they be taught
by, or learned from others.</hi> As for Example:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:2767:34"/>
No man can teach another to ſee,
heare, taſt, and touch; in like manner, and
much leſſe can any man teach another, to
beleeve, love, hope, repent, ſo that divine
truth and Theologie may rather be ſaid
to be experience then Arts: no man can
learne of himſelf the knowledge of God,
love of God, Faith, and ſuch like, becauſe
the naturall man cannot perceive things
divine; nay the Letter of the Scriptures
is not able to doe this: it doth not begett
in man any new nature, it but ſhewes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him what a one he ought to be, and
what he ought to doe; But yet he is, not
ſuch, neither can they make him ſuch,
but rather kill him and ſlay him by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto him his want and miſery.</p>
            <p>Therefore is the poſition true, that
faith &amp; love cannot be conceived in the
heart of man by the Letter of the word;
Otherwiſe it would be that none ſhould
be more faithfull then the Learned; and
yet for the moſt part none are more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
            <p>The letter of the word indeed propoſeth
faith unto us, but cannot write it in our
hearts, that being the worke of the holy
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2767:34"/>
Ghoſt. Therefore that of <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> is
alwayes true: as the <hi>anoynting teacheth
you;</hi> As alſo this, <hi>he that hath heard and
learned of the Father commeth unto me;</hi> For
faith and love commeth into no mans
heart but his who is indued with the
Holy Ghoſt. From whoſe inhabiting in
our hearts, the light of faith and the
knowledge of God deduce their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall;
yea love it ſelfe is not begott or
infuſed in us, but by the holy Ghoſt and
an affect of the love of God towards us.
Wherefore the concluſion is this: that
whom the Holy Ghoſt doth not comfort,
teach and direct, he cannot be comforted,
taught, and directed to the obtaining of
Life.</p>
            <p>Now all men will ſay and confeſſe,
that the world is darkneſſe, mans wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is fooliſhnes: yet if ſo be you will
indulge nothing unto him, but will tax
his will, witt, and deſignes, and ſay they
are all fooliſhnes and darkneſſe, there
is no man will confeſſe it of himſelfe, or
that it is earthly, but every man wil eger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and earneſtly contend, that his witt is
heavenly and divine, eſpecially if it be
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2767:35"/>
any way exerciſed about Religion, when
in very deed it is nothing elſe but the
wiſdome of the fleſh; Yea even that uſe
of the holy Scriptures, which is in the
world, which are wreſted and turned as
every man likes to either hand; neither
can theſe bare words, theſe words of
God, containing in them the knowledge
of God, which are common in every
mans mouth, profitt him any whitt: theſe
muſt be tryed according to the will of
God, and accordingly uſed. Otherwiſe
theſe very words will become a very
ſnare of Satan, and in ſtead of the
word of God the word of Satan to him.
It is not to ſay how well the wiſdome of
the fleſh knowes how to change it ſelfe
into each ſhape, and to flatter it ſelfe with
a forme of the word of God; what cannot
men pretend and undertake, to ſay in the

            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:2767:36"/>
This every man witneſſeth in his own
writings, in which for the moſt part hee
goes on ſecurely, without any doubting
upon the ſeeming approbation of the
Scriptures, to his tenents and opinions;
Not conſidering that this is the very
preſumption of the Turkes and infidels,
with all Sects of falſe Chriſtians, whom
I have knowne every one hath, or would
ſeeme to have the Word of God to be
the foundation of their tenets, as the
Turkes and Jewes thinke at this day,
their faith is grounded upon the Word
of God.</p>
            <p>Hence it comes to paſſe that every
man is deceived in himſelfe, and ſhutt
up to himſelfe, from the knowledge of
himſelfe. This being it which God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw,

which the Scriptures call the <hi>new man,</hi>
or the regenerate that hath the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and wiſdome of God, being taught
it from above; All other things are the
inventions of men, the wiſdome of the
Serpent and <hi>Fruit of the forbidden Tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now we have ſaid before that the
wiſdome of man muſt be forgotten, and
we muſt learne to unlearne it: For as the
fleſh, even ſo the wit of the fleſh, and the
righteouſneſſe thereof is nothing but
fooliſhnes and wickedneſſe in the ſight
of God. And on the contrarie, the wiſdom
of God, and his righteouſneſſe, is fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and wickedneſſe in the ſight of the
world and to the fleſh. So that all arts
and ſciences, being only fleſhly, are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
vanity, filthines, and a <hi>Fruit of the
forbidden Tree,</hi> from the which all men
eate death.</p>
            <p>It is no purpoſe for a man in word
to deny his owne witt, and yet in his
heart to extoll the ſame as the wiſdome
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2767:37"/>
of God; Or, ſecretly to be elevated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
theſe are but the findings out of
the deceived heart of man; outwardly
ſugred over by Satan with faire words;
And whoſoever reſts and depends upon
theſe faire pretences, hee builds upon
hell, which will all damne. For as meate,
cloathes, time, place, perſon, and ſuch like
doe make men neither leſſe or more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable

ſciences doe not make the poſſeſſour
thereof one jot the better in the ſight of
God, if he looke at them, and (as <hi>Adam</hi>

            <p>Therefore the moſt learned and wiſe

            <p>It is neceſſary therefore that thoſe

their witt, will, knowledge, &amp;c. if they
deſire to be indued with <hi>divine knowledg</hi>
from above:</p>
            <p>Therefore even as the naturall man
voluntarily for his owne bellies ſake
doth torture himſelfe day and night, in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2767:37"/>
the finding out of ſo many covetous, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and with God unprofitable arts;
Even ſo it is neceſſary that with the ſame
paine and labour he learne to forgett and
forgoe the ſame, and become a Childe
and Foole againe; For it is a greater
difficulty, and more labour by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
to unlearne his fleſhly wiſdome,
and forſake that good he hath gott al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
then from the beginning to learne
it for his profitt.</p>
            <p>In ſo much that this is true, who once
hath played the Aſſe, will ſcarcely learne
to leave thoſe doultiſh tricks.</p>
            <p>O how difficult is it for them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Fooles, who have grounded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in a preſumption of their owne
witt.</p>
            <p>And yet it is neceſſary that this they
muſt bee, or otherwiſe they ſhall bee
nothing leſſe then that which they deſire
to bee.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſo requiſite is this denyall,
hatred &amp; forgetfulneſſe of himſelfe, that
without it no man can be the diſciple of
Chriſt; that is, no man can be indued with
divine wiſdome, unleſſe in his affections
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2767:38"/>
he hath excluded, and given a farewell &amp;
adewe to his owne.</p>
            <p>Wherefore what wonder is it if the
worldly Man, who is buſied about the
things of this life, be altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the knowledge of God; For ſince
he is not obedient to that wiſdome that
is ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rituall, neither can perceive any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
thing, nor receive the ſpirit of
truth; nor for the wiſdome of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
his owne; For he neither cares to
nouriſh that wiſdome in his heart, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſires to learne it, and becauſe hee
deſires it not, he cannot learne it.</p>
            <p>And now it is requiſite, that as <hi>Sainct
Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>if any man will be wiſe, with
God he must be a foole in the World, that
thereby he may become truely wiſe:</hi> That is;
he muſt ceaſe to thinke, as the world doth
labour to gett a new minde, and deliver
over his ſences &amp; thoughts to be renewd
by God.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of which <hi>Paul</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
annexeth to the ſame: For <hi>the wiſdome
of the World</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is fooliſhnes to
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:2767:38"/>
And in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> hee
calleth it death and enmity to God. And
the ſame <hi>Paul</hi> bids adew to all his owne
witt which he had learned at the feete of
<hi>Gamaliell,</hi> above all his equals and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
all his owne righteouſnes and
knowledge as dung and droſſe, in reſpect
of the excellencie of the knowledge of
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And elſewhere he glories in this that
he had learned to unlearne and forget all
things, and now deſired to know nothing
but Chriſt &amp; him crucified.</p>
            <p>In the ſame manner all the Apoſtles
become little Children again.</p>
            <p>Beſides, <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> and all other
whoſoever, (as Chriſt had ſaid unto them)
unleſſe they be changed, and become as
little Children, they cannot ſee the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God.</p>
            <p>And a little after, Chriſt ſaith, that the
Kingdome of God is of ſuch little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>This is the reaſon why the Scriptures
admoniſh us ſo often to beware of our
owne witt, leaſt we doe any thing that
ſeemes good in our owne eyes; As alſo
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2767:39"/>
that we reſiſt our owne wils, neither that
we ſuffer our ſelvs to be led, and guided
by our owne affections and deſires; and
alſo thoſe that truſt in their owne hearts
&amp; obey their own cogitations, are fooliſh
and wicked, alſo that we ſeeme not wiſe
in our owne conceits, nor magnify our
ſelves but feare, and in feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
worke out our owne ſalvation.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, that we truſt not, nor leane
not to our owne witt; For what is or can
be more wicked then what fleſh and
blood hath found out.</p>
            <p>Truely the fleſh cannot of its owne
nature ſeeke God, and have him in eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
unleſſe it renounce it ſelfe, and
hate its owne life and ſoule; that is all its
owne workes; though it gloze them over
with a pretence of the word, honour and
glory of God; for he cannot be beleeved,
loved, prayed unto, or found but only in
God.</p>
            <p>Therefore all the endeavour, ſtudy,
art, &amp; diligence of is altogether void of
God, and want his grace and ſpirit. For
the word of God requires an humble,
ſubmiſſive trembling, and abiected mind;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2767:39"/>
and a ſoule <hi>poore in ſpirit,</hi> &amp; free from the
bondag of the creatures; &amp; like to tender
wax or clay, plyable in the finger of God
to receive the figure and ſtamp of his
image imprinted upon it.</p>
            <p>To theſe Fooles and Children, ſuch
as feare God, and are ſeperated from the
Dugges of the World, doth he open his
ſecrets, and teach his divine wiſdome &amp;
knowledg; if there be any man that fears
God, to him the Lord will ſhew the way
that he may chooſe, and he walke in the
truth, and his poſterity ſhall inhabit the
Land: He ſayes not to the Learned, and
to the wiſe of the World; as alſo in an
other place; the Lord reveales his ſecrets
to the righteous. For this cauſe Chriſt
the Sonne of God gives thankes to his
Father, that he had hidden his ſecrets
from the prudent and wiſe of the World,
and had revealed unto Children and
Babes; That as wee have already ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of the mouths of ſucking Babes;
Such as were <hi>Moyſes, Ieremias, Amos,</hi>
and the Apoſtles, &amp;c. hee might ſpeake
his praiſe, and extoll his Kingdome and
Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:2767:40"/>
Againe, the rich &amp; proud he ſends away
emptie, and filleth only the hungrie with
good things.</p>
            <p>Now, no Money-maſter nor rich cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Churle is more ſwollen up with the
vaine confidence of his riches; nor any
woman more proud of her bewtie, then
theſe wiſe men pride and boaſt themſelvs
of their wiſdome and knowledge; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
themſelvs that this is the divine
wiſdome and riches of the ſoule, which
neither theevs can ſteale, nor ruſt canker
it, nor moath corrupt it, when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
it is nothing but meere death,
fooliſhnes, and enmity againſt God, and
in a word the knowledg of the forbidden
Tree.</p>
            <p>Therefore the holy Scriptures ſpeake
expreſly of the wiſe of the world, theſe
righteous men, famous for their arts,
priding themſelves in their owne hearts,
who are arrogant and proud, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with nothing leſſe then the ſpirit
of God, who abides onely in <hi>ſimple
Doves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this it appeares that no kinde of
men are farther from the Kingdome of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:2767:40"/>
God, and doe leſſe ſquare and agree
with his word, and more diſagree from
his will, then thoſe who leane and truſt to
their owne wiſdome, knowledge, reaſon,
and will.</p>
            <p>Chriſt in the holy Scriptures ſpeaketh
not ſo much againſt Publicans and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſinners as theſe, who being puft up
with a conceit of their owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
reflect upon themſelves with a ſelfe
pleaſingnes; with theſe can Chriſt leaſt
accord, &amp; unto them doth ſo often threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
woes in the Scripture, and ſayes that
adulterers and Publicans ſhall enter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them into the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>Theſe are thoſe wicked men againſt
whom <hi>David</hi> ſo fervently and often
prayes, and of whom Chriſt hath ſo little
hope, and unto whom he with his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
and <hi>Steuen</hi> give ſo <hi>cutting lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;</hi>
who being men of a wicked mind,
would ſeeme nothing leſſe; But thoſe
things which are written concerning
wicked men, they ignorantly interpret
of others, theſe are ſuch whom the whole
world eſteeme and accounts to be the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2767:41"/>
ſhining lights thereof; Such were <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chodemus</hi>
and <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion;
theſe are thoſe who in <hi>David, Moyſes,
Christs,</hi> and all other times of the church
have beene the <hi>righteous Scribes</hi> &amp; <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes</hi>
with the people; who having a ſhew
of piety, have ſo lived, as that they were
eſteemed Patrons and Examples for
others to imitate; Theſe righteous men
of the world, the Scriptures call wicked;
who want nothing but onely this that
they have wicked minds, void of Faith
and grace; yet they ſo cloake their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe
with a forme of godlines, that
they ſeeme nothing leſſe.</p>
            <p>Neither thinke we that the times of
Chriſt and David were onely peſtered
with theſe kinde of people; But we may
rather conceive, that if thoſe goulden
dayes of theirs were full of ſuch, theſe
Iron ages of ours are much more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</p>
            <p>All times and ages have had their
Diſſemblers, Phariſes and Scribes, theſe
our laſt ages ſince are the worſt, for
ſeldome comes beſt things laſt; For the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2767:41"/>
world as it growes more aged, ſo it
growes more wicked, as both the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and experience doe teſtify.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it is behovefull that every
man endeavour that hee be not of the
number of thoſe men, who wreſting the
word of the Scriptures apply and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
them on others, as moſt men doe;
but in them behould himſelfe as in a
glaſſe, if he deſire to ſee a wicked man,
and one that is a capitall enimy againſt
God; And let him but queſtion with
his owne conſcience, it is as good
as ten thouſand witneſſes, and then
hee ſhall eaſily knowe what a one
hee is.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe the Scriptures are ſo
fyerie againſt theſe Godly Wiſe Men
of the World; Yea denying all good
to them, God in his juſt judgement
ſtriking them with blindneſſe; So that
they erre in their owne way, hiding
himſelfe and his word from their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the Scriptures doe brand
them with a thouſand infamous names;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2767:42"/>
Calling them Wolvs, a generation of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
Beares, Bulls, Sonnes of Beliall,
painted Sepulchres, who are glorious in
ſhew in the ſight of men, and ſet forth
themſelves as righteous before men by
their ſage manners, modeſt habits, and
graue geſtures, when in the ſight of God
they have their hearts full of nothing
but filthines and ſinne. Of whom Chriſt
ſaith, that unleſſe we be more righteous
then they, and exceede them, we ſhall
never enter into the Kingdome of God.
Nevertheleſſe they would not ſeeme to
be what they are indeed, but cover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with a ſhew of Sanctity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it pleaſeth the ſpirit of God to
checke and rebuke them to the diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of their ſecret houlds, and vizards
of their faces; But he who accuſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and denyeth himſelfe before God,
and in his preſence, ſhall obtaine pardon,
as the Scriptures teſtify; which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
thoſe carnall ſpirituall ſpirits, or
men, who place their ſtate with God, and
will be ignorant of nothing, and they are
admoniſhed by God in Solomons Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,
that they would deſiſt from this
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2767:42"/>
their arrogancie; Otherwiſe they ſhall be
ſo oppreſſed with the glorie and Majeſty
of God, that they ſhall not be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
and ſtand; But thoſe who humbly
ſubmitt themſelves, and creepe unto
God, and willingly know nothing, nor
are nothing but what God knowes and
is in them, they in not ſeeking finde that
which the other ſeeking with great
auxiety of minde ſhall never obtaine;
For all things are theirs, and they know
what God is, hath or knowes, becauſe
they in God and God in them inhabits
and dwels:</p>
            <p>Hence it is that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
man ſearcheth all things, yea the
ſecret things of God; which is denyed to
the fooliſh fleſh, according as we may
reade in the Proverbs, and <hi>Eccleſiastes,</hi>
for in counſell of the wicked there is no
health, no word of God, knowledge, or
love.</p>
            <p>To the ſame purpoſe is that ſaying of
<hi>Solomon,</hi> God made man at the firſt
upright, but he found out to himſelfe
many inventions, many difficults, many
labours, with which he doth weary and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2767:43"/>
vex himſelfe; God that is good, ſimple, &amp;
juſt, commandeth him that he ſhould
know nothing but him, and follow and
be obedient to him as all the reſt of the
Creatures; He ſhould (I ſay) be ſo obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to him, as to doe, know, will, love,
omit, and ſpeake nothing but onely what
God doth know, will, love, omitt, and
ſpeake in him, by which as in all other
Creaturs ſo in the heart of man he might
enioy a plenary Kingdome, and ruling
and governing him according to his own
will, neither ſhould man have any title,
claime, power, or priviledge over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Satan ſuggeſtion it was that man
found out ſo many ambuſhes &amp; curious
queſtions, with frivilous difficulties, by
which he is degenerated from that ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
wherein God created him, and
ſubordinated him, being tranſported
with an ambitious deſire, to become a
Lord &amp; God to himſelf; and ſo remained
in the power of his owne will; but
how juſt this is, let man that hath reaſon
judge, that the clay ſhould deſire to know
or be any thing contrary or beſides that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2767:43"/>
which the maker thereof would have it,
know, or be; ſuch ſimilitudes doth not
yet fully expreſſe the matter.</p>
            <p>Therefore it happens deſervedly unto
us, that our wiſdome, knowledge, and
vvill, ſhould bring upon us all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due unto ſinne, and alſo make us
utterly diſquieted, bringing unto us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but torture and vexation, ſince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
and contrary to the will of God we
have deſerved them.</p>
            <p>Hence it neceſſarily followeth, that
ſinne is the puniſhment of it ſelfe, and
Fooles are deſtroyed by their owne wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and knowledge.</p>
            <p>This is that which <hi>Solomon</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimently
complaines off, when he ſayes:
where there is much knowledge, there
is much vexation; And he that increaſeth
learning ſorrowes. And theſe wiſe men
are Fooles, for whoſoever endeavoureth
to be wiſe above meaſure, this man ſhall
endure greiffes and ſorrowes; and by
how much they become more wiſe, by ſo
much they are more diſquieted: For
God will have us to finde reſt in him
onely.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:2767:44"/>
Neither muſt we riſe, come, goe, or doe
any thing before him; For whoſoever
commeth before him is a theefe, and
whoſoever ſpeaketh or doth any thing
of his owne accord, without him, is a
Devill.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is that all men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded,
deceived, and fooled by their own
witt; yea even becauſe they profeſſe
themſelves to be wiſe, therefore they are
fooliſh.</p>
            <p>And as God did the Caldean, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
and wiſe men, ſo he ſuffers thoſe
to be ſeduced by their owne knowledge,
and to be wearied with their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
actions, and arts.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that Chriſt would not have
his diſciples deſire to be eſteemed ſome
bodies, or couett that men ſhould call
them Maſters, Lords, Doctors, or Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,
but onely Miniſters, Brethren, and
witneſſes of him, <hi>Ioh. 15. Ye are my
witneſses.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. VIII. Of the great Deaſter of humane

men doe kiſse their owne hand, and all

invention, and prudence of man.</p>
            <p>Therfore the worſhipping of Deaſters
is nothing but the adoring of the images
of God, not according to his Word as he
doth teach, figure and forme it to us, but
according to our own opinion and ſelfe
conceit.</p>
            <p>Againe, what other thing is ſinne then
our owne will, witt, and counſell, ſowne
unto us with the Seeds of the Serpent.
Conſider the inſtitutions, practice, and
Life of all Mankind, when and how
you will, you ſhall finde it nothing elſe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2767:45"/>
then humane wiſdome; here every man
would be his owne God, guide, governe,
teach move, revenge, defend, excuſe, and
enrich himſelfe; and every man ſets his
owne braine, will, and reaſon in the place
of his God, ſo that ſinne &amp; the fall of
Adam is nothing elſe but the humane
affectation of the art, reaſon, &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the fleſh; and therfore deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is tearmed fooliſhneſſe and enmity,
deadly and Deviliſh.</p>
            <p>All men ought with Chriſt to become
nothing, and with a continuall decreaſe
&amp; depreſſion of ſoule, become aſſes, fools
&amp; children; but now it is quite contrary:
every man labours that he may be wiſe,
great, illuſtrious and mightie; ſo many
arts and ſciences are learned of men, that
they may be great, famous, and excellent
in the eyes of the world; and may obtaine
titles of honour, &amp; names of reſpect.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that yong men are inflamed
with a deſire of glory, &amp; labour not only
to be famous in Schooles, but to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the pulpitt alſo; and for that end
they ſeeke out learned Tutors, who may
make them expert, quick, and acute in all
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2767:45"/>
kind of Literall deceits and exerciſes of
arts. By which it is as cleare as the Sunne
that the whole world is contrary and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to God. Here every man kiſſing his
owne hand and adoring his owne witt,
eſteeming it to be his light &amp; his God;
Even it that was the only ſinne of Adam;
and it from whence other ſinnes came &amp;
have their originall, as <hi>Job</hi> confeſſeth;
<hi>(Job. 33. 31.)</hi> For to admire &amp; worſhip
himſelfe, and to be led by his own will;
In a word, to ſtand on his own bottom, &amp;
to deſire to be ſomething of himſelfe
without God, is that one mortall ſinne,
which is the fountaine of al other; for the
luſts of the fleſh, and the witt thereof is
very dead.</p>
            <p>And man like a Logg, is no better
then dead; but while he doth nothing,
knowes &amp; deſires nothing, but keeping
a holy Sabbath or reſt; dyes wholy unto
himſelfe; and being void of will or
witt, reſignes himſelfe over unto God,
and permits him to know and doe in
him, what, when, and how he will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:2767:46"/>
And now the whole world lyes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with this ſinne; in ſo much that
it doth no other but adore the worke of
its owne hand, that is its owne inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
counſels, comments, and wiſdome.
To this purpoſe all things are directed,
intented, and wreſted; yea the very
Scriptures themſelves, the word of God;
that it may be agreable to our corrupt
reaſon, and not hinder the courſe of our
carnall and fleſhly witt, and knowledge,
but all theſe things muſt bee unlearned
and caſt away if we will ſee God. And
therefore the Scriptures urge ſo often
times, that wee ſhould become Fooles,
little Children, and purge ourſelves with
the Fruit of the Tree of Life, that we
may vomit up that poyſonfull witt and
knowledge of the Forbidden Fruit.</p>

the like; For which cauſe <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it
death, enmity, &amp; fooliſhneſſe unto God;
and <hi>Saint Iames</hi> calls it earthly, humane,
and deviliſh, becauſe theſe three are one;
For whatſoever is humane, is worldly, &amp;
Deviliſh; and whatſoever is Deviliſh, is
Earthly. For the Devill and Man, Adam
and the Serpent, are ſworne Brethren, yea
both one; For the Serpent hath ſo ſhed
his wiſdome, and fained righteouſneſſe
into the heart of Adam, that the Seed of
the Serpent and his word are incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
and made man, ſo that now the
ſame thing may be ſaid of both.</p>
            <p>And even as thoſe that are borne of
God, and in whom the Word of God is
incorporated, are called God, or one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
with God: So all men borne of fleſh
and blood, before they be regenerate &amp;
planted into Chriſt, may be called De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils;
and ſo whatſoever is Earthly, may
be ſaid to be Deviliſh, and whatſoever is
Deviliſh, may be ſaid to be Earthly.</p>
            <p>Againe, what is the Fall of Adam but
only the wiſdome of the Serpent and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2767:47"/>
Fruit of the forbidden Tree? What is
that old Dragon, who aſcends out of hel?
and with his tayle drawes a great part
of the Starres of Heaven after him? But
onely the wiſdome of the Fleſh, which
doth extoll it ſelfe againſt God, and
deſires to become a God unto it ſelfe?</p>
            <p>What are the thoughts of the Fleſh?
What is ſinne? what pride? But the
wiſdome and Fruit of the Forbidden
Tree.</p>
            <p>What are the Decrees of Men? The
workes of reaſon againſt God? Mens

onely the are of the Devill, Eaten of the

            <p>What is all the worſhip of Images
and all falſe Religions? as of Jewes,
Turkes, infidels, and all falſe Chriſtians.
What are all Sacraments, Aſſemblies, and

Men, pleaſant Fruit to his eye, that is,
reaſon which whoſoever eates, he ſhall

No man can fully expreſſe that ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
with which all the corners of the
world and hearts of men are ſtuffed up;
and who is it that doth not adore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and ſayes to his hand, wiſdome,
and reaſon, his art and his knowledge,
thou art my God, in thee I truſt, in thee J
hope.</p>
            <p>Indeed men ſay not this with their
mouth, but ſurely in their lives, workes,
and hearts, they plainly teſtifie as much.</p>
            <p>Hence all men deny that there is a
God, and teſtify the ſame by their works;
For if they thinke there is a God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doe they not reſigne vengeance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him? Wherefore are they ſo doubtfully
diſtracted? Wherefore doe they forge
ſuch wicked deceits, to deceive one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?
Wherefore doe they ſo warre
upon one another (whether with right or
injuſtice it matters not) and contend
together for mine and thine? Why doe
they lye, cogg, and flatter one another?
Wherefore doe they labour night and
day to gett and heape up riches? Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are they ſo forgetfull of the word
of God, and ſo little eſteeme his precepts
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2767:50"/>
and commandements? But that they
thinke God cares not for them, or that he
cannot or will not revenge them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is neceſſary that they helpe and
revenge themſelves; or that they thinke
that while to long to wait and expect the
helpe of God, before that he take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
and puniſhment they themſelves
ſhall be overthrowen; And becauſe they
thinke that nothing but povertie comes
upon them, if they have any commerce
and communion with the truth of God;
therefore it is neceſſary that they helpe
themſelves, and labour for their living,
by lying, cogging, deceiving, and uſury,
and the like; this makes a man rich and
honourable. As for the word of God that
is but a late helpe, and deficient in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie;
it ſtands us in hand, therefore
to adore our ſelves, ſpeake bigge &amp; ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

            <p>But you wil ſay, that the learned ſhall

as in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> and <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> wiſe
men are commended?</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that it is rightly
ſpoken, if it be rightly underſtood, to
wit, of the tree divine &amp; heavenly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which God himſelfe doth worke
&amp; teach in thoſe that are poore in ſpirit;
I ſay, it is underſtood of the wiſdome of
the tree of life; and not of the deadly and
fooliſh wiſdome of the Fleſh, which is
the knowledge of good and evill; and the
Scriptures will have us to acknowledge
our folly, and to be made fooles in our
owne judgement, (and indeed we are ſo,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2767:51"/>
but we would not be accounted ſo) and
forget all things wherby we may become
truely wiſe, and receive the influence of
divine knowledge into our ſoules; For
we are all fooliſh &amp; wicked, and we will
not ſee and perceive it, nor beleeve it;
and therfore God would have us by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
our folly in true ſimplicity, to
give a farewell unto it, &amp; by ſubmitting
our ſelves over unto God, be made truely
wiſe and learned by him.</p>
            <p>Hereupon it is that <hi>Solomon</hi> calls them
fooles, whom <hi>Paul</hi> calls wiſe &amp; prudent;
<hi>Solomon</hi> calls them what they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
in the ſight of God; but <hi>Paul</hi> calls
them what they ſeeme to be in their own
eyes, and in the ſight of men: We muſt
unlearne, and therein ſtrive to be fooles
in that wherin we learne and ſtrive to be
wiſe in; But as it is given us of God, ſo it
can be learned from none but God; and
as the love of God ſhed abroad in our
hearts, begets a mutuall love of him
againe; Even ſo Gods knowing of us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
in us a knowledge of him, as <hi>Paul</hi>
witneſſeth to the <hi>Gal:</hi> after that ye knew

as I am knowne. And alſo 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. He
firſt loved us. Alſo in another place: if
any man love God, he is borne of God.
Out of all theſe places I gather, that God
is never knowne, loved, ſought, or found
of us, untill we be knowne, loved, ſought
and found of God; as Chriſt ſaith to the
Phariſes: the Kingdome of God is in
you; and <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Athenians:</hi> Hee
is not farr off from every one of us; for
in him we live, move, &amp; have our being.
But this is moſt miſerable and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
that thoſe who profeſſe themſelves
to know God, know him not as they
ought; as <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies of the world:
If any man love the world, the love of the
Father is not in him. And againe: if any
man ſeeme to know any thing, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
nothing as he ought.</p>
            <p>VVe ſhould know this, that by nature
we know nothing, but are altogether
blind, dead, and fooliſh in ſpirituall
things; and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s knowledge ſhould make
us nothing, fooliſh and Children in our
owne eyes; But wee deſire to know,
and ſeeme wiſe, whereby it comes to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2767:53"/>
paſſe that we know not how, or for what
end we ought to learne knowledge, for
wiſdome is not given unto us for this
purpoſe, that thereby being puffed with
pride, we extoll our ſelves, and become
ſomething in the eyes of the world, but
on the contrary to make us nothing.
This is the knowledge of God, that
makes us Fooles and Children to our
ſelves and the world: it doth not puffe
us up, making us ſeeme wiſe in our own
opinion; Noe, for that is the knowledge
of the Serpent, both moſt deviliſh and
deadly.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee that the whole world
knowes not what, how, and for what end
they ſhould deſire to know, but alwayes
ſtrives againſt God in their knowledge;
and know not of what things they ought
to be ignorant off, but cheifly are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to know thoſe things they ought to
be ignorant off; and ſo by their owne
art and knowledge make themſelves
Fooles.</p>
            <p>Breefly, that which they doe know and
doe deſire to know, that they ſhould
learne to unknow; and what they reſiſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2767:54"/>
to know that they ſhould learn to know,
otherwiſe God will never acknowledge
them for his owne, becauſe God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
never to acknowledge, crowne
or reward any thing in us, but his owns
guifts and workes, that is never to love
or accept any thing in us but himſelfe:
For he alone is the Light, Life, the way,
and the truth, ſo that whoſoever is not in
him, or he in them, they alwayes wander
in the pathes of errour and ſhadow of
death. Now every man knows what it is
to walk in darknes. The walls of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
were not to be opened before the
Sunne did riſe; even ſo ſhould no
man intend to goe forth before the
Sonne of righteouſneſſe aroſe in his
heart; ſince all things depends upon him,
and bee ſhould be our Teacher and
Example, by whoſe inſtruction we ſhould
learne, and by whoſe Example wee
ſhould walke, as the Scriptures teſtify.</p>
            <p>It is an eaſie thing to ſay, that the
world is in darkneſſe, and uncapable of
the ſpirit of truth: but no man will either
acknowledge or beleeve himſelfe to be
the world, or that the whole world to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2767:54"/>
God is all Fleſhe as the Sonnes of Adam
all were naturall men, with the univerſall
righteouſneſſe, reaſon, and wiſdome
therein; but by the world men thinke
to be underſtood, the Turkes, Gentles, &amp;
Heathens; and I know not what people
of the fartheſt parts of the world, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
ſo much to arts, tongues &amp; Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which they almoſt preferre above
the ſpirit; and if a man doe reade and
have a Bible, they thinke it enough, and
that by which they may eaſily obtaine
the Holy Ghoſt; not conſidering that
either the Holy Ghoſt muſt bee their
guide, and enlighten them in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the word, or otherwiſe it is but
a dead Letter; and is ſo farre from
bringing Life with it, that it mortifies &amp;
kills the Reader: as <hi>Paul</hi> implies, where
he ſayth, the ſpirit quickens and not the
Letter.</p>
            <p>The Iewes in auncient times, and ſo
men in theſe dayes doe boaſt themſelves
of the word of God, &amp; are ſtrongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that out of it they are able to
gather Life to their ſoules; but they are
farre deceived.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:2767:55"/>
Wherefore Chriſt ſayes: In whom
thinke ye to have Life. As for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
his teſtimony of them is this, that
they are them which teſtify of him.</p>
            <p>Therefore all arts and knowledges are
no wayes the cauſe of Life; but the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Life to know him in and with
God; wicked nature hath alwayes a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
end, propoſed to it ſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it deſires to know all things, not
for God but for its owne ſake; therefore
all things are to the fleſh (as it is its ſelf)
vaine and perverſe, if the learning of ſo
many arts had beene neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
God had created and taught them
in the beginning; Neither would bee
have ſuffered that men ſhould ſo long
have wanted that, without which they
were not able to attaine to Life; but
becauſe they were formed out by men,
and ſtill are found out by them, though
no man be any whitt the more unhappie,
if ſo be he never know any thing of them;
Yea hee were more happie if he could
unlearne them, though with greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
then he learned them; you may
by the Tree conjecture what the Fruit
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2767:55"/>
is, what humane arts and ſciences are:
to witt, the Fruit of the forbidden Tree;
How then can they conduce any thing
unto Life, being the only precepts &amp; in,
ventions of men.</p>
            <p>Therefore very well in praiſe of that
word of God doth <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi> call
all arts and actions of men meere igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
fables and fooliſhnes, in his Booke
<hi>de vanitate Scientiarum.</hi> The beginning
and end whereof wee have putt in this
Booke, that wee may not ſeeme alone
with <hi>Ernestinus</hi> to contemne arts and
praiſe folly.</p>
            <p>Wherefore if thou leane unto arts,
pleaſe and boaſt thy ſelfe in them, having
any hope or accounting thy ſelfe any
thing better for them, they will prove
death unto thee, for they doe no more
conduce to thy happines then garments,
time, place, or ſuch like circumſtances:
But as they are the inventions of the
fleſh, ſo doe they produce no other thing
in thee then the workes and Fruits of
the fleſh, to witt, ſelfe-love, pride of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
contempt, diſdaine, ſecurity, &amp; ſuch
like; And this is verified by experience,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2767:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for no men are more perverſe, craftie, &amp;
covetous, then theſe wordly wiſe and
learned men bee, being men drowned in
their owne ſelfe-love, eſteemed of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
worthy to be beloved and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced
of all; full of raſh judgement,
lovers of all pleaſures, and ſo full of all
vices: that the whole world gives cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditt
to no men leſſe, ſpeakes worſe of
no men more: being full of taunting &amp;
reproaching proverbs againſt them; ſuch
as theſe, the better learned, the worſer
mannered, the better Scoller the worſer
Chriſtian. No man ſcapes ſcotfree out of
the clawes of a preiſt. He that wil have an
honeſt houſe, muſt keepe it free from
Preiſts, Apes, &amp; Doves. A monk dare doe
as much as he dare thinke. Theſe &amp; ſuch
like proverbs are common in every mans
mouth; which ariſe from this that they
are ſo ſwollen with the poyſon of the fruit
of the forbidden tree, ſo puft up with the
falſe opinion of their owne wiſdome and
righteouſneſſe, that no rich man is more
inſolent by reaſon of his riches, then theſe
perverſe wiſe men are by reaſon of their
arts &amp; knowledge; So that it is as eaſie to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:2767:56"/>
remove <hi>Cyrus</hi> out of his Kingdome, as
one of theſe wiſe men out of his opinion
and tenent; And truely it cannot be but
by how much a man is more wiſe in the
art of the forbidden tree, by ſo much hee
is more miſerable, as Chriſt witneſſeth
in the goſpell: that the multitude of their
arts and knowledge is an impediment
why they come not into the Kingdome
of God, and publicans and harlots enter
in before them.</p>
            <p>Therfore theſe men are to periſh with
their arts, &amp; to depart empty, and ſo farr
is any of them from leaving his art, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
knowledge, &amp; righteouſneſſe, that
he eſteemeth theſe to be the good and
riches of the ſoule, which neither theevs
can ſteale, nor moathes corrupt, when in
very deed they are nothing but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
of Satan, fruits of the forbidden
tree, and the death of the ſoule; For the
life of the ſoule is the true knowledge of
God, which himſelfe doth work &amp; teach
in us, to wit, the fruit of the Tree of life,
whoſe fruit is that it makes a man gentle,
loving, humble, lowly, meeke, &amp;c. By this
let a man examine himſelfe, with what
witt and righteouſeeſſe hee is endued;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2767:57"/>
For if day by day, he be leſſe in his own
eyes and in the judgement of the world;
if he ſeeme ſtill more fooliſh in himſelfe,
and a Child in his owne thoughts, his
knowledge is divine the Seede of the
VVoman, a Fruit of the Tree of Life;
but if hee finde contrary effects in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
then is all his wiſdome Deviliſh,
the Seede of the Serpent and Fruit of
the Forbidden Tree, and ſo the death of
the ſoule.</p>

            <p>I alſo grant thus much, that this Tree was

therefore he ſhould not eate of this Tree

that he ſhould dye the death, but God
who is Life it ſelfe, would not for ever
be angrie with his Creature, but was
unwilling that man ſhould for ever live
in that miſery, into which he had caſt
himſelfe, and therefore drove him out of
Paradiſe, and afterwards ſhewed him
the way by which he ſhould returne into

live for ever; and then gaurded the Tree
of Life with a <hi>Cherub</hi> and a flamming

have eaten thereof.</p>
            <p>The will and counſell of God was that
it was better that man ſhould dye in the

            <p>Therefore God who cannot nor will

conſider of it.</p>

               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:2767:58"/>
Now doe J think that the ſame alſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened

Evill, is the Seed, Knowledge, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the Serpent: And the tree of
Life, is the Seed of the Woman, and the
wiſdome of God; and theſe two Trees
are, as God and Satan; ſo contrary one to
another, that the one brings Life unto us,
and the other death.</p>
            <p>Therefore he that eates of the one, its

becauſe they are divided by a flying
Cherub and a flaming ſword; which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret,
ſinne and diſobedience, which
ſometimes in the Scriptures is called a

            <p>For hee that eates of the Tree of

hee that is poſſeſſed with a Diabolicall
wiſdome of the Fleſh, he cannot eate
the Tree of Life; that is, he is departed

that proceeds from God: For theſe two
wiſdomes are incompitable, they cannot
bee in one and the ſelfe-ſame heart,
being as contrary one to the other, as

knowledge, hee cannot dye, neither
ſinne; For this Fruit eates the eater
of it, and changeth him into its owne
nature, into Life, as the Scriptures
doe teſtify of thoſe that doe eate the

            <p>For it is one and the ſame thing, to

of the Tree of Life, to beleeve in

would have Ieſus Chriſt to live in us,
and obtaine the direction of the holy
ſpirit; For the death of the one is the
life of the other; the infirmity of the one
is the ſtrength of the other.</p>
            <p>No man can ſerve two Maſters, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it poſſible to unite Adam, God, &amp;
the Devill together.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XII. The praiſe of the Word of God, on
which alone man ought to build, rest, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
and it onely know, if he will remain
unſhaken in adverſity, have his Faith
manifest and approved, and finde quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse
to his Soule.</head>
            <p>INdeed there be many arts profitable
to the body, which God the belly hath
created, and yet doth dayly finde out,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2767:60"/>
which truely bring much profit to the
kitchin; and onely ſerve, worſhip, &amp; obey
their God the belly moſt zealouſly, as it is
expedient they ſhould. But as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
proverbe is, that which is profitable to
the body: doth often hurt the ſoule, and
that which is the bellies and fleſh, as life,
foode, and plentie, is often times the
death of the ſoule, and a meere poyſon
unto it, becauſe the ſpirit is contrary to
the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Hence it comes to paſſe that table or
belly arts, becauſe they be the Fruit, off-ſpring,
and witt of the fleſh, are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vaine, famine, and death unto the
ſoule. And on the contrary, that onely
art, the end whereof, was not for God
bellies advantage; which the whole world
doth ſo much ſleight and litle regard,
that onely true wiſdome and Theologie,
to witt, God and the knowledge of his
Word in him; together with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of him divinely infuſed into our
ſoules, is the ſole art onely neceſſary to
mans ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Therfore the true, heavenly, &amp; divine

eateth hath everlaſting life.</p>
            <p>Furthermore I ſay, this art is the
Foode, Wine, Milke, excellencie, defence
and all whether the profitt, pleaſure or
advancement of Soules; All other arts
being vaine, doubtfull, and the poyſon
of the Soule, hurtfull and deadly to
the Spirit of Man, if hee leane upon
them, reſt in them, glory in them, or
build his happineſſe upon their ſandy
foundation. In a word, they are the fruit
of the Tree of Knowledge of Good &amp;
evill, of which whoſoever eates, as J have
amply proved, hee ſhall dye the
death.</p>
            <p>Therefore I deſire that wee would
not be to righteous nor wiſe in our owne
eyes; As <hi>Solomon (Eccleſ.</hi> 8. as alſo
<hi>Proverbs 3.)</hi> doth faithfully inſtruct
us: that we ſhould eſteeme nothing to
be our wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, or any
other vertue in us, but onely to know
God in and with himſelfe, and love,
praiſe, worſhipp, feare, honour, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
him as wee ought. Which
thing muſt neceſſarily proceede from
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2767:62"/>
God himſelfe, beeing the worke of his
eternall, and in it ſelfe everlaſting and
immutable word, which without ſpokes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
from him proceeds out of his
mouth: that hee ſpeakes in our hearts,
teacheth himſelfe in our ſoules, imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and engraving his Image in us,
thereby enlightning ſo our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that to ſpeake in a word, he ſo
teach, love, know, underſtand, pray unto,
heare, guide, governe and worſhipp
himſelfe in us.</p>
            <p>All other things whatſoever are to
dull, and all the vertue of things are to
baſe, that they ſhould be able to teach
us God, and give us everlaſting felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
or that God by them ſhould give it
unto us.</p>
            <p>God will be himſelfe, teach him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
give, and convay himſelfe into
our hearts: Neither will hee ſuffer
his honour to bee given to any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that by it wee ſhould be ſaved
or ſanctified; but hee that heareth and
learneth it of the Father commeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:2767:63"/>
He will himſelfe be the Maſter of ſpirits;
and ſo a ſpirit ſhall be taught of a ſpirit.
And all thoſe that are divinely inſtructed
of the all-knowing and underſtanding
God, ſhall be ſaid truely to be learned
and wiſe.</p>
            <p>The fleſh hath teachers, who belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the ould covenant, have commerce
with the fleſh. The new covenant, becauſe
it is ſpirit and Life, and in like manner
hath a ſpirituall and new birth of God
to be inſtructed, hath alſo a ſpiritual word
and Maſter to inſtruct it, which is the
word and ſpirit of Life.</p>
            <p>Therefore if any man would know
himſelfe, ſubmitt himſelfe quietly to the
direction, and permitt himſelfe to bee
ſpoken too, ſought and found in him;
He ſurely ſhould be elevated to a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
Light; if any man I ſay doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the inſtruction and Doctrine of the
Father in himſelfe, he verily ſhould finde
God in God and with God. But the
world buſied and accupied in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
paſſeth away in a confuſion, and
not conſidering the hidden and ſecret
treaſure that is cloſed in his heart; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2767:63"/>
ſeekes for this precious Pearle, but
covered all over with the earth of the
Creatures, remaineth in darkneſſe with
the multitude of his arts and ſciences;
weary, ignorant, and void of all true arts
and ſciences; yet doth he in the meane
ſpace learne art after art, further and
further ſearcheth into the my fierie of
knowledge.</p>
            <p>And to uſe the words of <hi>Saint Paul,</hi>
is alwayes learning, and never able to
come to the knowledge of the truth;
but the more he learneth, the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
he is; and to ſuch a madneſſe doth
he come at laſt, through his overmuch
wiſdome, that he quite forgets what to
ſay, bable, determine, beleeve, and what
opinion to hould; and ſo he together with
his fraile foundation and fickle arts,
ſtaggers here and there, ſlides out of one
errour into another, untill hee become
vaine in all his imaginations, and like to
Foxes, caught with all their trickes and
turnings; is thereby miſerably enſnared
in the Netts and ſnares of his owne arts
and ſciences. But the Chriſtian like to
the Catt, hath but one way, knowes but
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2767:64"/>
one art, whereby he is able to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
yea that a cheefe one, viz. his God,
in whom he hath all things, knowes,
loves, and comprehends all things; And
therefore hee ſcapeth, when the Fox
though he know many ſleights, &amp; thoſe
craftie ones indeed; yet often together
with his ſleights, hee falleth into the
power of the Gods and the hands of the
hunter.</p>
            <p>Therefore thou canſt boaſt of nothing,
nor build upon any other thing whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
but onely that ſure foundation and
art, which is God himſelfe, &amp; his holy
word: For all other things forſake man
in adverſitie, except the hope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of God; this is the true preacher
in our hearts, if any man will attend and
hearken to what he ſhall ſpeake in him,
he hath planted in us the Seede of the
woman neere unto the Seede of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
for oppoſition unto the ſame; yea he
hath confirmed his Spirit, finger, word,
and Image in us; His Spirit he hath
cloathed in us with Fleſh, and hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
it captive in the midſt of its eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in the Tabernacle of the Fleſh,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2767:64"/>
that it may prevaile and overcome, and
ſubduing the Fleſh may with it ſelfe
carie it unto God, deify it, engraffe it, &amp;
unite it unto God; For this is the fight
betweene the Fleſh &amp; the Spirit in us, of
which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh off.</p>
            <p>Therefore if any will yeeld himſelfe
over in the midſt of his enimies to the
holy Spirit, &amp; glory in God, as in a moſt
fortified Campe in him: God would
(without doubt) once come and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh
his enimies, and ſo he ſhould know
all things to eternall Life.</p>
            <p>But the World doth not attend unto
God in himſelfe, alwayes occupied with
the ſound or noyſe of the Creatures,
paſſeth on with tumult and confuſion,
and ſo knowes nothing, heares nothing,
learnes nothing, though in the meane
time it compaſſeth, ſearcheth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
out a thouſand unprofitable
arts, and continually learnes, and the
longer it learnes, it is the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,
untill ſliding into errour at laſt,
it falls quite downe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:2767:65"/>
But if men as Chriſtians doe, would
abide with God privately in the Schoole
of their hearts; and with <hi>Marie</hi> would
ſitt attentively at the feete of their Lord,<note place="margin">Luke 10.</note>
and would both heare and learne what
God would be pleaſed to ſpeake,<note place="margin">Deut. 11.</note> teach,
&amp; interpriſe in them, verily they divinely
inſtructed, would at laſt vomitt up all
their arts, as ignorant and folly. And with
<hi>Paul</hi> would forgett them, deny them, and
account them as droſſe and dung.</p>
            <p>Standing water is eaſily made bright
with the beames of the Sunne; and
a rolling ſtone gathereth no moſſe;
but the roaring Rivers of this world
muſt neceſſarily be either lukewarme or
cold.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is behovefull, that before
al things we turn unto God in our ſoules,
and compoſe our ſelves with him in
quietneſſe; dayly talking with him, heare
him, and learne of him. Which thing the
whole world is ignorant off; it knoweth
not how to heare the word, the Maſter,
the teacher, and how to learne of him in
himſelfe; but alwayes it flyes out of its
owne heart into the mouth of man; who
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2767:65"/>
when they be altogether lyers, filthie,
vaine, it comes to paſſe that they are all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
deceived; are alwayes learning,
and heaping many arts; when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
with all their arts they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
and fooliſh, becauſe that which
they know, is but meerely ſurreptions,
theeviſh, untried, taken upon truſt from
others, of which they themſelves never
had experience; but if any to pleaſe the
people have profunctorily beleeved, yet
together with the people they beleeve
ſome other thing.</p>
            <p>Then truely like Bees they fly out in
ſwarming ſometimes, proſecuting a poor
Weſell, making deare enquiry into a
matter of little moment, and fall into
ſome matter of diſpute, upon whoſe,
foundation and ground they are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ignorant off, untill they be ſatiated
with it, then they fall upon ſome other
thing.</p>
            <p>So in times paſt all Iſraell (in whom
all the whole world is figured) together
with their Kings and Preiſts did fall, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
they wholy erred from the Faith, and
once taken were led away captive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:2767:66"/>
Read the people painted in my booke
of the World.</p>
            <p>Now J call with <hi>Paul</hi> the word of
God: that fooliſh and offenſive ſpeech,
which to weet doth bring with it the
croſſe, greefe, and death of the fleſh, and
maketh all things which ſeeme ſomthing
to be nothing, and only looketh upon &amp;
regardeth thoſe men who are nothing in
themſelves, which in the eyes of the
world ſeeme the greateſt folly that can
be. Neither can it be perſwaded, that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
paſſe that which it ſees, it ſhould
embrace that which it neither hath not
ſees; for it would rather have one bird in
hand then two in a buſh. Neither doth
it doubt ſo it might keepe it to preferre
a temporarie life before a thouſand eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
liues.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Word and the
preachers of the word have beene perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
for fooles.</p>
            <p>Now the word of God is of ſuch a
nature and force, that though it hath a
vulgar ſtile ſo ſimple in the language of
truth, yet it overthroweth all things
whatſoever riſe againſt it, it dulleth the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2767:66"/>
edge of all witt, and theſe entyſing and
corrupt contemplations, together with
the more eloquent kinde of lying, it
doth bring into ſuch ſtraight, that it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
them to bluſh for ſhame; although
(as it is alwayes the properties of lyes
and ungodlineſſe) they will not confeſſe
themſelves to bee overcome; For the
word of God doth ſay ſuch ſtrait ſeege
to the heart of Man, that every one, if
he doe not ſpeake againſt his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
is forced thus to thinke, and ſo to
determine as the word doth ſpeake, that
ſo it is, and otherwiſe it cannot be but a
lye.</p>
            <p>On the contrarye burſts in with a
long Circumlocution, and one lye doth
almoſt waigh ten lyes, that it may ſeeme
to be true and have a ſhaddow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>But the word of God, as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſaid, doth proceed after a moſt ſimple
manner, but it doth ſo gird a man, that
will hee or not, hee becommeth, ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
and with admiration aſtoniſhed
&amp; affrighted, doth ſay, this is the finger
of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:2767:67"/>
No man ever ſpake thus; for this word
hath ſuch a ſharpnes, ſting, and ſtrength,
that it pearſeth even into the heart, and
ſeperateth the fleſh from the ſpirit, ſo as
the minde beeing captivated without all
controverſie, aſſents to the ſame, and
confirmes the truth thereof with all aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
not ſo craftie ſubtiltie can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
againſt the truth, but that may be
battered, weakened, and refuted with
one word; neither can any thing ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
be produced, which weakened with
the like accute, may not be overthrowne,
onely the word of God overcommeth
with ſuch force, that even the minde of
the enemy is overcome and taken with
it; the outward man alone, and the face
of the fleſh, which would not be bridled,
ſeekes out all kinde of ambuſhes, trickes
and turnings, to eſcape this thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clapp.
And falſhood, for ſhame covers its
face with its hands, and thereby thinks
that the whole body is covered, that it
cannot be ſeene.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is behovefull, that all other
traditions of arts, words, and ſpirits, bee
examined by the word of God, as by an
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2767:67"/>
index, golden rule, and touch-ſtone.</p>
            <p>I call that the word of God, which is
the Spirit and Life, (not the Letter)
written without Inke and paper in the
hearts of beleevers, which ſpeakes unto
the ſoules of all thoſe that are obedient
unto it. This J call the Word of God;
Not the Scriptures. For if we ſpeake
properly, the Scriptures or Letters are
not the word of God, but the minde, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and that true divine meaning, which
<hi>Paul</hi> calleth the ſence of Chriſt and mind
of the Spirit, and Chriſt the Word of
God.</p>
            <p>This I ſay is the word of God, as <hi>ſaint
Paul</hi> doth teſtify: The Letter (ſayth he)
doth kill, but the Spirit, that is the true
and ſpirituall meaning thereof, which
onely ſpirituall men are indued with,
which doth quicken.</p>
            <p>Theſe alone have the Key of <hi>David,</hi>
for the opening of all the Seales of this
cloſed booke; to all other the booke is
Sealed with ſeven Seales; Of which men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made in <hi>Dan. 7. Apoc.</hi> 5. and <hi>Mat.
13.</hi> by way of parable; and the vaile of
the Letter doth hang before their eyes,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2767:68"/>
untill they turne unto God, and ſeriouſly
will obey his will.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of underſtanding entreth
into no froward ſcorner, who in the letter
only deſireth to ſhew his nicitie and
Clarkeſhip. For the truth is, that word
of God, and his ſecrets, are made manifeſt
to them that feare him.</p>
            <p>Therefore many in our times are
ſnared, who betwixt the writings and the
word of God doe know no difference,
and ſo doe they eſteeme the Scriptures
for the word of God, ſo as beſide it
they knovv no other.</p>
            <p>But it appeares by the Teſtimony of
many divinely taught, that the ſcriptures
are nothing but the huſkes, the ſhell, the
ſheath, the Lanthorne, the ſhrine, the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the cave, the vaile of the word of
God. From whence it ariſeth that they
appeare ſo ſiniſter, and in ſhew often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant,
and are hidden from wicked
men.</p>
            <p>But the Word of God placed in and
under them, is the kernell, the life, fulnes,
and thing it ſelfe, or ſubſtance: For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
thoſe learned men the Scribes and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:2767:68"/>
Phariſees had been bleſſed and happy, if
the Letter had beene the word of God,
viz. the light, &amp;c. becauſe they had ſo
well conned the Scriptures, that moſt
part of them they could ſay by heart, yet
were they for all that moſt miſerably to
periſh with this Art; and ſo death is eaten
by the Tree of good and evill, while yet
men thinke thereby to have Life.</p>
            <p>But Chriſt doth more ingenuouſly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify,
that they know not the Scriptures,
that is what in the Scriptures is the word
of God; for what otherwiſe belonged to
the Letter and grammaticall ſence they
writt, but knew not the mind of Chriſt,
which was the force and meaning of the
Letters; and the Letters in my judgment
are of ſett purpoſe, ſo ſiniſter and darkly
dictated by the Holy Ghoſt, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
and declared, that thoſe impious
Swine and Dogges may not underſtand
them, according as Chriſt out of <hi>Eſay</hi>
doth alleadge them, and giveth this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why he ſpeaketh ſo obſcurely by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes,
and demonſtrateth the ſame
thing more ſignificantly in <hi>Iohn,</hi> leaſt
we ſhould make an idoll of the Letter;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2767:69"/>
And that wee ſhould thinke ſome other
thing more neceſſarie to ſalvation then
Bibles: to weet, that of God we ſhould
deſire the Light of his word, which is
hidden in this Lanthorn; and alſo that
true teacher the Holy Spirit, which may
direct, lead, and inſtruct us in the holy
Scriptures, and may open the Seales
thereof, declaring unto us the myſterie
of this ſhrine, that is his divine word,
Law pleaſure, will, and meaning, hidden
under the dead Letter.</p>
            <p>Many thinke it enough that they have
Bibles, and know how to reade; Here
forſooth they find the Holy Ghoſt, the
word of God, that double Sword of
the Spirit; yet wrapped up, and cloſed
in the ſheath.</p>
            <p>But who can underſtand, gaine, finde,
and brandiſh the ſame? He anſwers by
the Prophet <hi>Eſay:</hi> Yong Children, who
will be affrayd at this killing Letter,
they are ſore out of heart, tremble and
dye for feare.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is not enough, although
it is good, to have Bibles. What to have
Bibles? All the Phariſes had the ſame,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2767:69"/>
could ſay them by heart, and yet they
lived no leſſe blinde and dead.</p>
            <p>Theſe very Bibles are the Tree of
Good and Evill, of which they did eate
death, although to the godly who conſult
with God about the meaning of them,
and renouncing themſelves, pray unto
him for the obtaining of his Spirit, they
be the Tree of Life; God will give his
glory to none other, no not to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but hath made them darke unto us,
and hath reſerved the interpretation to
himſelfe, that he may teach, enlighten,
rule, and guide, how, when, and as hee
will; and his will is, that we alwayes
wax ſtronger, and by degrees come nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to the knowledge of the truth, if ſo
be we would doe the ſame by his helpe;
but hee hath not ſowen his word by the
way ſide for dogges and ſwines, but hath
covered it, the ſame beeing hiding in the
Letter, that we may not reſt our ſelves
contented in the Letter, but digg up the
hidden treaſure; and with all Religion
pray for grace and underſtanding, and
conſult with his Holy Spirit, that he may
take us into his tuition, guide us, teach
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:2767:70"/>
us, leade us unto the Tree of Life, the
Fruit whereof may feed us up unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Life.</p>
            <p>And this is the tryall of all Arts, Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines,
and Spirits, that they be compared
and agree with the word of God, that
that which is divinely unto us, we finde
to be true by his word in our hearts. In
a word, that our ſpirits may confirme the
ſame ſo to be by its teſtimony, as wee
have divinely learned the ſame, and that
we ſuſtaine for the defence thereof to
dye.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is likely and ſo it ſhal be
indeed, what Doctrine ſoever commeth
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god, the ſame is not repugnant to the
word, which divinely taught, we have in
our hearts, but agreeable, thereunto gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
teſtimony that wee know his word,
as we are knowne of God, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
as we are comprehended of him,
otherwiſe how could we ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> and
aſſent if the contrarie ſhould be fall in
us.</p>
            <p>Therefore they are much deceived
who thinke that nothing is the word of
God, but what altogether differeth from
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2767:70"/>
our minds; and therefore compell them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
only to beleeve thoſe things which
in their inward man they can perceive,
feel, &amp; comprehend to be far wanting in
them, and contrary to them.</p>
            <p>Indeed the word of God invadeth our
hearts with an exceeding force, becauſe
it is ſpirit, our hearts are fleſh; but where
the beleeving heart addicts it ſelfe to the
worſhip of God, the word is ſoone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
in us, and our heart made one
with it, is converted into ſpirit; ſo as
now the truth it feeleth, yea and what
more it witneſſeth that to be true, which
the ſpirit doth ſpeake unto it; and is ſo
bound that it neceſſarily muſt aſſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it; Neither doth it ſo compell or
force it ſelfe to beleeve, but it is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled,
that it cannot but beleeve, and
would a thouſand times make a loſſe of
its body rather then beleeve otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>So again the mind cannot be beleeved,
and as long as the minde doth not aſſent,
it is a ſure argument, that as yet is hath
not comprehended, nor as yet is the
word incorporated in thee, nor the
Sonne of God borne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:2767:71"/>
For he who comprehendeth the word as
he is comprehended, feeleth the ſame,
yea teſtifieth, &amp; knoweth that the ſame
is true.</p>
            <p>Wherefore compare, or examine all
learning with the teſtimony of the ſpirit.
For if thou art a beleever, God dwelleth
in thee, and thou art ſealed with his
word and Spirit, but if thou doſt not
beleeve, this examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
unto thee; For it is ſpoken to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
<hi>Theſsalonians,</hi> try the Spirits.</p>
            <p>If in a wicked man the ſpirit were to
be compared with his heart and with the
letters, he could never rightly judge how
he doth underſtand them, becauſe hee
taketh that to be the word of God what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
pleaſeth his wicked and perverſe
heart and eyes.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, it is commanded to
the Saints, that they try and prove all
Spirits and Doctrines by the word of
God, which divinely taught, they have
approved in their ſoules; not to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
who are unfitt to every good work,
and whoſe judgement God doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
off.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:2767:71"/>
But if they ſay, they are to be brought
to the touch-ſtone of the word the holy
Scriptures. J willingly grant the ſame,
ſo that you underſtand that of the minde
of the Scriptures, which is the onely word
of God; which alſo onely thoſe who are
of God doe underſtand, but if the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
and Spirit be compared with the
Letter of the Scriptures, it will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
diverſly, every one according to
his owne underſtanding, in which they
are deceived; neither is this the true trial,
as more cleare then Light wee may ſee
it; Since all deſire the Letter to be this
judge, and thinke them of themſelves to
be the ſame.</p>
            <p>Therfore that which hath not the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
I ſpeake off, which I but now
ſpake off, is as eaſily confuted as it is
admitted, as <hi>Gregory</hi> ſayth.</p>
            <p>Here are caſheered all the arts, expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
orations, and comments of men,
which are boughes and fruits of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
Tree, in the Paradiſe of this
World, from which as yet all men doe
eate death, and yet nevertheleſſe with
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eva</hi> thinke themſelves to eate
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2767:72"/>
life, and hope to be Gods. Therefore
all mens arts are no other then a plant of
the Devill, who thinketh by this meanes
to change men into Gods, &amp; from hence
promiſeth life &amp; immortality, when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe
death is before their eyes, ſo
ſoone as they have eaten of this fruit.</p>
            <p>Now that Sentence ſtandeth firme:
Every plant that my Heavenly Father
hath not planted ſhall be cutt downe.</p>
            <p>Therefore all thoſe Arts muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
in their original be brought to
nothing.</p>
            <p>That J confeſſe is the only Scope of the
holy ſcripturs, which is the word of God,
knowne of them who are of God; But
that the literall and grammaticall ſence
is, this I doe not think, which wicked men
doe underſtand, and alſo follow, and yet
by Chriſt are denyed to underſtand the
Scriptures, but as they expound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the Godly, out of the Doctrine
of the Holy Ghoſt; And this meaning
cannot be comprehended in open Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
and rules, but the Holy Ghoſt
will have this book &amp; miſtery reſerved to
himſelf, neither wil he have it imprinted
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2767:72"/>
but will ſhew, teach, &amp; open to all, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the meaſure of every mans faith,
as much as is neceſſarie, neither will he
have it ſo committed, that one may
teach another, and ſo incroch upon the
priviledge of God, but will teach it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
that all and every one of us may be
divinely taught, and may glory that wee
have learned the Word of God from
God, and not from men, with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
docility, yet ſo as men ought,
and every one may one to another give
that teſtimony which hee hath learned
from God.</p>
            <p>So it commeth to paſſe, that with
Chriſt and his Apoſtles we are witneſſes
of the Word, not Miniſters of the
Spirit; For who hath commaunded
the Wind but onely the Maſter of the
Winde.</p>
            <p>To this belongs that which <hi>Job, Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi>
and <hi>Eſayas</hi> ſay, that we ſhall all
be taught of God, ſo as it ſhall not be
neceſſary for us to be taught of any
other, but that ſo its true as the holie
vnction ſhall teach us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:2767:73"/>
And whereas God is onely true, and
all men are lyars, it cannot be but it muſt
be a lye and errour whatſoever commeth
not from God; and that cannot come
from God which all wicked know and
underſtand. Since they are not of God,
but are ſeperated from him by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wall of ſinne.</p>
            <p>Now what commeth not from God
is ſinne, and not good; and what ſhineth
not from his Light, is altogether dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
although it ſeeme to be Light and
wiſdome, as <hi>Eſay</hi> upbraideth the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean
Philoſophers, their owne witt hath
deceived them, and they were wearied
with the multitude of their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>God ſpeaketh this againſt all arts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the art of God, formed in us by his
word; which exhibits unto us nothing to
be meditated upon, and vewed in the
Light but onely God, to know and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
God, becauſe that word is veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God, without any diſtinction of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
there as God cannot be defined,
deſcribed, or divided; but if we ſpeake
properly, God is all in all things, and yet
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:2767:73"/>
nothing of all theſe things which can be
felt, conceived, or comprehended by
ſence, reaſon, or underſtanding, ſpoken,
written, or heard; ſo is the Word of God
infinite, infallible, incomprehenſible, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
by it ſelfe exiſting, and farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
all the writings and words of
men, becauſe it, as God cannot properly
be written, read, or ſpoken. Since it is
God, and was before writing or man
was, and ſhalbe when man is deceaſed &amp;
writing are ceaſed.</p>
            <p>Therefore all things are ſubiect unto
vanity; For which cauſe the nature of all
things are called vaine and vaſt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the accident of vanity, although in
it ſelfe it be good; onely the word of
God, which in it ſelfe is perpetuall and
ſemperternall, can neither be written in
Letters, nor expreſſed in word, endureth
for ever.</p>
            <p>Hence it comes to paſſe, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is ſpoken or written of it, as that
which is not of God himſelfe, remaines
but as a ſhadow, a figure, and teſtimony
thereof, and is not properly God and his
word.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:2767:74"/>
Now no man can ſpeake or utter this
word, therefore it is neceſſary that it
ſpeake it ſelfe, in an obedient and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
heart; and for this cauſe it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of every man, that hee ſubmitt
himſelfe under the potent hand of God,
void of his owne will, free and cleare
from his owne heart, and ſubordinate to
the will of God, that God or his word
may ſpeake, teach, ſeeke, love, finde, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
beſeech, hear, praiſe, honour,
feare, and adore it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>This alone is the art of God, which he
himſelfe doth teach in us, without this all
other arts are nothing; For beſides this
to know all things, is to be ignorant of
all things. All arts without this art is
vanity, which yet is better conceived in
hearr then it can be uttered in word; yea
it cannot be expreſſed or declared in
worde, therefore no man can teach the
ſame to an other, but it is to be taught
and manifeſted by God, to the teaching
of which whoſoever are ſent, they are
not Doctors or Maſters, but onely wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of that word, which by the vertue
of God is before in our hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:2767:74"/>
Therefore it hath many names, which
oftentimes are uſed one for an other; ſo
that as ſometimes the Father, ſometime
the Sonne, and ſometimes the Holy
Ghoſt is called the Fountaine of Life or
Truth; So the word of God is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
called the Seed of God, ſometimes
his ſoule, ſometimes his ſoonn, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
his arme, ſometimes his hand, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
his right hand, ſometime his Law,
ſometime his will, ſometime his image,
ſometime his inſpiration.</p>
            <p>And hither may be referred all the
names which the Scriptures give to the
Father, Sonne, and Holie Ghoſt, and the
word of God, which are all one, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
unto one, ſerve to the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>And this Word which in the New
Covenant is called Chriſt, is the eſſence
of all things which are, and all things
are created by it, and alſo are preſerved,
nouriſhed, and ſuſtained by it, and
in it.</p>
            <p>So that all things have their bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rather in the Word then in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:2767:75"/>
And if God ſhould withdraw this word
to himſelfe, as was the eſtate of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the beginning of the world, while
yet the world was not made of him, ſo
ſhould all things neceſſarily in the ſame
moment be turned to nothing againe.</p>
            <p>Therefore doth God even to this day
preach this word unto us, and yet it is
ineffable, as <hi>Taulerus</hi> ſaith, though in him
all things have their eſſence and being
in &amp; from God.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to committ and conſecrate
a mans ſelfe to this living word of God,
is the onely life eternall; and that true
one art and part of <hi>Mary</hi> which cannot
be taken from her; all other arts are vaine
and muſt periſh with the inventors and
profeſſors, only to know God, &amp; obey his
word, which the Scriptures calls to eate
Chriſt, to beleeve in him, to putt on the
new man, to adhere unto God, to be born
a new, to live to the ſpirit, to heare and
receive the word of God, to be baptized,
to be ingrafted into Chriſt, to receive
Chriſt, and many other tearmes: is not
onely of it ſelfe immortal, but preſerveth
all from death, who are indued with the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2767:75"/>
ſame. No man can conſume this bread,
but it preſerves him the eater thereof,
from eternall death, and hunger unto
eternall life.</p>
            <p>This treaſure can no theefe take away,
no ruſt or moath corrupt. In a word, this
eternall word is to a Chriſtian all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in adverſitie a Sword &amp; Weapon againſt
all dangers, meate to him that ſtarves,
cloathing to the cold, for want of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
grace, and a ſure ſanctuary to every
fugitive.</p>
            <p>But he that knoweth all things, and is
ignorant of this, knoweth nothing; even
as hee who knoweth and hath all things,
and wanteth God, poſſeſſeth nothing;
and if it could be, that any man could
know all arts, which all men at any time
have knowne and underſtood; if he were
a <hi>Pandora,</hi> or a <hi>Hippias,</hi> knowing all
things, yet were he not therefore any
whitt better in the ſight of God; yea J
dare ſay, he ſhould be ſo much the worſe,
by how much he had glutted himſelfe of
the tree of knowledge &amp; eaten death; for
the more poyſon is received, the ſpeedier
will the deſtruction be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:2767:76"/>
And even as this was the fall &amp; death of
Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, viz. to become a god, &amp; to arrogate
to be ſomething in himſelfe, &amp; to know,
J will not ſay to be ignorant of nothing.
That fal cannot be forgiven, or repaired,
unleſſe thou vomitt up all that Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
art and curious knowledge; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
eate of the Tree of Life, which ſhall
worke in thee an utter forgetfulneſſe of
all thoſe arts, and make thee a Childe, a
Foole, and reduce thee to innocencie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God, that at length thou mayſt know
that which God would know in thee; ſo
he himſelfe ſhould teach and ſuggeſt in
thee by his word, according as it is ſaid;
otherwiſe all things are unprofitable, yea
though a man know all things, they are
not onely unprofitable, but alſo a hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to this art of God. He that is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of this, in vaine hath he learned &amp;
knowne all things elſe beſides.</p>
            <p>In the word of God alone, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
out of the mouth of god, is ſeated
the rule of all things, the Scope, Doctrine,
art, life, and truth, teaching what is to be
done, what not to be done, what to bee
ſpoken, what not to be ſpoken, whether
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2767:76"/>
to enter, from whence to depart and
come out.</p>
            <p>All other arts they be variable what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they be to time, fortune, vanitie,
death, and oblivion; and not onely theſe
arts, but alſo the Letters, bookes, formes,
maſters, tongues, which we uſe, doe
periſh, and others after them, which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in their places, ſo that nothing is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
&amp; of long continuance in the earth,
but all things according to their viſible
nature, are frayle, mutable, and momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.
How often are the tongues them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
changed; how often the formes
being removed, doe new ſucceed in their
place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as I have ſaid before) Orthography
is not ever like it ſelfe, and the ſame
with all people in all times; yea the true
pronounciation of the Latin tongue (as
<hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi> in his booke, called <hi>De
vanitate ſcientiarum,</hi> formerly alleadged
by us) is periſhed, and no where extant.
Moreover, the auncient Letters of the
Hebrews are gone, ſo that there is
no memorie left thereof, but onely
thoſe which <hi>Eſdras</hi> in their place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:2767:77"/>
Adde moreover, that the tongue is
made verie lame by the Caldeans, which
alſo hath been incident to periſh of other
tongues; So that no man there is who can
finde out their auncient forme and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects;
Beſides this new words doe all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
creepe in the old word, beeing
growen out of uſe. And againe, the old
words are received, the new being thruſt
out; ſo farre forth, that nothing is durable
or conſtant in this life. And if any man
would obſerve, he ſhall finde that our
mother Tongue in <hi>England</hi> is dayly
changed: that at this day they ſpeake
otherwiſe then they did a few yeares
ſince; yea and ſuch a curioſitie &amp; nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
there is in the word and tongues,
that what men have a while made uſe
off, ſuddenly they caſt away, as diſdaining
the ſame; Every man endevouring to
bring out ſome new and rare thing, that
he ſeeme not to imitate the words of any
other: inſomuch that the cheife inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
of words doe now obtaine the chief
praiſe and eſtimation of Art. And by this
meanes all things are confounded in the
earth; and what now is new, is preſently
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2767:77"/>
growen old, and anone become new
againe; and the hearts of men, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
peoples, and Languages of the
World, like to the courſe of the yeare.</p>
            <p>In times paſt <hi>France</hi> ſpoke the Dutch
language (as <hi>Beatus Rhenamis</hi> writing of
the <hi>Germaine</hi> affaires, moſt elegantly
proves) but now it hath gathered a
proper ſpeech to it ſelfe out of <hi>Italie,
Germaine,</hi> &amp; <hi>Spaine,</hi> but moſt ſpecially
from <hi>Italie;</hi> which thing of the tongue
was cauſed, perhaps by their warre,
becauſe divers people being mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
they made and uſed a mixed kind
of Speech.</p>
            <p>Hence it came to paſſe, that as yet
they retaine ſome of the Germain words:
as <hi>Suppen Sacken kuſhen,</hi> which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
according to the Nether Germains
pronounce, after the baſtard <hi>Germaine
Souper, Sacen, Cuysten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I ſpeake that we may ſee, that
nothing is conſtant or new in the earth,
and that is true which <hi>Terence</hi> writt: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is ſpoke now which was not ſpoke
before; So nothing is done which was
not done before. So that <hi>Cornelius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:2767:78"/>
thinkes the invention of <hi>Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uns was no new invention; of
which opinion in the <hi>Historian Volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramis;</hi>
and this may be gathered out of
the <hi>ſixt of Virgils Eneads,</hi> where thus
he writes of <hi>Salmon:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Salmon ſaw with paine &amp; torment late
Who would loues flame &amp; thunder imitate,
For caried by foure ſteeds, with torch in hand
Through Elis Cittie &amp; all Grecian Land
Did ride in triumph, and command that all
Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uld give him honour and a dietie call;
O mad man, he who with his Chariots noyce
Would imitate the mightie thunders voyce,</p>
            <p>And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhewes the ſame all
along in the 3. <hi>chapt.</hi> of <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> as alſo to
the firſt: that what hath beene that ſhall
bee, what hath beene done, the ſame
ſhall be done, neither is there any thing
new under the Sunne.</p>
            <p>There is ſomething which is as if it
were new, yet was that in auncient
times which hath beene before us. There
is no memory of former ages, neither
ſhall there be of thoſe that are to come;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2767:78"/>
amongſt who are to be; and a little after
things paſt, and things to come, are all
forgotten, and the wiſe together with the
fool doe dye. In which words what other
thing would the preacher ſhow then
that all arts are ſubiect to oblivion and
death; Neither can they alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in the ſoule, but together with the
body departs or periſheth by death. For
nothing (I ſay) can adhere unto the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God, (I meane the Soule
which is like unto God) and conſiſt in
death and fire; but what is onely God
and his word, this is the onely endure
able creature, and the meate of Eternall
Life: Not that opinion and Art of
Philoſophers, but the true good of the
minde and Soule, which can happen to
no other thing but the word; although
I doe not denye but that word appeared
to ſome of the Gentils, and taught
them; becauſe God is <hi>no respector of
Perſons,</hi> but as a common Light of ſoules,
as the Sunne is the Light of the whole
world; neither is the hand of God ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
nor his eye envyous, that he ſhould
not looke upon the whole VVorld.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2767:79"/>
With the ſame love, eye, and grace ſince
we are all alike the ſame workmanſhipp
of God, all of the ſame love, eſtimation,
and authoritie with him.</p>
            <p>Hence thou mayſt collect, that all arts
(invented by men) are death, and fruits
of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and
Evill. For aſſoone as Adam had eaten
of that Tree, the ſame day he dyed in the
eyes of God; as the hiſtorie declares; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
afterwards according to the
fleſh hee lived many yeares; as from
heavenly matters the ſame day was his
eyes ſhutt up, and he eat death, although
in his owne judgement his eyes were
opened, and he ſeemed to himſelfe to be
a living God, knowing Good and Evill:
Then began he to exerciſe his art, his
cunning to expound, diſpute and ſeeke
out a malitious ſutle and captious mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in all things, and alſo to deale de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully
with God, and in all things to
hide himſelfe, to cover himſelfe with
<hi>Figge leaves,</hi> to kiſſe his owne hand; in a
word, to worſhip himſelfe, by inventing
many arts amongſt his poſterity.</p>
            <p>And out of this Roote ſpring up all
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2767:79"/>
the precepts of men, their expoſitions,
their arts; and ſo excellent a foundation
have they, as both the inventour and the
authour of them was the Devill; and the
firſt Scoller that learned them, did eate
death therefrom.</p>
            <p>And this Science and Art is utterly to
be abhorred, being no other then a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall
perſwaſion, conceived in Adam,
formed and hid in the Seede of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
And yet all the World, as Adam
did, thinkes that Life is placed in it; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth it receive any inſtruction from
Adam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither indeed underſtand the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie
of Adams fall, or his riſing againe;
and that whole matter at this day doth
live yet, accounting it but a Hiſtorie long
ſince acted &amp; done, and afterwards dare
ſay the word of God endureth for
ever.</p>
            <p>Therefore wee muſt needs confeſſe
that nothing is paſt which in its kinde is
not yet extant.</p>
            <p>Whole Moyſes is urged upon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
neither is one jott of the word of
God loſt, which ſhall not be fulfilled in

            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:2767:80"/>
Therefore the fall of Adam happeneth
dayly; dayly doth Adam in his poſterity
eate of the forbidden fruit; And therfore
his Sonnes in Adam, as in the roote, are
damned &amp; dead.</p>
            <p>Now this our fall as Adams, is amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and repaired, if we ſpirt out and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt
up this knowledge of good and
Evill as poyſon, and become as Adam
was before his fall, Children, Fooles, and
innocent Turttles, that wee may eate
of the Tree of Life, and ſuffer the Seed
of the woman to be ingrafted in us. This
is not the Seede, the art, witt, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
of the Serpent; but the Seede, word,
will, the minde of God, the Tree of
Life, which whoſoever eateth, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freth
himſelfe to be fedd therewith, is
indowed with Eternall Life.</p>
            <p>Now in us there is a Medicine with
poyſon; For as by ſinne the Tree of
knowledge of good and Evill was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the heart of Adam, ſo by his
converſion, riſing againe, and Seede of
the Woman, the Tree of Life is planted
by the Tree of death in the heart of
Adam. From theſe two Seeds &amp; trees ſo
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2767:80"/>
different, doe ſpring different Fruits, ſo
as one is poyſon and death, the other is
Medicine &amp; Life; and if any man would
know that plant, which is called Man, he
may eaſily know what he ought to think
of his owne art, knowledge, wiſdome,
and righteouſneſſe, how that this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
all men, and is of great reſpect with
them; For what is current with the
world but its owne coyne? What but
the wiſdome, art, and righteouſneſſe of
the Fleſh, ſeemeth holie in the ſight of
men: onely the Holy Ghoſt can repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the world of ſinne, righteouſneſſe,
and judgement.</p>
            <p>It is wonderfull to behould how the
world doth dayly yet eate death of the
forbidden Tree; which tree you may call
(as the Germaine Theologie doth) our
own will; and although God doe dayly
cry aloud in them, and moreover provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
by the witneſſes whom he ſendeth
to teach them externally, that they abſtain
therefrom, or otherwiſe they ſhall reape
death therefrom, yet none beleeveth
but all follow that Serpent, which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
in our heart doth ſpeake thus:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2767:81"/>
Not death ſhal you reape by any meanes,
but if you know many arts, you ſhall bee
like unto God, and live for ever; (this the
whole hiſtorie of the Bible remaines in
force at this day;) &amp; from hence ariſeth
a certaine art and curioſitie, enquiring &amp;
ſearching out; Neither will any ſubmitt
himſelfe docibly and ſimplie unto God,
and obey his word.</p>
            <p>But every man will be his owne, yea
Gods Maſter too, and teach both himſelfe
and God, bring him into the Schoole, and
there preſcribe unto him, with whom,
where, what, wherefore he ſhall doe,
ſpeake, permitt, or omitt.</p>
            <p>Hence it commeth to paſſe that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is juſtified alwayes of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
and thoſe men ſkilled in a thouſand
arts, and above meaſure craftie, God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſatisfie, neither can he obtaine his
Kingdome, or gett any love or right at
their hands. Since they will be altogether
Gods, and kiſſe their owne hands, will,
wiſdome, prudence, and reaſon.</p>
            <p>The art of the Devill, which is ſucked
out of the Duggs of the Serpent, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
we compoſe many bookes, deſiring
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2767:81"/>
to teach the whole world, not knowing
how to teach our ſelves.</p>
            <p>From hence it comes that the proud
Devill, alas! is buried deepe in Learned
men, whom their deadly knowledge doth
ſo dangerouſly puffe up, that they thinke
themſelves worthie all honour, both from
God and men, and oftentimes if not in
word, yet indeed they make their eſtate
as Lucifer and Adam did.</p>
            <p>No man underſtandeth how we dayly
become Lucifers and Adams, but thinke
that to bee the relation of a thing long
ſince done in Adam, and condemne his
wicked pride and fal, when nevertheleſſe
we all ſticke faſt over head and eares in
the ſame, and yet deride others who in
this kinde are fooliſh.</p>
            <p>Divines preach much the word and
his precepts, but when they are to be
kept, indeed they are wanting in this;
yea what themſelves doe ſometimes teach
they will not ſuffer others to practiſe,
but contented meerly in the bare words,
ſo making the word of God nothing but
a meere Art, a matter of talke and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
&amp; had rather be called knowers
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2767:82"/>
and fearers of God, then lovers of him,
that not in vaine is the proverbe, which
is verified by experience, teaching and
confirming the ſame: The greater Scol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
the worſer Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>The Gramarian is carefull that he erre
not in his ſpeaking, but little regardeth
the errour of his life.</p>
            <p>In like manner the Poets had rather
bee lame in their lives then halting in
their Verſes. Philoſophers would know
all things, but not themſelves. The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian
deſcribeth all peoples, but neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth
himſelfe. The Orator is more
ſollicitous that he ſpeake not rudely,
then that he beleeve not, or live wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
The Logitian will ſooner forſake
the truth, then leave his opinion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.
They that have any thing to
doe with Geometrie, doe ſooner meaſure
the Earth then their wayes. The Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
taketh more care that his Song bee
not diſſonant then that his cariage bee
conſonant. Aſtrologers travell over the
whole Heavens, and foretell things to
come, but ſee not the ditch under their
feete.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:2767:82"/>
The Coſmographer relates of all
Mountaines, Valleyes, Woods, and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
but that makes him not one haire
better in the ſight of God. The Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
healeth ſick mens bodies, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecteth
the healing of his owne ſoule.
Lawers are alone expert in the precepts
of men, but negligently violate the
Lawes of God, ſo as the proverb from
hence hath riſen. Neither doth the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
live, nor the Civillian dye well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Phiſitians of all men are moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate,
and Civillians the worſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;
and for that cauſe (as <hi>Baldus</hi>
being an expounder of the Law himſelfe
doth ſay) the moſt part of them are taken
away by ſudden death.</p>
            <p>Other Arts-men J will not here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

            <p>So the Devill doth compaſſe us about
with the rope of folly; inſomuch that
ſometime with one queſtion, ſometime
with another art, we be ſo amazed; in
the meane time wee neglect the onely
ſcience of God, in which all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
even as the Adultereſſe <hi>Medea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:2767:83"/>
when her huſband <hi>Jaſon</hi> purſued her,
cutt her Children in peeces, &amp; diſperſed
their members in the way, that <hi>Iaſon</hi>
might bee buſied in the gathering of
them up, while ſhee eſcaped out of the
Countrie.</p>
            <p>Alas, ſhall death, ſinne, and the Devill
thus pleaſe us? ſhall wee alwayes thus
ſeeke God in hell with the Devill? Light
with darkeneſſe? The living among the
dead?</p>
            <p>One thing is neceſſary, and this no
man will deſire; many things are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
and unhealthfull, yea deadly; yet
theſe are greedily deſired off, and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by all men.</p>
            <p>In the word of God alone, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, are all things placed, neither
therefore will it profitt thee to have all
things, to know, will, ſpeake, ſurpaſſe in
meaſure, diſpute off, number, paint, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn,
judge, teach al things, &amp;c. To know
all things, is nothing elſe then to know
the arts of the Devill, eaten by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
of the forbidden tree; Onely to know
the word and will of God, and to live
according unto it; to be fruitfull in good
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2767:83"/>
workes, is the true art and eternall Life,
eaten of the tree of Life; in vaine, it is
to know all things, yea rather it is bitter
death, as hath beene ſufficiently ſpoken
off before.</p>
            <p>Since therefore all the arts, witt, and
righteouſneſſe of men, ſpringeth from
the tree of knowledge of good &amp; evill,
or rather from the Devill; and therefore
is the fall and death of Adam; it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
followeth, that the more any man is
learned therein, and experienced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
higher he hath aſcended, the worſe and
more perverſe he is; as hee who hath
made the greateſt proficiencie in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and knowledge of the Devill.</p>
            <p>And againe, the more fooliſh a man is
in this art, and in the wiſdome of the
fleſh and the Serpent, and the more bee
hath unlearned, forgotten, and emptied
himſelfe thereof, the more righteous he
is, and wiſe before God: For we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
forget and unlearne this fleſhly
art, this curious ſagacitie, this Deviliſh
righteouſneſſe; And in ſteed thereof muſt
learne the onely new, contrarie, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
art, wiſdome, and righteouſneſſe, by
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2767:84"/>
the eternall word, by the Seed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of the Tree of Life, of which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
eateth, ſhall have eternall Life.
For this cauſe the Scriptures doe ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently
urge new birth, Childiſhnes,
Fooliſhnes, hate of a mans Life, deny all
of himſelfe; which would not be, if there
were any thing that is good or acceptable
to God in man before.</p>
            <p>No man thinkes of this, but all men
being puffed up with their owne arts,
witt, righteouſneſſe, goodneſſe, &amp;c. bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſecure and without conſcience or
Religion, and yet doe eate death of this
forbidden tree, that is of their owne will,
witt, reaſon, knowledge, goodneſſe, and
art, by that Seed of the Serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, implanted
in them. But God doth exact nothing
but the knowledge of himſelfe, and that
we would be obedient to his word, and
ſubmitt our ſelves to be taught by him,
which the Scriptures doe ſometimes call
faith, which bringeth us unto God, begets
us anew, and regenerates us, that thence
doe flow the waters of Life, the fruits of
the ſpirit, love, peace, joy, a guiltleſſe
minde, and all other good things, which
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2767:84"/>
the Scriptures doe ſometimes call faith,
which bringeth us unto God, begets us
a new, and regenerates us, that then doe
flow the waters of Life, the Fruits of the
Spirit, love, peace, joy, a guiltleſſe minde,
and all other good things, which the
Spirit of God effecteth and powreth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us.</p>
            <p>Therfore Theologie is the true Magick,
the worſhip, &amp; ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, which God
doth equally exact from us all. And this
is the ſame which God doth exact, teach,
and effect by his Word in them, who
offer and ſubmitt themſelves to that his
word and clemency to be taught.</p>
            <p>Therefore doth he ſo frequently and
ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> admoniſh us, that he might make it
knowne, that in him alone is Life and all
other things to be found, and that hee
threatneth and inflicteth great puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on them that deſpiſe him, as many
places of the Scriptures doe witneſſe,
though the word of God is not tyed or
bound unto them, as wee will prove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none;
yet they give good direction
and teſtimony to the mind, if any man
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2767:85"/>
can have the ſame &amp; uſe it aright; and
yet doe much more, abuſe the Scriptures
then rightly uſe them. Nevertheleſſe
they are not to be forſaken any more
then a mans wife, Children, meate,
drinke, &amp;c. all which may be abuſed,
but yet wee muſt learne to uſe them
rightly.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIII. Of the Maiestie, of the free, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
and eternall Word of God, how it
can be bound to nothing, included in
nothing, nor buried in the Letter; and
alſo the difference betwixt the internall
and the externall Word.</head>
            <p>THE word of God is as God, infinite,
inviſible, ineffiable, a Spirit and Life,
which no mortall man can ſpeake, ſee,
or heare, but as farre as is Lawfull to
ſpeake of it after the manner of men,
and by ſimilitude.</p>
            <p>The word of God is nothing elſe then
the gliſtering, the eſſence, the Image, the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2767:85"/>
forme and ſplendor, as well imprinted
like a Seale into all Creatures, as more
ſpecially into the hearts of the faithfull,
which in all things is the cauſe of their
being, in all beleevers teacheth, in al wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men reproveth, exhorteth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
and reprehendeth the world of
ſinne, and which in the beginning did
enlighte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; informe the hearts of <hi>Adam,
Abell, Noah, Loth, Abraham, Iob, Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
Termigeſtus, Plotimus, Cornelius,</hi> and
all other upright-hearted Gentils.</p>
            <p>For though God giveth beeing, in,
above, below, without, and beyond all
Creatures, and is the eſſence of all things
that bee; yet in nothing is hee ſo clearly
to be ſeene as in Man, whom therefore
he created after his owne image, and
perfected in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore as brightneſſe doth ſo
proceed from the Light of the Sunne,
as yet it is not ſeperated from the Sunne,
but for all that remaines in the Sunne,
though it fill the whole world, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
the ſame; So is the Sonne in like
manner whole in the Father, and in all
the Creatures, as the Light is in the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2767:86"/>
Sunne and in the whole World:</p>
            <p>Therefore it is called the brightneſſe
of his Majeſtie, and the image or figure
of his divine eſſence; Of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſubſtance, and eſſence with God;
So as nothing can bee ſpoken of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which may not alſo be verified of
the word: God is no where and every
where, in all places, in all things, and yet
incomprehenſible above and beyond all
things; Limited to nothing, ſo farre forth
that the heavens and earth are not able
to containe him, nor all the Creatures.
So is the word.</p>
            <p>Even as the Light of the Sunne hath
an originall, from whence it proceedeth,
and a force &amp; action into which it tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
which originall is the Sunne it ſelfe,
and which externall active force is the
heating or enlightning of the whole
world, or as the word of every man
hath originall force and ſpirit, which
originall is man, whoſe expreſſion and
image the word is, and of the ſame
eſſence with him.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, it hath an active force or
ſpirit, which qualifieth this word, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2767:86"/>
makes it either cheerefull, or angrie, or
ſorrowfull or diſpleaſed. So the originall
of this divine word is the Father, or the
action, or active force, or vertue of it is
called the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>As therefore the Sunne, is light, and
that active force of that Light, is the
ſame; and as man his word, and the
active force of that word, is the ſame;
So the Father, the Word, and the Holy
Ghoſt, are one God. Wherefore nothing
that appertaines to their eſſence can be
ſpoken of one, which cannot alſo be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
of all, that is all three; and as they are
of the ſame eſſence, ſo of the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
diſpoſition, and nature.</p>
            <p>As therefore God is in nothing, and
yet in all things; ſo alſo is his almightie
word, which is the ſame: as God is ſo in
all things, yet that he can be included in
nothing, and ſo above all Creatures, as
the Earth, Heaven, or any other Creature
is not able to conceive or circumſcribe
him. And ſo in all Creatures, as nothing
is without him, or rather nothing there
is that is not full of him. So is alſo his
Word.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:2767:87"/>
As God can neither be ſpoken or
written, nor any man is able to declare
what God is, but all things which are
ſaid of him, are but Images &amp; ſhadows.
J will not ſay as <hi>Taulerus</hi> and Dr. <hi>Eicka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
ſay, ſeeing if we ſpeake truely and
properly, the whole nature of God is
farre otherwiſe then man doth or is able
to ſpeake of him.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, as God is a thing oppoſite, and
contrary to humane cogitation, and farre
otherwiſe then he is conceived to bee in
the thoughts of man; So alſo is the divine
word of God.</p>
            <p>As there is nothing ſo little in which
there is not God; and againe, nothing
ſo great that can receive or circumſcribe
God. As nothing is ſo little but God is
leſſe, and nothing ſo great but God is
greater, beyond, without, below, &amp; above
all Creatures; So alſo is his divine
word.</p>
            <p>As the free, almightie, eternall, immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
omniſcient, incomprehenſible, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,
and unconceivable God is the
beeing of all things; So as as all things
conſiſt rather in him then in, and by
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2767:87"/>
themſelves (as <hi>Taulerus</hi> and the <hi>Germain
Theologie</hi> in a 1000 places doe avouch)
and is none of theſe things which can be
ſeene or comprehended by ſence or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by word; So his divine word is
free in all, and beyond all, bound unto
nothing, neither tyed to the priſon, or
letters, or cover of the Letter, concluded,
included, and ſo tyed unto it, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it is no where; even as the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Poſition and Sentence of a Learned
man divinely inſtructed doe ſhow.</p>
            <p>As the word is covered and hidden by
the Letter, ſo it is opened and revealed
by the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Hence it commeth to paſſe that the
Letters be as a cloſed or ſealed Booke;
ſo as the dark Letter, except it be opened,
doth ſlay; but the Spirit doth quicken,
and the Letters are as a certaine Image,
void of Life and Spirit: that is a printed
and dead expreſſion of the Spirit; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they want Life, (except the ſoule of
the ſpirit be preſent) and doe erre.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Letters cannot be the
word of God. Since the word is farre
otherwiſe an other thing then the letters;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2767:88"/>
For it is a ſpirit, truth, &amp; life; but the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary: fleſh the letter &amp; death;
yea the letters if they want the Light of
the word, are an offence; &amp; if they want
the ſoule of the ſpirit, are a ſtumbling
block.</p>
            <p>Therfore the Letters are an otherwiſe
thing then the word; that is, they are not
the Sword of the Spirit, but a ſheath;
For as the womb of the virgin conceived
the word, ſo the Letters.</p>
            <p>For the word is clothed both with
fleſh &amp; with the Letters, that Seede of
<hi>Abrahem</hi> layeth hould of the Scriptures
or Letters, (for they are both one,) and
againe is apprehended by them; but the
ſpirit is not apprehended in the fleſh or
Letter of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>The cauſe thereof is this: the fleſh or
Letter cannot containe, conceive, or
comprehend the Majeſtie of the word;
yet even as it was ſo in the fleſh, that the
Majeſtie thereof did not appeare; ſo it is
in the Letter, that true neither to all, or
to any one that reads, is it obvious and
apparent.</p>
            <p>This is witneſſed by all Learned men
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2767:88"/>
in the meere Letter, ſince the world
began, who neither could know, finde, or
comprehend Chriſt in the fleſh, nor the
word in the Letter; which they ſhould
have done, if Chriſt in the fleſh, or under
the miſerie of the fleſh had beene known
unto all, not hidden but manifeſted; and
the Letter had beene not the covering
myſterie, but the true living and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
word of God it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>As therefore the fleſh was not the
word, but the cover thereof, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
great myſterie; So the Letters are
not the word properly, but the ſhell, the
barke and cover thereof.</p>
            <p>The word was made fleſhly aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not mixture, and ſo the ſame word
is made Letters, yet not ſo as the ſame
can be ſaid of the Letters, as of the word,
but as in a certaine Seale.</p>
            <p>Therfore ſo farre are the Letters from
being the word of God, that they onely
be the figure and barke thereof.</p>
            <p>For the word is not that which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the Letter, but that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by the Holy Ghoſt, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
onely of the Faithfull.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:2767:89"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:2767:90"/>
Therefore the Letters doe paint out, &amp;
ſhadow out; and after a certaine manner
ſet forth unto us the word, and expreſſe
ſomething, but are not the word, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they be ſpoken and expreſſed.</p>
            <p>For the word did not aſſume the fleſh
that it is not out of the fleſh. So it did
not ſo fall into the Letter, that it is not
out of the Letter; For there was the word
when there was no Letters; and the ſame
will remaine after the Letters are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed.</p>
            <p>Therefore as the word was never
included and circumſcribed in the fleſh,
neither is it in the Letters.</p>
            <p>For ſo it was in the bodie, as it never
yet left heaven, and in the ſame manner
it is ſo in the Letter as yet it is every
where.</p>
            <p>Therefore the word is in the Letter
altogether, but not all. Hereupon we ſee
that the letters have been exerciſed with
a continuall encreaſe and addition.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Letters are the Image
of the word, and not the word it ſelfe;
And if they be, they are altogether a
written, and a dead, &amp; not a living word;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2767:90"/>
For there is a twofould word, one that
quickneth, viz. the Spirit, another the
Letter, which is ſaid to kill and ſlay.</p>
            <p>The living word is that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
teacheth, and maketh us to fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie;
the dead word is that which in the
Fleſh and Letter is propoſed unto us.</p>
            <p>The living word is a true Light, which
enlightneth all men, and therefore a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating
ſpirit, becauſe it reneweth all
things. In a word, it is the power and
might of God, which giveth unto us that
knowledge, ſence, ſoule, and Life, which
is from God. A certaine brightneſſe of
the face of God, which enlightneth us
from above, &amp; imprints in us the unction
of the Holy Ghoſt, by which it teacheth
and inſtructeth us in all things; But the
dead word are the Letters, that ſealed
booke, and dead Letter, ſence, and will,
which is the word of the fleſh, not of the
Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>The true and living word is that
which God begetteth in us, and the ſpirit
of God effecteth in us; But the dead and
Litterall word is that which the Letters
ſhow unto us and men propound.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:2767:91"/>
Therefore he doth not alwayes want
the word who hath not the Letters: For
he may have the interior who wants the
exterior word, to witt, the Law of God
written in our hearts.</p>
            <p>Hence it comes to paſſe, that no man
hath abſolute neede to be taught of an
other, or to admoniſh his brother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the knowledge of God.</p>
            <p>For al theſe ſhall know, from the leaſt
to the greateſt, and are all the Diſciples
of Chriſt divinely taught.</p>
            <p>This writing is not printed with inke
and paper, but written with the finger of
God in the tables of our hearts.</p>
            <p>This is the Doctrine of the truth, and
the inſpiration of the Spirit, to wit, the
propheticall breathing, the inſpiration of
the Spirit, and the true art of God.</p>
            <p>Moreover, hee may have the living
word of God who wants the dead of the
Letter; and the thing it ſelfe who wants
the ſigne, that is the Life of the word,
though he wants the dead Letter; For
two things are cheifly to be conſidered in
the word.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:2767:91"/>
The firſt is the diſpoſition and nature
of the word, which is a certaine Light
intended for the enlightning of men.</p>
            <p>The other is the action of it, that is the
ſpirit, which giveth action and operation
to the word. For the word hath not
onely a knowledge, but alſo a certaine
action, it is not onely a Light and
ſplendor in us given from above but
alſo Life.</p>
            <p>The interior word containeth both of
theſe which ſometimes is called the
Kingdome of God, ſometimes the Spirit,
ſometimes Chriſt dwelling in us. For it
is not onely a Light, way, and guide, but
alſo Spirit, truth, and Life; that is, which
not onely teacheth man that he may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
but alſo moves him that hee
workes.</p>
            <p>But the exterior word is farre from
this priviledge, and hath farr a different
nature; For it is nothing elſe but a
certaine forme &amp; figure of the interior,
J will not ſay a ſhadow. Therefore
the interior words, as it is the onely live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſo it is the onely true word, as being
the truth and life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:2767:92"/>
But on the contrary the exterior is
nothing but a killing Letter, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
figure of the word.</p>
            <p>Hence it ariſeth, the Letter, (as Chriſt)
becomes a certaine ſnare to wicked men,
a ſtone of offence, darkeneſſe, not Light,
death, and not Life.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is neceſſarie, that beſide
the exterior word, the interior be ſought
after and knowne: Since the exterior
deceiveth a man with its ſhape, is death
and darkneſſe, unleſſe the Light &amp; Life
of the ſpirit bee together preſent with
it.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the exterior ſuffereth a
man to be ſluggouſly and idle, except
the power of the interiour bee preſent
with it. Therefore the interiour word
may be without the exterior, as the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
without the interior.</p>
            <p>Therfore it doth not neceſſarily follow
that a man hath the word of God, becauſe
he pretends and hath the letter; as on the
other ſide it followeth not, that eh who
wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth the exterior word or letter, wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth
alſo the interior, true, and heavenly word,
which is God himſelfe. For he doth not
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:2767:92"/>
alwayes want the word who hath not the
Letter; For the Letters doth onely give
a teſtimony of the word, ſo farre are
they from being the word it ſelfe; yea
they are ſcarce the Image of the living
word; Much leſſe are they it, which
neither can be written nor expreſſed by
words both which is incident to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Letters are farre from
being the word of God, yea all the word,
though ſometimes they bee called the
word of God; as the image and picture
of a man is called ſometimes by his name,
even as God is ſometimes called man, &amp;
the word fleſh: not that God is man, or
the word or ſpirit is made fleſh, by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
appellattion, and permixion; So as
what is ſaid of one, may be verified of
the other, or ſo as God ceaſe to be God,
and to be truely changed into man, as
that water in <hi>Cana Galilee</hi> was changed
into wine.</p>
            <p>Or ſo as the word is ſo fleſh, as not now
it is not the ſpirit, or the word but fleſh,
in no wiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:2767:93"/>
The word is not ſo in the Letter, that
they be one and the ſelfe ſame thing, or
ſo as the word ſhould have changed it
ſelfe into the Letter; and yet well and
rightly the Letters are called the Word
of God; ſo as God is called Man, and
the Word fleſh; although to ſpeake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
neither is the word of God cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged
into Letters, nor God into Man, nor the
word into fleſh.</p>
            <p>Therefore both theſe may be true, the
Letters are the word of God, and the
Letters are not the word of God.</p>
            <p>Now although the Letters are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in ſome reſpect the word of God,
yet truely are they not the ſole, nor alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
nor all the Word of God; yea if
we ſpeak properly, they are not the word
of God, which either can be ſpoken or
written; and that the Letters are not the
ſole word of God, may be made knowne
by this: That many things beſides the
Scriptures are revealed &amp; inſpired unto
many, and many things are ſpoken and
written by them which are not contained
openly in the letters, yea which ſomtimes
are contrarie to the dead Letters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:2767:93"/>
The Prophets, &amp; <hi>Moyſes,</hi> &amp; Chriſt,
and his Appoſtles, whoſe words ſeeme to
be contrary to the Prophets, what they
have written of the Temple, the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
Circumciſion, and of the viſion of
God.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the true word of God hath
beene from all eternitie; yea even before
any ſcripture was, (as I have ſaid before)
&amp; it will be hereafter whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſcriptures
are periſhed. Therefore the word is
improperly in the Letter and fleſh, and
therefore it is improperly called fleſh or
the Letter; For my word (ſaith Chriſt) is
Spirit and Life.</p>
            <p>Therefore the word cannot be that
word which is fleſh or dead letter; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though the word truely and indeed
is onely in ſpirit, as in which it onely
liveth, yet it is alſo in the fleſh, but yet
weake if there it bee alone without the
Spirit and Life.</p>
            <p>It is alſo in the Letter, but altogether
dead, unleſſe the Spirit doe quicken it,
as the ſoule doth the bodie; and it is in
both, and yet not truely, and if truely, yet
not all, and onely, and lively.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:2767:94"/>
Now, although the word is in the
Spirit lively and true, yet after a more
peculiar &amp; excellent manner it is in the
fleſh then in the Letter, although the
Spirit be preſent with the Letter, and
lend a hand, it teacheth nothing, but
when the ſpirit dwelleth with the fleſh,
it not onely teacheth, but alſo maketh
alive, and burſteth out into workes.</p>
            <p>So the letter of the Law brings men
to no perfection, although it be the word
of God, as alſo the Scriptures ſpoken by
the mouth of God, and written by his
finger; For the word of the Law did
teach the knowledge of the precept, but
did not give man a will and ſtrength to
fulfill the ſame, but the word which is
made fleſh giveth life to beleevers.</p>
            <p>Hence it commeth to paſſe, that the
fleſh inſpired with the word and ſpirit of
God, wills and doth keepe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore the word in the fleſh doth
onely give an Example of life, when on
the contrarie it leaveth in the letter all
things idle and ſleepie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:2767:94"/>
But in the Spirit it truely ſtirrs up
the heart and affections towards the
Law, for the Spirit is the life and ſoule
of the word, and therefore the word it
ſelfe; but the fleſh is a certaine imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the word, the letters a certaine
printed picture and Copie of the word.
Wherefore the written word is not the
true word, but a certaine image thereof;
yea the Scriptures pronounced in words
are not the true word of God, but onely
a teſtimony thereof: For the Scriptures
had beginning in time by occaſion, but
the word was from all eternitie. Adde
to which the Scriptures doe lead men
into errour, except the interpreter, viz.
the Spirit be preſent.</p>
            <p>And they are a ſealed booke, and a
perplexed Laborinth, unleſſe the Spirit
be preſent, as the Treede of <hi>Theſius,</hi> to
to guide us, and as the Key of <hi>David</hi> to
open unto us.</p>
            <p>Hence it comes to paſſe, that many
men ſeeing ſee not, and hearing heare
not, and as who know the Scriptures, and
yet neither know nor underſtand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:2767:95"/>
Therefore we confeſſe that the letters
are a certaine image and figure of the
word, yet they are not truely the very
word, becauſe they are but onely an
image &amp; figure thereof.</p>
            <p>This is the reaſon wherefore we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt
no other word but what is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to this Image or Example of the
Scriptures, and to the true and ſpirituall
ſence.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Scriptures are as the
Index or golden Scales of the word, ſo
they be underſtood not according to the
dead letter, but according to the minde
of Chriſt and will of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Therefore we reject not what is agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the true meaning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
ſo we doe not deny what is not
contrary unto them; For whoſoever is
not againſt us is of us.</p>
            <p>Therefore we deny not the exterior
word, written or ſpoken, ſo doe we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the interior or living, ſo it is wee
grant the maiſtery and unction of the
Spirit, and doe not deny the guift of
Prophecye and interpretation of the
Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:2767:95"/>
For the word hath ſomething to come
and ſomething obſcure &amp; difficult to the
fleſh. That which is to come, the Spirit
taketh it of the word, and declareth it
unto us, that which is obſcure &amp; hard to
be underſtood, it dayly teacheth unto us,
and leadeth us into all truth. Therefore
under the name of the word of God, the
Letters are not onely underſtood, but all
prophecies, viſions, dreames, unctions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſpeakings, Doctrins of the Spirit &amp;
revelations if they be fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God; alſo what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
holie men by the inſtinct of the
ſpirit have either ſpoken or done.</p>
            <p>Therefore no man muſt adhere pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
to the onely letter; where the
Holy Ghoſt is, there is libertie, and the
free word is bound to none. Moreover,
the Holy Ghoſt ſuffereth no rule or limit
to be prefixed to it in its owne; therefore
to nothing it is tyed but to it ſelfe, that
is, be not contrarie and diſagreeing to it
ſelfe, as therefore many things come and
are ſpoken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God; al which (nay not the
thouſand part) are writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ſcripturs;
So many things at this day happen &amp; are
ſpoken by God, which are not written;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:2767:96"/>
And yet nevertheleſſe they are the word
of God, and wrought by him.</p>
            <p>Add to which that many things there
are not written, nor expreſſed in words,
which wee yet receive for the word of
God, and onely by hand as it were, have
received them from our Forefathers, of
which kinde are the abrogation of the
precepts of the firſt counſell, renewed
after by the Holy Ghoſt to the Church;
So as the Church was freed from the
ſame; Of which things wee notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
have no written or expreſſe
word.</p>
            <p>Chriſt himſelfe taught all in word, and
writt nothing, and commanded his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
to preach, not to write.</p>
            <p>And the Church is begotten rather by
word then by writing.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Doctors &amp; preachers
of the new Covenant were called and
indeed are the Miniſters of the Spirit, not
of the Letter.</p>
            <p>By all theſe it is manifeſt, that the free
and ſwift Spirit is not tyed unto letters,
nor the Doctrine of the Spirit can bee
included into the Jayle, priſon and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:2767:96"/>
corner of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Therefore although there bee many
bookes of the Law, ſomething ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
may change to come in handling
of which there is no expreſſe Canon or
Law to be found, but it is to be excogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
and ruled by reaſon.</p>
            <p>So oftentimes ſuch a rare thing happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
the letters doe univerſall forſake a
man, that they cannot teach, comfort,
guide, or appeaſe him; but a man muſt
neceſſarily repaire unto God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
with the peculiar word of the Spirit
by prayer, to comfort and ſtrengthen his
weakned conſcience; For it is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to have the common call and word,
except a man have ſpeciall, proper, and
inward call, which yet is not contrary
unto the common.</p>
            <p>And although the word of God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
one, and undivided, yet how
much thereof a man hath received by
faith, ſo much of it is his; and this is his
word; His iſſue the Word of God is,
as God himſelfe, muſt be made every
ones by faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:2767:97"/>
No otherwiſe then whereas the Light
of the Sunne is common; yet as much
as every one is enlightned thereby, ſo
much is the Sunne his, and no more; So
as much as every one hath of God and
his word, ſo farre is he his God, and ſo
farre hath he God and his word, which
are common to all, peculiar to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Therfore the letters are farre weaker
then to ſatisfie a troubled conſcience in
the offences thereof, and to make quiet
againe; the lively word of God muſt doe
this, and this honour hath God reſerved
onely to himſelfe, neither will he permitt
it to the letters, or any Creatures whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
Moreover, the Holy Ghoſt will not
be bound or captivated in thoſe that are
his, nor be ſubject to the maſterie of any
one, nor ſuffer that it ſhould be taught by
any writing or mouth of man, but will it
ſelfe be the light, the Doctor, maſter, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and in a word all in all things.</p>
            <p>Moreover, he who uſeth the Scriptures
for a teſtimony of that worke &amp; ſpirit, ſo
hee doe it according to the minde of
Chriſt; not interpreting them according
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2767:97"/>
to the interpretation of the Scribes and
Puariſees, doth onely uſe the Scriptures
aright, according to the will of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as he ought; all others are meere
abuſes, and the worſhip of images, as the
whole world buſies it ſelfe in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and eſteeme them to be their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi>
as if the Holy Ghoſt &amp; God were no
longer to be conſulted with, concerning
any affaires, but onely the letters.</p>
            <p>In a word, here they enquire and have
all things; here with the Phariſees they
think to have life; neither will they grow
by an others mans harme, nor will they
ſee how blinde, impious, ignorant, and
dead they ever have beene in all ages, in
divine things, and in the word of God,
who have beene the moſt Learned, and
could all the Bible at their fingers ends,
having for all that neede to heare and
learne the truth from Chriſt; So darke
and deadly are the Letters, which they
make their Idols.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the Letters death, but
they life; but indeed they are eternall
darkneſſe, death, aenigma, allegorie, and a
ſealed booke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:2767:98"/>
Unleſſe thou have the living word of
God unto the Light, and in them relie
upon the Holy Ghoſt; For thy teacher,
inſpirer, interpreter, guide, and maſter;
and yet many of them dare make the
booke to be open when as yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
agree in the expoſition of it. And
from thence doe as many Sects and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies
ariſe, as Readers and Heads doe
attempt to reade it.</p>
            <p>But know thou, and have it as a thing
moſt true, that they are cleane onely to
the cleane, Spirituall to the Spirituall,
the Word of God to them who are of
God, and Religiouſly ſtudie them by
the direction and guidance of the Holy
Ghoſt, whom they carie alwayes with
them, and put as a Light into this, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
darke Lanthorne; ſo as by the
the doctrine of the Spirit &amp; direction of
it they bring more light unto them; then
they receive therfrom; what they receive
therefrom is nothing elſe or no other but
a certaine Teſtimonie of the Spirit of
them and all Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Bereans <hi>uſed the Scriptures as</hi>

followes,</hi> they are they which testifie of me,
that I am the Life and Word which ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
unto you, John 8.</p>
            <p>As therefore we graunt that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are the rule of the word &amp; judge
of ſpirituall things; So in no wiſe will
we remove out of the Church, the word
of God, and unction of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>For even as wee defend the Majeſtie
and authoritie of the word of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the dead Letter, ſo will we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the maſterie of the Spirit againſt
the executioner of the Letter.</p>
            <p>And ſo doe we grant the fulfilling of
the ſwift and ſhort word, as in the onely
precept of loue all is contayned, both
the Law and Prophets be comprehended
therein, we ingenuouſly confeſſe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore as wee doe not take away
the word of the Law, but confirm it: So
we doe think that ſomething is yet dayly
to be opened in the Church, by the
unction of the Doctors thereof; the ſigne
and earneſt not of that which is neceſſary
