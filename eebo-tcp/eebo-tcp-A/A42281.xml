            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hilst I had the honour to serve your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> I did it (how weakly soever) with that fidelity and dutifull affection to your Person, which found your gracious acceptance, together with some encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from your own mouth to hope a new and more sixt relation to you in the future; the onely suit I was bold to make: as having ever esteemed that to serve your <hi>Highnesse,</hi> would of it self be an abundant reward for having served you.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I hold my self bound to pay your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> some tribute of my hours of vacancy, presenting to your Princely view for the present this <hi>Italian Pastorall,</hi> into which the no lesse wise then witty <hi>Guarini</hi> (having grown unprofitably grey in <hi>Travell, Vniversities,</hi> and <hi>Courts,</hi> as out of the fifth Act, where he personates himself under the name of old <hi>Carino,</hi> may be collected) infused whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of excellent so eminent <hi>Schools</hi> could teach so apt a <hi>Scholer.</hi> His scope therein being, to make <hi>a Dernier effort</hi> (as the French call it) or generall muster of the whole forces of his Wit before his Princely Master (the then <hi>Duke
<pb facs="tcp:57204:3"/>
of Savoy</hi>) and withall to insinuate and bring into that aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full presence, in their masking clothes (as I may say) such principles of Vertue, and knowledge <hi>Morall, Politicall, and Theologicall,</hi> as (peradventure) in their own grave habits, out of the mouthes of severer Instructors, would not have found so easie admittance to a Prince in the heat of his youth, heightned with the pomp and flatteries that attend on Greatnesse, and with the glorious triumphs and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his royall Nuptials then celebrating: though this was the same <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> who proved afterwards in his riper yeers, by his Councels and by his Prowesse, <hi>the Bulwark</hi> indeed <hi>of Italie,</hi> against the puissance of the <hi>great Henry</hi> of France himself, your Highnesse most renowned Grandfather.</p>
            <p>Your Highnesse may have seen at <hi>Paris</hi> a Picture (it is in the Cabinet of the <hi>great Chancellor</hi> there) so admirably design'd, that, presenting to the common beholders a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of little faces (the famous Ancestors of that Noble man); at the same time, to him that looks through a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective</hi> (kept there for that purpose) there appears onely a single portrait in great of the <hi>Chancellor</hi> himself; the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereby intimating, that in him alone are contracted the Vertues of all his Progenitors; or perchance by a more subtile Philosophy demonstrating, how the <hi>Body Politick</hi> is composed of many <hi>naturall ones</hi>; and how each of these, intire in it self, and consisting of head, eyes, hands, and the like, is a head, an eye, or a hand in the other: as also, that mens <hi>Privates</hi> cannot be preserved, if the <hi>Publick</hi> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, no more then those little Pictures could remain in
<pb facs="tcp:57204:3"/>
being, if the great one were defaced: which great one like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise was first and chiefest in the Painters designe, and <hi>that</hi> for which all the rest were made.</p>
            <p>Just so our Authour (exposing to <hi>ordinary view</hi> an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlude of Shepherds, their loves, and other little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, with the stroke of a lighter pencill) presents through the <hi>perspective</hi> of the <hi>Chorus,</hi> another and more suitable object to his <hi>Royall Spectators.</hi> He shews to <hi>them</hi> the image of <hi>a gasping State</hi> (once the most flourishing in the world): <hi>A wild Boar (the sword)</hi> depopulating the <hi>Country: the Pestilence</hi> unpeopling the <hi>Towns:</hi> their gods themselves in the mercilesse <hi>humane Sacrifices</hi> exacting bloody contribution from <hi>both:</hi> and the <hi>Priests (a third Estate of misery)</hi> bearing the burthen of <hi>all</hi> in the <hi>Chorus,</hi> where they deplore their <hi>owne</hi> and the <hi>common</hi> Calamitie. Yet in the <hi>Catastrophe, the Boar slain; the Pestilence</hi> (but this was before upon that miserable composition with their Gods) <hi>ceased; the Priests</hi> above all others <hi>exulting</hi> with pious joy: and all this miraculous change occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the presaged Nuptials of two of Divine (that is, Royall) extraction; meaning those at that time of the <hi>Duke of Savoy</hi> with the <hi>Infanta of Spain,</hi> from which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Conjunction hee prophesies a finall period to the troubles that had formerly distracted that State: <hi>So much depends upon the Marriages of Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not ignorant <hi>(Sir)</hi> that this famous <hi>Dramatick Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em</hi> must have lost much of the life and quicknesse by being powred out of one vessell (that is, one <hi>Language</hi>) into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, besides what difference may be in the capacity and
<pb facs="tcp:57204:4"/>
mettle of the Vessels themselves (the <hi>Italian</hi> being tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendently both copious and harmonious), and beside the unsteadinesse of the hand that powres it; And that a <hi>Translation</hi> at the best is but the <hi>mock-Rainbow</hi> in the clouds, faintly imitating the true one: into which <hi>Apoll<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yet because it seems to me (beholding it <hi>at the best light</hi>) a <hi>Lantskip</hi> of these Kingdoms, (your <hi>Royall Patrimony</hi>) a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <l>" By that safe part which for the hand was wrought,</l>

                  <l>If Love must joyn them, and the one doth fly,</l>
                  <l>How can that be? How can the strings which tie</l>

                  <l>But who'd have dreamt midst plenty to grow poor?</l>
                  <l>Or to be lesse by toiling to be more?</l>
                  <l>I thought by how much more in Princes Courts</l>
                  <l>Men did excell in Titles and Supports,</l>
                  <l>So much the more obliging they would be</l>
                  <l>(The best enamell of Nobility).</l>
                  <l>But now the contrary by proof I've seen:</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Courtiers</hi> in name, and <hi>Courteous</hi> in their meen</l>

                  <l>Yet cruell as the Ocean when it raves.</l>
                  <l>Men in appearance onely I did finde,</l>
                  <l>Love in the face, but malice in the minde:</l>
                  <l>With a streight look a squinting heart; and least</l>
                  <l>Fidelity where greatest was profest.</l>
                  <l>That which elsewhere is vertue, is vice there:</l>
                  <l>Plain troth, square dealing, love unfeign'd, sincere</l>
                  <l>Compassion, faith inviolable, and</l>
                  <l>An innocence both of the heart and hand,</l>
                  <l>They count the folly of a soul that's vile</l>
                  <l>And poor, a vanity worthy their smile.</l>
                  <l>To cheat, to lie, deceit and theft to use,</l>
                  <l>And under shew of pity to abuse,</l>

                  <l>The vertues are of that perfidious race.</l>
