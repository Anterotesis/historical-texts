            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Glorious Doctrine of Juſtification, which <hi>V. Chemnitius</hi> terms <hi>Arx &amp; Propugnacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Religionis Chriſtianae, i. e.</hi> The very Strength and Bulwark of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and further calls, <hi>Articulus ſtantis &amp; cadentis Eccleſiae, i. e.</hi> That Article with which the Church ſtands or falls, is now ſo furiouſly attacked on every ſide; Satan and his Inſtruments being ſo very buſie to deprave it, that 'tis very neceſſary, that every one of <hi>Sion</hi>'s Watchmen ſhould give Notice of the Danger, and labour to fortifie himſelf and Flock, againſt the Devices of the Common Enemy: If we loſe this Doctrine, we loſe our Hopes of Salvation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that is Valuable in Religion; we have then no Way left of approaching to God, for Pardon and Salvation; nor any right Means for comforting afflicted Conſciences.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine is the Glory of the Proteſtant Churches, one of the Grand Differences between them and the <hi>Romiſh Antichriſt,</hi> the Avowed Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and all other Proteſtant Churches; and therefore we have a great Deal of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to contend earneſtly for this Doctrine, once ſo clearly delivered to the Saints, and afterwards ſealed by the Blood of ſo many Martyrs.</p>
            <p>It is now about Ten Years, ſince I publiſhed a ſmall Tract upon this Subject with great Succeſs; which was then approved to the Preſs, by that Reverend Man of

            <p>THis Chapter contains a Double Prophecy: The Firſt concerning the Redemption of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Re-edification of the Temple, and the Reſtitution of the Temple-Worſhip.</p>
            <p>The Other concerning the Calling and Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the Days of the Goſpel, of which the Words of the Text are the Concluſion; in <hi>Ver.</hi> 23. you have God's Oath to aſſure us of the Certainty of the Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles; I have ſworn by my ſelf, the Word is gone out of my Mouth in Righteouſneſs, and ſhall not return unto me void; every Knee ſhall bow, and every Tongue ſhall ſwear.</hi>

            <p>And <hi>Swearing,</hi> a Solemn Part of God's Worſhip, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating, that the Converted <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall reverently Adore, and ſolemnly Worſhip God in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now the Text gives a farther Account of the Change, that Converting Grace ſhall make upon the Converted <hi>Gentiles.</hi>

            <p>In the Text obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>The Perſon ſpeaking:</hi> It is the Lord Jehovah. <hi>The Lord that ſpeaks in Righteouſneſs,</hi> v. 19. He, who is God alone; a Juſt God, beſides whom there is no Saviour.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Here are the Perſons ſpoken to, or of;</hi> Namely, the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Converted <hi>Gentiles:</hi> Shall one ſay. <hi>One,</hi> is not in the <hi>Hebrew Text,</hi> but <hi>(Liamor:)</hi> dixit, <hi>He ſaith,</hi> or <hi>ſhall ſay;</hi> i. e.

They are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Seed of Irael,</hi> which is a Term proper and peculiar not only to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but to all Believers, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who are frequently called God's <hi>Iſrael</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Or, 2. The Unconverted amongſt them, who were not changed by the Goſpel, but were rather Enemies to Chriſt, that are incenſed againſt him, rebel againſt him, not ſubmitting to his Rule and Government.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Here are the Things predicted, or ſpoken of theſe Perſons;</hi> And thoſe are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Solemn Glorious Benefits which they ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy by the Goſpel, that are changed by it; they ſhall have Righteouſneſs and Strength; and by that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs they ſhall be juſtified.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49545:5"/>
principally intended; becauſe 'tis that Righteouſneſs whereby we are juſtified, <hi>v.</hi> 25. The Righteouſneſs of Sanctification being rather hinted to us in the Word, <hi>Strength;</hi> whereby the Holy Spirit begins and carries on a Saving, Regenerating Work in the Soul; whereby we are enabled to repent, believe, and walk in Newneſs of Life.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>Here is the Change Regenerating Grace makes upon theſe Perſons and the Profeſſion, that ſhall upon their Converſion be made by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. They ſhall come to Chriſt and believe on him; <hi>To him ſhall Men come,</hi> i. e. believe in Chriſt; for Coming to Chriſt is Believing on him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They ſhall be juſtified by him, <hi>i. e.</hi> Their Sins par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and their Perſons cloathed with the Imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, whereby they ſhall ſtand righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous at God's Bar.</p>

            <p>This precious Doctrine of Juſtification, is the very Marrow of the Chriſtian Religion; 'tis that Doctrine as <hi>Luther</hi> obſerves, with which the Church ſtands or falls; 'tis that Doctrine (the Devil) of all Goſpel Truths, moſt hates, and endeavours to corrupt; in the Beginning of the Reformation, it was looked on as the Grand Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi> Yea, 'tis that Doctrine, that will only help to ſettle an awakened, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, believing Sinner, in a ſweet and laſting Peace; and therefore in ſpeaking to it, I ſhall ſhew you,</p>

            <p n="5">5.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deſ.</hi> Juſtification is in Acquittance or Diſcharge at God's Bar, from all that the accuſing Law hath to lay to our Charge; and the giving ſuch a Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by Vertue whereof, we can lay Claim to Eternal Life as ours.</p>
            <p>Here are two Parts of Juſtification,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Diſcharge from what the Condemning Law hath to lay to our Charge; now the Law pronounces a Curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>For as many as are of the Works of the Law are under a Curſe; for it is written, Curſed is every one, that continueth not in all Things, written in the Book of the Law to do them:</hi> By the Law here is meant the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> as appears from <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. whence the Apoſtle borrows this: So to be under the Curſe of the Law, is to be liable to all the Penalties the Law threatens. Now Eternal Separation from God, is what the Law threatens to the Breakers of it; For that firſt Threatning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17.

               <hi>In the Day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely dye;</hi> is Threefold, involving a Temporal, a Spiritual and an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death. Now from this Curſe and Death we muſt be acquitted, this is the Pardon of Sin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. — <hi>In whom we have Redemption thro' his Blood, even the Forgiveneſs of Sin;</hi> and this Forgiveneſs is of meer Grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7 — <hi>According to the Riches of his Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2d. Branch of juſtification is by pleading a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, or a Satisfaction at God's Bar.</p>
            <p>We are by Nature Sinners, and by the Law accuſed or impleaded at God's Bar; to which Accuſation we muſt plead guilty or not guilty; Not-guilty can none plead, <hi>For we are all under Sin,</hi> Rom. 3.9. <hi>All the World is become guilty before God,</hi> v. 19. therefore the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed Sinner muſt plead guilty; and in Order to bring him off at God's Bar, he muſt plead either,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Meer Sovereign Mercy: <hi>q. d.</hi> 
               <q rend="margQuotes">Lord, I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and deſerved thy Wrrth and Curſe, but thou art a Merciful and Gracious God, ready to pardon, willing to forgive; a God which takeſt no Pleaſure in the Miſery and Sufferings of thy Creatures, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore plead Free and Sovereign Mercy.</q> Thus the condemned Creature throws himſelf upon the Mercy of the Judge; but this is not properly to plead but to beg: I do not ſay, God could not have ſaved the Sinner this way, by paſſing a meer Act of Sovereign Grace without reſpect to his Juſtice; but I do ſay, God will not do it, he will ſave Sinners in ſuch a way, as his Juſtice as well as Mercy ſhall be glorified in their Salvation; therefore meer Mercy cannot be pleaded. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Accuſed Sinner muſt plead a Satisfaction to the Law, a Righteouſneſs, ſuch as the Law and Juſtice of God requires.</p>
            <p>This is indeed the Way, in which we are to look for Juſtification; we muſt plead a Satisfaction made to Divine Juſtice, and a Righteouſneſs, in which we may ſtand righteous at God's Bar; and this muſt be either a Righteouſneſs inherent in our own Perſons, which is the Righteouſneſs of Sanctification; or without us the Merits and Righteouſneſs of another.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49545:7"/>1. <hi>Inherent in our ſelves:</hi> 'Tis true, all God's Saints are inherently righteous, for by that bleſſed Work of Regeneration and Sanctification, they are truly, tho' not perfectly righteous; as 'tis ſaid of <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> Luke 1.6. <hi>They were both righteous before God, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all the Ordinances and Commandments of the Lord blameleſs.</hi> They were not ſinle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Holy Scripture doth abundantly aſſure us, that none ever yet were, nor ever yet ſhall be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by any Righteouſneſs in them, of wrought by them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>And be found in him, not having on my own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which is of the Law; but that which is thro' the Faith of Chriſt, the Righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith;</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. The <hi>Jews</hi> are ſaid to be ignorant of God's Righteouſneſs, and went about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs. Now that which the Scripture calls our own Righteouſneſs, is the Grace of God in us by San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; that New Obedience we are helped to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form by the Holy Spirit, given us in Regeneration; which is elſewhere called the <hi>Deeds of the Law:</hi> Rom. 3.20. by which none ever yet were, nor ever will be juſtified in his Sight.</p>
            <p n="2">2. None can be juſtified by their own inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, or ſincere Obedience to the Goſpel; becauſe to be thus juſtified, would be to be juſtified by Works; for what elſe is Sanctification, but a new Creation by the ſanctifying Vertue of the Holy Spirit unto good Works, Sincere Obedience, what elſe is it but good Works, or the Works of Righteouſneſs? We read therefore, of the Work of Faith and Labour of Love.</p>
            <p>Now the Holy Scripture excludes all Works from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly,</hi> &amp;c. Every Believer is a Worker, he is ſtill labouring to work the VVorks of

               </gap>h not with a Deſign to be juſtified by his Works, thus Faith without Works juſtifieth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Righteouſneſs that muſt juſtifie us at God's Bar, muſt be a ſinleſs and ſpotleſs Righteouſneſs; there muſt be no Blemiſh in it, but it muſt perfectly anſwer the Law that accuſeth and condemneth us: But our own inherent Righteouſneſs of Sanctification, is full of Spots and Blemiſhes, and no way anſwers the Terms of the Law; which requires Perfect Obedience, and curſes every One that does not anſwer its Demands in every Point, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>For if we keep the whole Law, and fail in one point, we are guilty of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now our inherent Holineſs being weak, ſpotted and imperfect, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.46. <hi>There is no Man that doth good and ſinneth not:</hi> 1 John 1.8. <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the Truth is not in us:</hi> Therefore we cannot be juſtified by our own ſincere Obedience.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If we are juſtified by any thing in our ſelves, then have we ſomething to glory in, in our ſelves; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2. <hi>If Abraham was juſtified by Works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.</hi> But all that are juſtified at God's Bar, are juſtified in ſuch a way, as they have nothing to glory in, in themſelves; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Where is boaſting then? it is excluded,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. <hi>By Grace ye are ſaved.</hi>

            <p>Objection. <hi>If God accepts us as Righteous, for our own ſincere Obedience to the Goſpel, as if it were Legal and Perfect, meerly for the Satisfaction of Chriſt; is not this of meer Free-Grace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Tho' it be granted, that all that is wrought in us in our Regeneration, or done by us in a Courſe of Holy Obedience, is all of meer Grace; whatever we are, <hi>It is by the Grace of God we are what we are;</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10.

to the Goſpel, ſhall be accepted (thro' Chriſt's Merits) as if it were Legal and Perfect; and we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by juſtified and accepted at God's Bar; yet it muſt alſo be obſerved and granted, that when ever in Scripture, we are ſaid to be ſaved by Grace, juſtified by Grace; in thoſe Places Grace is oppoſed to all manner of Works, as well Evangelical as Legal; he that has any thing in himſelf to plead, and to bring him off at God's Bar, may challenge Juſtification as due to it; ſo that to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Free-Grace, or by Faith, which is all one, is to be accounted righteous at God's Bar, not for any Works, Righteouſneſs or Obedience of our own; but only by, and for the Active and Paſſive Obedience of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt received by Faith, <hi>Who of God is made unto us Righteouſneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was the Pattern of Juſtification, was not juſtified by Works, or by any Acts of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Obedience, then none elſe: But <hi>Abraham</hi> was not juſtified by Works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. therefore none ever was or can be ſo juſtified.</p>
            <p>Objection. <hi>The Apoſtle</hi> James <hi>ſaith,</hi> Jam. 2.21. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was juſtified by Works;</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 24. he ſaith, <hi>Ye ſee then how that a Man is justified by Works, and not by Faith only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now how ſhall we reconcile theſe two Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James;</hi> whereas one ſaith, <hi>We are juſtified by Faith only without Works;</hi> and the other ſaith, <hi>We are not juſtified by Faith only, but by Works alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe two Apoſtles may be reconciled, by rightly diſtinguiſhing and underſtanding theſe two Terms: <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. If we rightly underſtand this Term <hi>Juſtification:</hi> There is a twofold Juſtification, The One at God's Bar, the Other before Men, or in our own Conſciences.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a Juſtification at God's Bar, and that is an Acquitting or Abſolving the Sinner at God's Bar from the Guilt of all Sin, and the Accepting the Perſon ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted as righteous, for the Righteouſneſs of another im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted: This is not for any Works done by the Perſons themſelves, but of Free-Grace; as the Apoſtle proves,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49545:9"/>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4, 5, And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of Juſtification, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3, 4, 5 Chapters; and in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and elſewhere, he ſpeaks of it in this Sence: We are in this ſence juſtified only by Faith, apprehending the Righteouſneſs of another; Works bear no part in our Juſtification at God's Bar. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sometimes Juſtification is taken for a Declaration of a Man's Righteouſneſs before Men, or an Evidence of one's Juſtification in his own Conſcience, and this is by Works. For how ſhall I appear to others to be a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, juſtified Perſon, but by my Good Works; our Lord has directed to judge of the Tree by the Fruit, by their Works you ſhall know them, or how ſhall a Chriſtian know that he is juſtified at God's Bar, but by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Evidence in his own Soul, that he truly loves God, believes in Chriſt, and ſincerely obeys the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>This is our rejoycing, the Teſtimony of our Conſciences bearing us Witneſs, that in Simplicity and Godly Sincerity, not by Fleſhly Wiſdom, but by the Grace of God, we have had our Converſations in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now St. <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 2. ſpeaks not of Juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; for <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified at God's Bar, at leaſt twenty five Years before he offered up his Son, as appears <hi>Gen.</hi> 15 6. So that <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks only of a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Juſtification before Men, and in our own Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and ſo when <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid to be juſtified by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Meaning is, by this his Sincerity was made known to him; he had a full and clear Diſcovery, that his Faith was a ſaving, juſtifying Faith: <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This ſeeming Difference between St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi> may be reconciled, by conſidering and rightly diſtinguiſhing the Meaning of this Term <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Faith</hi> is taken ſometimes,</p>
            <p n="1">1. For a <hi>True, Saving, Lively Faith,</hi> which works by Love, and is productive of all Holy Obedience, and this is that Faith St. <hi>Paul</hi> means, when he ſays, <hi>We are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Faith only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Word <hi>Faith</hi> is ſometimes taken for a falſe, dead and barren Aſſent to the Goſpel; and this is ſuch a Faith, as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49545:9"/>
Devils and Hypocrites may be ſuppoſed to have, and this is the Faith St. <hi>James</hi> oppoſes in Juſtification. <hi>We are not juſtified by Faith, i. e.</hi> by a dead, barren, unactive Aſſent to the Goſpel: But <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Rahab</hi> were ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Works, <hi>i. e.</hi> Their good Works juſtified their Faith, or proved then Faith to be a truly Lively, Saving and Juſtifying Faith.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe two Apoſtles are reconciled, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates Works from Juſtification, but not from Faith. St. <hi>James</hi> joins Works to Faith, but not for Juſtification at God's Bar, but before Men, and in our own Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>Now by what hath been ſaid, it is abundantly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that we have no Righteouſneſs in our ſelves, by which we can be juſtified at God's Bar, but that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, by which we are juſtified before God, muſt be a Righteouſneſs of another, performed for us, and in our ſtead. Now my next Work is to ſhew you what that is.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>That Righteouſneſs, by and for which, we are eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed righteous at God's Bar, is, the Active and Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Jeſus Chriſt, performed by him in our ſtead, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, and received only by Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is very clear from Holy Scripture. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As we by Sin are under the <hi>Curſe of the Law,</hi> Gal. 3.10. and deſerve Hell; ſo Chriſt by his Death, hath redeemed us from that Curſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>In whom we have Redemption by his Blood, the Forgiveneſs of Sin;</hi> ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12, 13, 14. There is no other way, for a Sinner to be brought from under the Curſe of the Law and Wrath of God, but by the Merits, Death and Satisfaction of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed to us for our Juſtification.</p>
            <p>Now here Conſider theſe Two Things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What is meant by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is that Righteouſneſs, by which we are juſtified before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What are we to underſtand by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:49545:10"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Righteouſneſs of Chriſt which is imputed to us for our Juſtification, is the Active and Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt to the Law as our Mediator and Surety. For the Moral Law required two Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Sinleſs and Perfect Obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In Caſe of Sin and the Law broken, the Law required Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as our Mediator and Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, did both theſe for us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſt's Active Obedience to the Law was for us, that foraſmuch as we had broken the Law, Chriſt obeyed and fulfilled it for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>When the Fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law;</hi> and the Reaſon is given, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>To redeem</hi> (or ſatisfie Divine Juſtice for) <hi>thoſe which were under the Law:</hi> Rom. 8.3, <hi>For what the Law could not do in that it was weak thro' the Fleſh; God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fleſh,</hi> v. 4. <hi>That the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfill'd in us,</hi> &amp;c. The Law could not juſtifie becauſe we could not keep it; therefore God ſent his Son in our ſtead to do it for us; and this Active Obedience of Chriſt is imputed to us for our Juſtification.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Law broken threatens a Curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. Chriſt came from Heaven and endures this Curſe for us; the Death he dyed was for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12, 13. he dyed the Death, and ſuffered the Penalty due to us, and <hi>By his S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> and as he ſuffered the Curſe, ſo fulfilled the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law for us: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>God ſending his own Son in the Likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh, that the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us.</hi> The Law not being able to juſtifie us, becauſe we we were unable to keep it; God pitying us in this State, ſent his Son in our ſtead or place to fulfil the Law; which being done by Chriſt in our Nature as our Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is done in us. This is that Righteouſneſs, by and for which we are juſtified, and accounted righteous at God's Bar.</p>

               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:49545:10"/>Now this Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is called the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God,</hi> Rom. 1.17. becauſe it is the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of him who is God: And the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> Rom. 4.11. becauſe that Righteouſneſs that Faith eyes, and looks at in Juſtification, <hi>The Righteouſneſs of the Law,</hi> Rom. 8.3, 4. becauſe it is ſuch a perfect Righteouſneſs as the Law requires.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now this Active and Paſſive Obedience of Chriſt, is that Righteouſneſs, by, and for which, we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified at God's Bar.</p>
            <p>And this is the Meaning of all thoſe Scriptures, which ſpeak of our Pardon, Acceptance and Juſtification at God's Bar, to be of Grace, meer Free-grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.</p>
            <p>We read of Righteouſneſs imputed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man, to whom the Lord imputeth Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Faith was reckoned for Righteouſneſs;</hi> ſo <hi>v.</hi> 11, 22, 23, 24. Now what was imputed? it was <hi>Faith,</hi> i. e. the Object of Faith, the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which Faith look'd at; and that was not an inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in the Perſon of the Believer, but an Objective Righteouſneſs in the Perſon of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>So then the only Plea the Arraigned, Accuſed Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner can make for himſelf at God's Bar is this;</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">O Lord, I readily confeſs I have ſinned, and by Sin deſerve to be Eternally damned; yet in Love to loſt Sinners, thou haſt given Chriſt, who by his Active Obedience has fulfill'd the Law, and by his Sufferings hath purchaſed Eternal Redemption for all them that believe in him, obey and receive him as offered in the Goſpel: I ſee my ſelf loſt and undone by Sin, I ſly by Faith to him, and reſt upon him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone for Pardon, Juſtification and Eternal Life: He is the Lord my Righteouſneſs, I reſolve upon New Obedience and Holineſs, but I will not truſt to any Thing in my ſelf, but to the Merits and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Believer's Plea at God's Bar for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Juſtification; and there are two Conſiderations, that will much clear the Manner of this Imputation.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:49545:11"/>1. As <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin is imputed to his Poſterity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are all become Sinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>In him all have ſinned;</hi> even ſo is Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to all his, whereby they become righteous; <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>As by one Man's Diſobedience, many</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> all Mankind) <hi>were made Sinners; ſo by the Obedience of one, many</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> all the Spiritual Seed of Chriſt, for the Apoſtle is there ſpeaking of the two Seeds) <hi>were made righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As the Sins of the Elect were laid upon, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Chriſt; as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4, 5, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. laſt. <hi>He was made Sin for us.</hi> So the Obedience or Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed to us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. laſt. <hi>We are made the Righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>Let us now Conſider the Time when, we are made Partakers of this bleſſed Priviledge, Juſtification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From Eternity God hath decreed to juſtifie all the Elect; for it muſt be granted, that all thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Priviledges the Saints enjoy in Time, is ſetled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in God's Eternal Purpoſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He hath choſen us in him before the Foundation of the World, that we ſhould be holy and without blame before him in Love.</hi> V. 5. <hi>Having predeſtinated us to the Adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt, to himſelf, according to the Good Pleaſure of his Will;</hi> ſo that Adoption, Juſtification, Sanctification, and all other Spiritual, Heavenly Bleſſings are ſetled upon us in God's Eternal Election before Time; but yet it can in no propriety of Speech be ſaid, We are juſtified from Eternity; there being not one Syllable in the whole Bible that ſaith ſo: We muſt diſtinguiſh between a Purpoſe in God to do ſuch a Thing in Time, and the Thing actually done; we are no more juſtified from Eternity, then we are ſanctified and glorified from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; God having from Eternity equally purpoſed to give theſe Benefits to all the Elect.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath at his Death pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed the Pardon of Sin, Juſtification and Eternal Life for all Believers, <hi>God laid on him the Iniquities of us all,</hi> Iſa. 53.4, 5, 6. &amp; Rom. 5.12, <hi>ad finem;</hi> yet
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49545:11"/>
theſe purchaſed Priviledges are reſerved for us, not applied to us until we actually come to, and believe in Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath Everlaſting Life, and he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We are actually juſtified by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified by Faith we have Peace with God;</hi> Rom. 3.28. <hi>A Man is juſtified by Faith without the Deeds of the Law:</hi> Now if we are juſtified by Faith, we are not juſtified before Faith, nor without it; the Being of Faith in the Soul being abſolutely neceſſary to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In Death we have a further Manifeſtation of our Juſtification, when the Soul of a Believer appears at God's Bar; 'tis then acquitted and finds it ſelf more immediately in the Arms of Mercy. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the dead which dye in the Lord, they reſt from their Labours, and their Work do follow them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The Laſt and Great Day of Juſtification will be the Day of Judgment; the Saints ſhall then by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, be declared Juſt and Righteous before Angels and Men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>How we are juſtified by Faith?</hi> The very <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> and the Rankeſt <hi>Arminian</hi> will not deny, but own we are juſtified by Faith; let them but Explain the Term <hi>Faith</hi> as they pleaſe: Therefore, it will be very neceſſary to ſhew how Faith juſtifies.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively:</hi> We are not juſtified by Faith in a proper, but in a figurative Senſe; not by Faith as it is a Work in us: In this manner, <hi>Papiſts, Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> plead for Juſtification by Faith; nay, ſome would have Faith bear away the Bell, and have the Honour of juſtifying us; it is ſingled out by God from all other Graces, and God of meer Mercy looks on Faith ſay ſome, Faith and ſincere Obedience to the Goſpel, ſay Others; as if it were a Perfect and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Righteouſneſs, tho' they own this Acceptance to be of Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:49545:12"/>But all this is nothing but Popery refined, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Juſtification by Works dreſſed in neater Terms, the Devices of Satan to darken and obſcure the old Proteſtant Doctrine of Juſtification.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Poſitively:</hi> Faith juſtifies with reſpect to its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; Now the Object of Faith is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>General:</hi> The whole Word of God Hiſtorical, Mandatory, Promiſſory, Monitory, it looks at all the Parts of the Divine Law: Thus Faith purifies the Heart, produces Holy Obedience; but in this ſence Faith juſtifies not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Faith has a ſpecial and peculiar Object, and that is the Promiſe or Covenant of Grace, or rather Chriſt in the Promiſe: thus Faith juſtifies as it looks to and eyes the Promiſes, Faith is the Right Hand, whereby we look unto Chriſt, and receive Chriſt offered to us.</p>
            <p>Now this Saving Faith has a twofold Act: An Act <hi>ad Extra,</hi> and an Act <hi>ad Intra; Ad Extra,</hi> it looks and puts forth Acts of true Evangelical Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Holineſs of Heart and Life; ſo it juſtifies not: But <hi>Ad intra,</hi> it looks to Chriſt, and reſts upon him alone; in this Sence Faith juſtifies.</p>
            <p>So that upon the whole we may ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Internal, Moving Cauſe of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is meer Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Being freely juſtified by his Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The External, Moving Cauſe is Jeſus Chriſt God-man, who as Mediator hath purchaſed this Gift for us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Material Cauſe is the Active and Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt, whereby he both obeyed the Law, and made Satisfaction for Sin.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Formal Cauſe is the Imputation of our Sins to Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs to us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The External, Inſtrumental Cauſe of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the Goſpel, in which, Chriſt and Juſtification by the Imputation of his Righteouſneſs, is revealed and offered to us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.22.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Internal, Inſtrumental Cauſe is Faith, which juſtifieth inſtrumentally, as it apprehends Chriſt: Thus we are ſaid to be juſtified by Grace, by Faith, by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49545:12"/>
Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> thro' God's Grace, by Chriſt's Merits ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by Faith.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Declarative Cauſe of Juſtification is Good Works, whereby our Faith is declared to be not a dead, but a true and living Faith.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Final Cauſe of our Juſtification is the Glory of God and our own Salvation.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>Objections anſwered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. 1. <hi>If Chriſts Righteouſneſs imputed be the only Cauſe of our Juſtification, what need then of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Holineſs or New Obedience?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Repentance and true Holineſs, is by God himſelf made indiſpenſably neceſſary to Salvation; <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. <hi>God commands all Men every where to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent:</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I do not ſay Repentance, Holineſs and New Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience are no Cauſe at all; but they are neither the External nor Internal Moving Cauſe, they are neither the Efficient, Formal, Inſtrumental, Material or Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Cauſe; yet they are the Evidential or Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Cauſe, there being no other ordinary Way, to evidence to our own Souls the Truth of our Faith, and the Certainty of our Juſtification, but by ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and true Holineſs; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>They that are in Chriſt walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis very ſtrange, Perſons can find no place for, or reaſon of Holineſs, unleſs they muſt place them in Chriſt's Throne, and make them their juſtifying Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; our Holineſs does not merit Heaven, but it makes us fit for it; it does not give us a Title, but it is our Evidence for Heaven.</p>
            <p>Obj. 2. <hi>But does not this Doctrine of Juſtification by imputed Righteouſnes introduce Careleſneſs; for if we are juſtified by Chriſt's Obedience, what need we be exact or careful about our own Obedience?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Indeed this is an old Objection made againſt this Doctrine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Shall we continue in Sin, that Grace may abound?</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:49545:13"/>1. Conſider, Juſtification and Sanctification always go together, to whomſoever Chriſt is made Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>To them is he made Sanctification alſo;</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nothing more engages the Soul to Chriſt and Holineſs, then a ſence of Free-Grace in Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.8.</p>
            <p>Obj. 3. <hi>This Doctrine of Juſtification by Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs imputed, ſeems to diſſolve the Law as if it did no longer oblige to Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is alſo an old Objection made againſt St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preaching, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. <hi>Do we then make void the Law thro' Faith? God forbid, yea, we rather eſtabliſh the Law:</hi> The Apoſtle's Anſwer is, that the Doctrine of Juſtification by imputed Righteouſneſs, is ſo far from deſtroying the Law that it eſtabliſhes it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Law is eſtabliſhed in Chriſt, in that he has fulfilled the Law, and that both in the perfect Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Life, and alſo in the Sufferings and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his Death; becauſe Chriſt did all this as our Head and Repreſentative, and hence the <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law is ſaid to be fulfilled in us;</hi> Rom. 8.3, 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Law to a Believer is become void, as to its being the Way of our Juſtification before God, yet it is eſtabliſhed as a Rule of Life: We muſt obey it, not to be juſtified by it, but to teſtifie our Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God, not as a Cauſe but as an Evidence of our Juſtification; not to give us a Title to Life, but a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for it.</p>
            <p>Obj. 4. <hi>If we are righteous before God in the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, then God ſees no Sin in his People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True: God ſees not Sin in a Saint with a Vindictive Eye, he does not ſo ſee Sin in a juſtified Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as to revoke their Juſtification, and condemn them for it; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>No Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But with an intuitive Eye God doth both ſee and puniſh Sin in his own People; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30, 31, 32, 33, 34.</p>
            <p>Obj. 5. <hi>This Doctrine of Juſtification by imputed Righteouſneſs, is a Doctrine very pleaſing to Fleſh and Blood, every Carnal Man will be glad of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he need not be much concerned about his own Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49545:13"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is no Doctrine in the Bible more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Fleſh and Blood than this is; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. The <hi>Jews</hi> could not ſubmit to it, it's Fooliſhneſs to Carnal Men, Fleſh and Blood is for Setting up ſomething of its own to be juſtified by; no Doctrine doth ſo empty the Creature as this does, it makes Men abhor them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and renounce their own Righteouſneſs, and make Chriſt all in all, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>Obj. 6. <hi>The Scripture every where attributes our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification to the Death and Blood of Chriſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to his Active Obedience as you do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. 'Tis true, Mention is frequently made of the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt, as the Cauſe of our Juſtification and Salvation; but the Blood and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt are mentioned, not with a Deſign to exclude Chriſt's Active Obedience, but <hi>Synecdochically, Pars pro toto,</hi> a Part for the whole; for where only mention is made of the Blood of Chriſt, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. all that Chriſt did and ſuffered is to be underſtood, Chriſt ſhedding his Blood, being the concluding Act, includes all the reſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We find Juſtification attributed frequently to his Active as well as to his Paſſive Obedience; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, 4. where Chriſt's Active as well as his Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is mentioned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Perſon of Chriſt is the Object of juſtifying Faith, we muſt not look altogether it Chriſt's Holy Life or bitter Sufferings, but at both; as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>The precious Blood of Chriſt,</hi> there is his Paſſive; <hi>As a Lamb without Blemiſh,</hi> there is his Active Obedience; we were under the Curſe of the Law, Chriſt's paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience frees us from that: Alſo we want Conformity to the Law, Chriſt's Active Obedience is our Legal Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Obj. 7. <hi>The wretched</hi> Socinian <hi>objects againſt all this, That we need no Satisfaction at all, but are ſaved by meer Sovereign Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Old Teſtament Believers were not ſo diſtinct as to the way of Salvation by a Satisfaction, as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49545:14"/>
we now are in the Days of the Goſpel, tho' this was not unknown to them, as is evident, by <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. All their bloody Oblations plainly pointed to a Satisfaction; but the Goſpel way of Salvation not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet revealed, in that Brightneſs it was afterwards to be, Old Teſtament Believers ſpake more darkly and generally, but when they ſpeak of Salvation by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Grace, they mean the Goſpel way of Salvation, which being now clearly revealed and fully opened, is in the New Teſtament generally called <hi>Redemption by the Blood of Chriſt; That he is a Propitiation for our Sins,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1, 2. And if the Harmony of the Divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes be conſulted, we ſhall find, that God is juſt as well as meriful, and will by no means clear the guilty: The Sinner of an hundred Years old ſhall be accurſed, the Juſtice of God calls for a Satisfaction, and indeed when we conſider, that the very Strain of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, runs ſo much upon Exalting the Free-Grace of God in Chriſt, <hi>that We have Redemption thro' his Blood,</hi> Eph. 1.7. that <hi>The Lord has laid upon him the Iniquity of us all;</hi> That <hi>By his Stripes we are healed;</hi> Iſa. 53.4, 5, 6. We muſt fling away our Bibles, and renounce the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; nay, all Hopes of Eternal Life, if we let go the Doctrine of Satisfaction.</p>
            <div type="application">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>Is this ſo? That it is the Character of juſtified Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, to acknowledge that that Righteouſneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are juſtified, is in the Lord not in themſelves: We may make a Threefold Uſe of it.</p>

                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49545:14"/>

               <p n="2">2. This informs us, what a miſerable State all Men by Nature are in, that have no Righteouſneſs, nor are capable of doing any thing to juſtifie themſelves; no, neither Men nor Angels can furniſh us with a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, to preſent us righteous at God's Bar; but it muſt be a Righteouſneſs of God's providing, yea, the Righteouſneſs of his own Son; none elſe will do us any Good. O how far was Man gone from God! How deep was he ſunk into the deep Abyſs of Miſery! Without Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs we periſh for ever, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. See here the infinite Mercy and Kindneſs of God to undone Sinners, to provide us ſuch a Righteouſneſs when we had none of our own, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the World, as to give his Son;</hi> Rom. 10.4. <hi>He is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs.</hi> O Let us admire Grace! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.1, 2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This gives us a Reaſon, why Satan and his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are, and have always been ſo buſie in depraving and corrupting this Doctrine: Wicked <hi>Herod</hi> did not more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have killed Chriſt in the Cradle, than Satan and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers do to crucifie this Heavenly Doctrine. Learned <hi>Chemnitius</hi> ſaith, he could not but tremble to think of a Paſſage of <hi>Luther,</hi> who ſaid, <q rend="margQuotes">That he foreſaw after his Death, the Doctrine of Juſtification would be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted:</q> This was Ominous and proved too true, how did the <hi>Galatians</hi> warp from this Doctrine, which is like its Maſter, crucify'd among Thieves; the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> and <hi>Antinomian</hi> on the one hand, the <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Papiſt</hi> on the other.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Inference.</hi> That if we would preſerve this Glorious Doctrine, we muſt keep cloſe to Scripture, and have a Care of making our own Carnal Reaſon the Standard of this Doctrine; <hi>God's Thoughts are above our Thoughts, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49545:15"/>
his Ways above our Ways;</hi> the <hi>Socinian</hi> will believe nothing, but what accords with his own depraved Reaſon, tho' in the Goſpel there is nothing contrary to ſound Reaſon, yet there are many things above Reaſon, whereof this of Juſtification by imputed Righteouſneſs is one; 'tis utterly impoſſible that any thing ſhort of Divine Revelation, ſhould diſcover the way of a guilty Sinner's becoming righteous before God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This informs us, that Pardon of Sin is not the all of Juſtification; for in Juſtification there is two Parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Diſcharge from the Curſe of the Law, the Guilt of Sin, this is properly the Pardon of Sin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis poſſible one might be pardoned and annihilated: Therefore in Juſtification, there muſt be a Righteouſneſs, which muſt conſtitute us righteous at God's Bar, and give us a Title to Eternal Life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.22.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This informs us whence it is, that this Doctrine of Juſtification is ſo little underſtood, even amongſt Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; who have a good meaſure of Knowledge, and can talk hanſomely of other Truths, yet are very dark and muddy in this: The Reaſon is, this is one of the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Goſpel, that Fleſh and Blood, Carnal Reaſon cannot fathom.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If this be ſo, then a juſtified Believer may walk very comfortably, and enjoy a ſweet ſenſe of the Love of God and Eternal Life, notwithſtanding remaining Infirmities, which do ſtill cleave to the beſt of God's Children; we may, and ought to be humble for remaining Infirmities; but our remaining Infirmities do not make void our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, we ſtand accepted at God's Bar, not for our own but for Chriſt's Obedience; <hi>No Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.1. 1 John 2.1. <hi>If any Man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Uſe of CAUTION.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this be ſo, then are we juſtified by nothing in our ſelves, but only by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us. Then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take heed of reſting in a meer Doctrinal Soundneſs in this Point, without a renewed and ſanctified Heart; Some pleaſe themſelves with this, that they are right in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49545:15"/>
Point of Opinion, they diſclaim Works in Juſtification, expect to be juſtified only by Faith; but in the mean time, that which they call Faith is nothing but Opinion, a dead Faith that bears no living Fruit; this is what St. <hi>James</hi> doth ſo much ſet himſelf againſt, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Faith if it hath not Works, is dead being alone:</hi> O ſee that your Faith be a living, working Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. On the other Hand, take heed of relying or truſting to your own Duties, Graces of Holineſs; <hi>Without Holineſs you can never ſee God,</hi> Heb. 12.14. and yet you muſt not truſt to, or make Saviours of your Holineſs, Faith looks only to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Take heed of confounding Faith with Obedience, as too many do; our Juſtification conſiſts in receiving from God, not giving any thing to him: Chriſt is offered in the New Covenant, Faith is the Hand whereby we receive Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Uſe of EXAMINATION<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let us ſearch our Hearts, whether we are made Partaker of this bleſſed Priviledge or no: But how ſhall I know that?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> If you are juſtified then your Sins are pardoned, and if your Sins are pardoned, Then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. You have been truly humbled and melted down for Sin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If your Sins are pardoned, you have abandoned and forſaken all Sin, and that both in Practice and Affection, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the Wicked forſake his Way, and the Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man his Thoughts, and return to the Lord, and he will have Mercy on him, and to our God, and he will abundantly pardon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A pardoned Soul hates all Sin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. <hi>How ſhall I do this great Wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> Pſal. 119.113. <hi>I hate vain Thoughts, but thy Law do I love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. A pardoned Soul is an humble Soul, <hi>i. e.</hi> One who hath very low Thoughts of himſelf, of Parts, Duties, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some Rules to know when you are Partakers of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; and if you believe in Chriſt then are you Partakers of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs. <hi>John</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath Everlaſting Life:</hi> Look well to your Faith that it be not Common, but a Special and Saving Faith.</p>
               <p>Now True Faith may be known.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the Manner, how the Holy Spirit works Faith in the Soul: The Spirit finds us <hi>dead,</hi> Eph. 1.2, 12. dark, blind, Enemies to God and Chriſt; his firſt Work is to <hi>Convince of Sin,</hi> John 16.8. Acts 2.37. He <hi>Enlightens the Mind,</hi> Eph. 4.23. He <hi>Bows the Will,</hi> Pſal. 110.3. makes the Soul willing to part with all Sin, and to have Chriſt upon his own Terms.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By its Activity for God and Holineſs: True Faith is obedient, the Language of Faith is, <hi>Lord, What wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Acts 9.6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Saying Faith is never alone, but always accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with all other Graces; as Love to God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Faith which works by Love;</hi> Self-denial, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Saving Faith is a prayerful Grace, ſo ſoon as <hi>Paul</hi> believes he prayeth; ſee in <hi>Jacob,</hi> how Faith ſpirits him in Prayer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.9, 10.</p>
