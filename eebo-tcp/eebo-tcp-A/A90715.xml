         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in Divinity. And therefore it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is likely that ſome will
ſay of me, as it was ſomtime ſaid of one, <hi>Thou art but
a ſtripling, but they are men of War from their youth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not to be encountred with by thee.</hi> And they will think it
more ſafer for me to be employed about meaner matters, of a lower
Nature, rather than to encounter with gyants. And (perhaps)
give me a nipping check, like that of <hi>Eliab</hi> to <hi>David;</hi> viz. <hi>Where
are thoſe few ſheep left in the Wilderneſs? It is thy pride that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
thee to come and ſee the battel.</hi> But my anſwer is as that which
then was made, <hi>What have I now done? Is there not a cauſe?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>There were Iſraelites on the one ſide that ſtood for the glory of
God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the lawful liberty of his children; and there were Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines
on the other ſide, that did defie Chriſt and his redeemed Ones,
and they had one great <hi>Goliah</hi> on whom they did caſt their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and he did approach towards the Iſraelites with reproach and
defiance, and yet thoſe Iſraelites remained in a kind of aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>Our condition is ſomwhat like theirs (if well examined.) And
although I am not furniſhed with ſuch complete Armour as ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(ſpiritual) Warriours are, yet if the ſtone of Iſrael be with me,
I ſhall have good ſucceſs; You know, a jaw-bone was but a ſtrange
peice of Armour, yet a thouſand Philiſtins could not ſtand againſt
it, for God was with it: And his riddle did occaſion the quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them; for they brake the Covenant of Garments and Sheets,
as ſome have done in a Covenant with me here.</p>
            <p>I will not compare my ſelf with any of thoſe Warriours: yet
give me leave to put forth a Riddle;</p>

            <head>THE
LAWFVLNESSE
OF THE
CELEBRATION
OF
CHRISTS
BIRTH-DAY
Debated, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the ſecond Chapter of the Goſpel by Saint
<hi>Luke,</hi> from the tenth verſe to the fourteenth
verſe, you may find, that the Angel of the
Lord, the ſame day that Chriſt Jeſus was born,
did incite the Shepherds to rejoyce, by reaſon
of the good tydings which he then the ſame
day brought them, concerning the Birth of Chriſt the Lord:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:116118:3"/>
And for their Example, and greater Encouragement
thereunto, the Lord our God had then the ſame day, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a multitude of holy Angels to begin the ſongs of praiſe
with joy, praiſing God, and ſaying, <hi>Glory to God in the Highest,
and on earth Peace, good will towards men.</hi> Yea, the firſt Angel
did render them an exceeding ſtrong reaſon to move their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and wills thereunto, in theſe words; <hi>For, unto you is born
(this day) a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi> From whence I
will note one thing by the way, from the ſpeedy delivery of this
meſſage to the Shepherds; That if it had not bin the Will of our
God, that that day ſhould be the day of their ſolemn joyous praiſe,
then the Angel might have divulged the Birth-day of our Saviour
afterwards only, and not ſoo ſpeedily in the ſame day of his Birth;
but he was ſpeedy in the delivery of his meſſage, and emphatical
in his expreſſion, <hi>viz. This Day is born unto you a Saviour, which
is Chriſt the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And very great reaſon there was that men ſhould then ſo rejoyce,
For, if the Angel told <hi>Zechariah</hi> that many ſhould rejoyce at the
birth of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt (who was but the fore-runner of Chriſt,
to prepare his way before him) as in Chap. 1. verſe 14. you may
ſee; then much more cauſe had the children of God had, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
at the Birth of Chriſt their Saviour.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I will obſerve what our Lord God hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be written (for our inſtruction in this particular,) by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt
S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> in Chap. 2. and ſome of the former verſes.
There we may ſee how the Lord God would cauſe the wiſe men,
of the Eaſt to honour Chriſt (being new-<hi>born)</hi> with precious
Gifts, Gold, Franckincenſe, and Myrrhe; yea you may ſee in
the ſecond verſe, that the Star that appeared unto them, did denote
to them his <hi>Birth;</hi> Theſe are the words, <hi>Where is he that is</hi> born <hi>King of the Iews? For we have ſeen his Star in the Eaſt, and are
come to worſhip him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This birth of Chriſt was much reſpected by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:116118:3"/>
as in the ninth chapter of his Propheſie doth appear; For he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it (by faith) admired it in theſe words, <hi>Behold, unto us a Child
is born!</hi> &amp;c. Many Scriptures might be brought in to prove the
excellent eſteem or account of his <hi>Birth.</hi> The Apoſtle took good
notice of the excellent reſemblance that is between Chriſts bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-birth,
and our ſpiritual-birth, as well as of his Circumciſion,
and our heart-circumciſion, and of his death, and our dying to
ſin, and of his reſurrection, and our riſing again to newneſs of life.
And farther, the excellencie of his birth was typified before-hand,
to be very much eſteemed of in a particular reſpect; For <hi>every male
that firſt opened the womb, was to be accounted holy to the Lord.</hi> And
if the type was to be accounted holy, then much more was the
thing typified to be eſteemed holy.</p>
            <p>Thus I have noted to you the meſſage of the angel to the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
inciting them to rejoyce, with the reaſon to move them
to perform that their duty; and alſo the example ſet before them, to
encourage them therein, by a multitude of Angels ſinging out his
praiſe, &amp; proclaming his Glory at his birth: And how the wiſe men
did honour him, being moved by a Star, denoting his birth in an
eſpecial manner. And how the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> admired and eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of it (he ſeeing it but by faith.) And how his birth was eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Types of it, <hi>viz. The firſt born male was to be eſteemed
holy to the Lord.</hi> Therefore I cannot but conclude, that Chriſts
Birth was to be eſteemed very highly by them then living, and
therefore that they were to rejoyce for that great bleſſing of God,
that ſame day of his birth, ſo many as could take notice of that day;
no man will deny this to be a truth, unleſs ſuch as are of a diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
ſpirit. And alſo that the birth of Chriſt is to be much eſteemed
by all thoſe that at any time afterwards do truſt for ſalvation
by him; as it was by them that lived at that time, and ſo rejoyced
in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But a queſtion is made,</hi> Whether it be to be celebrated annually,
and ſolemnly with ſuch joy for ever after, if in caſe his birth-day
be known to us now, as it was to them then; or whether that inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
given by the Angel to the Shepherds, belongs to us Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ſucceſſively and annually, or no?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:116118:4"/>
Firſt, I anſwer, that it concerneth us now, as much as it did thoſe
ſhepherds, and others then living and believing in him: For the
chief reaſon or cauſe of their joy at his Birth, was from the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
which by and from him they were to receive, who then, and
at that time was newly born: and we that do believe in him, do
obtain the ſame benefit by his birth, as they did that then rejoyced
in him; and therefore it needed not to be commanded in expreſs
words ſucceſſively.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſome object farther,</hi> That when the Jews were to keep any
day ſucceſſively and annually for the remembrance and ſolemn
Thanks-giving for any ſpecial benefit received; they then were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
to do it by Gods ſpecial command ſucceſſively and annually.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer plainly, That thoſe benefits did concern them
in ſome temporal deliverances, and were for that particular people
only, or chiefly at the moſt; as the Iſraelites deliverance out of
Aegypt, and their deliverance from an intended ſlaughter in the
time of Queen <hi>Heſter,</hi> &amp;c. But this Birth of Chriſt concerneth all
Believers in all places, to the end of the World: for ſo ſaith the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
<hi>Behold, I bring you good tydings of great joy, that ſhall be to all
people, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore it being for the good of all Believers in
Chriſt, of all ſorts of people to the end of the world, it belongeth
to all Believers in Chriſt to rejoyce for the Birth of Chriſt, as it did
belong to them to rejoyce that were then living; for the meſſage
is belonging to us, as much as it was to them; in as much as the
good tydings belongeth to all people: And therefore it being for
the good of all Believers to the end of the World, the Angel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
our greater attention and admiration, by this word, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
Behold, I bring you good Tydings of great joy that ſhall be to</hi>
all <hi>People, for unto you is</hi> born this day, &amp;c. <hi>a Saviour, which is
Chriſt the Lord.</hi> And we read of no command from God for the
keeping of the new-Purim, but it is noted as well done by them
&amp;c. And that it ought annually to be celebrated with joy we may
collect farther by reaſon, that it ought ſo to be; For if great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
deliverances deſerved annual thankſ-givings on ſome ſpecial
daies, then doth an everlaſting deliverance from damnation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
much more ſuch manner of thanks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:116118:4"/>
               <hi>But it is farther objected,</hi> That all Believers in Chriſt, do give
thanks for that great mercy of God (as they do for all other his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits)
upon the Lords daies in ſpecial, and upon all ordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer thus, ſo were the Jews to do upon their ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,
for all their temporal deliverances; as for their deliverance
from Egyptian Bondage, and <hi>Hamans</hi> decree of their death; and
yet they had their feaſt of <hi>Paſſeover</hi> and <hi>Purim,</hi> to commemorate
thoſe deliverances more ſpecially; and we have ſpecial daies ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
for us to praiſe the Lord for our deliverances from the Spaniſh
Invaſion, and the Gun-powder Treaſon; and alſo for many deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances,
from divers great dangers in theſe our times of War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it is objected again,</hi> That we do not know certainly what day
in our yeer Chriſts birth-day can be celebrated, as the right and
true annual day, it being not certainly known; or at the leaſt, it is
queſtioned by many Learned Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, firſt, That it is not ſo great a matter whether
we know (ſtrictly) the day or no; ſo as we do ſolemnize one day
thankfully, ſo neer the true day as we can gueſs; for in ſuch a caſe
we ſhall be accepted: for ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>God accepteth the
willing mind of his children for the deed, (which endeavoureth to
perform according to their knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, if in caſe we do know the day ſtrictly, yet it is not
abſolutely neceſſary for us to keep it upon that day alwaies <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
for the Jews did not keep their <hi>Purim</hi> upon the ſame day of
the Yeer wherein their Deliverance was given them, but as
on the next Day after; as you may ſee in the Book of <hi>Eſther,</hi>
the ninth Chapter, and the ſixteenth verſe to the two and
twentienth. And Chriſt Jeſus himſelf did excuſe <hi>David</hi> for
eating the Shew-Bread in his great (neceſſity:) And he
excuſed his owne Diſciples for plucking the eares of Corne
upon the Sabbath Day, &amp;c. upon their neceſſity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
was the ancient Proverb verified, <hi>viz. Neceſſity hath no
Law.</hi> We are neceſſitated to obſerve a day neer the day of Chriſts
Birth.</p>
            <p>And the Paſſeover was to be eaten in the firſt moneth, as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116118:5"/>
you may ſee in <hi>Exodus</hi> 12. 2, 3. &amp;c. Nevertheleſſe if you
look in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 2, 3. compared with verſes the 13. and
15. you may there finde that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and his People kept it
(at that time) in the ſecond moneth, contrary to the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
(in that particular,) and the reaſon is there rendred,
<hi>viz.</hi> that they could not keep it at that time in the firſt
moneth; And yet they were accepted of God too, as in the
20. verſe you may ſee. And although it be ſaid in the laſt
verſe now quoted, that <hi>Hezekiah prayed for the people,</hi> and
that <hi>the Lord healed them;</hi> which implyeth, that God was
offended with them: You ſhall ſee that the reaſon thereof
was for their not preparing themſelves better when they did
come, (as in the 18. verſe you may ſee) for they came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparedly
to that holy Sacrament.</p>
            <p>If it be queſtioned whether we may keep it Feſtivally or
not? I anſwer, We may and ought ſo to do: (though not
in exceſſe thereof,) but firſt we are to be exerciſed in the uſe
of the publike Ordinances, as the preaching and hearing the
Word, and in Godly prayers and praiſes, &amp;c. and after that
in plentifull feaſting, and giving gifts to the poor according
to our ſeveral abilities: for though Faſting be for mourners,
yet Feaſting is for joy and mirth, as you may ſee in the 8.
chapter of the book of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> the former part of that
chapter to the 13 verſe, theſe are thoſe words, <hi>Eat the fat,
and drink the ſweet, and ſend portions to thoſe for whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is prepared,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the joy of the Lord is your ſtrength:</hi>
And the Jewes <hi>Purim</hi> was kept feſtivally, as in the ninth
chapter doth appear, in verſes the 19, 20. 22.</p>
            <p>But it is objected again, that the name that is given to the
day, or the manner of its celebration is now juſtly excepted
againſt, for it is called <hi>Chriſt-maſſe day,</hi> which cauſeth us to
beleeve that it was inſtituted by the Pope, or at the leaſt
thus named by the Pope, for his ſervice which he pretendeth
to Chriſt, is called <hi>Maſſe,</hi> or at leaſt, much of his ſervice is
ſo called.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:116118:5"/>
To this I anſwer briefly, that it is not taken for a bad ſervice
in its ſignification, but indifferently for either bad or good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
(as ſome affirm) and ſome one word may have divers ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications;
And beſides it is by ſome Expoſitors taken for an heap
and greatneſſe in quantitie, and ſo we often now uſe the word,
as a maſſe of money, and the like: but it was taken (as ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm)
to diſmiſſe an aſſembly with a bleſſing, called <hi>miſſa.</hi> And
beſides if the name were given to a bad intent at the firſt (which
I do not beleeve) if in caſe the Pope firſt gave this name to it,
(for the firſt Popes were ſuch as did accompany us in the way to
ſalvation, and were not ſo bad as in latter times they have been,
and now are) yet may we not omit ſo great a duty of joyous
praiſe as the celebration of ſo great a mercy is, becauſe ſome
have caſt in ſome evill weed into it; but refine it again that it
may be better ſpirituall nutriment. And therefore take this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> who did not caſt away all the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
which had ſome gourds of the wilde Vine in it, but did put
in ſome meal that might over-powre the killing ſtrength of the
gourds of that wilde vine, as you may ſee 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 38. to 42.
Therefore if the name offend you, you may take as quick a way
to alter that fault, as the Anabaptiſts do in a thing not ſo war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
as this; for they can provide a new name againſt their
next waſhing.</p>
            <p>But it is further objected, that of late time this feaſting hath
been abuſed, by exceſſe therein, and many vicious actions have
been committed in that day we lately ſo celebrated to that end
we now plead ſo much for; and therefore it ought to be no more
obſerved as a day of joyous feaſting in the remembrance of the
birth of Chriſt our Saviour.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer: Thus the beſt things have been abuſed, as
namely, the Lords day it ſelf; but many things which are abuſed
may not be taken away or made void, but the abuſes purged
from them, as I ſaid before concerning the name of the day; for,
though ſome things may be taken away, or ſuſpended when
they are much abuſed, yet ſuch things whoſe loſſe will produce
very great ill conſequences may not be made void; for in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we ſhall, loſe many good ſubſtances which are maintained
and preſerved by ſome means that are of leſſe concernment, (in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116118:6"/>
themſelves conſidered) and eſpecially it is very dangerous to
clip off the ſpeciall occaſioning of the remembring of ſo great a
mercy, as the celebration of the birth of ſo dear a Saviour.</p>
            <p>And if we clip off ſo great a commemoration of Chriſts birth
now, it will make way to the neglecting of ſome other the like
mercy another time; and ſo (ere long be) we ſhall (through the
diſpleaſure of our God) loſe all good occaſions of our ſpeciall
thankfulneſſe to our God for his ſending of Chriſt in the fleſh.
Selah.</p>
            <p>The eſpeciall celebration of Chriſts birth-day (though uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
known) doth ſtrengthen our faith concerning his humain
nature, or of his taking it in, and of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> contrary to
the hereſie of divers Hereticks, as the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> &amp;c. and very
likely it was therefore ſo ſpecially divulged by the Angel (as
Gods meſſenger) to be noted, and celebrated with joy by thoſe
ſhepheards, and alſo performed by the multitude of Angels, as
an example to men on earth, to preſerve the Saints from the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies
of thoſe Hereticks, as are mentioned by St. <hi>John</hi> in his 1.
Epiſtle, Chap. 4. 1, 2, 3. and his 2d. Epiſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. For, that men
may be aſſured that he took his humane nature in, and of the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and not otherwiſe, therefore his birth is expreſſed
by name, in theſe words, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you is born,</hi> &amp;c. And becauſe they
ſhould rejoyce for it timely, therefore the time is made known
to them alſo, in theſe words, <hi>This day.</hi> And leſt they ſhould not be
incited or moved thereunto by the bare promulgation, therfore
their welfare in him, is divulged unto them, in this word <hi>Saviour;</hi>
And that they might not think, that it ſhould be to them onely,
they are therefore certified that the benefit belonged to all ſorts
of people. And becauſe he was to ſave them from their ſins, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was <hi>tydings of great joy,</hi> (ſaid the Angel.) And that they
might take the greater notice of this ſo great a mercy, therefore
the Angel prepareth their attention with this word, <hi>Behold, Behold
I bring you tydings of great joy,</hi> &amp;c. Thus we may ſee how the all-ſufficient
fore-knowing God hath provided for us a ſpeciall
means to ſtrengthen our faith, concerning the humane nature of
our Saviour, taking it in, and from the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> againſt all
thoſe hereticall ſeducings of men (that afterwards were to deny
the ſame) by noting his birth to the ſhepherds for its joyfull ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116118:6"/>
And ſurely (as it is reported) the <hi>Polonians</hi> do kneel
at the receiving of the Sacrament of the body and blood of
Chriſt, becauſe many <hi>Arrians</hi> deny him to be God. So we may
upon the like reaſon, and with a better warrant, ſolemnize the
commemoration of Chriſts birth, becauſe many now begin to
queſtion his humanitie; I ſay upon better warrant: <hi>viz:</hi> from the
Angel his inciting the Shepherds to rejoyce at his birth, and the
multitude of the heavenly hoſt promulgating of their exemplary
praiſes, for that tranſcendent gift, given for the everlaſting joy
of all (ſorts of) people. And alſo, from the Shepherds exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
gloryfying, and praiſing God, as they returned from that
joyfull ſight of Chriſt then new born, as appears <hi>ver.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>And ſurely the chief queſtion is (by our Chriſtians that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the celebration of a day in commemoration of his birth)
whether we may ſet apart ſome ſpeciall day for a joyous and
feſtivall celebration of his birth, or whether we ought to do it
onely in the generall; And me thinks it is a very weak queſtion
for wiſe and knowing men to make, the premiſes wel conſidered.</p>
            <p>And you may take notice that the children of Iſrael (being
enjoyned to offer divers offerings) might offer ſome offerings
over and above to the Lord of their own voluntary will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
as thank-offerings, and the like, as you may ſee in <hi>Levit.</hi>
22. 29. and Chap. 6. 16. And they might make ſome vows to do,
or not to do ſome things, and therefore <hi>David</hi> inciteth us to it in
<hi>Pſal</hi> 50. 14. in theſe words, <hi>Offer unto God thanksgiving, and pay thy
vows to the moſt high.</hi> And in <hi>Coloſ. 27. Paul</hi> will have us to abound
in thankſgiving. And likewiſe they might offer ſome burnt-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of their voluntary free will without any ſtrict injunction
in that particular, as in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 31. you may ſee. And in the
New Teſtament it is ſaid, that <hi>Paul</hi> had a vow; and in <hi>Acts</hi> 21.
23 it is ſaid, that there were <hi>foure men that had a vow on them;</hi> for,
we have liberty to vow to humble and afflict our ſouls (as they
of the Jews had) when we pleaſe, (upon divers occaſions) as in
<hi>Numb.</hi> 30. 13. and <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 23. &amp;c. And ſo likewiſe have we liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to give thanks with joy to God particularly, and ſpecially,
upon divers occaſions concurring, and ſolemnly too; For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
all kinds of ſacrifices might not be offered at mans
choice of times, yet ſome kinds of ſacrifices might be offered at
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116118:7"/>
mans choice, and choice of times (for the more part) and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
of their free will onely, as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 23. What think
you of that which the Iſraelites did in the time of the Reign of
King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> as in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 23. you may read; for they kept
other ſeven dayes feſtivally to the Lord, after they had kept the
feaſt of the Paſſeover; And that 7. dayes feaſt; was of their own
free will and affections, by their own counſell, ſaith the text
there. And you may there perceive that the holy Ghoſt noteth
it to their commendation. And truly if this ſolemne joyous
thankfulneſſe in a feſtivall way, was ſo acceptable to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ſpeciall command, then much more will the joyous, and
thankfull celebration of Chriſts birth-day in a feſtivall way be
acceptable upon a more warrantable ground, namely, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
from God by his holy Angel to the ſhepherds (at firſt)
to rejoyce for a great good, given for the good of (all) people;
for we muſt abound in thankſgiving, and rejoyce evermore; theſe
being our ſpirituall ſacrifices, as thoſe corporall ſacrifices were
for them then. Beſides all this alreadie premiſed, let us take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the great inconveniences that cometh to the Civill State
of the whole Kingdom, by the endeavouring to overthrow the
joyous obſervation of this birth-day of our Saviour; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in theſe times wherein the State ſtandeth ſo fickle, wicked
men being apt to make an inſurrection upon the leaſt occaſion:
and much more upon ſuch an occaſion as this, wherein ungodly
men may procure ſo great a partie of better men to joyne with
them, though not to ſo bad an end, but, in an holy indignation;
for many of thoſe that love Chriſt, with a well-informed judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in this particular, upon the conſideration of the great love
that Chriſt hath ſhewed to them, in coming to be their Saviour,
taking fleſh in and of the Virgin: will be apt to be jealous of the
loſſe of the occaſion of the eſpeciall remembring of his coming
in the fleſh. And beſides, wicked men will be forward to take this
occaſion as a cloak to put on to make a par<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie for a worse end,
when they ſee the obſervation thereof ſo much oppoſed.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is fitting that we i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> itate the Apoſtle in the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off occaſion from them that ſeek occaſion (to do wickednes
and miſchief) and eſpecially in a matter that is ſo clearly law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and convenient too, as the ſpeciall giving of thanks with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116118:7"/>
joy is, or as the joyous celebration of Chriſts birth-day is to the
Spouſe of Chriſt. For, although the Leviticall-ceremoniall daies,
times, months, and yeers, are aboliſhed, being but types of thoſe
things that are fulfilled by Chriſt: as is mentioned in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 10.
ſee <hi>v.</hi> 3. yet the ſame Apoſtle affirmeth confidently, that he that
thinketh he may not ſet apart ſome dayes now under the Goſpel
to celebrate Evangelicall duties, as hearing the Word, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Sacraments, and offering the ſacrifice of ſpeciall
thankſgivings for ſome ſpeciall mercies of God, is as weak as he
that thinketh that he may eat but hearbs, as you may ſee in
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>And therefore I entreat all well affected people to uſe their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to get vitious men to be reſtrained from their abuſing
of themſelves, and the time, to the diſhonour of our Saviour, the
wounding of their own ſouls to everlaſting death, and to the
ſcandalizing of good men, and the perverting of others.</p>
            <p>And this may be done ſometimes by gentle means, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by chaſtiſements, and puniſhments, provided that the fault
be a notorious ſin, or at the leaſt more then an ordinary blemiſh;
for I know that ſome make mountains of mole-hils (comparing
one ſin to another) againſt ſome men.</p>
            <p>And truly I beleeve that ſome do rejoyce to ſee ſome men tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe
againſt God in that day, becauſe they would thereby take
an occaſion to make the obſervation of it to be odious to ſome
that may be a mean to take it quite away; out of a malignant
ſpirit towards the obſervers of it. I hope better of many. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you to conſider, that when men are reſtrained from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
of timely recreation, they then (for a time) will be the
more unruly when firſt they come to obtain it again; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
from youths, and young raw-manner'd men; as it is with
horſes and cows that have been ſtalled up, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If we under the Goſpel be not afforded daies of refreſhing, yea,
and ſomewhat often too, we ſhall be in greater bondage (in this
kinde) then the Jews in or under the Old Teſtament; for they
had many feſtivals, and they were much refreſhed by them; ſhall
we be in greater bondage to labour then they were? And ſhall
not we have liberty from ſparing dye<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, for feaſting, as well as
they? They feaſted divers dayes together, ſometimes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116118:8"/>
love and good will was the better occaſioned in many that
were godly; and we may do ſo too; though not with all the
ſame ceremonies as they did, becauſe not altogether to the ſame
end as they did; And at ſuch times the poore may be the more
eaſily relieved, and give thanks to God, and pray for us. And by
this means men will not be ſo forward to borrow ſo much of
the Sabbath, or Lords day to prophane it as (perhaps) now they
do, when they ſhall have other convenient time, for their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
recreation.</p>
            <p>I do confeſſe that ſome things that are lawfull to be obſerved
and celebrated, may (for a time) be ſuſpended, and not celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
provided that it be not forborn as a thing unlawfull, but as
a thing inconvenient; as to prevent a farther miſchief for the
preſent time; but if that which in it ſelf is lawfull, be forborn as
a thing unlawfull, then will honeſt knowing men be offended,
and ſo it will breed a great diſturbance in the State; evill men
taking that occaſion as a fair cloak to put on, for to begin a
quarrell; and ſo incite ſome better men to take part with them
(though not ayming at the ſame end); therefore it is fitting that
men be taught how to diſtinguiſh between things lawfull, and
things unlawfull; and between thoſe things that are ſo lawfull
as that they may not be diſpenſed with, ſo as to neglect the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
thereof at the inſtant time; and thoſe things that may
be diſpenſed with for a time to prevent ſome great miſchief.</p>
            <p>And now I will note (to thoſe that ſhall either read or hear
the premiſes in this little Tract) ſome of the particulars contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the ſame, for their better remembring what I have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
ſpelling.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the celebration of Chriſts birth with joy was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated
to the Shepherds, becauſe he was born to them a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that they had an example ſet before them to lead
them on to the performance of that their duty, by a multitude
of Angels ſinging out his glory at his birth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that his birth was much reſpected by the Prophet
<hi>Iſaiah,</hi> he ſeeing it but by faith.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that the Wiſemen of the Eaſt were ſent by the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
providence of God, by a ſpeciall Star, to honour Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
new born.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:116118:8"/>
Fifthly, that becauſe the Angel told <hi>Zachariah</hi> that many
ſhould rejoyce at the birth of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, (who was but the
fore-runner of Chriſt) therefore, they were to rejoyce at the birth
of Chriſt their Saviour much more.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, that it is our dutie to rejoyce for the birth of Chriſt
as much as it was their duty ſo to do, becauſe the benefit of his
birth belongeth to us as much as it did unto them then; for the
tydings of joy by reaſon of the birth of our Saviour Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to all thoſe that at any time did, do, or ſhall beleeve in him,
as ſaid the Angel.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, divers queſtions are anſwered, as, firſt whether we
are, or ought, to keep it annually and ſucceſſively, in caſe the day
of his birth be known to us annually in the ſtrict time.</p>
            <p>Eightly, whether we ought, or may, keep the celebration of
Chriſts birth as neer the annuall day, as may be, if in caſe the
ſtrict time be not known to us as it was to thoſe Shepherds then
living at his birth, &amp;c. and many the like queſtions.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, that if in caſe there had been no command given for
the joyous celebration of his birth, yet we may do it at our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of choice which is left us by the will of God; for I have
proved, that as the Jews might afflict their ſouls voluntarily (as
they had occaſions) ſo they might rejoyce, and offer thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
at their own free will ſolemnly without any ſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
(at ſome convenient time) at their own choice.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, I have proved, that the Jews in the dayes of King
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> did keep ſeven dayes with joyous feaſting to the Lord,
by their own counſell, after they had kept the Paſſeover, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any command from God ſo to do; And yet the holy Ghoſt
noteth it as acceptable, and therefore it is an example for us to
do the like. And if we kept more dayes evangelically holy, we
ſhould not ſin in ſo doing.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, I have noted divers reaſons for the keeping of the
celebration of his birth-day, as to prevent us from being ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the hereſie of thoſe that did (and perhaps now do) deny
that Chriſt came in the fleſh; and that he did not take it in and
of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, I have noted divers other inconveniences that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116118:9"/>
may hap to the Civill State by our not obſerving it in times of
diviſions (in ſome caſes,) and therefore the premiſes well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
(eſpecially with the leave of Authority) I will conclude
with the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5. 8. though he ſpake it in
a ſpirituall way, <hi>Let us keep the Feaſt, not with old leaven, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the leaven of malice and wickedneſſe: but with
the unleavened bread of ſinceritie and truth.</hi> Thus
let ſtrength bear down weakneſſe.</p>
