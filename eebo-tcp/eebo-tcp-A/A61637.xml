            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat S. <hi>Hierom</hi> observ'd long
since concerning this Book of
Psalms, <hi>Titulos esse Claves;</hi>
that the Title is usually the
true Key of <hi>David,</hi> to set
open the Psalm to us, and
to let us in to the true Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of it; he learn'd probably from a
former Author, (with who's Writings he was
in his younger years much delighted)<note place="margin">Orig. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>local. p. 59</note> 
               <hi>Origen</hi> I
mean: Who in his Tomes upon the Psalms,
discoursing of some Obscurities in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50652:3"/>
and the proper Remedies thereof, gives
us yet a more ancient Tradition, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
(as he saith) from a learned Jew; That
the whole Body of Scripture is like a great
House, in which are several Appartments, and
therein many Rooms shut up, and in them again
many Cabinets, and Boxes lockt down: Nor
hangs the proper Key at every Door, but they
lie scatter'd here, and there, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd;
so that it requires some pains, and
skill to find them out, and apply them aright.
Thus the Key of the Prophetick Scripture lies in
the Historical, where we often find both the
Occasion of the Prophecy, and the Event too;
and that proves usually the best Interpreter.
Thus the Acts of the Apostles, which contein
the Peregrinations, and Gests of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> are
a great Master-Key to open his Epistles, and to
unlock to us many things, hard otherwise to be
understood in them. And thus in the present
Instance, <hi>David</hi>'s History is the proper Key to
<hi>David</hi>'s Psalter; and so the Books of <hi>Samuel,</hi>
the <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Chronicles,</hi> the best, and most
authentick Commentary upon the <hi>Psalms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this now before us, lest we should mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
the Spirit of God hath hung the Key at
the Door, or at least pointed us whence to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50652:3"/>
fetch it: and while the Title dates it from the
Cave, we are plainly directed to 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiv.
There we find the holy Man in a great streit of
Affliction; wandring like an Exile, or Bandito
in the Wilderness of <hi>Engedi;</hi> the few Men he
had, stragling, and shifting for themselves upon
the Rocks of the wild Goats; implacable <hi>Saul</hi>
in the mean time with five times his Number
so closely pursuing him, that he is forc'd to
take shelter in the Cave: And there being shut
up from the Sight of Heaven, and light of the
Sun, and as it were buried alive in that obscure
Dungeon, surrounded with Danger on every
side, and little Hope left him of escaping with
his Life; 'tis then that he sighs out his <hi>Al-tas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chith,</hi>
(as this, and the two following Psalms
are entitled) <hi>Oh destroy me not utterly,</hi> (so the
Word signifies) <hi>but let me live to praise thy
Name;</hi> 'tis then, that by a vigorous Faith he
flies to the tender Mercies of God, as to his
only City of Refuge: and reposing himself in
the Bosom of the Divine Goodness by Acts of
Faith, and Devotion, and of perseverance in
both, he doth exactl, and precisely that which
We all are enjoyn'd to do this Day: he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores
the Mercies of God in the Protection
of himself, and in him of those that belong to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50652:4"/>
him; <hi>Be merciful unto me, O God,</hi> (saith he)
<hi>be merciful unto me, for my Soul trusteth in thee;
yea, in the shadow of thy Wings will I make my
Refuge, until these Calamities be overpast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that, the proper business of this Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
visibly stampt in great Letters upon the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
of the Day, and that by the Hand of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Authority it self; and the Lines of the
Text too running so parallel all along, and so
commensurate to those of the Day, (upon
which Ground the whole Psalm was very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
selected as one of the proper Psalms for
the Office of the Day:) I may hope in some
Degree to discharge my Duty to both of them,
by treating of these two things; <hi>What God's
Protection is;</hi> and <hi>What we are to do,</hi> that
we may be qualifi'd, and prepar'd aright, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully
to implore the Mercy of that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
In Order whereunto, I will consider
the Text in a twofold Reference.</p>
            <p>I. As it looks down from God to us-ward in
gracious and powerful Protections: and so it
speaks our great Honour, and Happiness, the
high, and glorious Privilege of pious Kings,
and their Kingdoms, that they are under the
Shadow of God's Wings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:50652:4"/>
II. As it looks up in another Aspect from Us
to God again; and so it contains our necessary,
and indispensable Duty; and calls aloud for
our suitable Deportment; which is resolvedly
to put our selves under the Divine Protection,
or to seek, and make our Refuge under the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of his Wings.</p>
            <p>I. I begin with the high and glorious Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of all holy Souls, but especially of
pious Kings, and their Kingdoms; They are
under the shadow of God's Wings. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
frequently occurs in Scripture, and
may seem to speak these three things, or some
of them; which together will give you, I think,
the full Extent of the shadow of God's Wings,
the adequate Importance of this illustrious
Metaphor.</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1.) Safeguard, and Defence from Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that they come not. Or</item>
               <item>(2.) Speedy Help, and Deliverance out of
Calamities, when they are come. Or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever</item>
               <item>(3.) Comfort in the mean time, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment
in Calamities, while they are upon us.</item>
            </list>
            <p>(1.) The Priviledge of Safety, and Protection
from Calamities stands first in our Method: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50652:5"/>
here in a threefold Expression; A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
a Shadow, and the shadow of Wings.</p>
            <p>1.) And what is a Refuge, (which is the first,)
but a place of Security, either in regard of its
secrecy to hide us, or its strength to defend us,
to which we flie, when Calamity threatens us?
And such is God to his People; a City of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
an inviolable Sanctuary; an Altar of
Mercy, to which we may flie, and be safe,
and from the Horns whereof no bold Calamity
shall dare to pluck us, without his special
Commission. Or in another Reference, a
place of Refuge is a Covert from Storm, and
Rain, <hi>Es. IV.</hi> 6. and as it follows there in the
same Verse,</p>
            <p>2.) A Tabernacle for a Shadow too in the
Day-time from the Heat, which is the second
Expression. The <hi>Emphasis</hi> whereof is far
better understood in those intemperate Climats,
where the Sun-beams are scorching, and the
Heats insufferable. Nothing there more desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
than a shady Grove, or a deep Grot,
the Sun never looks into, or the Shadow of a
great Rock in a weary Land. Which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections,
because the Pilgrim-<hi>Israelites</hi> wanted
in the Wilderness, God supplied it to them,
by spreading a Cloud over them for a Covering
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50652:5"/>
in the Day-time,<note place="margin">Ps. CV. 39.</note> (as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks,) and
God was in that Cloud; so that for forty years
together they marcht, and encampt under his
shady Wings, I had almost said, without a
Metaphor. And still whenever the Sun of
Persecution,<note place="margin">Jac. I. 11.</note> or other Calamity ariseth upon us
with burning Heat, God can exempt, whom he
thinks good, and send them times of Refreshing
from the presence of the Lord: so that, while
the World is all on fire about them, they
journey through that torrid Zone, with their
mighty <hi>Parasol,</hi> or <hi>Umbrella</hi> over their Heads,
and are all the while in the shade.</p>
            <p>And yet every Shade is not a safe protection.
<hi>Umbra aut Nutrix, aut Noverca est,</hi>
               <note place="margin">L. 17. c. 12.</note> saith <hi>Pliny:</hi>
And all the Naturalists tell us, that the shadow
of some Trees is unwholsom; of others dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Ay there is a shadow of Death too in
Scripture Language; and you have heard of
the Shades of Hell it self. And therefore to
distinguish this benign, and saving protection
from those black, and dismal Shades, here is
yet a further, and a higher <hi>Emphasis;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3.) 'Tis in the third place <hi>Umbra Alarum,</hi> a
Shadow of Wings: An Expression borrow'd
from Birds, and Fowls, that brood, and foster
their young Ones under them. The Wing of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50652:6"/>
the Dam is both the Midwife, and the Nurse;
it brings forth the Chickens, and it brings them
up too. So Providence is both the Womb,
that bare us, and the Paps, that give us suck.
The Wing is not only, as the Shade, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
from the Heat; but a more universal
Defence against all the Injuries, and Incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencies
of the Air. Is it too hot? The Wing
casts off a cool Shade. Or is it too cold? The
Wing affords a warm Covering. Are the
Younglings frighted with a Storm? The Wing
is a ready Shelter. Doth the Kite, or Hawk,
the Tyrants, and Freebooters of the Air, hover
over and threaten? The Wing is a safe Retreat.
And thus <hi>in sacris Domini Defensionibus,</hi> as <hi>Cassian</hi>
speaks; in God, and his holy Protections we
have All.</p>
            <p>That our Troubles are not long since grown
too hot for us, 'tis because He cools, and allaies
them. That our Comforts do not grow cold,
and die away in our Bosoms; 'tis because he
warms, and reinforceth them. That we have
heard it bluster abroad for so many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a formidable Tempest, which hath
drench'd, and drown'd so great a part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom
in Blood, and yet the Storm hath
hitherto flown over us: That the Clouds have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50652:6"/>
been gathering at home too, and so long hung
black o're our Heads, and yet not powr'd
themselves forth in showers of Vengeance:
That <hi>Gebal,</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Amaleck,</hi> and the
Rest; that Hell, and <hi>Rome,</hi> and their Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans,
our Enemies on all Hands, both foreign,
and domestick, have been so long confederate
against us, saying, <hi>Come, and let us root them
out, that they be no more a People,</hi> that the Name of
the Reformed Church of <hi>England</hi> may be no
more in Remembrance; that they have so often
lookt grim, and four, and roar'd, and rampt
upon us, and yet not been able to seize us;
to what can we justly ascribe all this, but to
the gracious protections of God's shady Wings
spread over us?</p>
            <p>'Tis pity, Brethren, we are not more deeply
apprehensive of it, since so it is. We sit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
in the Lap, and Arms of Providence:
She is at once our Fortress, and our Store-house:
'Tis to her we owe both our Defence, and
Supplies; our Safety, and our Abundance:
That we ever had any good thing in this World,
whether Personal, or National, 'tis because
we have suckt the Breasts of her Consolations:
And that we keep, and enjoy any thing, (while
our Soul is among Lions, while we dwell in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50652:7"/>
the midst of <hi>cruel,</hi> and <hi>blood-thirsty Men,</hi> as
holy <hi>David</hi> complains a little below my Text;)
'tis because we sit under the shadow of her
Wings. And since we are for all this so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt
to forget her, and to pride our selves in
Bulwarks of our own projecting; God hath
seem'd oftentimes, and now again of late, to
be about to dismantle all, and to teach us this
Lesson at the dearest Rate, if we will not
learn it better cheap, That we cannot be safe
out of his protection; that the shadow of his
Wings is our best, nay our only Refuge: and
that whether we take a Refuge for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of Secrecy, or for the protection of
Strength. Of which much might be said,
would the time permit it: But so much briefly
of the first Priviledge, that of Safeguard, and
protection from Calamities, that they come
not upon us. I hast to the second;</p>
            <p>(2.) If Calamities do come, (and who is
wholly exempt from that common Tax, and
Tribute of Mortality?) the Expression speaks
Assistance too, and timely Deliverance out of
them. Wings in the common Notion of the
World signifie Speed, and Activity;

'Tis therefore, that we give the Winds Wings,
and the Angels too; as being the swift Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of God, the nimble <hi>Mercuries</hi> of Heaven.
'Tis therefore too, that when God appears sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
to deliver his afflicted People, he is

or to come flying to them upon the Wings of
the Wind, or to carry them off into safety on
the Wings of an Eagle. Birds do not only cover
their young Ones under their Wings within the
Neast: If the Seat prove dangerous, they take
them up too on their Wings, and carry them
off to a safer station.</p>
            <p>Ye have seen, what I have done for you,
(saith God to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation) <hi>how I bare you
upon Eagles Wings, and brought you to my self.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ex. XIX. 4.</note> As if
he had said, When you were in actual Bondage,

And may not God bespeak us too, the
People of <hi>England,</hi> in the same language?
When we were enslav'd at home, (and so in
worse than <hi>Egyptian</hi> Slavery) and our <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
and his proud Task-masters made even our
Lives bitter to us in hard Bondage, in Mortar,
and in Brick, to build up their own proud
<hi>Babels;</hi> when they had now kill'd, and also
taken possession, and divided the Spoil, and
said in a Frolick of their lusty pride, We have
devoured them, and there is no Hope for them
in their God: Then on the sudden, as an Eagle
stirreth up her Neast, and fluttereth over her
Young, and spreadeth abroad her Wings, (as
<hi>Moses</hi> speaks in his admirable Song) thus awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening,<note place="margin">Deut. XXXII. 11.</note>
and exciting their natural Activity,
and emboldening them to use it to the utmost;
and when that will not do, taketh them up
her self, and beareth them away upon her own
Wings: So here, The Lord alone did lead us,
and there was no Other with him; that's <hi>Moses</hi>'s
own Reddition: When our own Pinion prov'd
too weak, and all our faint Flutterings to no
purpose; then by a Miracle of Wisdom, Power,
and Goodness, he took us up to that gallant,
and wonderful Flight, even up to a higher
pitch, than we durst look, and made us to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50652:8"/>
ride upon the high Places of the Earth, and set
our Neast again amongst the Stars.</p>
            <p>And now, when restless, and unquiet Men
(the true Spawn of him,<note place="margin">Rev. XII. 4.</note> whose Tail drew the
third part of the Stars of Heaven, and cast
them to the Earth) would fain by their hellish
Plots, and Contrivances bring us down again
from thence, even down to the very Ground,
and lay all our Honour in the Dust: When by
their secret Machinations they are at Work on
all hands to hurry us back into the old Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
in Hope, that out of that disordered
Mass they may at length rear up a new World
of their own; (But what a World? A World
made up of a new Heaven of Superstitions, and
Idolatries; a new Earth too of Anarchy first,
and pretended Liberty, but of Tyranny insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable

State of Affairs as this, whether should we

the Serpent's Root shall never come forth an
Adder, to bite us, or a fiery flying Serpent, to
devour us. He will confound these <hi>Babel</hi>-builders,
with their City, and their Tower, or

Worship; their novel Modes, and Models of
Government in Church, and State) and scatter
them abroad from hence upon the Face of all
the Earth. Like as a Dream, when one awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth;
so shall he despise their Images, and

like a Snail, and become like the untimely
Fruit of a Woman, which shall never see the

And if hereupon we put our selves (as we
ought) under the saving Influences of his
Wings; he will either digest our Confusions
into greater Order, and Beauty than before;
or at least support, and chear us, while we lie
under them; which is the third, and last Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

(3.) Comfort, and Refreshment in Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
while they are upon us. For the Wing is
not only the Retreat of Safety from Calamities,
as in the first particular; Nor only the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Deliverance, out of Calamities, as in
the second: 'Tis also the Seat of Comfort, and
the Fountain of Refreshment, when they lie
heaviest upon us.</p>
            <p>And here I might spend the Hour with much
Delight; for the Prospect is fair, and large be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me. But I am sensible, that I have already
staid too long upon the first Head of Discourse
propounded; and so perhaps comply'd too
much with the common Humour, which loves
rather to be tickled, and amused with high Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
than instructed in necessary Duty. I
shall therefore make haste to seize what remains
of the Time, and improve it, to let you see,
That All, I have said hitherto, and the Much
more I might have said, upon that first Head of
Priviledges, signifies nothing at all, is all blank,
and Cypher to them, that go not on chearfully
to the Second, that of Duty.</p>
            <p>II. They that would be safe under God's
Wings, must not only please themselves with
the general Speculation, that Safety, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
is there to be had: They must also
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50652:10"/>
make their Refuge there, they must put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under the Shadow of those Wings by
their special Act, and Deed; must deliberately
chuse, and effectually place their last Resort
there; and if they will partake the Benefits,
must comply with the Obligations of such a
State. God is our Refuge, and our Strength,
saith holy <hi>David,</hi>

our Refuge by flying to him, before we can
hope, that he will be our Strength. In vain
do they dream of God's saving Protections,
that turn their Backs upon his Precepts, and
cast his Laws behind them. 'Tis true, God's
Altars are our Sanctuary; an inviolable <hi>Asylum</hi>
in our Sufferings, and in our Sorrows, in our
Calamities, and in our Dangers, for our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
and for our Infirmities: But are our
Crimes too priviledg'd, and protected there?
That were indeed to turn God's Temple into a
Den of Theeves, and Murderers, (the noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Abuse of the modern Sanctuaries;) and
to set up the <hi>Wing of Abominations</hi> (spoken of
by <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet) even in the <hi>Holy Place.</hi>
Nay but <hi>pluck them from mine Altars,</hi> (saith God)
or <hi>stay them there,</hi> that <hi>sin presumptuously,</hi> and
<hi>with a high hand.</hi> God will not be so merciful
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50652:11"/>
to those, that offend of malicious Wickedness,
as to receive them, with all their Sins about
them, under that sacred, and saving Protection.
The holy Dove broods not a Kite, or a
Vulture: They are Birds quite of another
Feather. If in good earnest we would be
foster'd, and cherisht under God's Wings; we
must first be hatcht into his Likeness, and
Similitude, be renewed after his Image, and
be made partakers in some Measure of the
Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>To hover no longer in Generalities; the
fruitful Metaphor of the Text, as you have
distinctly seen it big with our Priviledge; so
to qualifie us for that, 'tis as remarkably preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with our Duty also. Among the Rest,
it clearly suggests to us in three noble Instances
of our Duty so many apt, and proper Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,
to fit, and prepare us for God's Wing.
(1.) A pious Trust, and Confidence in God.
(2.) A fervent Devotion toward God, and his
holy Worship in his Temple. And (3.) a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
unwearied perseverance in both the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
for 'tis <hi>Donec transierint,</hi> until these Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
be overpast. And</p>
            <p>(1.) For Trust, and Affiance in God, 'tis vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
That to fly under God's Wings, and to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50652:11"/>
make him our Refuge, and to trust in him, are
parallel Phrases, which expound one another;
and differ only, as the same sense clad in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor,
and stript of it again. And therefore
some Versions, both ancient, and modern,
translate the Text,<note place="margin">Chald. Engl. Gen.</note> 
               <hi>Under the shadow of thy
Wings will I trust.</hi> 'Twere happy for us, were
this Duty of Trust in God but as visibly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
into our practice, as 'tis originally le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
in the Text. We all pretend high in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and put on a fair Semblance here too;
<hi>I believe in God</hi> is our daily Language: But, as
one saith well, <hi>Non est strepitus Oris, sed Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,
&amp; Devotio Cordis:</hi> Lip-labour will not
serve the turn; it must go deeper, even to the
Ground of the Heart. Would we put in then
for <hi>David</hi>'s share in the Priviledge, God's
Mercy, and Protection to our King, and to
our selves? We must labour then for a Trust
like <hi>David</hi>'s: <hi>Be merciful to me ô God,</hi> (saith he)
<hi>for my Soul trusteth in thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To bring you to the Test then; The Trust
that may be trusted to, and that will stand
us in stead, when Calamities invade, or
threaten us, must have these three Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
'Tis founded, and prepared in Self Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence;
'Tis carried on, and exercis'd in active
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50652:12"/>
Diligence; And lastly 'tis consummate in full,
and perfect Resignation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> 'Tis founded, and prepar'd in deep
Self-Diffidence, and Distrust; in a clear Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renunciation
of our selves, and all worldly
Dependences. The Chickens are weak; and
helpless in themselves; and, as if they knew
it too, stay not to combat the Kite, nor stand
the dreadful shock, when the Hawk hovers
over, and is ready to stoop upon them; but
run nimbly under the Dam's Wing for shelter.
The very Instincts of Nature have taught all
Weak things, to seek their Support out of
themselves, in some Retreat, where they
may be safe.<note place="margin">Ps. CIV. 18.</note> Thus the Firr-Trees are a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
for the Stork; the high Hills for the

The Hare hath her Converts too, and the Foxes
their Holes or Dens. Even the weaker, and
groveling Plants, (as Vines, and the like) have
their Tendrils, certain pliant Strings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they naturally clasp, and twine themselves
about the Supporters, they are to climb by. In
fine, all Nature is wholly Adjective, and, as

to stand alone, is ever in busie quest of
its proper Substantive, that may uphold it.

And of this Holy <hi>David</hi> stands here before
us a great Example. He trusts not in the Wings
of his Army, but in the Lord of Hosts, and
Battels; not in the shadow of his Cave, but in
the shadow of God's Wings; not in the height
of his Rock, but in the Rock of Ages. Though
being a Man of War, he well understood the
grand Importance of a Castle well seated, and
fortified; of a Mount, or Rock inaccessible; of
a Cave in that Rock capacious, and defensible
(such as <hi>Strabo</hi> tells us there were many in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine;</hi>
and such were probably the Cave of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullan,</hi>
and the strong Holds of <hi>Engedi,</hi> and the

he could not be safe on this side Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It goes on in active Diligence. The

its own, it imployes to bring it thither. The

            <p>The Moral, and the Reddition of All is but
thus much. We all of us have Wings of our own
too; Faculties, and Abilities, that must be
us'd, (Why else were they given us?) though
they must not be trusted in. The most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Father <hi>Paul</hi> of the <hi>Servi</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> was Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell'd
in the Holy Office,<note place="margin">See his Life.</note> (as they call it) for
advising one that pretended to immediate Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and Assistances, to use humane Means,
and Industries, and so to expect God's Blessing.

But the Inquisitors were for once so wise, as
to absolve him without Examination.</p>
            <p>Our Psalmist states the matter well.<note place="margin">Psal. xxxvii. 3-5.</note> 
               <hi>Trust
in the Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>but be doing Good too, and so
verily thou shalt be fed. Commit thy way unto the
Lord, and He shall bring it to pass:</hi> But walk in it
thy self; how is it else thy way? <hi>Commit the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thy Soul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. iv. ult.</note> (saith the Apostle, and so, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the keeping of the publick too) <hi>to God:</hi>
But still <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in well-doing,</hi> in doing thy
Duty in thy Station in all the instances of it.</p>
            <p>In the Age of Miracles indeed, when the Sea
divided, and suddenly turn'd green Meadow;
and when an Angel went forth, and dispatcht
so many Thousands in a Night: well might
the watch-word be, <hi>Stand still and see the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God; The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall
do nothing.</hi> But the season is chang'd, and 'tis
now, <hi>Come forth, and help the Lord against the
Mighty; and work out your own Salvation,</hi> (and so
the Salvation of the Nation too) <hi>because 'tis
God that Works;</hi> that is St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Logick.</p>
            <p>We must not presume to use our Lord, as
<hi>Herod</hi> did; call for him, when we please, to
Work us a fine Miracle; neglect our Affairs,
and leave them embroyl'd and ruffled on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that he may come down <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to

disentangle them. The Glory of God descends
not visibly now adayes upon our Palaces, as
of old upon the Tabernacle of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
to rescue our <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
massacred by a desperate Knot of Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers:
Nor doth the Earth open her Mouth
any longer, to swallow up our Rebels and
Traitors alive. 'Tis a Scepter of ordinary
Justice, not a Rod of Wonders, that fills the
Hand of our Governours. We must not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
that a good Cause should work alone of
it self by Way of Miracle: Believe it, it must
be prudently, and industriously manag'd too, or
it must at last miscarry.</p>
            <p>For Instance, (the Instance of the present
time:) The Devils of Sedition, and Faction,
of Treason, and Rebellion, those Familiars of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Rhemes,</hi> and S. <hi>Omers,</hi> (the <hi>Jesuites</hi>
I mean, that have so long possess'd and agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a wretched part of this Nation;) will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
go out from hence, and leave us at quiet,
no not by Prayer and Fasting only. Nay, the
best Laws we have, the best you can make,
(if they be not steddily, and severely execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
will prove too slight a Conjuration for
these sturdy evil Spirits of Disobedience. There
is another and a better <hi>Flagellum Daemonum,</hi> than
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50652:15"/>
that of <hi>Hieronymus Mengis,</hi> and his fellow Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cists.
Holy Water is a Trifle; and holy
Words will not do it. There is no such thing
as <hi>Medicina per Verba:</hi> Words, and Talk will
never cure the Distempers of a Nation. Deaf
Adders refuse all the Voice of the Charmer,
charm he never so wisely. If in good Earnest
we would be rid of this Legion, and say, as
our Lord to the deaf and dumb Spirit, Go
out, and enter no more; (What shall I say?
—In short,) Solomon'<hi>s Rod for the back of Fools,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. xix. 29.</note>
that grow troublesome, or dangerous, (as it may
be prepar'd, and manag'd) is a very powerful
and effectual Exorcism. Untamed Horses, and
skittish Mules, that will have no Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
are not edified at all by calm reasonings,
and Instructions, and meek Remonstrances;
nor in any other method so well as by <hi>Davids</hi>
Expedient;<note place="margin">Psal. xxxii. 9.</note> 
               <hi>In Fraeno, &amp; Camo;</hi> their Mouths
must be kept in with Bitt and Bridle, that it
may not be possible for them to fall upon you;
and so ye may be secure of them.</p>
            <p>But the fitting up of <hi>David</hi>'s Bridle, and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>'s
Rod, and the right Use of both, is the
Business of another Place. I shall resume the
general Thesis, and so shut up this Particular.
I say then; They trust not in God, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50652:16"/>
and tempt him, who work not toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with him, but receive his Aids in vain, and
look, that He should bring about in extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
manner, what they take no care of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
but lie flat upon their Backs looking
upward, and will stir neither Hand, nor Foot,
to help themselves. Nay but <hi>Viriliter agite, &amp;
conforabit Cor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. xxxi. 24.</note> as 'tis in the Psalm; play the
men your selves, Do All that you can, or
ought to do, within your proper Sphere; and
so <hi>God will strengthen your Hearts, all ye, that
put your Trust in the Lord.</hi> Wings as they are
the Covert of Safety, so also the Emblems of
Diligence, and the Instruments of Activity:
And as they shew us our Priviledge, may teach
us also this part of our Duty,—to trust only
in God's Wings, but to use our own too; that's
the progress of <hi>David</hi>'s Trust; It goes on in
active Diligence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is consummate (as in the last Act)
in clear, and perfect Resignation to God's good
pleasure in the Event, whatever it be. They
trust not in God entirely, and as they ought,
that rely only on his Power, and dare not
submit to his Wisdom also; that would gladly
engage Omnipotence on their side, (and can
you blame them?) but then they would manage
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50652:16"/>
it their own Way, and in Methods of their own
Contriving, and to Ends, it may be, far distant
from what God hath appointed: As if he would
work Journey-work under them, and leave them
to be Masters of the great Shop of the World.
No; but as <hi>Luther</hi> said well, when his Friend
<hi>Melanchthon</hi> troubled himself overmuch at some
cross Events; <hi>Desinat Philippus esse Rector Mundi:
'Tis God alone, who sits in Heaven, and doth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
pleaseth him.</hi> If we be not content with the
Portion he allots us, but will needs be carving
for our selves elsewhere, or otherwise: or if
we be not satisfied with his Conduct of the
Affairs of the World, but think with the great
<hi>Alphonso,</hi> that we could mend the Systeme:
what is this but in Effect to turn our Backs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God, and to set up for our selves upon our
own wretched Stock, and implicitly at least to
renounce the shadow of his Wings, and all the
privileges of it? <hi>Pulli non prospiciunt,</hi> saith One:
Young Birds have no Designs, or Forecasts of
their own, but are wholly under the Dams
Conduct. And if we are allow'd to have any
our selves, be they never so deeply laid, or so
wisely contriv'd; so skilfully managed, or so
vigorously pursu'd; We must at last intirely
submit, and sacrifice them all to that Soveraign
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50652:17"/>
Wisdom, and Power, which ruleth in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of Men, and orders them in all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the good pleasure of his VVill.</p>
            <p>To summ up then this whole great Duty
of Affiance in God, with all the parts, and
Branches of it: He trusts Regularly in God,
that trusts in Nothing else first: And yet se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
doth every thing he can, or is oblig'd
to do by his Duty: And thirdly, when he hath
done All, sits down at last under the shadow
of God's VVings, and waits the Success in Faith,
and Hope, with perfect Resignation to God's
wise and just Appointment in all things; That
is the first Duty implied in the Expression, a
pious Trust, and Confidence in God. The</p>
            <p>(2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>) Is an ardent and flaming Devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
God, and his holy Worship, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in his Temple: <hi>Under the shadow of thy
Wings will I make my Refuge;</hi> 'tis certainly an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion
to the Holy of Holies, where was the
Ark of the Covenant, the Symbol of God's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
presence; over which the Cherubim of
Glory stretcht forth their VVings on high,<note place="margin">Exod. xxv. 20.</note> and
shadowed the Mercy-seat:<note place="margin">Hebr. ix. 5.</note> Between which
VVings was God's Dwelling-place, his <hi>Shekinah,</hi>
or Majestatique presence. And therefore when
<hi>Ruth</hi> the <hi>Moabitess</hi> became Proselyte to the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50652:17"/>
Jewish Religion, and VVorship; she is said <hi>to
come to trust under the Wings of the God of Israel,</hi>
Ruth ii. 12.</p>
            <p>There are also <hi>Alae Ecclesiarum,</hi> which we meet
with in Church-writers; as we corruptly call
them, the <hi>Isles of Churches;</hi> and in the Gospel
it self <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Pinacles,</hi> or (if we will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it close, and just) <hi>Wings of the Temple:</hi> From
the saving Covert and Protection whereof, as
'tis the Devil's Business to tempt, and withdraw
us, and so to cast us down from one of our
noblest Heights, and Defences: So on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
holy <hi>David</hi>'s great Example here, and
the clear Importance of the VVords of my
Text, lead us directly thither (that is the last,
and most illustrious Resort of the Expression)
and bring us up with Boldness to seek, and
make our Refuge even under the VVings of the
Cherubim of Glory.</p>
            <p>And indeed, VVhere can we find on Earth
so safe, or so comfortable a Retreat, when Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
assail, or threaten us, as here in the
House of our God? Doth not his Cross stand
over it on purpose, to direct us hither, when
we are ready to sink under the Burthen of our
own? When God's Judgements are abroad in
the World, and the Avenger of our Sins pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50652:18"/>
us; More particularly, When the Land
is mov'd, and divided; when the Pillars there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
shake, and tremble, and the Foundations
are ready to be cast down; when all things are
in Ferment, and in Commotion round about
us, and Men's Hearts ready to fail them for
Fear, and for looking after those things which
are coming upon the Earth: Where should
we rather take Sanctuary, where can we more
probably find Help, and Redress, than at the
Altar of the God of Mercy, and under the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of the Wings of his Mercy-seat?</p>
            <p>This was holy <hi>David</hi>'s steddy Resolve, when
his Heart was <hi>overwhelmed,</hi> as he speaks, <hi>Ps.</hi> lxi. 2.
<hi>I will abide in thy Tabernacle for ever; I will trust</hi>
(or, <hi>I will make my Refuge) in the Cover of thy
Wings,</hi> v. 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>: And when his Afflictions put
him beside that Guard, set him at Distance
from those happy Opportunities, took him
down from those blessed Heights: Yet still,
even at the lowest,<note place="margin">Psal. cxxi. 1.</note> 
               <hi>I will lift up mine eyes,</hi> saith
he, <hi>to the Hills;</hi> (at least cast a long Look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Sion) from whence cometh my Help.</hi> This
was the Sting of all his Sorrows, as it were
the Calamity Royal he so groans under, almost
in every Psalm; not that <hi>Saul,</hi> or <hi>Absalom</hi> had
driven him from his own, but from God's
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50652:18"/>
House. Though the Holy Land was of no
large Extent: Yet as if he had been banisht
to the <hi>Antipodes; From the Ends of the Earth,</hi> saith
he, <hi>have I cried unto thee,</hi> Psal. lxi. 2. Though
his Devotion consecrated every place he came
into; turn'd the Cave into a Chappel, and
the Wilderness of <hi>Judah</hi> into Holy Ground;
and I had almost said, even <hi>Gath</hi> of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listins</hi>
into a Holy City; (for we have Psalms
dated from every One of these;) Yet still he
sighs, <hi>Oh restore me, Oh bring me, Oh set me up
upon the Rock that is higher than I:</hi> He means
without Doubt the Hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> the <hi>Pico</hi> of
<hi>Jewry,</hi> where God's House was <hi>establisht upon
the Tops of the Mountains,</hi> as the Prophet speaks,
<hi>Esa.</hi> ii. 2.</p>
            <p>Men, and Brethren, you that make up the
more popular part of this mixt Audience; Let
me freely speak to you of the Patriarch <hi>David,</hi>
and of your selves. Blessed be the Mercies of
God, you lie under no such Restraint, or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
as he did: You are not banisht into the
Wilderness, nor shut up in the Cave: The
Doors of God's House stand open to you, if you
please; and the Wings of his Mercy are stretcht
out wide to invite, and receive you; would you
but come in, and put your selves under the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50652:19"/>
of them. Let it not be said, that your Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity,
or some worse Humour leads you quite
another way: that you are over-careful, and
troubled about many things, which belong not
to you, while you neglect the one thing necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the great Duty of this, and of every Day;
namely to implore God's Mercy, and Protection
upon the King, and his Kingdoms, and his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and Blessing upon the publick Counsels.
Let my Counsel, I pray, be acceptable unto you.
Study to be quiet, and to do your own Business:
and that lies not in the Court, or in the Palace,
but here in the Temple. 'Tis not to listen at the
Doors of the two Houses of Parliament, or to
Eves-drop the Council-Chamber; but to wait
in your proper Stations with Modesty, and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
what Avisoes, and Commands are sent
you from thence, and to comply with them. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of thronging, and pestering the Galleries,
and Avenues of those places, where Matters of
State are upon the Table; what a blessed Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
were it in times of Danger, such as this
is, to see the Church Doors alwaies open, and
the great Stream, and Shole of People continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
flowing thither; and to find some of you
alwaies upon the Floor there, <hi>Weeping between
the Porch, and the Altar,</hi> and saying, <hi>Spare thy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50652:19"/>
People, Oh Lord, and give not thy Heritage to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.
Thou hast brought up a Vine out of Egypt:
Thou hast cast out the Heathen, and planted it.
Let not the Wild Boar out of the Wood root it up,
nor the Wild Beast of the Field devour it. Let thy
Hand be upon the Man of thy right Hand, whom
thou hast made so strong for thy self. Keep him,
as the Apple of thine Eye. Hide him under the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of thy Wings. Let his Dayes be many, and his
Reign prosperous; and under his shadow let both
Church and State long flourish: And let them be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
and driven backward as many as have Evil
Will at Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To furnish out an Office for such daily Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
'tis but to take your Psalter along with you
in your Hand, which is full of them. But espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
let me commend to you that Decad of
Psalms, which begins with the livth. and so on:
which may seem to have been put together on
purpose for such an Occasion. This would be
indeed effectually to transcribe holy <hi>David</hi>'s Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
in this his Exemplary, and ardent Devotion:
which is the second Duty requir'd in the Text,
to prepare us for the protection of God's Wing.
There is but one more behind; and that is</p>
            <p>(3) Constant Perseverance in both the former.
In the two former you have seen holy <hi>David</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:50652:20"/>
putting himself under the shadow of God's
Wings, and making good his Refuge there by
Acts of Faith, and Devotion. And being once
there, no storm shall beat him off, No Discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
shall drive him away, No delay shall
weary him out. If God kills him, 'tis all one,
hee'll trust in him still, and die in his Arms: For
here he hath set up his Rest, and <hi>Donec transie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint,</hi>
he is steddily resolv'd; his Refuge is, and
shall be here, till these Calamities are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past.</p>
            <p>But here we must take heed of a great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake.
There are, that hold the <hi>Donec</hi> in the Text
too hard, and stiff; are too punctual, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
with God in it: who will trust in him, it
may be, and ply their Devotions just so long, as
till the Calamity be past: But then on the sudden
their Trust grows feeble, and their Devotion
cold, and heartless: No sooner deliver'd, but
like old <hi>Israel,</hi> they <hi>forget God at the Sea, even at
the Red Sea;</hi>
               <note place="margin">

under which men run for shelter in a
Storm, but the Shower once over, they pluck
off the Branches, turn their backs, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>Nay, but there is in Scripture-language an
infinite and an interminable <hi>Donec,</hi> which never
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50652:20"/>
expires.<note place="margin">Matth. i. ult.</note> 
               <hi>He knew her not, till she brought

               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (as the Greek Church
stile her) A Virgin before, and in, and after
the Birth of our Lord, and for ever. Ay,
that's the Virgin-Soul indeed, that keeps ever
close to her heavenly Spouse: Not only runs
under his Wings for Shelter, when Calamities
affright her, saying, Spread thy Skirt over me,
and then straies away again as soon as ever the
flattering Calm, and Sunshine of Prosperity
tempts her abroad. As our Lord hath given
us an everlasting <hi>Donec; Lo I am with you,</hi>
saith he, <hi>till the End of the World:</hi> (Not that
he will leave us then, but take us yet nigher
unto himself, and <hi>so we shall ever be with the
Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Thess. iv. 17.</note> as the Apostle speaks:) So must we also
have One for him of the same Latitude, and
Extension. For ever under the Shadow of his
Wings; <hi>till this</hi> single <hi>Tyranny,</hi> as in the Old
Translation; <hi>till these Calamities,</hi> as in the
New; or as the Hebrew implies, till all, and
every of our Calamities be overpast; Both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and in, and after Calamities, still under
the Shadow of God's Wings. While they last,
'tis <hi>In the Shadow of thy Wings will I trust:</hi>
and when they are past, 'tis <hi>In the Shadow of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50652:21"/>
thy Wings will I rejoyce;</hi> that's all the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
As the Scenes shift, our Devotion must
improve, and advance too; till our Prayer be
heighten'd into Praise, (as I trust ere long it
will be) our Hope swallowed in Enjoyment,
and our Trust sublimated, and made to flowre
up into Joy, and riumph: When the same God,
that rais'd <hi>David</hi> from the Cave to the Throne,
shall translate us also from the Shadow of his
Wings into the Light of his Countenance: To
the Beatifical Vision whereof He of his Mercy
bring us, who hath so dearly bought it for us,
Jesus Christ the Righteous: To whom with
thee, O Father, and God the Holy Ghost, be
ascribed of us, and all the Creatures in Heaven,
and Earth, Blessing, Honour, Glory, and Power,
both now, and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
