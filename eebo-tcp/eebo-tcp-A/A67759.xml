            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>uch Respected:</hi> Did not the <hi>Word of God command</hi> me, <hi>Lev. 19. 17. Heb. 3. 13. Conscience</hi> and <hi>duty binde</hi> me, a zeal of <hi>God's glory,</hi> and a desire of <hi>your eternal good, constrain me: Discretion dictates</hi> unto me, that it is better having a <hi>friend without trouble,</hi> then a <hi>foe with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not that you shall have cause to finde fault <hi>with it,</hi> or <hi>with me for it:</hi> for I fight not against you, but against your sins; not with you, but with your enemies for you: You have no such <hi>foes</hi> as your <hi>faults,</hi> and these are they that I seek to subdue and batter down before you; as well knowing, that <hi>unless they die, you cannot live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Other friends refuse to <hi>tell you</hi> of your faults, who will be very ready to <hi>tell others</hi> of them; whereas I speak of your <hi>faults to your face,</hi> of your <hi>virtues behinde your back:</hi> and he that <hi>loves</hi> not such a <hi>friend, hates himself. He</hi> (saies <hi>Solomon) that refuseth instruction, is brutish,</hi> Prov. 12. 1. and <hi>destroieth his own soul,</hi> Chap. 15 32.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When wisdom stretcheth out her hand, and men refuse: then wisdom will laugh at their destruction,</hi> Prov. 1. 24. &amp;c. That soul is <hi>past cure,</hi> which turneth from, and <hi>refuseth the cure, Deut. 17. 12. Prov. 29. 1. Psal.</hi> 81. 11, 12. Smal hope of that <hi>Patient,</hi> that is deaf to the counsel of his <hi>Physitian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I hope better things of you;</hi> for admit it prove <hi>as wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi> to you at present, as <hi>water into a Ship,</hi> yet when you shall consider, that I have so learnt to distinguish between
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34158:2"/>
               <hi>persons</hi> and <hi>vices, offenders</hi> and <hi>offences;</hi> as to have <hi>no peace with the one,</hi> while <hi>I have true peace with the other:</hi> that I do not <hi>so hate,</hi> as to be <hi>a foe to goodness;</hi> nor <hi>so love,</hi> as to <hi>foster iniquity;</hi> That he who is <hi>a friend to our faults,</hi> is <hi>no friend to our selves:</hi> the case will bee altered; since that to be <hi>vices friend,</hi> is to be <hi>virtues enemie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True; <hi>sore eies</hi> cannot abide the <hi>light of the Sun:</hi> And so long as you love your <hi>sins</hi> better then your <hi>soul,</hi> you will scorn my counsel. But if ever your eies be opened as <hi>Sauls</hi> were, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 18. you will say as once <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Abigal, 1 Sam. 25. 32. 33. Blessed be the Lord, and blessed be thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and blessed be thou who hast kept me from</hi> doing thus, and thus. <hi>Hee that rebuketh a man, shall finde more favour at the length, then he which flattereth with his tongue,</hi> Prov. 28. 23. <hi>Reprove a scorner, and he will hate thee: but rebuke a wiseman, and he will love thee,</hi> Prov. 9. 8. <hi>Give instruction to a wiseman, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning,</hi> Ver. 9. And (which makes much for my incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement) <hi>Nathan</hi> wrought more upon <hi>David,</hi> by one pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate particular admonition, then all the <hi>Lectures of the Law</hi> could do for three quarters of a year together. And it were happie for millions, were they so plainly dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
            <p>Wherefore be not in the least offended, but love and thank me for my plain dealing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 23. Yea, if I <hi>make you smart, give me the more thanks, love me the better</hi> for it. <hi>Sharp reprehension is the healing of the soul; and love to the soul,</hi> is the <hi>very soul of love.</hi> And not to <hi>chide</hi> a <hi>friend</hi> least wee <hi>offend</hi> him; is as to let him <hi>drown,</hi> rather then <hi>catch</hi> him by the <hi>hair.</hi> He is shrewdly wronged, that being <hi>stung by a Bee,</hi> (when <hi>asleep)</hi> is delivered from <hi>a Serpent,</hi> which otherwise had stung him to death. The <hi>Physitian</hi> and <hi>Surgeon</hi> you know, <hi>heal</hi> us not without <hi>pain,</hi> and yet we <hi>reward</hi> them. And possible it is, I may prove another <hi>Photian</hi> unto you; who when a friend of his would have cast himself away, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him not; saying, I was made thy friend to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. So then, abide me <hi>no friend to your faults,</hi> or, <hi>no friend
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34158:3"/>
to your self:</hi> And let this serve for an <hi>Apologie,</hi> as also for a <hi>Protection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dear Cousin! <hi>my love to,</hi> and <hi>hopes of you</hi> formerly were not greater, then is now <hi>my fear:</hi> for that scarce a day pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but I hear that of your <hi>pride;</hi> which both <hi>moves me to passion and compassion.</hi> Possible it is, that though you make your self the <hi>subject of every opinion, wise and weak,</hi> and no lesse of their <hi>discourse;</hi> though you are <hi>a wonder</hi> amongst <hi>fools</hi> for your <hi>bravery,</hi> among <hi>wisemen</hi> for your <hi>folly:</hi> yet you may neither hear of it, nor in the least perceive it; high time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you be told thereof. If with those <hi>Gentiles, Rom.</hi> 10. 20. you receive more good by it then you desire, admire the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> and <hi>free grace of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it a wrong to lay, that you bid defiance to all other <hi>Ministers wives?</hi> The best <hi>Lord Bishops</hi> Wife in the Land might not wear <hi>a French hood,</hi> by <hi>Act of Parlament;</hi> you do far more, and seem to scorn (not to own) the Function, though too honorable for you.</p>
            <p>To speak of particulars; as <hi>naked breasts and shoulders,</hi> (when in warm weather that was a <hi>fashion,</hi> though <hi>a whorish one) beauty-spots, cut-locks, long trains like a Countess, light coloured gowns</hi> and <hi>Waste-coats, gold-lace,</hi> with other <hi>curious</hi> and <hi>costly laces</hi> and <hi>attires,</hi> fit for none but <hi>Ladies: exactness in all new fashions,</hi> deifying your <hi>Child,</hi> your little regard of <hi>hearing the Word,</hi> (in which you should be an example) and the like, were needlesse; being better known to <hi>your self,</hi> and more observed by <hi>others</hi> then <hi>me.</hi> Though I may more then guesse, how you and your wicked <hi>Counsellor,</hi> more <hi>studie</hi> for <hi>fashions,</hi> then <hi>Lawyers</hi> do for <hi>delaies:</hi> yea, your Husband (were he at all consulted with) would finde it as hard a task to cloath you, as <hi>Mercury</hi> had to <hi>cloath the Moon:</hi> And it is a sure <hi>conclusion,</hi> where so <hi>great care</hi> is had to <hi>deck the bodie,</hi> there is as <hi>great carelesness,</hi> and as <hi>little regard</hi> to <hi>adorn the soul</hi> with virtue, as <hi>Cato</hi> speaks. Yea, let conscience say, Whether you be not more careful to preserve your <hi>cloaths from dust and spots,</hi> then your <hi>soul</hi> from <hi>guilt?</hi> Do not you know also, that you honour your <hi>Childe</hi> more then <hi>GOD?</hi>

               <hi>Pambo</hi> spying a certain woman flaunting it in very sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous apparel, fell a weeping; and being asked why he wept so much answered, For two causes; one, the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this woman; another, because I (quoth he) who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess my self <hi>a Christian,</hi> do not so much studie to <hi>please God</hi> by innocencie of life, as this woman does <hi>to please the Divel</hi> and <hi>men</hi> with her vanities. I cannot, nor need I stand to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it.</p>
            <p>But see the sottishnesse of <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>vain glory,</hi> for <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>follie</hi> are vices that ever <hi>go together.</hi> Wicked men <hi>glory</hi> in that which is indeed their <hi>Shame.</hi> Our <hi>cloaths</hi> are but as a <hi>plaister</hi> upon a <hi>sore. Wickedness brought nakedness,</hi> and <hi>appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel</hi> hides it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 10, 11. whereof being proud, is as if a <hi>Thief</hi> should be proud of his <hi>halter.</hi> Our cloaths are but to cover shame and nakednesse; but as signs of <hi>God's</hi> displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, by reason of <hi>Original sin;</hi> and to be proud of them, is as if a <hi>Prisoner</hi> should be <hi>proud of his Bolts.</hi> Our cloaths are like a <hi>Westminster-hall paper,</hi> to shew what we have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted which occasioned it, nor had we else needed them. It is as if a <hi>Rogue</hi> should have his <hi>pardon,</hi> upon condition that he will ever after wear <hi>a rope about his neck:</hi> and therefore as one <hi>burned in the forehead</hi> for some villany, ought so often as hee looketh in a glasse, and perceiveth the scar thereof, to think upon and detest his wickednesse, so ought we.</p>
            <p>Again, in glorying in gorgious attire, you make that a matter of <hi>pride,</hi> that indeed makes you <hi>ridiculous:</hi> You think <hi>your self</hi> brave, but <hi>no bodie else</hi> thinkes you so. Nothing procures <hi>love</hi> and <hi>credit,</hi> both with <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man,</hi> like <hi>humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> nothing <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>scorn,</hi> like <hi>pride.</hi> Would you have <hi>God your friend,</hi> or <hi>your enemie?</hi> you may: for <hi>he resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble, James</hi> 4 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 5. No vice gets a man so many enemies as this vice: not the humble alone, but <hi>one proud man hates another:</hi> your self loves humilitie in all but your self; as if you did wish well to all souls but your own.</p>

They seek <hi>content in riches,</hi> which is, as if one should seek for <hi>fresh water</hi> in the midst of the <hi>Sea.</hi> They seek for <hi>honour</hi> in <hi>pride,</hi> whereas honour is to be found in <hi>humilitie, Prov.</hi> 29. 23. It is to be observed, that the <hi>more ignorant</hi> any one is, the <hi>more conceited</hi> he is: <hi>Great pride,</hi> argues <hi>great ignorance; little humility,</hi> but <hi>little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of our own hearts. According to our <hi>humility,</hi> is our knowledge of our selves: and according to the <hi>knowledg</hi> of our selves, is our <hi>humility.</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> saw the <hi>filthie puddle of concupiscence</hi> that was in him, he was throughly taken down indeed: And until we become <hi>humble,</hi> we can never become <hi>wise. Time, reading</hi> and <hi>learning</hi> may <hi>swell our brains,</hi> but still <hi>our hearts</hi> will remain <hi>emptie. He will teach the Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his way, Prov.</hi> 11. 2. <hi>The first step to wisedom, is humilitie, Isa.</hi> 28. 9.</p>
            <p>Nor is <hi>pride</hi> more a sign of <hi>ignorance,</hi> then it is of <hi>emptiness:</hi> The lighter <hi>ballance,</hi> or end of the <hi>beam,</hi> will presse <hi>upward,</hi> and ever be <hi>highest:</hi> that <hi>ear of corn,</hi> or <hi>bough</hi> which is <hi>fullest,</hi> or <hi>most laden with fruit, hangs lowest</hi> to the ground alwaies: It is <hi>froth</hi> onely that <hi>swims</hi> on the top.</p>
            <p>It is the <hi>nature of man</hi> to be <hi>proud,</hi> when <hi>man by nature</hi> has nothing to be <hi>proud of.</hi> As take away from mens mindes <hi>vain opinions, flattering hopes, fals valuations, imaginations,</hi> and the like; you will leave the mindes of most men and women but <hi>poor shrunken things,</hi> full of <hi>melancholy, indisposition,</hi> and <hi>unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to themselves.</hi> And as for <hi>Beauty,</hi> even the <hi>fairest presence,</hi> (which puffs up so many) is but a <hi>dunghill coveredover</hi> with <hi>white</hi> and <hi>purple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or admit it be <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>virtue</hi> that one is proud of; such an ones <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>virtues</hi> will be sure to <hi>lessen,</hi> as his pride <hi>increaseth;</hi> and in the end <hi>wither away</hi> and <hi>leave him, as leaves do a tree in Autumne.</hi> Neither will any good thing stay or reside, where pride is, and remains: be it <hi>peace, plenty, credit,</hi> or the like.</p>

Even the best and greatest works, undertaken for ostentation, do commonly misse of their end, and turn to the Authors shame. <hi>Before honour goeth humility, Prov.</hi> 15. 33. but <hi>when pride cometh, then cometh shame,</hi> Prov. 11. 2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor will <hi>plenty</hi> and <hi>prosperity</hi> stay, where pride remains. While <hi>Saul</hi> was <hi>little</hi> in his own eies, <hi>God</hi> made him <hi>head over the twelve Tribes,</hi> and gave him abundance: but when he <hi>left his humility, his Kingdom left him</hi> and his house. When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was puft up with the wealth and the pretious things that <hi>God</hi> gave him, the <hi>Prophet</hi> tells him, that <hi>all those things, and all that his Fathers had laid up in store for him, should be carried away to Babylon,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 12. to 19.

            <p>And I would wish you to look to it, (least <hi>God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw</hi> more, as he hath already some of the <hi>fuel of your pride,</hi> and <hi>quench the fire of your Kitchen)</hi> for confident I am, out of the experience I have of the <hi>Lord's</hi> dealing; that if you belong to him, he will make you <hi>bow, or break:</hi> you shall be humbled, and that to purpose; and that in it wherein you offend. Mark me what I say, Are you <hi>proud of beauty?</hi> You shall have <hi>no beauty to be proud of. Because the daughters of Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are proud, and walk with stretched out necks, and with wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring eies, making a minsing as they go, and make a tinkling with their feet: therefore shall the Lord mak the heads of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Zion ball'd, and the Lord shall discover their secret parts. In that day shall the Lord take away the ornaments of the slippers, and the cauls, and the round tiers, the sweet balls, and the brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and the bonnets, the tires of the head, and the slops, and the head-bands, and the tablets, and the ear-rings, the rings and the mufflers, the costly apparel and the vails; and the wimples, and the crisping-pins, and the glasses, and the fine linnen, and the hoods, and the lawns. And instead of sweet savours, there shall be a stink, and instead of a girdle, a rent; and instead of dressing of the hair, baldnesse: and instead of a stomacher, a gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty,</hi> Isa. 3. 16. to 25. <hi>Miriams Leprosie</hi> is one instance of this: her <hi>foul tongue</hi> was not onely punished with a <hi>foul face;</hi> but her <hi>pride</hi> was <hi>cured with deformity.</hi>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34158:5"/>
are an abomination to the Lord: and though hand join in hand, such shall not go unpunished,</hi> Prov. 16. 5. <hi>He that hath a proud look, and high heart, I cannot suffer,</hi> saith <hi>the Lord,</hi> Psal. 101. 5. Job. 40. 11. 12. Mal. 4. 1. of which you have had some experience.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath <hi>spoken</hi> to you, <hi>once, twice, thrice;</hi> and that in an easie and familiar <hi>Scripture phrase:</hi> he hath brought you, and your babe, into physicks fetters; he hath <hi>abated</hi> of your <hi>beauty:</hi> he hath cut short your means, (the fuel of your pride) yea he hath gone further with you; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>your honour</hi> hath been <hi>more cared for then your God,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> was <hi>well while</hi> you were <hi>well esteemed.</hi> Is not your <hi>good name</hi> at the stake? and your credit wofully <hi>blasted,</hi> by excelling all of your rank and calling, and all bounds of discretion; and by your scorning to be thought a Ministers wife; in which Religion also suffers. Hath not <hi>self-conceitednesse bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken your credit?</hi> For as there is <hi>no plaister like this, to pull down proud flesh;</hi> so God hath accordingly decreed, that while we <hi>think well of our selves, others</hi> shall <hi>never think well of us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus hath the Lord dealt with you, whose preventing mercie it is, to <hi>speak before he strikes,</hi> to <hi>lighten before he thunders,</hi> to <hi>warn before he wounds,</hi> to <hi>use the rod, before he takes up the sword:</hi> yet you neither hear, nor take notice of his displeasure. <hi>Your eies are not opened, your heart is not humbled,</hi> but <hi>your pride re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains:</hi> being somwhat like <hi>Nero</hi> still, who took it for a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparagement,</hi> forsooth, <hi>to be seen two daies in one suit.</hi> Though you wear a pretty part of your husbands <hi>estate upon your back;</hi> and the like <hi>about your neck.</hi>

            <p>What is wisedom departed from you? or would you have <hi>Jezabels</hi> fare? be dasht in pieces. Would you be let go on like <hi>Absolom?</hi> whose chief <hi>pride lay in his hair, and that became his halter.</hi> Look to it, for <hi>God</hi> will first or last make you know your self, if you belong to him; and at the next bout, cast you down to the very ground: and if that will not serve, <hi>one foot</hi> shall <hi>slip into hell,</hi> that it may be a means through his blessing, to further and forward you in <hi>the way to heaven;</hi> as it fared with the <hi>incestuous Corinthian 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8. which if you would prevent, take warning in time:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34158:6"/>
for, <hi>God will</hi> be sure to <hi>have his will of those that are wedded to their own wills:</hi> yea he delights in it, as you may see in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Cousin! my fear is, that this your pride will spin you a thred of many troubles, before you learn that lesson of the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, Before I was afflicted, I went astray: but now do I keep thy commandements, Psal.</hi> 119. 67. And indeed we call for <hi>greater strokes,</hi> by not feeling the <hi>lesser.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we be warned of any thing but sin, one warning will serve: but we are so incorporated, and inured to sin, that a thousand sermons will not serve. Custom hath made sin stronger in many, then the <hi>Word of God:</hi> Whereupon <hi>God</hi> takes another course, and saies, <hi>I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their fault, and seek me: for in their affliction they will seek me diligently, Hos.</hi> 5. 15. Though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed never to think on <hi>God</hi> until we stand in need of him, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a <hi>base,</hi> and not an <hi>ingenuous</hi> spirit.</p>
            <p>I confesse it's well if it prove <hi>so well;</hi> for this is more then <hi>God</hi> ows us: and his method to millions is this; <hi>The seed</hi> was <hi>sown this year,</hi> the Lord calls for <hi>fruit,</hi> and <hi>none will come;</hi> the <hi>next year,</hi> and <hi>the next</hi> after, and <hi>none comes:</hi> at last the curse goeth forth, <hi>Never fruit grow upon thee more:</hi> as it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the <hi>Fig-tree: Cut it down, and cast it into the fire,</hi> Luk. 13. 6. to 10.</p>
            <p>Now whether of these two waies the Lord will deal with you; onely himself knows. But one of the two I am sure he will, and the last is most likely. For <hi>the greatest number enter the broad-gate;</hi> and they are <hi>few</hi> in comparison <hi>(one of a City, and two of a Tribe,</hi> Isa. 10. 22.) <hi>that shall be saved.</hi> True, there is scarce a man <hi>on earth,</hi> but he thinks to go <hi>to heaven;</hi> though no man thinks that the <hi>whole world</hi> shall go <hi>to heaven,</hi> for then were <hi>hell</hi> made to no purpose. Yea, whereas the <hi>Jews</hi> thought, that if but <hi>two men</hi> in the <hi>world</hi> were <hi>saved,</hi> the one should be a <hi>Scribe,</hi> the other a <hi>Pharisee: Christ</hi> saith, neither of both should come there, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 28.</p>
            <p>But admit your case be onely doubtful, and not desperate: you have <hi>not two souls,</hi> that you may <hi>hazard one:</hi> nor will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34158:6"/>
any wise-man <hi>venture his soul</hi> on such an <hi>uncertainty.</hi> I know you have favorable thoughts of your self, and much to say in your own behalf, (though that <hi>much</hi> is <hi>nothing).</hi> In <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing our faults</hi> we are all <hi>too eloquent;</hi> though to a wise and godly man, (whose <hi>folly</hi> is <hi>wiser</hi> then the <hi>wisdom of the world:)</hi> what you have to alleage, would appear but pitious <hi>shifts, weaker then walls of paper.</hi> As what saies wise <hi>Solomon? All the waies of a man are clean in his own eies; but the Lord ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And men may more then <hi>guesse,</hi> by <hi>reflection from the Word;</hi> because the <hi>outward actions</hi> declare the <hi>inward intentions. A good Conversion</hi> is proved by a <hi>good Conversation. If any one be ingrafted into Christ, by a lively faith; he becoms a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and shews it by the fruit of a good life,</hi> Joh. 15. 1. to 9. he is <hi>divorced</hi> from the <hi>world,</hi> and the <hi>flesh,</hi> with their <hi>fruits,</hi> and <hi>fashions,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10, 11. Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21. Prov. 16. 2. 1 Pet. 4. 3. 1 Joh. 2. Ephes. 4. 18, 19, 20. And whosoever does not bring forth such fruit, it is certain that he is not yet ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into <hi>Jesus Christ. Regeneration,</hi> or <hi>New-birth,</hi> is a <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of new qualities</hi> in the <hi>soul,</hi> as being by nature onely evil disposed. In all <hi>true Repentance</hi> is a <hi>change,</hi> both in the <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> from <hi>errour</hi> to <hi>truth;</hi> and in the <hi>Will,</hi> from <hi>evil</hi> to <hi>good;</hi> and in the <hi>Affections,</hi> from <hi>loving evil,</hi> and <hi>hating good,</hi> to <hi>love good,</hi> and <hi>hate evil.</hi> In the <hi>whole man,</hi> from <hi>darknesse</hi> to <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>from the power of Satan unto God;</hi> without which change, no repentance. <hi>Grace</hi> changeth <hi>nature</hi> of a <hi>bramble</hi> to becom a <hi>vine,</hi> of a <hi>thorn</hi> a <hi>fig-tree,</hi> of a <hi>wilde, a natural Olive,</hi> of a <hi>Lion</hi> a <hi>Lamb,</hi> of a <hi>Dog under board,</hi> to a <hi>son sitting at table,</hi> of a <hi>Saul</hi> a <hi>Paul.</hi> And of this you may assure your self, that if <hi>Christ</hi> be not your <hi>King to govern,</hi> hee will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be your <hi>Prophet to forwarn,</hi> nor your <hi>Priest to expiate.</hi>
