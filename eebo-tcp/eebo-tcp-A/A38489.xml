            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE SECOND PART OF THE SVRVEY OF THE Articles of the late rejected Peace: wherein the invaliditie and nullitie of the ſaid Peace is evidently proved out of many heads or cauſes.</head>
            <p n="1">1. IN the firſt part of this Survey we proved the injuſtice and iniquitie of the ſaid Peace by notable obſervations on cach, or moſt of the Articles included in the ſame peace. In this ſecond part wee further proceede to prove alſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validitie, and nullitie thereof out of thoſe heads or cauſes, which are expreſſed in the lawes, and accepted as generall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes among Divines and Lawyers; to the end the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Confederates may be rightly enformed how farre they are exempted from any obligation to embrace ſuch a Peace, in the contriving whereof injuſtice accompanied with nullitie, had full and perfect concurrence. As in other Contracts, ſo in Contracts paſt by <hi>mandate</hi> or <hi>Comiſſion,</hi> the nullitie and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liditie thereof is derived from many ſources or heads. Six are <note place="margin">A zor. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit. moral. par. 3. l. 9. c. 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That the like <hi>revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Commiſſions or mandates</hi> given to the Marques of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and to our Committee of the Treatie hath hapned in the concluding of this Peace, before the ſame was concluded, is the point (among other) which we are to prove in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paragraphes. In the.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61604:6"/>
               <head>§. 1. <hi>The invaliditie of the foreſaid Peace is proved by the revocation of the Marques of Ormonds Commiſſion given him to conclude a Peace, before the ſame was concluded.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="2">2 THis invalide and unjuſt Peace was indeed <hi>ſigned and ſealed</hi> by five of our Committee on the 28. of <hi>March</hi> 1646. but never <hi>DELIVERED</hi> interchangeably by both parties untill the 29. of <hi>Iuly</hi> following: during the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent time it lay, as an Eſcroule or Scroule on the hands of the Marques of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> without any power or force to oblige in law either parties. Though this be a truth confeſſed in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate by the Committee of Treatie, and well knowne to the then Supreme Councell and Committee of Inſtructions, yet becauſe the knowledge thereof is ſuppreſſed from the reſt of the Confederate Catholiques, and that the Peace hath beene published, as if the ſame were abſolutely concluded on the 28. of <hi>March,</hi> I here thinke fit to diſcover the <hi>myſterie of iniquitie</hi> out of that, which I ſinde written by <hi>Mr. Darcyes</hi> owne hand, (one of the five that ſigned and delivered the ſaid Peace) on the out-ſide of the manuſcript draught of the articles of Peace deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by <hi>Mr. Plunket</hi> &amp; himſelfe in <hi>VVaterford</hi> to the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of both Clergies; <hi>Signed and Sealed ONLY</hi> (note the excluſive partticle ONLY) 28. <hi>March</hi> 1646. <hi>anno</hi> 22. <hi>Regis Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roli, in the preſence of the Lord Digby, Sir Maurice Euſtace; Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Fennell, and George Lane, and DEPOSITED on the Marques of Clanrickards hands till</hi> 1. <hi>May, and untill the ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand be ſent into England.</hi> Thus farre one note. In another note there written, I reade thus: <hi>This</hi> (meaning the Articles of Peace) <hi>was DELIVERED</hi> 29. <hi>Iuly</hi> 1646. <hi>in my Lords STVDY, by my Lord Lieutenant on the one part: Lord of Muskery, Sir Robert Talbot, Iohn Dillon, Patricke Darcy, and Geofrey Browne of the other part, witneſſed by the Marques of Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickard, Lord Taaffe, Lord Digby, Monſieur du Moulin the French Agent, and Daniel O Nealc. Preſent beſides, the Earle of Roſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Lord Dillon, Colonell Trafford, and George Lane, &amp;c.</hi> on the ſame 29. day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and not before, <hi>the defeaſance,</hi> which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61604:6"/>
paſt betweene the Marques of <hi>Ormond</hi> and our Committee, obliging the kingdome to ſend over 10000. men, were <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled, and an Inſtrument avoyding the defeazance then perfected &amp; witneſſed, ut ſupra,</hi> ſaith a third note written alſo by <hi>Mr. Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes</hi> owne hand on the foreſaid manuſcript Copie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By all which it appeareth that the Peace was never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded untill the 29. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and that both parties did ſuppoſe the ſame for a certaintie, aſwell becauſe they never cancelled the foreſaid defeazance untill the foreſaid 29. day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe the Marques of <hi>Ormond,</hi> having before that day received His Majeſties letter revoking his Commiſſion, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelfe not to be obliged by any act, that paſſed on the 28. of <hi>March,</hi> rejected our Committee of Treatie, and would by no meanes proceede to the concluſion of the foreſaid peace, affirming that his Commiſſion was recalled and that he had no authoritie to treate further with them; as you shall heare as yet more hereafter. This is further confirmed by the letters of the late Supreme Councell and Committee of Inſtructions dated at <hi>Lymericke</hi> the firſt of <hi>Iune</hi> 1646. delivered unto the Lord <hi>Nuncius,</hi> where they confeſſe the Peace was not then <hi>conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> but that <hi>ſhortly they expected the ſame to be</hi> both <hi>concluded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and publiſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. We preſſe the matter as yet more eagerly: they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Peace, either on the 28. of <hi>March,</hi> or on the 29. of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> If the later, wee have our intention; namely, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Peace after the Marques his Commiſſion was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, which was the eleventh of <hi>Iune</hi> before: if the former; <note place="margin">See numb. 5.</note> then were our Councell and Committees violators of their promiſe made to His Holyneſſe His Nuncius Apoſtolique, and perfidious to the whole kingdome, which in publique aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly promiſed and agreed, that nothing should be concluded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> agreed upon untill <hi>May</hi> following. Such as are meanely ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, either by ſtudy or practiſe in the lawes of this kingdome, know that an obligation paſt by a Debtor unto his Creditor, though <hi>Signed and Sealed</hi> this moneth, yet bindeth not then, nor ever after, unleſſe he alſo DELIVER the ſame obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then onely, and not before, it beginneth to oblige, when the obligation, or bond is <hi>delivered:</hi> how much more in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61604:7"/>
our caſe, is it evidently convinced, that the rejected Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan not to oblige untill the time of the <hi>deliverie</hi> thereof, which was on the 29. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and not before; ſeeing that in our caſe, beſides the defect of <hi>deliverie,</hi> the very <hi>ſigning and ſealing</hi> it ſelfe was not abſolute, but conditionally, that 10000. men should be ſent over by the Catholique Confederats, and the Articles were not laid on the hands of either of both parties, but <hi>depoſited</hi> on the hands of a third perſon? But in a truth ſo evident, &amp; teſtified by ſo many witneſſes, yea, confeſſed by the Committee of treaty themſelves, we need not waſt much time.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Wherfore we are to prove that the Marques of <hi>Ormonds</hi> Commiſſion was recalled and revoked before the foreſaid 29. day of <hi>Iuly;</hi> for effecting whereof wee need no other evidence, than the Kings owne letter which we exhibit unto the Reader word by word, as it was written by His Majeſtie himſelfe.</p>

Its knowne, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques is of the ſame profeſſion with the Parliament; that ſince
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61604:8"/>
theſe warres he hath continuall Commerce and mutuall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with them; private letters, meſſages, and Agents paſt betweene him, the Parliament and the <hi>Scots;</hi> that hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſed any act of hoſtilitie againſt either; nay ſince the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and their Adherents (the Confederate Catholiques) have oppoſed this Peace, he hath ſent ſeverall Agents aſwell unto the <hi>Scots,</hi> as unto <hi>Inſequin</hi> and the Parliament, praying them to ſend him ſuccours, and actually entertained ſome of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Commanders in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and intruſted them with pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Command within that Citie; yea, had actually delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not onely that Citie, but all other Cities and Forts &amp;c. in his Quarters to the Parliament, if the Parliament vouchſafed to intruſt him with the government of the kingdome; and to grant unto him ſuch Conditions, as hee expected: for procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whereof (it is thought) <hi>Sir Francis VVilloughby</hi> (whom the Marques ſent over before to the Parliament) is now gone over againe with the Parliament Commiſſioners to elaborate the buſines. I appeale then to all diſintereſſed Divines, whether the Catholique Confederats may in ſuch a caſe transferre from themſelves (who have ſworne allegiance and fidelitie to their Soveraigne, and particularly to keepe ſecure ſuch Forts and Cities, &amp;c. for His Majeſties uſe) unto one ſo ſuſpected, the government or Command of the ſame Cities, Forts, Armies, &amp;c. ſeeing in ſo doing they doe probably hazard Religion, King, and Countrey. If neither Parliament nor <hi>Scot</hi> will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt his Excellencie with the chiefe government of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, though hee be of their profeſſion, nor entertaine him, as their ſervant, shall the Catholiques, (unto whoſe Religion he is a ſworne Adverſarie) inttuſt him not only with ſuch a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but alſo entertaine him, as their Lord and Maſter? This I ſpeake not (God be my Iudge) for diſreſpect to ſo noble a perſonage, who (if hee followed the ſteps of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Catholique progenitors, and were diſingaged from wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Councell) might well deſerve ſuch honour; but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my conſcience in a matter of ſuch importance, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the ſecuritie of Religion, King and Countrey.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As this letter was dated, ſo was it delivered and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Lord Marques long before the 29. of <hi>Iuly,</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61604:8"/>
when (and not before) the Peace was concluded; wherein I <note place="margin">The revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 29 of Iuly.</note> call as witneſſes the conſcience of thoſe very noble perſons, who concluded, and joyned in concluding this peace. Nay, the ſame hath beene confeſſed unto me even by ſome of them, that ſubſcribed unto the peace. But the accompt, which <hi>Mr. Browne</hi> gave unto the late Supreme Councell at <hi>Limericke</hi> after his returne from <hi>Dublin</hi> in the month of <hi>Iune</hi> and his publicke narration or declaration of the anſwer received from the Lord Marques in <hi>Dublin,</hi> puts the queſtion out of all doubt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he declared that the Lord Marques his Commiſſion was confeſſed by himſelfe to have beene <hi>recalled,</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could conclude no peace with us. His returne then without effecting any thing, and the very originall letter above mentioned shewne to <hi>Mr. Browne</hi> and others by the Lord Marques, doth confirme it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It may be anſwered that the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> brought over ſome new Commiſſion from <hi>France</hi> authorizing the Lord <note place="margin">An obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupated.</note> Marques to proceede in the peace. But this is as eaſily denyed, as it is affirmed without apparance of truth; it being moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine (and ſo ſignified by letters from <hi>Paris,</hi> to the Councell and Congregation) that the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> never ſaw the king, nor received letters from the king, from the time he left <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> untill he returned backe; how then could the Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques his Commiſſion be renewed? ſome letters are ſaid to have been brought over by the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> in Cyphers, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation whereof muſt be received from the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But this may carry aſmuch truth as the former; and though it were true, yet have the Confederate Catholiques no reaſon to give credit (in a matter of ſuch high concernment) to ſuch Interpreters; but ſuppoſing all were true, it would never be able to render the peace concluded the 29. of <hi>Iuly</hi> valid; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the ſame peace is grounded on the Commiſſion given unto the Lord Marques 24. <hi>Iunij</hi> 1644. and the 20. yeare of His Majeſties Raigne, which (as you have heard) was recalled before the foreſaid 29. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and not on the new imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Commiſſion brought over by the Lord <hi>Digby;</hi> wherefore if they would render the peace ought worth or of any validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in law, they ought to ground the ſame on this new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61604:9"/>
and not on the old: or if this new Commiſſion were a Continuation, or a reintegration of the old, both should be inſerted in the Articles of peace, if they intended to conclude any valid or ſolid peace. Shall I ſpeake the truth <hi>in ſimplicitate cordis mei?</hi> as that peace alone was concluded, which pleaſed the Marques of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and all other peaces, that pleaſed God and man, king and Countrey were rejected: ſo <hi>then</hi> was the peace concluded, when it pleaſed <hi>Ormond,</hi> namely <hi>when</hi> her and his pretended Proteſtants could no longer ſubſiſt, their brethren (the <hi>Scots</hi> and other Parliamentarie Rebells) being reduced to nothing in <hi>Vlſter</hi> and <hi>Connaught.</hi> while theſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters could craule, the concluſion of any peace was protracted; while <hi>Bunratty</hi> was in diſpaire, <hi>Roſcoman</hi> and other places in <hi>Connaught</hi> in defiance againſt the Confederate Catholiques; then the Marques his Commiſſion was recalled; but when the Catholique Confederates recovered all theſe places, and gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned two glorious victories againſt the Enemie, then this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortued Commiſſion was ſuddenly revived, and a peace was concluded upon, maugre all the reſiſtance of the Lord Nuncius and Clergie, or the ſoundeſt part of the Councell and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, of ſeverall acts and proteſtations made by the whole kingdome in the aſſemblies held in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and <hi>February</hi> 1645.

THat no obligation of law did enforce our Committee to conclude this peace is evident by what even now we expreſſed in the foregoing paragraph: for if the articles, though <hi>ſigned</hi> and <hi>ſealed</hi> on the 28. day of <hi>March,</hi> yet remained ſtill as a ſcrole untill the 29. of <hi>Iuly</hi> following, at which time, and not before, they were <hi>delivered</hi> and begunne to oblige; then is it certaine that during that intervall our Committee were free, and at their owne libertie to perfect, or not perfect, conclude or not conclude the ſaid Articles, yea they could not with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie of conſcience and diſcharge of the truſt impoſed on them, proceede to the deliverie or concluſion of the ſaid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, being enformed that His Majeſtie had now recalled the Marques his Commiſſion, authorizing him to conclude a peace; it being a Maxime generally received aſwell in the lawes of <hi>England</hi> as in the Ceſarean or Common law, <hi>extingui man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datum per revocationem mandantis;</hi> that a Commiſſion given to any is extinguished by the revocation thereof, and out of the extinction of the Commiſſion foloweth the extinction alſo of all obligation to purſue the contract, nay wee shall shew hereafter, that the Commiſſion given to our Committee to conclude this rejected peace was not onely invalid but alſo ſufficiently recalled before any ſuch peace was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Wherefore wee may without difficultie conclude that no obligation of law did enforce our Partie to conclude this peace.

The obligation of law being thus extinguished, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the obligation of honour, which is grounded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon was alſo extinguished. This I adde, becauſe I have heard ſome of our Committee of Inſtructions ingeniouſly confeſſe, that they had never conſented to proceede unto the concluſion of that peace, if they had thought, they were not obliged thereunto by Law and honour, of which ignorance I marvailo they were not freed by thoſe among them, who were skilfull in the lawes: they themſelves might obſerve in the Marques of <hi>Ormonds</hi> recoyling from the Contract, that hee held himſelfe not bound either in Law or honour to conclude the ſame; why then should they thinke themſelves more bound than he? if there was any obligation, it was alſo mutuall; ſo as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques could not be free, unleſſe ou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r partie were alſo free; If our Councell and Committees would needs inſiſt ſo much upon honour, they should rather in honour deſiſt from the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any peace with his Excellencie, ſeeing they were ſo fool'd by him, as having received their moneyes, to the value of three thouſand pounds (as is ſaid) to ſupply his preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, hee without any reſpect to ſuch favour done him, or to the precedent <hi>obligation of ſigning and ſealing</hi> the peace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected them and denyed to conclude any peace with them. Wherefore in very deed the concluſion of that peace did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound rather to their dishonour than honour; and the giving of ſo much money to the Marques was to diſgrace and prey the Countrey. Queſtionleſſe no good Catholique would ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute any money to purchaſe ſuch a peace. I wish this disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour were confined within the bounds of <hi>Ireland</hi> onely.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That utilitie to our Soveraigne could be no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to our Committee of the treatie to conclude ſuch a peace is alſo evident, in aſmuch as the Carholiques at home obſerving the iniquitie thereof tending directly to the maintenance of their ſworne Enemies and their owne deſtruction, had beene thereby wholly disheartned, and deterred from giving any aid to His Majeſtie either in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61604:10"/>
their perſons or meanes; and the Catholique Princes and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats abroad had likewiſe wholly ſubſtracted their ſuccours, deeming it againſt Conſcience to concurre to the preſervation of hereſie. And what can more dishearten the Catholiques of <hi>Ireland,</hi> than to ſee their ſervice, their Contributions, their proweſſe and fidelitie ſo vilipended, as they may not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enjoy thoſe priviledges onely and immunities, either in ſpirituall or temporall, which are due unto them by their birthright and which by the ancient fundamentall lawes of the kingdome they ought quietly and peaceably to enjoy? much more might be here ſaid, particularly touching the danger, whereunto our Soveraigne had been expoſed, if the poſſeſſion of his Forts and Command of his Armyes had been given to any, but to ſuch as are Catholiques. Whereof elſe where. That <note place="margin">See part. 1. ſup. art. 25. 28.</note> the neceſſitie of the kingdome should induce the Committee of the Treatie to make this peace, it may not be, ſeeing the kingdome was never in a better poſture to defend it ſelfe, or in greater hopes to chaſe away, and deſtroy the Enemie, than it was, when our Committee concluded this fatall peace, as you have, and shall hereafter heare more amply. Certainly if the hinderance of the proſecution of our victories againſt the Enemie be a diſprofit and detriment to His Majeſtie (as ſure it is) the concluding of this peace (where ſuch hinderance fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed) muſt be neceſſarily a diſprofit and detriment to His Majeſtie. Wherefore we may rightly conclude, that neither neceſſitie on our part nor utilitie on the Kings part, nor obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of law or honour did induce our Committee to the concluſion of this peace. Had our Councell and Committees shewd the ſame reſolution, and uſed the ſame endeavours to procure the acceptance of the Earle of <hi>Glamorgans</hi> honourable and juſt peace in the Enemies Quarters by force and armes, as they uſed to procure the acceptance of the Marques his disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and unjuſt peace in the Conſederate Catholiques Quarters, then had the puritie of their intentions been revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and their endeavours applauded. <hi>St autem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

cloake that treaſon) publickelie declared in the diſmembred Parliament of Dublin, that as it was lawfull for euery man euen by the law of nature to defend himſelfe againſt the violence of uniuſt Aſſailants, soe was it lawfull for the kings Lieutenant, and the kings priuie Councell in Dublin (for theire owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) to looke for ſuccour from the kings Enemies, (the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) againſt the kings ſubjects the Irish, who were in a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and hoſtile manner to aſſault them. letting this paſſe for an hyperbole, the Catholike Confederats doe brieflie affirme, that they were noe aſſailants, but defendents of theire lives, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, liberties, and eſtates againſt theire fellow ſubjects, and particularlie againſt the chiefe Miniſters of juſtice, who follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the ſteps of their Predeceſſours tirannically gouerning, made uſe of all the projects, that michieuous policie could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent to depriue them of theire lives, religion, liberties, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, wherin they have beene soe exorbitant, as neither the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the ancient fundamentall lawes of the kingdome, nor the kings owne Commands could preuaile with them. Here we muſt deſcend vnto particulars, and eſpeciallie to the kings Commands ſent vnto the Marques of Ormond <hi>enlarging</hi> his power for the ſpeedie concluſion of a happie peace.</p>
               <p n="21">21. <q>The <hi>impoſſibilitie</hi> (saith his Majeſtie writing to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of Olmond) of <hi>preſeruing</hi> my <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by a continuation of the warr, haueing moved me to give you theſe powers and directions, which I haue formerly done "for the concluding of a Peace there, and the ſame growing daily much more evident, that alone were reaſon enough for me to enlarge your powers, and to make my Commands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the point more poſitive. But beſides theſe conſiderations, it being now manifeſt, that the <hi>Engliſh Rebels</hi> have (as farras in them lies) given the command of <hi>Ireland</hi> to the <hi>Scots;</hi> that their aime is at a totall ſubverſion of Religion and Regall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and that nothing leſſe will content them, or purchaſe Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: here I think my ſelf bound in Conſcience not to let ſlip the meanes of ſetling that Kingdom (if it may be) fully under my obedience; nor to loſe that aſſiſtance which I may have from my <hi>Iriſh</hi> Subjects for ſuch ſcruples as in a leſſe preſſing condition might reaſonably be ſtuck at by me: For their ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61604:16"/>
I do therefore command you to conclude a Peace with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> whatever it coſt, ſo that my <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects there may be ſecured, and my Regall Authority preſerved; But for all this you are to make me the beſt bargaine you can, and not diſcover your inlargement of power till - you needs muſt. And though I leave the managing of this great and neceſſary work entirely to you, yet I cannot but tell you, that if the ſuſpenſion of <hi>Poynings Act</hi> for ſuch Bills as ſhall be agreed upon between you there, and the preſent taking away of the Penall Lawes againſt Papiſts, by a Law will do it; I ſhall not think it a hard Bargaine: ſo that freely and vigorouſly they ingage themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves in my aſſiſtance, againſt my Rebels of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> for which no conditions can be too hard, not being againſt Conſcience or Honour.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. Many things are here to be carefullie oberued by the Confederat Catholikes. firſt that this letter or <hi>enlargment</hi> of the Marques his <hi>power</hi> was neuer communicated vnto our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell or Committees (though then, and after in atctuall treatie with hym for a peace, by vertue of a former Commiſſion giuen him by his Maieſtie the 24. th of Iune before) vntill the ſame was put into the preſſe by the Parliament, who found the ſame in his Maieſties Cabinet in the battell of Nasby; from the print of London it was ſent into France, and there ſent by accident into Ireland. yet the reuocation of the Marques his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the letter of the 11. of Iune aboue mentioned was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with and without delay communicated vnto vs by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, and soe punctuallie obſerued as noe precedent obligation paſt betweene him and the Confederat Catholikes could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to goe forward. By which the Confederat Catholikes may with reſentment take notice, how litle behoulding they haue beene vnto the Marques of Ormond for any graces or fauours shewd them by him, though his fauorits haue extolld his imaginarie fauours don the Contry beyond meaſure. 2. Whether the Kingdome haue more cauſe to conceiue iealouſie (in this respect) againſt the Marques, who (as yow may behould in the letter) had ſome Commaunds not <hi>to diſcouer the enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his power till he needs muſt,</hi> than againſt the then ſupreme Councell, who receiuing this letter in Iuly or Auguſt 1645. did
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61604:17"/>
neuer to this day reueale or publish the ſame vnto the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. whether this was don by them, becauſe they were then actuallie concluding a peace (in huggar muggar) with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques and therin reſolued to reiect theſe royall graces of the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale of the penall lawes,</hi> and <hi>ſuſpension of Poynings act,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would not diſcouer theſe graces, leaſt theire owne remi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnes in the cauſe of God should be likewiſe diſcouered: or for what other cavſe they did it, 'twere fit to bring into queſtion. 3. we are to obſerue with what confidence the Marques procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with our Committee, with whom he doubted not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a peace on more abiect Conditions than the king himſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe did grant vnto them. 4. That as Sir William Parſons and the reſt of the Rownd-headed priuie Councell of Dublin did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe from the Contry the graces ſent ouer into the Chtholike Confederats of Ireland the Auguſt before the firſt of theſe Commotions; ſoe our owne intruſted Catholikes ſuppreſſed theſe other graces granted vnto vs by his Maieſtie ſince theſe Commotions. <hi>inimici hominis domeſtici eius.</hi> 5. out of all which yow may further obſerue the hypocriſie of ſome great ones in Dublin; who (to cloake theire diſloyall recourſe for ſuccours to the Parliamentarie Rebels) gaue out that they were forced the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runto for theire neceſſarie defence againſt the Confederat Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes: wheras it is is moſt certaine if the Marques had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs what the king commanded him by this letter, and not giuen (for his owne priuat ends, to the kings irrecouerable detriment) impediment to the Earle of Glamorgans articles of peace; the Catholike Conſederats had ioynd with armes and hearts in ſoe happie a peace, and (by Gods bleſſing) they had (wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th the hazard of theire liues, eſtates, and fortunes, together with the aids of forren Catholike Princes and Prelats) preuented and preſerued his Majeſtie from the deplorable condition wherin now he is; and chaſed out the of three kingdomes his ſworne enemies. In a word the Marques, and thoſe of Dublin ſent vnto the kings Ennemies for ſuccours, not to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as they pretended; but to defend theire obſtinat diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the kings Commands; and their inordinat deſires to preſerue theſe pernicions hereticks who are known toſide <hi>with</hi>

and ſweare <hi>for</hi> the Parliament; wherfor the Confederat Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes did diſcharge theire dutie to God, and theire allegian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to theire king in ſetting vpon such disloyall Refractories wherin they proceeded (Like faithfull ſubjects) in a defenſiue way, endeauouring to maintaine the preſent grants and graces, which theire gratious Soueraigne conferred vpon them, and the ancient fundamentall lawes of the kingdome, chiefly that of Magna Charta, wherin theire, religion, liberties, liues, and eſtates haue beene ſecured vnto them; for defence Wherof mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of noble Catholike ſubjects in England in former ages haue ſacrificed theire liues and fortunes, and taken vp armes, euen againſt theire owne ſoueraignes: how much more iuſtlie might the Confederat Catholikes, (for defence of the ſame lawes) take vp armes againſt theire fellow ſubjects, who, as they haue rebelled againſt God by repealing thoſe ancient funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall lawes and eſtablishing new deſtructiue to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith; ſoe haue they, and ſtill doe rebell againſt the lords an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed theire liege lord and ſoueraigne, by diſobeying his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Commands; and attempting the ruin of him and his royall iſſue.

To shew the inſufficiencie, defects, and nullitie of the ſaid commiſſion wee neede not entertaine ſharpe-ſighted Lawyers, the errors, and defects thereof are ſo groſſe and palpable, as men meanly verſant in that profeſſion may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty diſcover them.

As for the Act of aſſembly 10. <hi>Auguſti</hi> 1644. even now mentioned number 34. you ſee the kingdome ſelected indeed the foreſaid Committee of Treaty, but never (by that act) authorized the Supreme Councell, to give them a Commiſſion to that effect. Yet that ſuch an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie is neceſſarie, is ſuppoſed by the Councell it ſelfe, which groundeth it ſelfe on the like authoritie, as you have heard numb. 34. for as the aſſembly onely in the name of the whole kingdome, and not the Supreme Councell, had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to ſend Commiſſioners to His Majeſtie ſo the Aſſembly onely and not the Councell, had power to ſend Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

Accordingly wee ſay, that the firſt Supreme Councell, being removed from that office, are civilly dead, and therefore any authority given them (in this particular) or by them (in vertue thereof) given to the Committee of Treatie (for in theſe two reſpects the Councell may be called <hi>Mandatarij</hi> and <hi>Mandantes)</hi> is extinguiſhed and dyes with the late removed Councell.</p>
               <p n="36">36. It is true that the common power and authoritie given to the Supreme Councell by the Modell of Government may peradventure deſcend upon the ſucceeding Supreme Councells, becauſe by the Modell of Govurnment that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon power is expreſly declared to be conferred by the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome on the Supreme Councell <hi>for the time being;</hi> but the caſe is other wiſe in this weighty matter, whereon depends the ſecuritie and ſafetie of Religion, King and Subject; and therefore being tranſcendent and extraordinarie it muſt be acted by and concluded by tranſcendent and extraordinarie power: and as the Commiſſioners appointed to goe to his

Majeſtie muſt have beene eſtabliſhed and appointed by the whole Kingdome, becauſe, indeed their imployment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the whole Kingdome; ſo (for the ſame reaſon) the Commiſſioners appointed to treate with His Majeſties Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant (in this particular) muſt be authorized (either me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly or immediatly) by the whole Kingdome; for as much as their imployment concernes the whole Kingdom. If His Majeſtie did conferre any power or authoritie upon any Corporation, which hee would have to continue in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Magiſtrats thereof, hee is carefull in his patents or Charters to uſe theſe words: to the Maior, or to the Maior and Citizens <hi>for the time being,</hi> to ſhew, that his intention is not to make this power perſonall onely: but in that commiſſion, which the firſt Supreme Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell pretend to have had from the aſſembly, there are no ſuch words uſed, authorizing the <hi>Supreme Councell for the time being.</hi> Much more may be here ſaid, which I leave to our learned Lawyers diſcuſſion, whereof ſome (vnto whom I have propounded this difficultie, have aſſured me, that (for this reſpect) the Commiſſion given our Committee of Treaty by the Councell. wasſufficienr and inv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And when I admired, that the Supreme Councell dared attempt ſuch an enterprize without a full and ſolid authoritie from the Kingdome, my admiration was augmented by the anſwer I received from one affected to them, to wit, that the <hi>Councell made no doubt</hi> to conclude all things (as they pleaſed) by force.</p>
               <p n="37">37. The laſt Supreme Councell was eſtabliſhed the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of March 1645.

I ſuſpect this order (though it make little to the preſent purpoſe) to be one of thoſe ſurrepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious orders; the cauſe of my ſuſpition is; that in the ſelfe ſame Aſſembly 19.

That five ſecular men ſhould be made Supreme Iudges in a Catholique Kingdome of Prelate and Prieſt, of Regular and ſecular, of Religion, Church, and Church-livings, of Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction, adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacraments, celebration of divine ſervice and office, &amp;c. <hi>à ſeculo non eſt auditum,</hi> no not in <hi>Henry</hi> the eights owne dayes. <hi>Numquid omnes Crumvelli? numquid omnes vicarij in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualibus &amp; temporalibus? numquid omnes Braini?</hi> And this is the third argument, whereby wee prove the invaliditie of the ſaid peace.</p>
               <p n="39">39. The fourth argument may be deduced out of the number ſelected by the kingdome to be of the Committee <note place="margin">4.

This ſelected number of 13. did belong unto the ſubſtance, and (as it were) eſſence of the commiſſion or authoritie given by the Kingdome, and therefore could not be altered without rendring the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion invalid. When I reade in the commiſſion given by the firſt Supreme Councell to the committee of Treaty, that the number of thirteene was appointed, and no power men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned therein authorizing them to diminiſh that number<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was indeed aſtonished, and therefore laboured ſo much the

more earneſt to finde out if any act of Aſſembly there were giving them any ſuch authoritie; at length I lighted on an act paſt 23. Auguſt 1644. Wherein <hi>it is ordered</hi> by Aſſembly, <hi>that the Supreme Councell shall grant Commiſsions under Seale from time to time unto ſuch, and ſo many of the Commiſsioners nominated and authorized by the houſe to TREATE with the Lord Marques of Ormond for eſtablishing of a firme peace within this Kingdome, or a further Ceſſation of armes, as the ſaid Supreme Councell, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall Committee of Instructions shall thinke fit.</hi> This act of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly may ſeeme to quell the ſtrength of my fourth argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Yet I cannot but reſume, and urge for my argument againſt this order 1. that it doth not ſo much warrant the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Councell to diminiſh the number of the Committee of Treaty, as it doth limit the power of the ſaid committee; for here (as in the firſt act of Aſſembly) no greater power is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, than to TREATE of a peace, &amp;c. and no power at all to <hi>conclude</hi> a peace. 2.

That ever the Marques obtained his deſire herein by conſent of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly I never heard, nay I have heard the cleere contrarie, that the aſſembly reſolv'd never to change or diminiſh the number of that committee, Howſoever I doe not know but this act of the 23. of Auguſt was hedg'd in upon this motion, the circumſtances whereof I could wiſh were diligently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.

The ſumme is, as he would have a peace of his owne moulding, ſo would he have a committee pliable to his owne reſolutions; and it is remarkable, that when any that was of that ſame ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of five, which the Councell cul'd cut, were ſuſpected to ſtand conſtantly for the cauſe of God and the Countrey, and not to yeeld to the Marques his abject conditions, ſuch art was uſed, that ſuch kind of perſons were then kept from the Treatie, when all things were upon concluſion.

               <p n="5">5. In this letter the Lord Nuncius doth elegantly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh in the Marques of <hi>Ormond</hi> a double qualitie, the one of a Lieutenant for his Majeſtie, the other of a chiefe Peere of the realme. In the qualitie of Lieutenant, hee proves no firme and ſolide peace can be made with him; foraſmuch as his <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">No firme peace could be made with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</note> 
                  <hi>depends of the King, and by how much the more or the leſſe the ſecuritie and power of his Majeſtie increaſeth or decreaſeth, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſariiy followeth that the authoritie alſo of the Lieutenant increaſeth and decreaſeth, and that the ſafetie and authoritie of the King being uncertaine, the authoritie alſo of Lieutenant becometh void and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine &amp;c. and if this be true in thoſe articles, which belong to the politicke ſtate of the Kingdome, how much more in the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate, and things belonging to the Catholique Faith; against which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61604:31"/>
(he being a Proteſtant) hath an averſion of minde, beſides the want of authoritie. VVherefore the Confederate Catholiques ought not by any meanes chooſe any other way, than by laying aſide in the interim any treatie of peace. &amp;c. untill the Kings moſt excellent Majeſtie be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Inhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on untill the King confirme the peace of Rome.</note> 
                  <hi>to that ſtate and condition, as he may confirme by Parliament the Articles, which His Holynes agreed upon with Digby in Rome: which thing ſeemes not onely profitable and neceſsarie for the affaires of Ireland in the preſent ſtate, but alſo honourable to the King himſelfe, ſeeing all things are reſerved to his authoritie untill that time, when he shall be in the full libertie of dominion, and the loyaltie of the Irish shall be able to merit ſomewhat with his Majestie &amp;c. which shall be</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pidelitie of the Iriſh.</note> 
                  <hi>augmented by the Catholiques publique proteſtation, that whatſoever they poſſeſſe or acquire shall be with all loyaltie and fidelitie preſerved for his Majestie;</hi> who otherwiſe may be waſh'd out of all, if Parliamentarie Harpies once fix their Tallons in them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hee proceedeth further ſhewing <hi>how glorious it shall be unto the Confederate Catholiques, that the advance of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique cauſe, the ſplendour, libertie, lawes, rites, and publike exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Religion, proceeded rather from themſelves, and from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate love they beare to true Religion, than from any treaty with the Marques, whoſe authoritie lyes a bleeding, &amp;c. All Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (and chiefely the Pope) would be offended, that any peace (and that of abject conditions) should be here treated of, while the peace (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining honourable and good conditions) concluded upon in Rome doth expect only our Kings approbation; as if particular men (and thoſe Procestants to) could better provide for Ireland,</hi> and the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church; <hi>than His Holynes</hi> can doe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If the Marques be conſidered <hi>as a Peere of the Realme;</hi> in that reſpect <hi>he may have all things common to the reſt of the Irish,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Church's care that loyaltie he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to Princes 11. 5. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>and therefore I hold he may be a defender of his countrey againſt the common enemies. And if he will, as an Irish man, and a Servant to his Majeſtie gather all his forces againſt the Scots and Parliamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he ought to be received, yea, and to be aſsiſted by money and other ſubſidies, ſo as the Catholique Religion by ſuch kinde of conjunction receive no detriment:</hi> for effecting whereof he layeth downe (among other) theſe conditions; <hi>if it shall ever happen that the forces of the Marquis be joyned with the Catholique forces, that then he may by no meanes establish any other Religion, than the Catholique

Therefore to this end we must be warie, leaſt in the interim, while the affaires of England doe waver, wee doe any thing, which may compell the Nuncius Apoſtolicus, in the behalfe of His Holyneſſe, to proteſt againſt it,</hi> as by his private letters he hath <hi>proteſted a few dayes past.</hi> Hee addeth further, that <hi>Dublin</hi> be delivered to the poſſeſſion of the Confederates to be <hi>preſerved for the Kings moſt excellent Maieſtie;</hi> that all hopes may be cut off from the Pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

they would never conclude any peace, but that whereunto he would condeſcend, upon which conditions he came into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and they accordingly accepted of him. Hereof the Nuncius challenged them in the above proteſtation; but their ſilence in not anſwering thereunto argues their tacit confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of breach of promiſe. I doe not know what conſcience men may frame unto themſelves, to ſend into Rome by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Agents, praying the See Apoſtolique, to helpe and honour this Nation with a Nuncius Apoſtolique, and after ſo great a Prince and Prelat (having expoſed himſelfe to many dangers by Sea &amp; by Land) arrived in this Kingdome with full and ample power to aide and aſſiſt the confederate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, not onely by his councell and adviſe, but alſo by the contribution of moneyes and ammunition; to make uſe of him to ſerve their owne turnes, but never to follow his wayes or direction, never performe what they promiſed, but lurkingly to proceed in the concluſion of this miſerable peace. Whereof the Nuncius being privately advertiſed, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſudden ſending of the committee of Treaty to <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin,</hi> challenged them of their promiſe; unto whom by their lelter <hi>dated at Kilkenny menſe Marcij</hi> 1645. they anſwered that the committee <hi>concluded no articles of peace, neither could there be any articles of peace perfected or have any power before the Calends of May, and that nothing was done contrarie to the ſenſe of the paper ſigned and delivered to his most Illuſtrious domination,</hi> and therefore <hi>prayed</hi> him to <hi>give credit unto them, profeſsing theſe things.</hi> Its not without myſterie, that the day of the moneth of March is omitted in this letter: leaſt they ſhould be found guiltie of notable falſhood; for at this very time were the committee in <hi>Dublin</hi> actually labouring in drawing up the articles of peace, and in <hi>ſigning and ſealing</hi> the ſame; for (if you be remembred) their commiſſion was given them the 6. day of the ſame moneth of March, the draught of the Articles was given <hi>Mr Darcy</hi> by the Viſcount <hi>Muskerie</hi> on the 14. of the ſame moneth, and <hi>ſigned and ſealed</hi> on the 28. wherefore the councell did purpoſely abſtaine from putting to the letter the preciſe day of the date thereof, to conceale their owne ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and clancular proceeding in concluding that peace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie

to their promiſe paſt unto the Nuncio, which in this laſt letter of the firſt of Iune they tacitly confeſſe.

Our ſecond anſwer is, that the loud cry of the people (and that confirmed by the Lord Nuncius his letters above) is, that our late Supreme councell themſelves are the chiefe cauſe of ſuch <hi>weakeneſſe and neceſsity,</hi> aſwell becauſe they continued for the ſpace of three yeares a tedious, chargeable, and needleſſe ceſſation with the Marqueſse of <hi>Ormond:</hi> by which meanes the Parliamentary rebels in the <hi>North, Conaght</hi> and <hi>Mounſter</hi> (who at firſt accepted the ceſſation) had leaſure enough to ſtrengthen themſelves, who having ſufficiently furniſhed themſelves from <hi>England</hi> and other places, rejected the ceſſation, and put in practiſe their hidden treaſon: as alſo becauſe they conſumed vaſt ſummes of mony on the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of <hi>Ormond</hi> and other known enemies of Religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any neceſſitie, which being obſerved by Catholique Princes, and Prelates abroad, gave occaſion unto them to ſubtract the aid and ſuccours, they reſolved to give unto the Confederate Catholiques for the advance of Religion, and conſervation of Monarchie.

72. Now to come to the ſecond thing, which is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. <hi>Glamorgans</hi> peace is grounded on the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion dated the 12. of March, where his Majeſty authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth him <hi>as firmely as under the great Seale to all intents &amp; purpoſes,</hi> &amp; obligeth himſelfe <hi>in the word of a King, and a Christian to ratifie and performe</hi> what he ſhould grant to the Confederate Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes. His Excellency the Marqueſſe of <hi>Clanrikards</hi> engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is grounded on no ſuch Commiſſion, he onely volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily engageth himſelfe without any invitation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate catholicks, and is aſſumed, as an inſtrument by thoſe, who would croſſe his Majeſties foregoing grants made unto the catholickes, who may reaſonably thus diſcourſe with themſelves: if thoſe men have fruſtrated his Majeſties owne grants and the peace by his commiſſion concluded, how much more will they fruſtrate the engagements of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſubject, which are grounded on nothing but on his own undertakings, and in caſe of non performance the catholicke confederats have no redreſſe. Neyther doth the Kings Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant himſelfe oblige himſelfe to the performance of any thing, nay rather this engagement ſuppoſeth his oppoſition to ſome things. To conclude (omitting much more) the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who concluded <hi>Glamorgans</hi> peace, have beene authorized by King and countrey; the parties concluding <hi>Clanrikards</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement have beene authorized by neyther; and therefore invalid and to no effect. Out of which, and what alreadie hath beene anſwered by the councell and congregation 24. Novemb. 1646. it is evident how farre thoſe nine catholicke church-men of <hi>Dublin</hi> erred in their judgement, when unto a queſtion propounded unto them touching this matter, they anſwered, <hi>that the Roman Confederate catholickes of this kingdome may without ſcruple ſubmit to the</hi> late rejected <hi>peace and accept thereof as strengthned with the ſaid addititionall engagements.</hi> Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it avayle them to adde <hi>(the circumſtances of times and preſent ſtate of this diſtreſſed kingdome conſidered)</hi> ſeeing we had better conditions from his Majeſty himſelfe, when we were in a worſe poſture, &amp; we were never in a better poſture, then we were when this engagement was offered, if miſchievous faction had not put a diviſion among us. <hi>Veruntamen, vae illi

In both parts of this Survey, I am perſwaded, I have produced ſolid demonſtrations to prove the principall concluſions by me handled; if in ſome acceſſories, which follow the principals, I have onely produced probable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or reaſons grounded on violent preſumption, or juſt conjectures, I am not therefore to be reprehended, becauſe in matters, which may prejudice our Religion, and hazard our lives, fortunes, and eſtates, we may make uſe even of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, of the truth whereof there may be ſome doubts or ſuſpicion; with how much more reaſon may we make uſe of arguments, which carry with them ſome probability; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are alleaged <hi>per modum Cautelae &amp;c.</hi> to prevent the ſuſpected.

If the clergie had beene ſilent, then (to ſave the credit of a few private perſons) they had hazarded their owne credit, and ſunke in the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicke enterpriſe by them attempted for defence of Religion, King and countrey: neither had the confederate catholiques been ſo truly informed of the nature and condition of the ſaid rejected Peace, had conſequently they had beene ignorant of their owne miſerie. Thoſe good Gentlemen, who have herein manifeſted their affection to the Marques of <hi>Ormond,</hi> have not beene ſo well recompenced by his Excellency, as they deſerve; for in his treatie with the Parliament, he was carefull to provide for the ſecuritie of all the Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but neglected to provide for the ſecuritie, either of thoſe Gentlemen, or of other his deereſt catholique friends and neereſt alliance. <hi>Maledictus homo, qui confidit in homine.</hi>
