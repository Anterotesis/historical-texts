            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T might well have beene wished, that the growth of Romish errours and superstitions (the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of this time) had not made this Worke too seasonable: True it is, though it doe but now see the light, yet it came to the birth before any other Answer of <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> was knowne to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour; it came indeed to the birth, but there was no strength to deliver; the judgement of those times not giving way to any other besides those whose Answers have beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made publick. But though they have run before like <hi>Cushi</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2 Sam. 18.</hi>
               </note> this, like <hi>Ahimaaz,</hi> (yet perchance not altogether without ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings) may run after: and with <hi>Ahimaaz,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64025:3"/>
it may make the better speede, because, with him, it goes <hi>the way of the Plaine</hi>; it goes a plaine way, speaking plainely the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>Shiboleth</hi>; and it useth plainnesse and evidence of speech, in which way it is likely to meet with most Readers. Neither doth it come altogether without tidings; for it brings with it the tidings of Truth and Love, and, by both, a remedy against error and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritablenesse. And, as it is a worke of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, so is it sutably fitted with charitable expressions; for it doth not take up those sharpe arrowes which in these Concertations too often are shot at mens persons, besides the Marke of the Matter. True it is, that where the Writer doth put his faults into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Booke, and doth publish them of purpose to have them seene, and by the sight of them to make others faulty, there it will bee a duty of obedience, as well as of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary providence (for the Readers safety) to take notice of them. Controversies cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely looke like breaches of love, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Authour hath not been much in love with them: But if love will bee lost, except it be kept by a Controversie, there the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie that keepes it, is a worke of love: To strive against uncharitablenesse, that it may be removed, and charity put in the roome of
<pb facs="tcp:64025:3"/>
it, is an act of charity; and this charity is the businesse of this work.</p>
            <p>The Reader may also take notice, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers passages not insisted on by the other, are here examined, because this worke surveyeth the whole Booke, which it answers more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly then the other.</p>
            <p>There hath indeed come forth a Reply in defence of <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi>: But both the one and the other turne mainely on these two hinges; <hi>That there must be an entire unity of faith in all Truths revealed by God, and proposed by the Church</hi>: And, <hi>That if u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity were to be held by the faith of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, a perfect and uniforme List should be given of those Fundamentals.</hi> Now these two hinges being taken off in this Book, I hope it may give a fall to the maine matter of them both.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Replyer strives to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide our unity by this Engine,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page 81.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>That some Protestants directly, wittingly, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly dis-beleeve what others do beleeve to bee testified by the Word of God; and herein is no difference between Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and not Fundamentall:</hi> It is rejoyned for a defence against this Engine of division, That if herein be no difference betweene the one and the other in Fundamentals, there is
<pb facs="tcp:64025:4"/>
no proofe that they are not united members in the body of Christ: For, hee that wittingly and willingly dis-beleeves that which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beleeves to bee testified by the Word of God, may know, (as the terme <hi>wittingly</hi> seems to import) that the point dis-beleeved is not testified by the Word of God; and so hee may bee safe, and is still one with Christ and his Members: Againe, the other who beleeves it to bee testified by the Word of God, may bee deceived: yet the point not being fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, his errour may not divide him from the other which is a member of Christ. Indeed, if a Protestant should know a point to be testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Word of God, and then dis-beleeve it, that might prove him not to be in the Body of Christ; but first, This would bring him within the difference of Fundamentals and not Fundamentals, contrary to the Replyers Affirmation: for it is a maine Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall to beleeve God; whom that man beleeves not, who wittingly and willingly denyes the Word of God. And secondly, It is meerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent and incompossible, That hee who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves Fundamentals, should wittingly and willingly dis-beleeve what hee knows the God of Truth hath spoken. And, if out of weaknesse, errour, and ignorance hee doth not beleeve that God hath spoken it; this ignorance, if it
<pb facs="tcp:64025:4"/>
be not in Fundamentals, doth not inforce a disunion from other Members of the Body of Christ. Thus the Replyers objected Not-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, either falls under Fundamentals, and then his case is not rightly put; or else it falls not under Fundamentals, and then it doth not conclude a disunion betweene Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants. This having received my selfe, I impart to the Reader, with a Prayer, that in reading this Worke, hee may bee enlightned with that Spirit of Truth which alone can kindly discover both the Mystery of godliness, and the Mystery of iniquity; and that the same Spirit may hold him in the one, and keep him from the other.</p>

               <p>Wherefore, upon the whole matter, wee may undoubtedly conclude, that Rome, as shee wants catholick love and peace towards many famous parts of the catholick Church, and is therefore unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick; so shee notably and especially pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:64025:19"/>There is a Scarlet woman drunk with the bloud of the Saints,<note place="margin">Isa. 47.5. Rev. 17.6.</note> and her owne mouth saith, <hi>I sit as a</hi> Lady, <hi>and shall see no sorrow.</hi> This Lady is also a mother, even the mother of abominations; and this is the Lady mother, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants charge with uncharitablenesse, for condemning them to hell. Now I would hope that no Cavalier should so misplace his valour, as to fight like a Knight for a bloudy Lady, nor as a sonne for a mother of abominations; and yet if this Cavalier doe not fight for this Lady in this Book, hee fights not against us, nor for her whom wee accuse; and so the Book is but a long mistaking.</p>
                  <p>Yet, because this scarlet and bloudy Lady doth cover her selfe with the title of the Church, and under that cover deceiveth many; and here wee finde that a defence of the Church is undertaken, as charged with uncharitablenesse, there appears some possibility that this Lady, who is indeed so charged, may bee defended under the title of the Church, her sonne by that title be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceived into this defence: Wherefore it may bee not altogether uselesse to make good this charge of uncharitablenesse on this Lady, though mistaken, and defended
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64025:20"/>
under the name of the Church, lest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance some others also may bee led away from their stedfastnesse by this Cavaliers error, and think it improbable and impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that shee which is called the Church should be uncharitable; Whereas indeed it is neither probable nor possible that the scarlet Lady, drunken with the bloud of the Saints, though wearing the title of the Church, should be to the same Protestants both charitable and cruell; yea indeed this Lady doth thus double her wrong: for it is one injury uncharitably to hate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the true catholicke Church in her children; and a second to take her name from her, thereby to justifie and beare out her owne wrong and persecution with her owne name.</p>
                  <p>But yet here I must at first acknowledge that this Cavalier, fighting for this Lady, is not farre from agreeing with us that fight against her: for wee finde this position a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed by him, That if shee proceed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably against <hi>Protestants,</hi> shee is a <hi>Harlot, and a Strumpet, not the Spouse of Christ</hi>; now hereunto wee subjoyne: But the Chapter foregoing plainely sheweth that Rome hath proceeded uncharitably against Protestants; and now, how can we
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64025:20"/>
keep off this Cavalier from agreeing with us in one common conclusion; Therefore Rome is an Harlot, and not the Spouse of Christ: which if hee affirme, I will not blame him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.</note> because Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith the same, and it were a fault to finde fault with him when hee speaks Scripture. Yet hee will needs strive to shew, that what hath been proved is improbable, and that truth is untrue.</p>
                  <p>And first hee indeavours to prove it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that this Lady, through want of charity, should pronounce a damning sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against Protestants, but rather from some errour in Judgement, indiscreet zeal, &amp;c. because she hath abundance of charity; and this abundance of charity againe hee will prove by many particulars, which, it seems, appear to him in the shape of works of charity. And indeed, because the Romish Champions stand much upon their works, and cast the carkasses of them in our way, so to hinder our prosecutions of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish <hi>Sheba,</hi>

                  <p>TOward this removall, I answer, that there are many works that looke like fruits of charity, but are not that which they seeme: They may perchance have the same matter that workes of charity have; but, not being quickned and enlived by charity, a fruit of the spirit, they are but dead carcasses, and not the fruits of living charity.</p>
                  <p>The Sacrifice of <hi>Cain</hi> was to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eye a fruit of love to God; but while hee hated his brother whom hee saw, hee could not love God whom hee saw not: and thus wanting charity, his Sacrifice could not bee a fruit of that charity which hee wanted. And indeed, there are many
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64025:21"/>
motives and causes besides charity that may bring forth to the eye such seeming good works. And wee see such motives generally over-spread upon the face of the Romish Monarchy: especially since wee see in Romists, killing of brethren joyned with these works; as in <hi>Cain,</hi> fratricide was joyned with sacrifice, how can we take the works of such to be other then the sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Cain?</hi>

Now a State sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the shew of Christian Religion, may very well give way to many works of Christian Religion which helpe to make this shew; especially those, which besides the advancement of Rome, in advancing her hornes of the Lambe, or shew of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, doe also immediatly advance her wealth, strength and supremacie. And if wee examine most of those works whereof this Author hath made a glittering Table, they are such as by some one of these waies do increase the glory of the Papacie. Now the Church of Rome being understood

                     </note> of faith to perswade faithlesnesse, and by the shew of charity to palliate uncharitablenesse and persecution: And indeed, I think the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent wonders at his owne wit in the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and applauds it as the highest and most artificiall counterfeit of a creation, because therein hee hath wrought, and as it were created contraries out of contraries; Out of a doctrine of deepest humility, hee hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the highest pride; and from a doctrine of contempt of the world, hee hath raised a title to the whole world; from a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of patience, long-suffering, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect charity, hee hath raised a catholick persecution, tormenting the world with uncharitablenesse and cruelty. And so by this kinde of infernall Alchimie (which hee still continueth,) the seeming good works, yea, the true ones done by the remnant of Grace, are digested to nourish and defend the sinnes, and among them the uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse of the man of Sinne. There is yet a second sort of works, which passe for works of charitie, but are indeed works of error; for they issue from error, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not from charitie; these are fained,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64025:24"/>
empty and hollow inventions or imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions given by Rome to her children, in stead of nourishing and solid gifts of true motherly piety; so indeed they are rather works of Poetry, then of Charity: such are the Popes Jubiles and Indulgences, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those which are annexed to a <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,</hi> like that sent into Ireland, which stirred up subjects to rebell against their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne. But in our Authors own Catalogue of Romes charitable workes, I take notice of her giving things for Sacraments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring grace, which are none; now when Rome giveth these to her children for Sacraments which are none, shee giveth them not gifts of charity, but of vanity, yea, of cruelty; for a cruelty it is for a mother to feede her children with fictions in stead of Sacraments: as when a father to his hungry so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>There is also a third kinde of Romish works, which looke like works of charitie, but are not such indeed, because they come not from a right spring, nor ayme at a right end; they come not from the love of God, nor ayme to the glory of God; but come from error, pride, and selfe-love, and have
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64025:24"/>
selfe-ends: such are works done for merit, satisfaction, and supererogation: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, these carnall wayes of doing good works, are generally very successfull; for all mankinde is flesh of flesh; so that if you speake of a worke of charity to bee done a carnall way, and to carnall ends, you have all mankinde already fitted to heare you: but if you speake of works of charity to be spiritually done, and for spirituall ends, there are farre fewer that have a spirituall eare to heare what the Spirit saith: Yet upon the works carnally done, and for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ends, doth the Papacy exceedingly multiply the number of her works of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, mentioned in the Catalogue; yet an army of these is but an army of dead men, even of dead workes, which have not the spirit: And uncharitable is shee who suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, yea, teacheth her children to bring forth dead works, when, by good instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they might have gotten life into them from the quickning Spirit.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Claime of Charitie is confuted, which is drawn from the seven Romish Sacraments.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ANd as thus generally, so now more particularly let us put the Cavaliers supposed works of charity to the touch, and try whether true charity may bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them to be in the Papacie.</p>
                  <p>But before wee come to his proofes, I cannot but take notice that his preparative is very pleasant; for therein hee speaks of seeing <hi>the holy catholick Church dissolve, and as it were defeate her selfe of her very selfe, for the acquiring of all imaginable, both tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and eternall blessings to mankinde.</hi> Surely, it seemeth to mee, hee could hardly have chosen words more contrary to the actions of the Papacie: and this the former Chapter, and many Stories doe over-abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly shew; for we see plainly, that Rome is so farre from defeating her selfe, for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall blessings to mankinde, that for the acquiring of temporall blessings to her selfe, shee defeats Kings both of their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and lives. And whereas hee saith, a man needs no more, but to have eyes in his head to see her charitablenesse; it seems
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64025:25"/>
much rather, that hee who in numberlesse slaughters, and actions of bloud, doth not see her uncharitablenesse, hath need of that strong delusion which causeth men not to beleeve truth though they see it with their eies.</p>
                  <p>But I come to the Authors owne Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Romish works of charity, and take notice of it as it begins with a mans begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and for profitable reasons doth not end at his ending: For, seven proofes of charity which hee names, are seven Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; of which, one begins at mans birth, and the last comes as neere his end as it may; but when it can goe no further, it is lengthened with prayer for the dead, which often brings good, or at least profit to the living (if they bee paid for these prayers) and so perchance may be taken for good works.</p>
                  <p>But whereas among these he speakes of giving Baptisme and the Lords Supper, as fruits and proofes of Romish charity; I answer, that the Papacie must allow or suffer the giving of these, or else there cannot be under her Throne that shew of a Church in which Antichrist must sit, that hee may looke like the beast which hath horns of a Lambe: Without these his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64025:26"/>
were neere dissolved, and wee should see the Dragon starke naked in him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pope may keepe these for love to himselfe, and not to his subjects.</p>
                  <p>But, saith the Cavalier, his Church gives Baptisme very early, as soone as the childe is borne, and this haste is a signe and a fruit of charity. And why may it not be a signe and fruit of error in judgement rather then of charitie? yea, why may it not proceed of an uncharitable error, seeing it often damneth children for want of that washing which they could not have in their mothers belly? for many thousands of infants must be damned by the same charitable opinion which makes this haste to baptize others. And although this opinion anciently might perchance bee taken for an error in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet on the latter, to whom the point hath beene more plainely cleared, it may much more probably lay a guilt of uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritablenesse. Sure it is, that if want of charity bee not the cause of it, yet want of charity doth accompany or follow it, as it doth the Popish beleefe of Protestants damnation: for to infants unbaptized, and Protestants, I thinke there is little charitie afforded by Papists when they have once damned them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:64025:26"/>Let them also consider how this doth give a proofe of their charity, when there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they make the Gospel of grace more deadly then the killing Law: for the Law damned not infants for dying without circumcision seven daies after the birth, in which time there was a possibility of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcising them; but these men make the Gospel to damne children for dying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized before they bee borne, when it is not possible to baptize them.</p>
                  <p>The Lords Supper is put off for a while, and Confirmation is brought in next for a Sacrament, and this Sacrament for a confirmation of Romish charity: and indeed, so much as Confirmation is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, so much let it be a confirmation of Romish charitie.<note place="margin">

And himselfe affirmeth, that the time when Christ did institute this Sacrament is not recorded by the sacred Historians; and withall, hee acknowledgeth (according to <hi>Thomas</hi>) that to institute new Sacraments belongs to that excellency of power which is Christs alone. So the sacramentality of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64025:27"/>
Popish Confirmation seems to bee a stone, and not bread, which being given to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by a mother, proves rather her hatred then charity. But indeed, if they would make this use of Confirmation, to see that children bee brought, and made to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the grounds of salvation, this were bread and not a stone, and so a fruit of charity, and not of hatred: but to give them an outward signe, that gives nothing from without by any Sacramentall insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; and to give them no knowledge within, but a Creede or Lords Prayer in Latine, which they understand not, this is not a work of charity, but a deceiving, yea, a soule-killing cruelty and uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>The next seale of Romish charity, is the Sacrament of Confession and Penance; whereby, as our Author saith, <hi>when a man hath drunk of the poysoned cup of actuall sin, Rome strives to make him cast it up againe.</hi> Much might here bee said to prove this auricular Confession to be no Sacrament, and so no charity in giving that for a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament which is none. But of Romish uncharitablenesse in the use, or rather abuse of this which they call a Sacrament, there would scarce be time and place enough in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64025:27"/>
the world to containe the proofes of it. Wee know what Markets are made of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, even absolution from Penance; which being set to sale, doe plainely crosse Christs charitable doctrine, by making it easier for a rich man then a poore man to enter into the Kingdome of heaven. But indeed, it hath had this charitable conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that it hath caused many Nations to cast up, not single sins only, but the man of sinne himselfe: But otherwise, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this Author speakes of this Sacrament to cast up sinne, wee must complaine, that it hath beene used as a meanes to cast up goodnesse, and to cast sinne into a mould, even to nourish and strengthen it; for <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> thought it a good covert and hiding place of treason, saying, that in Confession hee first received the knowledge of the Powder-treason; and secondly, himselfe would not say that hee did cause his Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents to cast up this treason, but left it in their stomacks, wherein it lay with some of them untill death, not acknowledged as a sinne: Behold right Romish charity, plainly proved by the Sacrament of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; yea, this Sacrament hath beene by them uncharitably used, as a means (not to cast up sin, but) to cast up righteousnesse;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64025:28"/>
for some maine acts and duties of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse have been put to Penance as great sinnes. Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> and my selfe met with an Irish Pilgrime in France, who taking us, as hee said, for Catholickes, (wherein hee was not mistaken, if hee had rightly understood the word) told us, that hee was enjoyned by way of penance to goe on Pilgrimage to Rome and Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stella, for serving Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in her warres against <hi>Tyrone.</hi> See here not a sin cast up, but an excellent duty of subjection and loyalty; and so the Romish Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Penance not a proofe of charity, but of disloyall uncharitablenesse.</p>
                  <p>Hee goes on, and sayes that Rome, to make her child grow and stand out, <hi>feeds him from time to time with the precious Body of our blessed Lord in the Sacrament of the Altar.</hi> But where is Romish charitie in taking away the Bloud of our blessed Lord in the same Sacrament? If it be charity to give bread to a childe, is it not uncharitable to deny him drinke? but the children of Rome are left to cry like <hi>Sampson,</hi> though not heard as <hi>Sampson,</hi>

                     <hi>Thou hast given this great deliverance; and now shall I die for thirst?</hi> Christ hath given them a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and now Rome would kill them
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64025:28"/>
with thirst: Yet the same Lord in his Passion gives both meat and drink to their soules; and therefore hee not onely saith, that his flesh is meate indeed,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.55.</note> but that his bloud is drink indeed; and so is hee perfect nourishment, and a just refection, being both meat and drinke. Hee gives no lesse to the true Israel then to the typicall Israel (the type of the Church) in their Journey to Canaan;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.3, 4.</note> it is said of them, <hi>they did eat— spirituall meat, and drank—spirituall drink, for they drank of the Rock, and that Rock was Christ.</hi> But Romish charity, or uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse takes from the people that drink which Christ gave them, and as it were drives the true Israel from the waters that issue from this Rock, to refresh them in their walking through the wildernesse to this heavenly Canaan. Neither doth it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile any thing to say, that there is bloud in the body, for bloud out of the body is given us in this Sacrament, to quench the otherwise unquenchable and ever-thirsty guilt of sinne. Bloud that was shed for us is given to us in this Sacrament, as the very words of our Saviour in the Institution of it doe affirme;<note place="margin">Mat. 26.28.</note> and if Christ say hee gives us bloud that is shed, either they must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely deny the words which our Saviour
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64025:29"/>
spake, or else they must bee inforced to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that they doe uncharitably, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianly deny to us, that which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour gave us: and indeed, bloud that is shed and so powred out of the body, is the proper Sacrifice for sinne; for <hi>without the shedding of bloud there is no remission</hi>:<note place="margin">Heb. 9.22.</note> yea, our Saviour himselfe here saith of his bloud given in the Sacrament, that it is <hi>shed for the remission of sinnes.</hi> What therefore Christ the fountaine of charity hath shed for us out of his body, and so given us being shed for the remission of our sinnes, is it not extreme uncharitablenesse in Rome to take the same from us? for thereby shee takes from us an excellent means of the remission of our sinnes, and so the remission which should come to us by this meanes.</p>
                  <p>I could here multiply complaints of Romish uncharitablenesse in the manifold abuses of this Sacrament; and among them, of their Latine (that is, barbarous, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith) and whispering Consecration.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.11.</note> It is no Sacrament in the Romish beleefe, without the Priests intention; and the words that should give some ghesse of his intention are not heard and understood: How short then are t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But their doctrine of worshipping this Sacrament, yea, even when they know not whether it be a Sacrament, yea, carrying it about the streets in a solemne procession, on a set day, of purpose to bee worshipped, is a most killing uncharitablenesse; if I may say of the Sacrament by their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> of the Law by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.10.</note>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64025:31"/>
hee hath not the <hi>gift of continency</hi>; surely, shee is either uncharitable to Gods Church, in thus denying Orders where God hath given a gift that deserves them; or uncharitable to the Minister, in tying him to that continency whereof the gift is not given him. On the one side, if this man want Orders, a Congregation that wants him, may starve for lack of him; on the other side, if hee want marriage, his soule is tyed to the fire, and so is in danger to bee consumed with the flames of it; and either way is Rome still uncharitable, even in these things by which our Author would prove her charity.</p>

                  <p>As for this Authors praying for the dead <hi>to the worlds end,</hi> I wonder why he should speak of it, when he should not be ignorant, that if the living friends of the dead bee rich, there is a shorter way to free them out of Purgatory, then to pray to the worlds end. Besides, the Treasure of the Church growing by the growth of Papall charity, which delivers soules out of Purgatory; it is a wonder how that Papall charity doth not inlarge it selfe and the Churches Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to the utmost, in a whole deliverance of Soules out of Purgatory, and so leave no worke for the tedious charity of praying for them to the worlds end. But it seems, that either there is a want of charitie in the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64025:33"/>
Pope, who may deliver soules and will not (especially seeing <note n="a" place="margin">Dogma de purgatorio i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandum est ab Ecclesia, &amp;c. The doctrine of Purgatorie should be roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it makes men careless of purging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in this life, while they looke for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purging hereafter: <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus de purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio igne.</hi> To w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> add, that the purging fire hereafter may bee taken away for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and so they need not to be troubled with purging here or herafter.

                  <p>Our Author comes next to Monasteries and religious Houses, as proofes of Romish charity; where hee tels us, <hi>That being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated by the vows of Poverty, Chastity, and Obedience, their Church, with excessive cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, provides means for them, that they may bee enabled to live, and wholly to attend that sacred function, for the assistance of mankind in the way of Spirit, without scattering and dispersing their thoughts and cares upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for the necessaries of this life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Surely, if the Author can prove it to be <hi>charity</hi> which hath made this provision, all the world without more proof may beleeve it to bee <hi>excessive</hi>: For so excessive hath it beene in provision, that it hath fret deeply into Church and Common-wealth, having eaten up a great part of the maintenance of the Clergie in Appropriations, and a great part of Lay possessions in Bequeathes
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64025:34"/>
and Donations: yea, this excessive charity hath provided such meanes for these thus consecrated by the vowes of poverty, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and chastitie, that the excessive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision hath exceedingly devoured the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrating poverty, obedience, and chastity: for the spirit of error works in these mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Papacy, as it doth in the Head, bringing contraries out of contraries; from the prosession of poverty infinite riches; of chastity, most foul uncleannes; and of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, high disobedience to the Lord of the Universe: yea, rebellion against his Deputies and annointed Ones, the Kings of the earth.</p>

Secondly, It may bee no charity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64025:37"/>
it may bee an erroneous opinion of merit and satisfaction. And it is too well knowne, that the supposed expiation of crying sins hath laid the foundation of too many Monasteries. Thirdly, This Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion may be a fruit not of Romish Charity, but of Romish Policy: for Rome may cherish this provision, and enriching of Monasteries, that they may serve as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Garrisons for Rome against Princes: for by them they may diminish Kingdoms; and as much as they take from these, so much they adde to the Kingdome of Rome.</p>

they doe at this time serve our Author to make a shew that Rome is charitable. But take out of his Inventory those works that are done for satisfaction, to pay God the debt of sins, and so to make them Saviours; or, for merit and supererogation, to bring God in debt unto man, I doubt not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining works, like <hi>Gideons</hi> Army, will abate from thousands to hundreds.

And he that is ignorant of other Articles of the Creed, at least those which the Church doth solemnize (by Festivall dayes) &amp;c. Wherefore we desire all Curates, Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Parents, &amp; Confessors, (especially of the common people) and all Preachers of Gods Word, that they will not cease to inculcate this particular and explicite faith of these Articles, and of those other which are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Apostles Creed, which the holy Church of Rome doth use: For in the whole Church of Christ there is so great negligence about these, that every where you shall finde many that beleeve no more explicitely and in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64025:39"/>
particular of these, then an heathen Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, endued onely with the naturall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of one true God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, if the Reader withdraw this painted and deceitfull curtaine that seemes to represent a Heaven sprinkled with the Starres of seeming good works, and looke into the Hell of Romish uncharitablenesse, whereof a small, but true modell was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in the former Chapter: Or, if he see it not there; he will look into the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition House, and there behold it set forth to life, or rather to death, in severall torments; I doubt not but this pleasant image will soon be frighted out of his Imagination, by the terrible shape of Rome appearing all bloudy, and drunken with the bloud of the saints. And so the improbability of Romish uncharitablenesse to <hi>Protestants</hi> will vanish away like a fantasie, and a Poeticall fable. And indeed, if the Pharisee, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his tyth-paying and fasting, went away condemned, because proudly and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably hee despised and damned the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane, though hee did neither imprison no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64025:39"/>
worse then Publicans and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
                  <p>And thus, though the Cavaliers words may bee true, that <hi>At the first sight it is wholly improbable</hi> that Rome is uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; yet at the second sight it is more then probale, because it is proved.</p>
                  <p>This Chapter is almost ended; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of it, the Champion shoots an arrow like a Parthian flying, even then to hurt us when hee seemes to looke from hurting us. Hee would seeme to spare Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants in <hi>not recriminating</hi>; yet in naming this <hi>not recriminating</hi> hee did not spare us; but indeed hee did spare himselfe most, in not urging it more; for wee have such proofs of Protestant charity as may shame his Recrimination: For they are ready to bee brought forth against a Recriminator, and may binde his Recrimination as a crown to the head of the Protestants. And when a catalogue of them is brought forth, wee may boldly say (and that not without Recrimination to Romists) that none of them are the bastard fruits of Romish and carnall errors of merit and satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>But a patterne of these works of charity hath been already presented to the world; and yet not of all Protestants, but of this

Kingdome, and yet not of the whole Realme, but of some part for the whole. And that I send not away the Reader alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether empty, I will take a part of that part; and this part, I doubt, is not to bee matched by any proportionable part of the Romish Jurisdiction, in the same proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of time.<note place="margin">

And because it would require an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse labour to make collection of all such works,— I will give instance onely of three most famous places of this Land, which have most abounded in these fruits: namely, the City of London, and the two Universities.</hi> And then, having reckoned and summed up divers gifts, hee thus concludes his to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall; <hi>They want not much of a Million. But if all other gifts which came not to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge were added, the summe would farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a Million.

to goe to the Legate; accordingly he went to him to Venice, craved pardon, and promised future obedience: The Legate, for an example to others, commanded him after his returne to make an open recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which accordingly hee performed. But having done this against his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to maintaine himselfe and his charge, being returned to his house, hee could not rest an houre, no, not a minute, nor feele any ease of his continuall anguish.

Nothing came out of his mouth that was lightly or foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly spoken, or that might discover any raving in him. They asked him if hee thought his sinne to bee so foule, that it could not be pardoned through the bounty
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64025:46"/>
and infinite mercie of God. His answer was, That hee had sinned against the Holy Ghost, which was so great a sinne, as it is called a sinne unto death; whereof this wretched man discoursed amply, learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and too subtly against himselfe: Hee said, that hee did acknowledge the severity of Gods judgement, who had chosen him to make him a spectacle rather then any other, and to admonish all by one mans mouth, to abstaine from all impiety, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing that there was no reproach nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment which hee had not deserved by reason of his foule offence.</p>
                  <p>After hee had discoursed gravely of the Divine Justice, hee said, That they should not account strange this his speech, for that oftentimes God doth wrest out of the mouth of Reprobates most assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red testimonies of his Majestie, his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and his fearefull Vengeance; as wee see in <hi>Iudas,</hi> confessing his owne sin, and justifying his Master.</p>
                  <p>Many testimonies of Scripture being alledged to divert him from this fearfull apprehension, and being exhorted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into his heart a hope and a trust of salvation by <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; hee said, even in that whereby you doe exhort mee to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64025:46"/>
gather some hope, I see all meanes of health and pardon taken from mee. For, if the Testimonies of the holy Scripture have any authority (as they have) doe you thinke that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> said in vaine, that he which renounceth him before men, hee will renounce him before his heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Doe you not see that this concerns mee, and that it is as it were particularly verified in my person? What shall become of him whom the Sonne hath disavowed before his Father, when, as you say, wee must hope for no salvation but in <hi>Iesus Christ?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It cannot bee beleeved with what gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and vehemency his words were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered; neither was there ever man heard pleading better for himselfe, then <hi>Spira</hi> against himselfe: Hee said, That God did set the precious bloud of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and the dignity of his obedience, as an high and strong Rampart, that sinners, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, might not bee drowned with the overflowing of their sinnes, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: As for himselfe, seeing hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced our Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> hee had (as one should say) overthrown this strong Rampart with his owne hands, so as the deluge of the waters of vengeance had
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64025:47"/>
covered and swallowed up his soule. One of his most familiars said unto him; that his great torment proceeded from abundance of Melancholy which troubled his braine. <hi>Spira</hi> remembring that hee had many times refuted this opinion, said; You may thinke what you please, but God in truth hath troubled my spirit, seeing it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for me to have any hope of salvation.

                  <p>But the inference sowed hereunto is most miserable, <hi>That no one is to be blamed, if, conceiving his owne to bee the onely true Religion, hee declares the dangerous estate wherein hee takes any other man to bee, who communicates and agrees not with him: but rather that hee is obliged to let him know it.</hi> An inconsequent untruth, except conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent because deduced from untruths; and so it must either accuse the premisses, or it selfe.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64025:48"/>
what hee saith? or can it come into his judgement, that if two hold two contrary opinions, whereof one is true, and the other false, that he which holds the false is not to be blamed, if he declare to the other that the truth is falsehood, and thereupon tell him that hee is in danger to be damned by beleeving the truth, so to terrifie him out of the truth into his owne falsehood? If there be no fault in this, then how can any man blame a Turk for telling a Christian that hee cannot well bee saved, except he turne Turke? Surely whatsoever this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier may thinke of this kinde of doctrine, I beleeve that if the same were maintained in false titles to a Crown, the Law would call it treason: For if a Subject conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his false title to bee good, should tell his Prince that he were an Usurper, were not such a Subject to be blamed? Surely, whatsoever a Romist may thinke of such a one, I doubt not but the Law would thinke him worthy of a capitall Sentence. And it is likely the abbetters of him by such doctrines, would not bee freed from blame and danger. But if this Champion had sought advice, his own Doctors could have holpen him out of his error: For

                  </p>
                  <p>But thus this errour of the Cavalier be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken from him, by which he thinkes he may follow his erroneous conscience, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing damnation to those that are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the very sinnew and bond of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is cut assunder; and all his ensuing labour lost, by which hee strives to prove that Protestants and Romists are divided, and cannot both bee saved: For though they be thus divided, a Papist cannot cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably tell a saved Protestant that hee is damned because hee doth erroneously beleeve it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:64025:50"/>Yet will he needs goe on to his proofes of unity, though altogether unprofitable, and unable to excuse Rome from the charge of being uncharitable to Protestants: yea, it rather aggravates his charge, and makes her more uncharitable, in not hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unity with so good Christians as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants. Yet hee is resolved to goe on, and to utter that which hee gathered upon this head, or rather upon this word of <hi>Unity:</hi> for the places which hee brings forth, it seemes, please him well, if they doe speake of the word <hi>Unity,</hi> or something neere to the sound of it, though the meaning bee nothing of that unity which it concernes him (even in this his walke of impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and wandering) to pursue and prove. For sometimes his Allegations seeme to prove that there should bee in the Church one <hi>Head,</hi> and sometimes one <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Affection,</hi> somtimes one <hi>Spirit.</hi> But if the Author would bee pleased to remember his owne businesse, he might consider that his worke is to prove that there is in the Church such an entire unity in all points of Doctrine, that there can be no difference or dissent in any one point, though never so small, but that by this difference the unity of the Church and salvation is lost.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64025:50"/>
For wee deny not, but there must bee one heart, and one affection, and one spirit in the Church, and all this in and under the unity of one <hi>Head, Christ Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, we acknowledge that God did found but one Church, and one Religion; and that without these two there is no sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: But except the Author prove that the unity of this one Church, and of this one Religion consists in this, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of all must be one and the same in all points, under paine of Damnation; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words of unity are meere words, and not pertinent to this end, neither will they make up his taske. For when hee comes to his next point, that this unity is broken betweene Protestants and Romists, wee will presently deny that wee have any way broken that unity of faith, which holds us in unity with the Church; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wee are still in the state of salvation, and so all his errand is lost. Therefore the most places being impertinent, as proving that which wee deny not, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed make nothing for him being granted, hee hath two or three, which by screwes are wrested toward this full unity in points of beliefe, though they reach not home to it.

                  </argument>
                  <p>A First of his unproving and impertinent places, is that of <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. where (as our Author saith) his whole <hi>people should be subject to the determination of the High Priest for the time being; and this upon no lesse then paine of death: In which sentence, there was to be no appeale.</hi> And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>The great authority and power, which was cast upon the individuall Person of one Iudge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But first if wee will reade the words of God himselfe, we may see that He speaks of more then one individuall Person:<note place="margin">Ver 9. and Ver. 12.</note> For Hee speakes of the Levites, the Priests, and the Judge. And if a man will not hearken to the Priest, or to the Judge, that then he should dye.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Verse 11.</note>But secondly, it must bee remembred, that that which the Priest or the Judge must pronounce, must bee the sentence of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64025:51"/>
the Law: For even the Prophet must dye, which shall presume to speak a word which God hath not commanded.<note place="margin">Deut. 18.20.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet thirdly, wee well know, That this speaking according to the Law, was often neglected by the Priests; and therefore they brake the Covenant of <hi>Levi,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mal. 2.8.</note> and led the people into errors, as hereafter more fully may bee proved. And I hope this Champion will not say, that the people lost their salvation if they did not hold uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the errors of the Priests.</p>
                  <p>And whereas hee addeth, <hi>That there could bee no Religion or Church that did not agree with this</hi>; Wee take not this to bee the present Question: but, Whether all beleevers, Proselites or Jewes, did in every point, by the Priests decision, hold an unity of beliefe, and did in no point differ: Now this, I thinke, will never bee both affirmed and proved. For not only humane Testimonies, but the Scriptures themselves doe shew us,<note place="margin">Mat. 22. Act. 23.6, 8.</note> that there were divers sects and opinions among them, and yet they joyned together in externall unity, not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding themselves into two Religions and Churches.</p>
                  <p>But to put this Author out of trouble, in regard of his individuall High Priest,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64025:52"/>
the mention of whom seemes to looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>squint on the Pope, as his shadow; let him remember, That the High Priest was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a shadow of Christ,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.12. &amp; 8.5.</note> and when Christ came, this shadow was abolished; and when this shadow dyed, it left not the Pope either heire or executor; and so hee can be at best but the counterfeit of an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished shadow.</p>
                  <p>And thus all this Authors labours for the High Priest are left to the Pope. But see how yet it fals out more unhappily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; for after hee had made mention of the <hi>individuall High Priest,</hi> his next proofe ariseth from <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> punished for Schisme (and not for Heresie, and difference in Doctrine) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst two individuall persons, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi>

                  <p>And how should it bee otherwise, but that it should produce such hellish effects, when it teacheth Christians, for every fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the beleefe of any one point of Christian (that is in their language, Romish or Popish) doctrine, to accompt other Christians in the state of damnation, and to hate them more then heathens; So that if the Pope say, that the <hi>Worship of Images, Prayer in an unknown tongue without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, Rats eating the body of Christ,</hi> and such other errors, bee points of Christian doctrine; the man that beleeves them not, though hee beleeve in Christ, yea, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points but one of these, hath forfeited his salvation, and is fallen into the odious state of a combustible heretick, and of a damnable person.

                     </note> Commands by inordinate thoughts, or small deviations, the Romists can make not mortall and damnable, but veniall. How comes it then that they will allow us no veniall errors and failings in small points of doctrine, but any one point of Christian (that is, in his sense, Popish) doctrine not beleeved, is damnably mortall? Is there not in this a great piece of Popish leaven, even of the wicked mystery, that sinnes against Gods Commands of morall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience may bee veniall; but against the Popes Commands, in the least point of doctrine, are altogether mortall? And doth not the reason appeare to bee this, That in the breach of a morall Law (as that of coveting our neighbours goods) God is offended, but the Pope is not hurt: but by not beleeving any one point which the Pope delivers for Christian doctrine, his <hi>In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that all the world were burned or damned, or set at division, then that the Papacie should fall. But thus doth the Pope set himselfe above God, by valuing offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces against himselfe of a more damnable nature then sinnes against God: But well it is withall, that they shew hereby, that God is yet farre more mercifull then the Pope; for God, they say, makes little sins veniall, whereas the Pope makes little er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors against Popish doctrine deadly and damnable. But the truth is, to those that are in Christ Jesus, God doth make veniall both errors in lesser points of <hi>faith,</hi> which grow by ignorance, blindenesse, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of faith, aswell as lesser errors in <hi>life,</hi> by infirmity and weaknesse. Christs bloud is a propitiation for all our sinnes, aswell sins in the understanding, as in the will. And to those who attaine to that measure of faith which knits them to Christ Jesus, Christ Jesus by his bloud will make other ignorances and unbeliefes in those points of doctrine, to which they cannot attain, veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and pardonable: and surely, our Author is hardly driven to get a shew of proof from Scripture, of this doctrine of division and damnation: The place of <hi>Matthew</hi> could not serve; for there was only a command to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64025:55"/>
the Apostles, to teach all Nations to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all Christs Commands. But we have seene above out of Romists, that the breach of some of Christs Commands is not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, but veniall; wherefore another place must be forced to confesse it. Accordingly that of Saint <hi>Marke</hi> is set on the rack; but this place speakes not of not beleeving all and every point of doctrine delivered and decreed by the Pope and his adherents; but the maine scope of the place is a casting of damnation upon men for the great point of not beleeving in Christ: for in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel this is an usuall sense of the word <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving,</hi> especially when it stands upon life and death. And, it seemes, this Author can bring no plain place of Scripture to prove,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.36. &amp; 6.29, 35, 40. Joh. 17.3. Act. 10.43.

But thus still behold a going on of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of iniquity. Unity unto salvation is urged, thereby to make division unto dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; Words are taken from Christ the Head, therewith to tear his body into pieces: But hereof wee may make this use, That when a Papist preacheth to Protestants of unity, then let them expect &amp; beware of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>I Might here bee at rest for this Chapter, but that this Champion, besides two impertinent places (one of which speaks of unity of Affection, and a second of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Spirit in the bond of Peace,) brings forth a third, even the often answered place of S. <hi>Matth.</hi> which hee perverts to divers ill uses,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.</note> whereof this imaginary Popish unity is one; For, hee assayes hereby to prove the Church to be the judge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, to prove her visibility, to prove her inerrability and thereupon he thinkes presently should follow an unity.</p>
                  <p>First, to remove the stumbling blocke of visibility, for which the Author went out of his owne way, that hee might lay
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64025:56"/>
it in ours: I answer, That this Text may teach what is to bee done where there is a Church, as commonly there is where there is a Brother and a Brother, but it doth not teach that there shall be a Church visible in all places, and at all times.</p>
                  <p>But notwithstanding this text, a Church may be visible sometimes in one Nation, and somtimes in another, according to the fruitfulnesse of the people, and the just pleasure of God, who sometimes removeth the Gospell and the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke from a Nation that bears no fruit, to another that shall beare it: And so wee see that there are no Churches now to be seene where there have beene famous Churches in times past. Accordingly the Church may be visible in Greece, in AEthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia, in Armenia, yea in England, though it be not visible in Rome; and so the visibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity thereof may bee true, though there were no Rome, and no Pope. So that neither this, nor any other text, though they say the Church is visible,<note place="margin">Potest in aliis Episcopis et quidem firmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pietas reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> yet they doe not say that Rome or the Pope shall still be the visible Church: but contrarily the Scripture giveth us good hope that Rome shall be invisible; yea, it gives us great proofe that shee is now the Scarlet
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64025:56"/>
Lady that persecutes the Church, and is now the Mother of abominations.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, no Scripture doth say that in time of persecution or prevailing Heresie, the Church shall there bee visible where this persecution drives it into corners, that it may escape the fury of it by a kinde of invisibility: And when the Arian heresie had covered the face of the Earth, and the Roman Bishops or Pope had subscribed to it, this Scripture doth not say that then the Pope or his Adhaerents were the visible Church; nor that they shall be so when the Pope turnes Antichrist.</p>
                  <p>For the second point, that the Church is the judge of controversies, I could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance say, that there appeares very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reasons why this text doth not speak of the Churches authority in judging of controversies of faith, but of her authority in admonishing her children; and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring reconciliation &amp; satisfaction from one brother to another, in evident wrongs, even faults without controversie: For the text saith, <hi>If thy Brother sinne, or trespasse against thee, go and tell him his fault</hi>; So that there is a sinne and a fault without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, and such a fault, that the offended Brother himselfe may first judge and tell
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64025:57"/>
him of it that hath offended: And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this beginning may bee the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is, that the two witnesses, and so the Church may be not to judge of the fault, whether it bee a fault or no; but to witnesse and condemne the contumacy of the party in denying satisfaction, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation after an evident fault. And when the offending Brother will not heare the Church thus admonishing, perswading, and injoyning him satisfaction and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, then hee is to bee cast out of that Church, which hee hath thus contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously disobeyed: Agreeable to that of S. <hi>Paul, If any man obey not our word, have no company with him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Thes. 3.14.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But be it that the Church be the judge of controversies, this also may bee true, in Russian, AEthiopian, and Protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; And so the Church may judge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies though there were no Pope, and where the Pope hath no power: Besides, the Romists themselves differ concerning the meaning of the word <hi>Church:</hi> So that while wee labour in this text to finde a Judge of controversies for reconciling them; wee are left unreconciled, by being at controversie about the Judge of controversies mentioned in this text:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64025:57"/>
For, <note n="a" place="margin">Hieronymus &amp; glossa no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ine Ecclesiae mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligunt. vid. <hi>Lorcam. in</hi> 22. <hi>Disp.</hi> 46. n. 22.</note> some say, the multitude is this Church; and they have for them the most usuall acception of the word Church in that sense through the new Testament: And the current of the place, seems to him that way, according to proportion: For, first the offended Brother, alone was to admonish his Brother; and next with one or two witnesses; and lastly, hee was to be admonished by the congregation: So it is a doctrine of degrees, from one to two, and from two, to many; And if it be thus, then the Popes power of judging contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies hath no footing here. But thirdly, (and so withall to include and resolve the question of inerrability,) If the Prelates be meant by the Church, (which <hi>Lorca</hi> saith is the most usuall opinion amongst Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists) yet doth not this place say, that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Prelates shall have still an unerring judgement in controversies; especially any single Prelate, as the Pope. Againe, it can hardly bee thought, that when a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath offended a Brother, this text would have him presently to call a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell or Synod of Prelates, and so complaine to many Prelates at once, and so to the Church. But if it be his owne Prelate of whom hee must aske, doth this place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64025:58"/>
that no Prelate shall erre in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of controversies? it is well known that in the Jewish Church, (which was unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably the true Church before Christ,) Priests did not judge controversies without errour: Yea, God Himselfe complaineth of the contrary,<note place="margin">Mal. 2.7, 8.</note> when he saith, <hi>The Priests lippes should preserve knowledge, and they should seeke the Law out of his mouth; for hee is the messenger of the Lord of Hostes: But Ye are departed out of the way, Yee have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed many to stumble at the law; Yee have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Covenant of Levi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Accordingly wee finde in the Prophets a continuall out-cry upon the Priests for mis-leading the people; yea, the Priests are chiefe in false judgements,<note place="margin">Jer. 26.8.</note> and injuries of the true Prophets. Accordingly, <hi>Pashar</hi> both prophecied lies,<note place="margin">Jer. 20.1.2, 6.</note> and did cast <hi>Ieremy</hi> into the stockes for prophecying truth: yea,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.6, 5.</note> the High Priest himselfe falsly judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Christ to have spoken blasphemy; And S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells the High Priest and his associates, that they were the builders that despised the Corner stone, and crucified Christ. And thus wee see it plaine in the Scripture, that the Priests and Prelates did erre, even when our Author ascribes that inerrability to them by which hee would
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64025:58"/>
prove the inerrability of Rome; yea, we see farther that this same opinion of inerrabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was the cause of their Error, as it is even now in the Romish Papacy. Their presumption of not erring, was so far from being an Argument of inerrability, that it made them to runne into error, and to lead the people after them, (blinde after blinde) into the ditch of error. This wee see in their owne words;<note place="margin">Jer. 8.18.</note> for thus they say, <hi>Come let us devise devices against Ieremiah, for the law shall not perish from the Priest</hi>; yea, this presumption of not erring was thought a very sure ground of erroneous judgement in this strange controversie, whether Christ be Christ: <hi>Do any of the Rulers, or of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises beleeve on him?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 18.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>8.</note> as if they should say, The Rulers, and the Pharises, the Priests and the Doctors cannot erre; and they have judged this controversie, that Christ is not Christ: And therefore without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie men ought not to beleeve in Christ.</p>
                  <p>But is there then no use of judgement of the Church? yes surely very great; The Church, yea, the Priests or Ministers of the Church, according to the covenant of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,</hi> ought to speake the Law of God to the people, and judge controversies thereby.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64025:59"/>
And then as the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> hearing Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> wee must not thinke that wee doe so much heare their word, as the very word of God: And this word being followed, will make a true and inerrable judgement, and truth ever being one, it will ever cause unity.</p>
                  <p>And so are we come to the fourth point, and indeede the point most proper to the present question, though the place bee not proper to prove the Popish unity, which this Author would picke out of it.</p>
                  <p>For whereas to raise this unity out of this text, he would thereby enforce an absolute yeelding to the judgement of the Church, without appealing to Scripture, hee must remember that in this judgement of the Church, the Scripture is implyed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: And the including of it is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly right meanes of causing true christian unity; For the case wherein a man, not hearing the Church, is to be accounted an Heathen, is sinning against a brother: Now sinning against a brother is plainly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by Scripture, being contrary to that Royall law of love, which commands a man to love his Neighbour as himselfe: So that not to heare the Church in a case of sinning against a brother, is not to heare
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64025:59"/>
the Church advising or judging according to Scripture: And so upon the matter it is a not hearing of the Scripture speaking by the mouth of the Church; and then see how unhandsomely ariseth the Inference of this Author; That he that will not hear the Church judging according to Scripture, may not appeale to the Scripture, that is, he may not appeal from Scripture to Scripture.</p>
                  <p>But much more right and reasonable is this consequence,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.7. Obey your Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, &amp;c.

And indeed, I can scarce thinke, that if this man who is questioned and accused by his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were guiltlesse, and so by the Word of God should bee acquitted, that this Author himselfe would have him taken for a heathen, being judged by the Church, against Gods Law and Scripture, to bee an offender. But in this case the <note n="a" place="margin">Hac caeci ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusione Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saei, sibi ipsis plus damni in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulerunt quàm caeco; per hoc enim seipsos separârunt &amp; à Christo, &amp; ab omnibus fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus, &amp;c. <hi>Ferus in Ioh.</hi> 9.</note> curse lights on the false Judges that call good evill, as it doth on those that falsely damne Protestants.</p>
                  <p>And thus also the Cavaliers imaginary contrariety of two Churches judging one against another, is prevented and removed through this stedfast rule of unity: for
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64025:60"/>
two Churches judging one case, according to one right rule, (and such is the Scripture) cannot pronounce of one case more then one judgement. And so the man whom hee would affright is put out of feare, for being tossed betweene two damnations by two contrary judgements; for there is but one right judgement according to the Scripture, and so but one damnation to bee feared, which any man may avoyd by hearing the Church judging uniformely according to the Scripture: for if the Church make a man a heathen against the Word of God, we have seen that <note n="b" place="margin">Ejectus qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem est à Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plo, sed à Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli Domino inventus est. <hi>Ferus ibid.</hi>

And no wonder; for <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> Christs Disciple, takes it for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed ground; neither is it denyed by the Pharisees, That the Law is Judge, and from the Law all Judgement should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed:<note place="margin">Joh. 7.51.</note>

the Church, may be compatible with unity and salvation. Secondly, if it were true which hee saith, that unity were broken by the obstinate beliefe of any one doctrine joyned with disobedience to the Church, how doth not this make against Rome, which maintaineth her universall Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, and other errors directly against the Canons of the Church? Thirdly, wee deny Rome to bee that Church which the Fathers speake of. Fourthly, this Authors allegations make directly against his owne end, and overthrow the authority of Rome, which hee goes about to establish: For, let him speake upon his conscience and reputation; Were all those heresies, mentioned by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Augustine,</hi> adjudged and condemned for heresies by the Church of Rome? If not, then it seemes, there may bee hereticks without any judgement of the Church of Rome; and there may be hereticks that hold some errors not adjudged heresies by the Church of Rome: But if so, then what is become of this Authors heresie described to be the obstinate beliefe of any one doctrine in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the Church, the Church, in the Authors sense, being no other then the Church of Rome?</p>

                  <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>sacrifices for the dead?</hi> Had the Church of Rome adjudged these at this time to bee points of faith? Hee cannot say it. How plaine deceit then is this, to seeme to prove these to bee heresies, because held in a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the Church, when the Church in his Romish sense had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the doctrines to bee beleeved which are contrary to these supposed heresies? Let us now come to his particular citations, and see yet more particularly, how they make not against us, but mostly against himselfe: Hee begins with Saint <hi>Irenaeus, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>The Church having received this word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and this faith as was shewed before, and having spread the same over the whole world, doth diligently preserve it, as inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting one house; and doth likewise beleeve those things which are taught thereby, as having one soule and one heart; and in the same conformity shee preaches, and teaches, and delivers it, as possessing but one mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th. For though there bee in the world different
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64025:63"/>
expressions and tongues, yet the vertue and power of Tradition is but one and the same: And neither those Churches which are found in Germany, nor those others in Spaine, nor those in France, nor they which are in the Easterne parts, nor they which are in Egypt, nor they which are in Lybia, nor they which are in the middle parts of the world, doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve or make tradition of doctrine any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in one place then they doe in another: but as that creature of God, the Sunne, is one and the same in the whole world, so is the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching if the Truth. And those Prelates of Churches who have most power and grace of speech, will deliver no other things but these; for no man is above his Master, neither will such an one as hath meaner Talents in speech make this doctrine and Tradition lesse; but (since Faith is but one and the same) neither doth hee inlarge it, who is able to speak much of it; nor that other diminish it, who speakes lesse.</hi> I answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this place is produced improperly, in regard of the Point; deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, in regard of the Reader: For <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> in the second Chapter next preceding, had set downe a forme of Faith, and a summe of chiefe Articles agreeable to our Creed. And then in the third, whence this allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is taken, hee saith, that the Church,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64025:63"/>
having received this faith, doth uniformly preach it, and with one Mouth through all nations; neither doth the more learned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease it, nor the lesse learned diminish it: Now this being spoken of the principall points of faith, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oth rather prove our unity in fundamentalls, but not prove our Champions entire unity in inferiour points; therefore it comes not home to the Authors marke, but indeed he goes about to deceive the Reader, when he brings it in as a proofe of that which it proves not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this place makes mightily against the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and that Confederacy; for in the faith which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> sets downe in the foregoing chapter, there is not one Article concerning the Popes Supremacy, nor worshiping Images, nor of praying in an unknowne tongue, &amp;c. These therefore being now decreed by the Pope, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements of faith; wherefore the Popes that thus inlarge the faith, are by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> censured, <hi>not to bee these Prelates of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, who have most power and grace of speech; yea, not so good as the others of lesse grace</hi>: but withall hee censureth them, that they are above their <hi>master</hi>; and their master being Christ, it fits right with the saying of <hi>Paul; That hee sits as God, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64025:64"/>
exalts himselfe above all that is called God.</hi>

               <p>The next place doth much accuse the Cavaliers need of Allegations, and yet withall excuseth him not from an indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to deceive his Reader: The place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by him is this: <hi>Quod apud multos &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>The question in hand was concerning the rule of Faith or the Creed; as the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may see by comparing the thirteenth chapter, where the Creed is rehearsed, and the end of the one and twentieth, where he saith, <hi>That it remained for him to shew, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the doctrine in the former rule</hi> came from the delivery (or, if you will, Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so it bee not a Tradition beyond that which is written, for there is no such in this rule of faith) of the Apostles: And

that all Churches agreed in sin, all points beyond and besides the Creed, that it speaks onely of their agreement in the rules of Faith, and doctrine of the Creed: And he saith, that such an agreement comes not by errour which commonly is divers; but by one uniforme delivery and doctrine of the Apostles: So the Cavalier is still to seeke for a necessary unity in every smal doctrine, and in points without the Creed.</p>

               <p>The other inference from <hi>Irenaeus, That a Christian must not beleeve by a different motive from that by which it is beleeved of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christians,</hi> is a point that is mortall to Popery: For they, making the Popes word or authority the motive of their faith, herein doe differ from the motive of faith received by the Christians in Grecia, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia, and AEthiopia; and so transgresse most dangerously, and, I doubt, fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64025:71"/>
against this rule produced and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Author, as from <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> though there I cannot finde it. And now after a just examination of these Allegations, I cannot but inferre, that, There appeares a manifest losse of the cause, when the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces produced for proofe of it prove it not.</p>
               <p>So that the Authors conclusion being no way made good by his allegations, it is left still solitary, forsaken, and unproved: And whereas hee saith, <hi>For the present it may suffice to have proved the necessity of perfect unity in the Church; wee must needs reply,</hi> That hee hath most imperfectly proved the necessity of so perfect an unity. And for the other piece of his conclusion; <hi>That indeed no reason can bee given why, if there bee allowed any more true Churches then one, there should not be admitted aswell two thousand as two:</hi> I acknowledge with him, that not onely no reason can bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of this, but also of the Cavaliers speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of no reason in this point: For it is not denyed by us that there is but <hi>one true Church</hi>; and if you make two, you may make two thousand.</p>
               <p>But wee deny that every little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence makes two Churches of one; and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64025:71"/>
this neither the Author hath proved, neither doe his citations suffice to prove; but let him here looke to himselfe, and his fellow Romists, whether they bee not in danger of making two thousand Churches, who have made a second Church, called the <hi>Church vertuall,</hi> the Pope, yea a third Church, the Pope and his mysticall body (for he is a mystery also, but of iniquity) which two Churches many eminent members of the Catholicke Church deny to bee that one true Church whereof they are members. In the meane time Romish uncharitablenesse in damning Protestants remaines still as a proved truth, seeing this Authors proofes for an imaginary perfect unity, by which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke to prove it an untruth, doe not prove this unity; and no such unity proved, no untruth proved: so they are still uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, and Protestants doe yet speake truth when they affirme their uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse.</p>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64025:72"/>
So, upon the matter, hee proves that out of the Protestants Church there is no salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But then what will become of the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which will not be of one Church with saved Protestants? And indeed except it were to speake for us, and against the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, what need is there of these proofes for a point not denied by us? For, wee give him this at first onely for the asking, That out of the onely true Church (the body of Christ) there is no salvation.</p>
                  <p>Yet will hee needs goe on to fight for a point which we confesse; yea, withall to fight for us against himselfe: And indeede even where he would seem to fight against us, hee doth it so loosely and far-off, that it is hard to discerne how his blowes doe concerne us.</p>
                  <p>Let us see his first onset, <hi>Since the Church of Christ our Lord is so truely one, and but onely one, it followes easily enough that no salvation can be had out of this Church, and that every Heresie or Schisme is sufficient to deprive any soule thereof; but yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to the end that men may bee wholly left without excuse, or rather that they may bee the better warned to take heed in time of those miseries, which otherwise they are to feele for all eternity: I will strengthen also this truth
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64025:73"/>
by the Authoritie of some few Scriptures and Fathers of the Primitive Church; for so by degrees it will easily and of it selfe appeare, that wee Catholicks are not faulty in that wherewith wee are so much charged.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it is hard to finde out this Authors or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and way; his end or drift we know, but the way by which he would come to it is hard to bee seene: I am sure hitherto hee hath not made good his first steps in it, and yet hee would seeme to proceed, as if hee came neerer to his end by degrees, when yet hee is still on his threshold: for first, though the Church of Christ be but one, and it doe follow that no salvation can be had out of that one Church, this (as hath beene noted) is no degree to the cleering of Papists uncharitablenesse in damning Protestants. Againe, it doth not follow, that every Heresie in the Popish sense, is sufficient to deprive any soule thereof; and so Protestants may still suffer a false charge of Heresie to bee laid on them by Romists, and yet bee sure enough of salvation. And thus not any degree is yet made good toward the freeing of this charge of uncharitablenesse, justly laid on the Romists; So that the matter stands still, though the Author moving
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64025:73"/>
his pen thinkes that the matter moves with it.</p>
                  <p>And for the Allegations that follow, which seeme to labour for these two points, <hi>That out of the Church is no salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, And that Heresie and Schisme doe put men out of the Church</hi>; these being proved no way hurt us or help the Romists, but helpe us and hurt the Romists; among whom wee have found most fearfull and bloudy Schisme, and wee may discover damnable Heresies: but they can never prove that Protestant doctrine maintaines either He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie or Schisme; but by that which they call Heresie, as relying wholy on Christs merits and not our owne for redemption, and worshiping God in spirit and truth, and not worshiping Images, &amp;c. wee serve the God of our Fathers.</p>

For, whereas <hi>Tertullian</hi> here saith, <hi>Fides in regula posita est: The faith is set downe in that rule,</hi> which before hee rehearsed; the Romists faith is not in that rule: For,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64025:76"/>
there was not one word of the Pope, nor of Christs being under the forme of bread by Transubstantiation; but, <hi>In Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los ereptum, sedere ad dextram Patris; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisse vicariam vim Spiritus Sancti qui cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes agat: Being taken away into heaven, hee doth sit at the right hand of his Father; and hee hath sent his Vicar</hi> (not the Pope, but) <hi>the power of the Holy Ghost, which should leade those that beleeve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in the 33. Chapter, making an Inventory of certaine Heresies, amongst others, hee names this, which, I doubt, is some kinne to the Papacie; Timotheum <hi>instruens, Nuptiarum quoque interdictores suggillat:</hi> He saith, <hi>That S.</hi> Paul <hi>instructing</hi> Timothy, <hi>doth condemne the forbidders of marriage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> is next brought in to say that thousand times produced sentence, that, <hi>Out of the Church there is no salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Hereunto is added, that <hi>There is no reward of any suffering whatsoever; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is hee a Christian that abides not in Christs doctrine and faith.</hi> But in all this hee doth not say that the Protestants are not in the Church, neither that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine not in Christs Doctrine and Faith; but it may rather concerne the Papacie,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64025:76"/>
which hath made a new Church against the Church of Christ; and a new Faith, by adding twelve Articles more to the former. It doth also plainely shew them that they, suffering for Treasons of Powder, Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. cannot expect thereby a Crown of faith, but a punishment of perfidiousnesse.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> is next alledged, and hee useth the like or very same words, and so the like or the same answer might serve. But indeed <hi>Augustine</hi> so punctually speaketh against the Papacie, and pierceth it through, that no one place can well bee lost, because every one is serviceable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Papacy for which it is produced; These are the words first alledged out of Saint <hi>Augustine, Would you have men so blinde and deafe as not to heare or reade the Gospel, where they may know that faith our Lord left to his Apostles concerning his Church?</hi> Now, what the Papists will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this I know not, who make many men so blinde, as not to reade at all, and so deafe, as not to heare the Gospel but in Latin: And secondly, hee sayes that Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> puts himselfe to shew, <hi>That this is that Church of Christ which is spread over the whole world.</hi> Who can more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, that the Roman Papacie is not this
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64025:77"/>
Church, whose universall power and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is denyed by other Patriarchs, and is unbeleeved, yea, and unknowne in a great part of the Christian world?</p>
                  <p>The last place out of <hi>Augustine,</hi> secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the consent of Cardinall <hi>Perron,</hi> hee turnes to this use, <hi>That Catholick is not onely a name of beleefe and faith, but of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and communion; which whosoever should want, should also want salvation.</hi> But withall I must say, that long before I knew this opinion of <hi>Perron,</hi> I beleeved this truth; and I also beleeved that it did make mightily for us, and mightily against the Papacie. That it makes mightily for us, I have shewed in the first Chapter, who doe imbrace a catholick love with the whole body of Christ, which is his Church. That it makes mightily against the Papacie, I have shewed in the second Chapter, because it excludes from love and communion many eminent parts of the Church; even so much of the Church and body of Christ as extends beyond subjection and obedience to the Papacie: And indeed, this Champions allegations doe so fight for us against his owne Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that a suspicious Reader may doubt hee hath been hired by us.</p>

                  <p>Indeed, the Papacie, (even the Man of

sinne, the Head and his members in the Mystery of iniquity) now call themselves the Church of Rome: But Rome at the best had never Religion and the Church faster tyed to it, then Jerusalem; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may take leave to say of Rome as it was said of Jerusalem,<note place="margin">Esay 1.21.</note>

                     <p>The Cavaliers indeavour to prove that the Protestants and Papists cannot bee both members of this one Church, doth not absolve the Papists from uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ANd having thus concluded the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, hee thus gives a reason of his conclusion; <hi>Nor will I so much distrust either the attention or the discretion of my Reader, as to thinke that I need presse this point any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> A saying good at last, but much better at first; for if there had bin at first no distrust of the Readers discretion, there had beene no neede of any one of those Allegations, which have beene brought forth to prove a point not denyed: <hi>There is but one Church, out of which there is no salvation.</hi> But let us see what immediatly followes: <hi>So that now in the next place it will onely remaine to be considered and resolved, whether or no both the Catholickes and the Protestants can bee truly said to bee parts and members of this one and selfe same Church. For if they cannot, the case in question is already judged, and there will be no colour of Reason, why either
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64025:79"/>
of us should hereafter be charged with want of charity, for affirming that the other is not saveable without repentance of his Religion.</hi> Behold a knot of strange things knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by an invisible cohaerence, or a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble incohaerence. For first, whereas he saith, that in the next place <hi>It will onely remaine to be considered, whether the Protestants and Romists may bee truly said to be parts and members of this one Church:</hi> For my part I am utterly of opinion that this doth neither in the next place, nor at all remaine to bee considered toward the Authors end, which is the saving of Rome from uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in damning Protestants.</p>
                  <p>For Protestants may bee members of the true Church wherein is salvation, and Romists may be out of it; and yet Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists may bee uncharitable for damning Protestants, who are in the Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is salvation. But since hee is out of the way, I will thus shew it to him: His way of cleering Rome from this charge of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitablenesse, hath been hitherto by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it an untruth; and his way of proving it an untruth, by proving that Protestants are truely in the way of damnation: And to prove this againe, hee hath shewed, that there is but one Church in which is salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64025:80"/>
and from which men are excluded by Heresie and Schisme.</p>
                  <p>Now as I thinke, in the next place, to goe on in his way hee should prove that Protestants are guilty of such Heresie and Schisme as separate them from this one Church, and so from salvation: For then had hee slaine them out-right with a true damnation, and had saved his mother Rome from S. <hi>Iohns</hi> truly mortall uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritablenesse. But it seemes wee are cleere in these points, and therefore the Author would not goe against his conscience in a false accusation; wherefore let his silence bee taken for a consent and confession: But then it seemes the question is at an end, we are absolved, and Rome is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
                  <p>And indeed so it should bee; but hee is resolved still to say on, though not to the purpose; For to what purpose is this, <hi>that the Protestants and Romists are not one Church,</hi> toward proving Protestants to bee in the state of Damnation, whereby onely Rome can save her selfe from uncharitablenesse in damning us? Surely, this is so far from proving Protestants to bee in the state of damnation, that it is more likely to prove them to bee in the state of salvation, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64025:80"/>
Romists in damnation. For Protestants being parts of the true Church, by true faith and love are sure to be saved; and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists not being of this Church wherein Protestants are saved, are by his owne Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations in danger to be damned: So Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists are both brought into the danger of damnation, and the charge of uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse layd on the Romists may still stand true, because they falsely damne Protestants for being in the state of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>A second strange position is this, <hi>That if the Protestants and Romists, bee not of one Church, then there will be no colour of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why either party should be charged with want of charity for affirming that the other is not saveable without repentance of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi> For there is neither reason, verity, nor charity in affirming that Protestants who may be saved by their Religion, are not saveable without repentance of the same Religion. But this vanity if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, hath beene blowne away in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to his third Chapter. But if this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable position bee taken out of the way, which is made the ground and reason of the future discourse (concerning Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants and Romists being of two Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64025:81"/>
then the discourse built on it falls to the ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for indeede to what purpose is it to prove that Protestants and Romists are of two Religions, except the Author may hereby save Romists from uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in falsly condemning the Protestants for being in a good religion, different from their owne bad Popery? For that is his errand, and this errand hath hee lost in losing this last monstrous po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, which hee made for a bridge to his errands end.</p>
                  <p>So, for ought I see, this Cavalier is at the end of his journey in the midst of his way; and the rest of his walke is a wandring, and this voyage a sayling up and downe from his harbour.</p>

                     <p>First, divers untruths of the Cavaliers are discovered touching the difference of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Sacraments and Discipline, which are betweene Protestants and Papists.

the businesse seems to be ended, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as of the tumult at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> so of the throng of words that follow, it may be said,<note place="margin">Acts 19.40.</note> 
                     <hi>There can be no cause given of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:</hi> For though the Author have his purpose, and Protestants and Romists bee not of one religion, yet Rome may bee uncharitable for condemning Protestants who are of the true religion: Yea, Rome, by the Author being cast out from the Church, if Protestants bee in it, may be in the state of damnation, for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors owne title and ground, even because there is but one Church and salvation, whereof Protestants and Romists cannot be both partakers. And now what would this Cavalier have his Antagonist and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer to doe? would hee have him to prove for Romists, that they are in the Church, when himselfe proves that they are not? surely I confesse, that though there bee some untruthes by which hee would prove that Romists are not of the same sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Church which Protestants, yet there are some truthes that I cannot answer, but must confesse that they prevaile against me in putting Romists out of this Church.</p>
                  <p>I will first take notice of his untruths, <hi>To make a Religion so intire as may make
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64025:82"/>
men to bee of one Church,</hi> saith the Cavalier <hi>they must beleeve the same doctrine, partake the same sacraments, and be obedient to the same discipline and Prelates.</hi> Here, first I deny that there must bee an entirenesse in all points of doctrine; and if hee will looke backe, hee may see that hee hath laboured to prove it, but hath lost his labour. Againe hee hath been told, that if all have not just seven sacraments, yet they may bee saved. Thirdly, if they bee not under the Pope, and in that regard not under the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, they may bee of a very good reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and of the one saved Church; For so are the Greek, Armenian, and Abis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sine Christians.</p>
                  <p>A second untruth is his inference upon a catalogue of differences; For, saith hee, wee differ in prime points, &amp;c. Hereupon his looke tells us he would inferre, that we are in some danger for differing in these points: But I referre him for the proofe of our safety to <note n="a" place="margin">Examen pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifique de la doctrine des Huguenotes: translated into English under the title of the Catholick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derato<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And untill the Cavalier
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64025:83"/>

                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:64025:84"/>He comes to a third point; and therein hee hath also many and manifest untruths: His point is this, <hi>That it is the Pride of the man in his disobedience to the Church, and not the importance or weight of the doctrine, that makes the Heresie.</hi> And this he would prove, because Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> accounts some things heresies which are points of small importance; and because the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists are accounted hereticks for that which in S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was not heresie; and againe, because Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, (nothing to the Cavaliers purpose) that <hi>the doctrine of</hi> Novatianus <hi>was not worth the inquiring, because he was not of the Church.</hi> Here are divers untruths met together; a first is the Position it selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That it is Pride and Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Church that makes the heresie: A second, that if it were disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Church, yet it is not disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Cavaliers Church, the Pope and his Adherents: Thirdly, It is not true, that those places and proofes produced by him doe prove his point of Pride to bee heresie. But before I come to a more exact consideration of these particulars, I cannot but deliver him backe againe his scornefull objection which hee threw at us in passing to this point, as nothing accusing

us, but him that gave it without reason; <hi>That the Protestants have taken upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to bee the Reformers of the world, without ordinary Mission or Miracles.</hi> That our Ministers have not ordinary Mission, is an untruth so strongly refuted, that there needs a great deale of impudence or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to affirme it, without new and more proofe: And for Miracles to make good a Reformation, I never heard that the very Priests of <hi>Baal</hi> did require them of <hi>Iehu,</hi> nor the idolatrous Jewes of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Iosiah.</hi> And indeed, they might well think there should bee no absolute need of new Miracles to them that brought in no <hi>new</hi> Law, but reformed the Church according to the <hi>old,</hi> which at first was delivered as it were in a cloud of Miracles. Neither is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that our Reformation not bringing in a new Gospel, but reforming according to the Gospel once delivered to the Saints, and at first confirmed by signes, should be now again confirmed by Miracles.

For it is still an errour contrary to the Scriptures that makes the Heresie; and not pride and disobedience against the Pope and his decisions. And indeed this truth was so strong, and so prevailed against the Cavalier, that it forced him to speake some part of it, even against his own proposition: For he saith thus; <hi>The Pride wherewith they presumed to abuse Scripture, and to impose such a fond law upon mens consciences, and a resolution not to leave it when they were commanded by the Church, was that which made it Heresie in them:</hi> Where the abusing of Scripture is indeed the chiefe if not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cause of giving it the likenesse of Heresie. For imposing it as a law upon mens consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, I hope this Author will not take for Heresie, but rather for a vertue, seeing he hath ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> told us, <hi>that those who suppose their religion to be true, are not to blame if that they tel others that they are in danger by hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contrary.</hi> Howsoever I am sure this is not the life of Heresie, as the Cavalier pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently tels us in the next page; <hi>But main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a doctrine &amp; discipline contrary to the judgment &amp; commandements of the Church.</hi> But how he could know by the art of divination that these his barefoot Hereticks, had a resolution not to leave their errours
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64025:88"/>
when they were commanded by the Church, the Church being taken for the Pope and his adhaerents, I cannot divine; for it is very possible that they, seeing the Popes glorious Pantofle adorned with the Crosse, might perhaps thinke it more holy (by the example of him whom they call his Holinesse) to weare shooes of that fashion.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving discovered many Untruths, in at least foure maine points of this Chapter, wee are come to a fifth point, whose truth is so powerfull, that it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes mee, and makes mee to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with the Author, <hi>That it divides Protestants and right Romists so farre as sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and damnation.</hi>

                  <p>And I must cleere either side from uncharitablenesse, in saying that these who faile in this point are in a state of damnation. And it is very true that hee promiseth, <hi>That this Reason strikes at the roote, which is taken from the nature and propertie of Faith:</hi> The point is this; <hi>That whosoever doth give his faith and assent to all the Articles of Christian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, yet if hee doe it not upon the right and infallible motive, hee hath no saving Faith.</hi> Now hereunto wee subjoyne, That <hi>true and right Papists or Romists</hi> doe not beleeve upon the true and infallible motive; Therefore they can have no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith. And indeed, though they
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64025:93"/>
have many and pernitious errors, yet this is the great and generall error that makes up the Mystery of iniquity, which wee call the Papacie, and the Papists call the Church. For the ordinary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of faith in those who are the right and naturall members of the Head of that Mysterie, is to beleeve the Articles of Faith, because the Church, whose mouth, head, and spirit is the Pope, propounds and commands them to bee beleeved. And this Author saith, that the onely true and infallible ground is, <hi>The Revelation of Almighty God, and the proposition and direction of the Church.</hi> Wherein first hee joyneth the Church with God in this ground of Faith; and so gives as it were halfe of the ground of Faith to the Church from God, and makes it halfe unsafe and damnable: But even this halfe hee seemes elsewhere wholly to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and so to leave men wholly to bee damned by a Faith wholly grounded on a <note n="*" place="margin">Objectum formale (<hi>fidei</hi>) est prima veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas Testificans; aut ergò Ecclesia est objectum ut diversum quid à Dei testimonio, aut ratione ipsius: Si diversum, erit testimonium hominum &amp; alienum à fidei infallibilitate &amp; certitudine; si ratione Dei, eo ipso non est ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectum formale, quia formale objectum per se primò, &amp; non per aliud est objectum. <hi>Lorca in</hi> 22. <hi>Sect.</hi>

brings forth <hi>Medina</hi> affirming, that <hi>The Testimonie of the Church doth so farre par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of being the formall object or motive of faith, that the utmost resolution of faith is into the authoritie of the Church, and the proofes produced for it are to bee heard in the common language of Romists: If it bee asked why thou beleevest the Trinity in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and thou answer, Because God saith it; It will then bee demanded of thee how thou knowest that God saith it; thou hast no other Answer left but this, Because the Church saith it; and so are they taught in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme, and so answer both the learned and unlearned.</hi> Behold the common an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, and common faith of Romists.

And seeing this humane faith hath so possessed Romists, that their Prophets doe make the obeying and cleaving to the Pope in his doctrine the very Character of a Christian and childe of the Church; this Church consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of these children thus adhering to the Pope, is against such truely affirmed not to bee the Church; and so may the

Now many seeing a field overcome with these deadly and killing weeds, and so overcome, that they seemed to cover the face of the field, they tooke it to bee a field of Weeds and not of Corne: And because the usuall manner of speaking is to say, that a horse is blacke and not white that hath but a few white haires on him, they thought they might say, the Church of Rome was the Synagogue of Satan, and not a true Church, because there is such a multitude of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, Antichristians, and Idolaters, and so few true worshippers and beleevers.</p>

if Christians knew not but that the Idols ought to bee worshipped with divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, they, beleeving this, might give divine worship to idols; and this Idolatry is not damnable.

                     <hi>Babes, keep your selves from Idols: This Corollary</hi> S. John <hi>not unfitly nor without cause annexed to this Epistle; For, seeing he had taught that there is one onely God, who hath manisted himselfe in his Sonne, and hath taught us by him, that the true worship of God consisteth in faith, hope and love, and in purity and sanctity of life; hee doth now necessarily admonish us, that we remaine in that faith and true worship of God, and beware of all Idolatry. So</hi> John
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64025:104"/>
                     <hi>in this whole Epistle would teach us two things, That there is but one true God, And one true Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iesus Christ with the Father and the Holy Ghost is that and one true God; and Christian Religion is the onely true worship of God: For this Religion g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a caution to be annexed to the conclusion, I thinke that true zeale and charity, though they take such for living soules which are safe in fundamentalls, yet they pity other grosse errours which make the soule sick though they kill not; and a true lover of soules resembles the head both of soules and of love, and desires to present unto God soules without spot and blemish: And because they love them, as on the one side they acknowledge the life that is in them, so they desire to add growth to this life, and to bring it onward toward perfection. They doe not tell them that they are well enough, because they live; for that is rather to build their contentment on their owne safety, then on the full plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and serving of their Saviour. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they call on them for the washing away of other errours, which are blemish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Cavalier in his last chapter hath rid on, much out of his way: and in this he rides apace, and the faster the more out of the way. He was out of his way when hee travelled to free Romists from want of charity, by proving Protestants and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists not to have one saving faith, seeing Protestants having that saving faith, the Romists shew want of charity in damning those who are saved: Hee was againe out of the way in bringing his owne Romists into schisme and damnation, by dividing them from Protestants which have that one saving faith: And now he goes further out of the way, in removing the reasons that may make for unity, though by unity with Protestants Romists may avoid uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse, schisme, and damnation: so, it seemes, hee is so earnest for division and dis-union, that to attaine it he will hazzard both charity and salvation to his owne fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Romists as a high price, and farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the value of that which hee would purchase, though it were the richest jewell in the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:64025:105"/>Yet on hee goes upon this adventure; And whereas differences amongst Romists are brought forth to make Romists more equall to differences among Protestants, or to some differences betweene Protestants and Romists; and likewise to make Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists thinke there may be a spirituall unity notwithstanding some differences, because, notwithstanding their owne differences, they affirme there is an unity among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, this the Author thinkes too peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and therefore strives to take it out of the way.</p>
                  <p>Toward this, he is willing to deny that there are such differences amongst Romists, and he strives to shew that they agree even in those things wherein they differ; But differ they doe, and strong evidences wee have for it, which may hereafter be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: Neither indeede their Poeticall Heade of unity, the Pope, nor any one man on earth, can make the whole Church to bee inwardly of one minde and soule, but onely that Lord and maker of Spirits by his owne Spirit, his true and onely Vicar.</p>
                  <p>For that one Spirit, enlightning and guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the spirits of men, with one faith of one word, delivered by the ministery, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64025:106"/>
and enabled by the same one spirit, can onely make a true, reall, internall and spirituall unity: And accordingly S. <hi>Paul</hi> leading us to the unity of faith, thus right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordereth his words toward unity; <hi>One Spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephes. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>one Lord, one Faith:</hi> And thus hee goes on, and sheweth how this one spirit of one Lord which inwardly workes this unity of faith in the Lords body, outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly also concurres to the working of it by the gifts given to the ministery; For this working without in the ministery, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling them to teach one and the same doctrine of saving faith; and inwardly working in the hearts and soules of Christs members, these members are brought into the unity of faith and so into one body of Christ: and, as in this body of Christ there are different members of different mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and capacities, by the different gifts of the spirit; so these different capacities doe not reach or containe one measure of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth: Christ the Foundation and Head is made knowne to all his members, for by this knowledge they become his members, and so have they all unity in so much divine truth as knits them to Christ: But by reason of their different measures, some attaining such holy truths of which
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:64025:106"/>
others are short, there must needs bee a difference in the apprehension of those truths to which some attaine, and others doe not come; yet in all is a settled de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and purpose to beleeve the whole truth revealed by God, if it be also revealed to them that it is the truth of God: And so whatsoever force was in the Champions speech, <hi>That true spirituall faith beleeveth the whole Body of divine doctrine,</hi> makes not against us but for us, and much more for us then for them. For we upon the right motive, which is God speaking in his word, doe beleeve plainly whatsoever we conceive, and what we doe not conceive wee beleeve in purpose and intention; And thus have wee perfect unity, while in the fundamentalls we have an actuall unity of faith, and in the lesser points an unity of purpose and will: But in this true and kindly unity, one Spirit, not one Pope doth cause inwardly one faith. And againe, that one spirit giving gifts to men, not to one man, outwardly bringeth to the inward unity of faith. And indeede that none but the spirit, the true vicar of Christ, can make this solid, spirituall, and internall unity, it appeares by the confession of the very Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish craft, which hath coyned the Pope to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:64025:107"/>
be the head of unity. For, that they might make and prove him to be such, they have put him into the place of the holy Ghost, and made him the Vicar of Christ: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they say that the holy Ghost speaks by him, and so the speech of the holy Ghost, being infallible verity, is a right ground of unity: A foule errour and without ground of Scripture, which never, since the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Christ from earth, tyed the holy Ghost to one man, so that from him the whole Church should fetch Oracles and resolutions.</p>
                  <p>But indeed it is a high and blasphemous imposture, which puts the Pope in place of the holy Ghost: And when this man speakes, it pronounceth of him as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Herod; <hi>The voice of God, and not of Man.</hi> And how little this differs from Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanisme, I wish Romists would consider, who reduced the promise of sending the Comforter (<hi>Christs Vicar</hi> as<note n="a" place="margin">Assistentia Spiritus sancti promissa est specialiter Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifici (Joan 14.)

                  <p>And the very same place doe the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists apply to the Pope which was applied to Montanus; but yet thus it appeares, That even they that erre in the application, yet hold truth in the position; That the holy Ghost is the true root of union, though er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneously
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:64025:107"/>
and blasphemously they put the Pope into his roome, and make the voyce of the Pope to bee the voice of the holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>And surely the Pope himselfe plainely shewes, that hee doubts his owne spirituall power of making unity, and therefore hee flyes to the grosse and materiall instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of unity, the Sword and Faggot. And so calling downe fire on those that obey him not, if he have any spirit, it seems it is not that spirit which Christ said was the Evangelicall spirit of the Apostles, but rather of him which is called the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, this device of man to make unity of faith by one man, called the Pope, being thus thrust into the place of the Spirit of God, as it proceeded from the spirit of errour, so hath it made unity in errour (as the last, best of Popes, <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great did in a manner prophecie) but it never will make unity in solide and universall Faith and Truth: for the beleevers in this counterfeit head of unity have both gotten from him an unity in many errors, and have beene left in many great and weighty differences, whereof there is little hope of resolving them into union: the sight
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:64025:108"/>
whereof turnes our eyes from this humane and fictitious Head of unitie, to the true roote and meanes of unity, set forth by the Apostle.</p>
                  <p>And, because this Author strives to put away from mens eyes the differences which arise under this false Head of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let us shew him a more full spectacle of them, which may serve to prove that disunion which hee goes about to confute, and to confute that union which hee goes about to prove.</p>

                     <hi>That it is hereticall to beleeve the Pope not to be subject to the Councell,</hi> how is it possible that Romists should bee at unity, of whom a part beleeves, and a part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves it not; yea, each seeme Hereticks thereby unto the other? And thus, if in the <hi>roote</hi> of unity there bee <hi>division,</hi> how great is this <hi>division?</hi> and who can shew how ever this division can bee reconciled by Romists? For, if there be a free Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, no doubt such a Councell will decree the Pope to be subject to it; as they have good reason from Scripture and Antiquity. But if the Pope be free, and may command the Councell, who can expect but that the Pope shall judge for himselfe, and subject Councels to his headship and infallibility? Behold the great Citie divided into great
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64025:109"/>
parts; and division growing even from their roote of unity. Againe, many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Head of unity are at division about the Popes earthly Supremacy; some hold that hee may onely excommunicate Kings, and then can doe no more, his power being meerly spirituall: others hold, that after excommunication hee can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Kings; yea, cause their subjects to kill them: a weighty controversie, and hardly to be decided amongst Papists, but onely by the unity of Kings agreeing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to depose Popes. Againe, in some things hee takes power to dispense; and in the same things his Doctors say he hath not power to dispense: A paterne of which opposition we may plainly and actually see in the Popes Bull of Dispensation to <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, for marrying his Brothers wife, and the Testimonies under Universitie Seales of the Doctors denying him the power of this Dispensation. These and the like questions concerning the power of this Head of unity, make division betweene the Head and members, and make division be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the members themselves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee see divisions doe againe arise from this Head of unity, because this Head leaves many things of controversie
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64025:110"/>
so doubtfully decided in Councels, that their very decisions breed controversies: And what unity is to be expected from such a Head, who by decisions gives occasion of dissentions, and leaves division when he sits of purpose in his Chaire under pretence of making unity?

Hence he saith of the other, that hee erreth in the faith; and the other retorts the same against him: yea this happeneth not only between two particular Divines, but between one Schoole and another.</hi>

                  <p>But now in his Answer to the second ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, somewhat like a right Cavalier of Rome, he runs at Tilt against <hi>Calvin,</hi> and thus he breaks his Lance on him:</p>

                     <hi>The next objection is yet more stupid then the former; and I wonder how</hi> Calvins <hi>rage against the Church could put him so farre out of his wits, as that hee would ever take it into his mouth: For it is hee who (being pricked with our noting their want of unity towards their fellow Brethren) thinks to retort it back upon us, by saying that wee are not in case to object any such thing against them; for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that forsooth wee have as many Sects among us, as we have severall Orders of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men; and then hee reckons up Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctines,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:64025:116"/>
Carmelites, Dominicans, Franciscans, and whom he will. Wicked man, who well knew that none of these holy Orders doth differ in any point of doctrine from any of the rest; and are so farre from breaking communion with them, as that still they prevent one another in all honour and good respect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this wee must take upon his bare word, and his title also which he giveth to <hi>Calvin, wicked</hi> Calvin: yet well fare the honest Belgicks purgers; for when <hi>Calvin</hi> was named, they, in stead of <hi>Calvin,</hi> did put in <hi>studiosus</hi>; so, upon the matter, they called him not <hi>wicked,</hi> but <hi>studious Calvin</hi>: But why <hi>wicked Calvin?</hi> because he knew that no one of those Orders doth differ in any point of doctrine. Did <hi>Calvin</hi> know this, or doth any man, yea, the Author himselfe yet know it? We come but now from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Jesuites and Priests, Dominicans and Franciscans, &amp;c. And this Authour himselfe confesseth there, that each oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the contrary opinion by all arguments that occurre. Besides, it is no new nor strange objection, that divers covents have their severall Masters whom they follow. Againe, look on the Jesuites doctrine of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Kings: doe all Friers agree in these doctrines, upon which much more justly

may be cryed out, wicked <hi>Mariana,</hi> wicked Friar <hi>Clement,</hi> wicked <hi>Barradius,</hi> wicked <hi>Garnet</hi>? doctrines, in my opinion, plainly contrary to the faith; since the faith is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught by the Scripture in this point: And I think more hereticall it is to deny and contradict such a point, being thus plainely taught in the Scripture by <hi>David, Solomon, Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>; then to deny what the Pope hath decided by letters sent from Rome unto Trent.</p>
                  <p>But will you see this Authors ingenuity? hee accuseth <hi>Calvin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 26.9. Eccles. 10.20.

And,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:64025:117"/>
that this departing should not bee secret, they have given to themselves divers names of Sects: Neither were they ashamed to boast of that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth so much detest; In stead of Christians wee heare some called Benedictines, some Francis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, some Dominicans. So that here we find neither mention of Carmelites, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of differing in points of faith; but of a schismaticall separation from other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians by different sects, expressed by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent names. And to them hee might have added Jesuits, who by a more neer separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have divided Jesus from Christ, and so themselves from Christians; though, as it hath been told them (and as it is said by a Pope from S. <hi>Paul</hi>) all Christians are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>ad societatem Iesu Christi,</hi> to the society both of Jesus, and of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. But surely, if this be the Authors place in <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> it is likely hee hath either forgotten <hi>Calvin,</hi> or was not trusted with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Calvin</hi>; and some one that was trusted, but not trusty, told him it would serve his turne, and deceived him.</p>

Which Prophecie was soon after fulfilled in this Land.</p>
                  <p>The Cavalier comes now to dismount a third objection of Protestants concerning Romish difference, which ariseth, as hee saith, in regard of the differences betweene learned and unlearned men: which hee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayeth to take away by a distinction of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite and implicite faith, in this manner; <hi>A man is said to have explicite faith of any article or doctrine, when he hath heard it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly propounded to him, and hath some particular knowledge thereof, and gives par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular assent thereunto: But as for implicite faith of any article or doctrine, a man is then said to have it, when hee beleeves that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, which the Church teacheth them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely who are capable thereof, although for his owne part he have not perhaps so much as heard of it in particular; or if he did, hee hath forgot it; or if he did remember it, he hath not capacity enough to apprehend or understand it.</hi> And when he hath shewed this distinction, he labours with great vehemency to prove it, and affirmes, <hi>That without this it would be wholly impossible to maintaine any Church in any unity of faith at all:</hi> and finally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>That this sword of ours is turned into a buckler wherewith to defend them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:64025:119"/>First, for the pains he takes to make good this distinction, hee takes it to make good our objection, and so labours for us, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himselfe; for upon this distinction being grounded we ground our objection, and say; that this distinction leaves even the like differences amongst Romists for which they accuse and damne us, and leaves no better unity among them then it leaves among us. And if thus, then it is both a sword in our hand to hurt them, and a buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler also to defend us against them: neither have they any buckler to defend themselves against this sword; much lesse will this sword that wounds them, become a buckler to defend the wounds which it selfe gives. But the onely safe way is, with that King who comes with the weake side, to send Ambassadors for peace to the stronger.</p>
                  <p>Now to shew that this distinction being strengthened doth strengthen our objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so is a true sword against Romists; I say, That in those points of faith which are beyond the explicites or fundamentals, &amp; are called implicites, there are differences among Romists as well as among us; and these differences are not onely such as are discovered by the ell, by which the faith of the unlearned is found shorter then that of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:64025:119"/>

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:64025:120"/>
by the others errour; as here, the not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers of the Image with divine worship, is opposed by the worshipper. Besides, he that is in the darke, and sees not what to beleeve, if he beleeve any thing, he can but beleeve an imagination of his owne, and not a reall ttuth; and so must needs differ from him who seeth the truth, and beleeves it being seene: As for their unlearned who walke most in the darke, though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it may happen two blinde men may stumble upon one path, yet it is impossible but that mostly they must differ in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions concerning that which they know not.</p>

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64025:121"/>
Buckler to defend them in this deniall: But it is a Buckler to us to defend us from their objecting of differences against us, seeing this distinction doth both acknowledge a necessity of some lesser differences, and so excuseth us.</p>
                  <p>And thus may wee come to a sight of the unity of faith in the Church; For in the explicites, that is, in fundamentalls of absolute necessitie which knit unto Christ the foundation, there is and ought to be an unity; and this substantiall unity may cover the incurable differences in the lesser im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite points being held by Infirmity, and not with Contention, Scandall, and Schisme: For unity in fundamentalls doth take away the damning censure of differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in lesser points when there is a will of beleeving right in these points, but a want of power to attaine this beliefe. And so these differences in lesser points not being put upon account for the will of unity in them, and for the reall unity in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls, this reall unity in fundamentalls is accounted an entire, or at least a solid and saving unity: So that the unity is not to be reckoned from this, that all doe actually agree in this beliefe of all lesser points, (for in divers of these points divers doe necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64025:122"/>
differ;) but because their unity in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls, and a will of unity in these les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser points wherein they differ (the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of smaller differences being thus taken away) are accounted to them for an entire, or at least for a sufficient unity.

them miserably to be slain: which thing seem; to have given the occasion of this wretched schisme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>See here Rome diseased, and her healers cast out that tell her of her diseases, yea, cruelly slaine. And now, if the Author be not ashamed, let him aske why Protestants fly from Rome; yea, let him aske of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Divine, why men should go out of Babylon, that they may not be partakers of her sins, nor of her plagues; and of Christ himselfe, if they persecute his members in one City, why should they fly into another; and of the blinde man in the Gospel, why doe you stay out of the Synagogue when you are cast out? Surely, when the Author useth these questions, what will his Readers think, but that hee is very unreasonable to have Protestants stay where they are cast out, or where they must bee spiritually or corporally slain for staying? This unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nablenesse of his puts me in mind of a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who espying his enemy going up Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate hill faster then hee could follow him, having drawn his sword, called out to him, and sware that if he did not stay, he would kill him; but the other beleeved that if he had stayed hee should bee killed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore went away the faster: So this Cavalier,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64025:124"/>
when the Pope drives out Protestants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him with excommunications, pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, fire and sword, hee cries after them that they shall bee damned if they stay not, whereas they doubt that they shall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and killed if they stay: indeed, this was a great fault of theirs, that they did not stay to be killed, that, by taking their death pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, the Pope might goe on with selling Indulgences and his other merchandizes quietly. Yet may you heare the Cavalier even cholerick in such unreasonable que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning; <hi>With what colour could certain sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, base, and filthy men have presumed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the visible Catholick Church of Christ our Lord, and to erect their conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles as they did, if they had not at least profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that they could not finde salvation there?</hi> Where first wee acknowledge the titles to be of the Authors meere bounty, out of a Romish Treasurie of charity mistaken; and because they beare the superscription of Rome, we send them back to Rome, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theirs and not ours. But secondly, wee deny that they departed from the catholick Church; for, in the second Chapter, we have shewed that Protestants have still commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the catholick Church; they fled not from health, but from the plague; not
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64025:125"/>
from salvation, but damnation; not from the whole, but from the sick: Neither did they fly only, but were cast out and bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; and not only cast out, but in danger of death if they stayed, except they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that the plague of Rome was a disease. The remnant that hath salvation there they pity, and love as their living brethren in a deadly Pesthouse, or Israel in Egypt, swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting under the burdens of brick, and under the whips of Egyptian and Romish Taske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters. And whereas the Cavalier speaks of Conventicles, to his griefe, hee sees that they are not shut up in private Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but have obtained large Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And being excommunicated from the Romish Synagogue, as the blind man from the Jewish, <hi>Iesus</hi> hath found <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>HEe goes on both to cleare and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us in this which followes: <hi>This discourse of theirs, and their standing so much upon fundamentall points of faith in the sense which they use, is a meere Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra; but it is frequented by them through an high kinde of craft: For, though it bee most true, That some doctrines are in themselves of farre more importance then some others, because the knowledge thereof may bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the performance of some duty which is required at our hands; or else because they may containe the very heads, and first grounds of Christianity more then others doe, and therefore doe exact a more explicite beliefe at the hands of Christians, and consequently may be accounted in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spests more fundamentall,</hi> &amp;c. Here, though they seeme to accuse us of an high craft<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of a <hi>Chimera</hi>; yet withall, thus farre

hee acknowledgeth our Truth, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it from being a <hi>Chimera,</hi> That some doctrines are of farre more importance then some others, containing the very heads and first grounds of Christianitie more then others doe, and therefore doe exact a more explicite beliefe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently may bee accounted, in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, more fundamentall. This I desire the Reader to observe, because this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that which hath beene formerly spoken concerning the agreement between Fundamentals and Explicites, and must serve hereafter for a Confutation of his owne objections against Fundamentals. In the meane time, that which paines him for the present is this, That wee doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve every Decree or Errour of the Pope, as well as these important grounds of Christianitie: for thus hee presently sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth, <hi>There is no doctrine at all concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Religion, the beliefe whereof is not fundamentall to my salvation, if the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church propound and command mee to beleeve it.</hi> So the Cavaliers quarrell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us is this, That wee doe not make the worship of Images, kindred of Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sips, and such popish vanities, fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall to our salvation, as the Articles of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:64025:127"/>

Thus is the Pope made Christs Rivall, and takes the faith of the spouse from her husband to himselfe.

But let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, <hi>Whoremongers and Adulterers</hi> (especially such great ones) <hi>God will judge</hi>; Yet this would hee approve by that which followes: <hi>For there is no errour in faith, which may not bee made damnable by the manner of holding it, when it is done so obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately as that in defence thereof a man denyes the authority of the Catholick Church.</hi> But briefly I answer; First, that the Church cannot make a point of faith of that which is none. Secondly, <hi>Stapleton</hi> tells us that the Church hath no promise to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly directed in the decision and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of small or light points, and so the Church not having this infallible direction, cannot have authority to make such points fundamentall, nor to command faith to them where she hath no infallible direction in them. Thirdly, the Church in these les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser points not having this authority, hee doth not disobey the authority of the Church who beleeveth not these points
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:64025:134"/>
which she hath no authority to command as points of faith. Fourthly, if the Church were this foundation, and could make a point fundamentall, yet the Pope, and his confederacy for whom this Author fights, is not the Church. Fifthly, the same Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Church hath taught and propounded many grosse errours and untruths for points of doctrine, which are so farre from being fundamentall to salvation, that they shake the very foundation, and so are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fundamentall to damnation. But here I cannot but complaine of this Author in that hee useth craft, which himselfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth; for, while he goes about to lay the Pope (the <hi>Chimera</hi> of Rome) for a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith, hee names him not in his whole booke, but still tells us of the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, let him come forth plainly out of his Covert, and shew us his catholick Church, even the Pope and his adherents, if he be not ashamed of them; and not thus draw disciples to a fancy, and a piece of Poetry, under the reall and reverend name of the catholick Church. But this may serve as a caveat to the Reader, that the Cavalier tells us of the Church, when the Pope is his errand. Another point whereof he seemes to be ashamed is the worship of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:64025:135"/>
Images, which he never reckons among the doctrines of difference; but, if it please him, he may now fitly conjoyne them together, and then his discourse may runne thus: If the Pope decree the worship of Images, it may be fundamentall to salvation, if with the deniall of Idolatrie the Popes authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bee denyed: Yet our Author having spoken that which is proved to be fearfully untrue in his sense, (that what the Pope and his conspiracy under the name of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church doe propound, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be beleeved is fundamentall) he is bold to say, <hi>This (untruth) is unanswerably proved by the meere catalogues of heresies which have beene made by severall Fathers of the Primitive Church, and especially by S.</hi> Austin, <hi>in his Treatise ad quod vult Deum: which I have toucht before, and which I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly exhort my Reader to peruse at large.</hi> This is so farre from being unanswerable, that it hath beene answered; and our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor can never make it good that those points, which hee acknowledgeth to be of little importance in themselves; were there declared to bee fundamentall, for being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately maintained against the decision &amp; command of the Pope and his Councell, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

onely makes up with boldnesse and undertaking, what hee wants in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and proofe.</p>
                  <p>And, as in the following piece hee preferres his Reader to the sixth and fifth Chapters, so I also referre him to the answer of those Chapters; and there, besides other solutions, hee may see that the example of Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> makes mightily against the Popes authority, since it plainly appeares that Saint <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> did hold the Popes fallibilitie, when he plainly held the contrary to that which the Pope had decided.</p>
                  <p>And thus, being put besides his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses, hee is also deprived of his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: The distinction of points of faith into fundamentall and not fundamentall doth stand still in such full truth and power; that the unbeliefe of points not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall doth not presently forfeit sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, though the same points bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by the Pope, and his conspiracy; much lesse doe worship of Images, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in an unknowne tongue, salvation by merits, the Popes supremacy (especially taken for a foundation of faith) though decided and commanded by the Pope,

                  </p>
                  <p>First to his question, what are funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls, and what not, hee ought to give an answer himselfe; for hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath told us, Page 74. <hi>That some doctrines are of farre more importance then others, because they may containe the very heads and first grounds of Christianitie more then others doe, and therefore exact a more Explicite beliefe, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may bee accounted in some respects more fundamentall.</hi> It being then acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by him, that there are such do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of farre greater importance then others, that exact a more Explicite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and are more fundamentall; why

And indeed, let him bring an exact List and Catalogue of all the onely Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith contained in the Fathers rules of faith, and an exact List of all and the onely Explicites of the Romists; and hee may quickly receive a Catalogue of our Fundamentals. But this Authour is here againe exceedingly out of his way, and that the Title of his Chapter might tell him by the warinesse of it; for his businesse is not to deny a distinction of fundamentals and not fundamentals, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of greater or lesser importance of the Articles themselves; but, this being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to adjoyne and superedifie; that, though this distinction doe stand, yet even points of lesser importance, and in themselves not fundamentall, may bee made funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall by the command and authority of the Pope: So that his quarrelling at this distinction is not onely a quarrell from his errand, but a quarrell against the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:64025:138"/>
and a quarrell against himselfe, and against his fellow-Romists: and if hee make quarrels against himselfe and his fellowes, why may wee not leave them and him to make up their owne quarrell among themselves?</p>
                  <p>And accordingly, whereas this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour makes a fearfull noyse how dearely it concernes men to know which are fundamentals, wee might turne him to get an answer for this out-cry from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his fellow-Romists, yea, from the Pope himselfe; for Romists say, that the Explicites are such points, that hee who doth not know them cannot bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: Then the Authours terrible words doe thus warfare against himselfe (putting Explicites for Fundamentals) That <hi>there is nothing in all Christian Religion which imports a man more exactly to learne, then what are these Explicites, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof none can bee saved: And an exact List and Catalogue should be given of these Explicites, which yet the infallible Pope hath never given to his Papists: So that if a Papist should faile of beleeving an Explicite, by not knowing it to bee an Explicite, hee must be sure to perish, and that for ever.</hi>

                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:64025:139"/>Yet the Cavalier (in wrath and warre against unity) proceeds further in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against his owne confessed and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable distinction of Explicites and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals; and hee so proceeds, that it may easily bee seene that his anger puts out the eye of his judgement, or carryes him beyond the kenne of it: For thus hee saith, <hi>Whereas, if either they framed not the distinction of Fundamentals at all, or else would clearly let men know which points alone were fundamentall; then this would follow, That whensoever wee should convince them in any particular Doctrine which is denyed by them, and which yet was belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the ancient Fathers, they would bee obliged to confesse, that either that point was not fundamentall, which would dis-able them from railing at us for beleeving the same; or else that the Fathers were of a different Religion in fundamentall points from them, and that in their owne opinion those very Fathers could not bee saved: which would put them to much prejudice another way.</hi> Here leaving to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour his owne terme of <hi>railing,</hi> (wherein I wonder hee should delight, but that I see elsewhere hee takes pleasure in the mentioning of scurrill and blasphemous
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64025:139"/>
Invectives) I say, that some errors bee not fundamentall which are found in the Fathers, and now maintained by Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists: yet wee are not disabled by this distinction to reprove Romists for them; for wee doe not say in this distinction, that no errours should bee reproved but those which are fundamentall, for even lesser errours are to bee reprehended; but wee say, that these errours in lesser points doe not breake the unity which by greater and more fundamentall points is made betweene Christ and his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and betweene the members them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>And secondly, wee say, that Romists are much more to bee reproved if they hold any errours of the Fathers now in controversie betweene us; for these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted errours have beene now by the Scriptures more evidently discovered to bee errours; and it is a thing farre more worthy of blame, if a man should runne into a ditch by day, then if he should stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into it by night.</p>
                  <p>But whatsoever exactnesse this Authour may require or imagine in this distinction, this exactnesse being granted, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make it to appeare, that wee differ
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:64025:140"/>
from the unanimous beliefe of the Fathers in the maine points mentioned in their rules of faith, now called Fundamentals. And for his Argument concerning the Lutherans, it doth not endanger us; for, if the Lutherans should bee found by this distinction to differ from us in these fundamentall points which should unite them to Christ, it is no hurt to us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the communion of those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce communion with Christ. And on the other side, if by it they bee found to differ from us in points not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, it would bee no danger nor just dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reputation to us to avow those points, wherein wee differ, not to bee fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall: but wee will much rather disavow the quarrels which are made where there is no fundamentall difference.</p>
                  <p>The period which followes, as farre as it is a true Narration of our way of making peace by this distinction with the Fathers and the Lutherans, is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation both of the distinction, and our peace-making by it.

if hee should cast off this onely true and substantiall ground of unity, which knits together all the sound Churches that are at this day, or ever have been through all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the face of the earth since our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, to make an unity by agreeing, under paine of damnation, in all points propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and commanded by the Pope and his Church of Rome, whether important more or lesse, hee shall not onely by this meanes breake the unitie of all the true Churches on earth into pieces, but of Rome it selfe: For (to returne almost his owne words) <hi>Since the Pope, who hath rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christ, and usurped the Headship of the Church, first coined and established a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Trent, neither then, nor in any time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there was in the whole world any one Kingdome or Country, or City, or Towne, or Family of men, or Pasture, or Flocke, yea or any one single person, who by a supernaturall Faith, which this Authour onely approves, did imbrace the whole body, and every Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Trent Religion.</hi> Yea even at this day it is not received in divers parts that beare the name of the Church of Rome, much lesse in Greece, Armenia, Syria, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia, most of which either know not, or acknowledge not this Councell, nor the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:64025:144"/>
Popes Supremacie. All these therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing any of these Articles, must be torne in pieces from the body of Christ, and cast into Hell fire. Thus the Scarlet Whore, drunke with the bloud of the Saints, speaks in the right voice of the Harlot, If she may not have the whole childe,<note place="margin">1 Kin. 3.26.</note> let it bee cut in pieces: Let the Church be distracted and damned, if the Pope may not be her Lord and her Tyrant. And so whereas Christ was a head that gave himselfe to death, to save his body from damnation; is not hee an Antichrist that throwes the body of Christ into hell and damnation, to make himselfe the head?</p>
                  <p>But in a third place hee objecteth not an use of ours, but an abuse of his owne: For hee abuseth his Reader in saying to him, <hi>That the making of this distinction betweene Fundamentall, and not Fundamentall points of Faith, and the resolving not to declare which is which, doth save them with a great part of the ignorant world from the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of rigour in their proceeding with us. For how could they persecute as they doe, without extreme note of cruelty?</hi> But neither the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king nor hiding of Fundamentalls is the cause of prosecuting Romists in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but the cause of their punishment hath
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:64025:145"/>
been their owne making of Treasons, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously revealed by Gods goodnesse, notwithstanding their hiding, even in the vaults and depths of the earth. And though there were no Fundamentalls of Religion, but only Fundamentalls of State; the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls of State are very plain, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be hidden, which justifie the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Rebells and Traitours. But of this some proofe hath been given in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Booke, and the Authour will call for more towards the end.</p>
                  <p>As for that which followes, <hi>Yea, or even, how could they dissent without apparent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety from our beliefe and practice of those Doctrines wherein wee have had, and still have prescription of so many ages, if the contrary thereof should be confessed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves not to be Fundamentall?</hi> It is so weak, that I wish that some childe, and not the Cavalier, had spoken it to save his reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For, will any man say that it is impiety to dissent from others in ancient errours, though these errours be not Fundamentall? <hi>Tertullian</hi> might have taught our Authour much more wisdome, who, upon the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of an errour not very Fundamentall, thus saith, <note n="b" place="margin">Hunc qui receperunt, veritatem consuetudini anteponunt. <hi>Tert. de vel. virg. cap.</hi> 1.

                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Cavalier thus goes on: <hi>It is more then probable, that one reason why they are so unwilling to give in any Catalogue of the fundamentall points is, Because they know so well how ridiculous they would make themselves by the infinite variety of their Catalogues. For, if it be so familiar with them to bee of different mindes concerning particular doctrines, how much more would they bee so in this, which is a roote of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny branches, or rather a monster of many heads; and so there can bee no doubt, but that some of them would not bee more resolute in restraining the fundamentall points into a narrow compasse, then others would bee in enlarging them into a broader.</hi> The Authour here goes about to make the Fathers, yea, himselfe and his owne
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:64025:146"/>
partners ridiculous; for, if varietie in the Catalogues of Fundamentals, or chiefe heads and grounds of Christianity bee ridiculous; how shall the Fathers escape the merriments of this Authour? Yea, how shall himselfe and his owne partners not bee mocked by himselfe? For it is plaine, that neither <hi>Irenaeus</hi> nor <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> in sundry patternes of the rule of Faith, doe enumerate Articles just of the same number and breadth. Neither doe the three usuall Creeds hold equall measure by the Authours ell; yea, let the Authour himselfe, who confesseth that <hi>there are such Heads and Grounds of Christianity more fundamentall,</hi> make a Catalogue of these Heads, and hee can never agree with all his fellowes, who agree not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves. And thus, if hee will looke into this glasse, hee may see him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe laughing at himselfe: And indeed, if the Reader will peruse the Romists where they write of their Explicites, they may see the same variety wherewith the Cavalier here makes himselfe merry; <hi>some contracting them into a narrower, some enlarging them into a broader compasse:</hi> And to save labour to the Reader, I will

                     <hi>That in assigning the Rule by which it may bee defined what the vulgar should beleeve, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines doe differ, and doe put divers Rules: the most common Rule is, That they should beleeve those Articles which are by Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities

celebrated in the Church; and that it sufficeth if they beleeve these.</hi> But this Rule seemes insufficient to others, both in excesse and defect. <hi>Scotus</hi> seemes to say, <hi>That the common precept of faith doth onely binde to the beliefe of the easie (which hee calleth grosse) points.</hi> Some of the later (as <hi>Suarez</hi>), <hi>It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Yet, I confesse, that I find not my selfe so merry hereat as the Cavalier, (at our sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed differences in Fundamentals) but will rather strive to excuse them, and to finde reasons for their varietie: for the reasons seeme to bee serious, as the matter which they goe about is weightie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable;
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:64025:149"/>
even the proposall of those grounds whose knowledge is necessary to salvation. So farre is it from being a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, as this Authour termes it, that his calling of it by this Title is so much the more monstrous, as it is true that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe acknowledgeth that there are such Heads of Christianitie, which himselfe thus calleth monstrous. Behold a Truth of the Authours owne bringing forth, and then mocked by him for a monster: but I will goe on to speake for his Truth, and against his Monster; even against him, to plead for him and his fellowes. True it is, that there may bee a different enumeration of the Articles in the Fathers Rules of faith, in the Creeds, and in the Explicites of later Writers, as well as our Fundamentals; and that for divers reasons.</p>
                  <p>One may bee this; Because some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogues may put in more Articles for more full unfolding and expressing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Articles; so it is said by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Chalcedon, that the Additions in the Creeds of Constantinople <note n="a" place="margin">

Some measures of understanding and faith are small; and it is not to bee denied but that some Articles, which are now necessary to be particularly knowne and beleeved, were then knowne onely and beleeved in grosse, without danger of salvation. And that there is now no toleration of lesse degrees in this kind, for weaknesse of faith, or shallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of capacity, I thinke wise men scarce dare to affirme.</p>
                  <p>A third reason of this variety may be the various affection and intention of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signers of these heads: For one perchance would be sure not to exclude any man from salvation, that hath any true, though never so little interest in it, by the knowledge of never so few fundamentalls; and therefore this man contracteth them. Another hee feares, lest by the lessening of them, thereby to include the salvation of some, others may bee excluded from salvation, by not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or not beleeving those points which are lessened, and therefore enlargeth them.</p>
                  <p>Now these reasons being given, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend this Authour and his fellowes against
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:64025:150"/>
himselfe, I will adde essayes of some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty upon this variety.</p>
                  <p>A first, That certainly so much must bee knowne and beleeved of God in Christ Jesus, as may unite us to him, and so make us partakers of his death and resurrection unto remission of sinnes and regeneration: And therefore ordinarily his <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 4.24, 25.

                  <p>Secondly, That so many Heads and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles as conduce to this union, may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Fundamentall, because they knit and unite us to Christ the foundation.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly, more of these points being knowne to one then to another, and the more points working the union in one, and the fewer in the other, the more may be called Fundamentall to the one, and the fewer to the other; so a great house built on a rocke, and by more stones knit unto the rocke then a lesser, may bee said to have more fundamentalls then the lesser; yet both have as true an union with the rocke each as other.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is good, in teaching, to enlarge

the points as much as may be;<note place="margin">The most fundamentall is the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Deity. For the foundation it selfe is God with us. For there is no Rocke but God, Psal. 18.31. And all the Church is built on this Rocke unto salvation, Mat. 16.18. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Arians, or any others that build not their faith on the Godhead of the Son, are not built on the Rocke, but on the sands. And the Judge himselfe hath made knowne his judgement on them: They shall not see life, but the wrath of God abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on them, John 3.18, 36. So also John 20.31. 1 Tim. 3.16. 2 Corin. 5.18, 19. Colos 2.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. 2 Cor. 4.3, 4.

                  <p>Fourthly, as the Teacher should enlarge his teaching, so let not the Learner volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily shut or contract his learning, knowing, nor beleeving the grounds of Christianity; but goe on as farre as his measure will give him leave, untill hee have found Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus dwelling in his soule by his Spirit, and by that Spirit witnessing to his soule, that he is a Sonne of God, even an heire annexed with Christ: For then, and onely then shalt thou have a comfortable certainty of the sufficiency of thy fundamentalls, when thou feelest thy selfe an habitation of God by the Spirit.

(called by your selfe, more fundamentall) leave out the Canon of Scriptures, and the number, yea, the nature and name of Sacraments?

                     </note> So till you answer him, doe not require of us to bring in Sacraments as fundamentalls of that faith, which is denied by your owne to be an effect of them. But you are soone weary, and I hope ashamed of this point; and therefore wander to another, not much more of kinne to the point, then the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath been hitherto to the Title. You say there are great differences between the Protestants and you, about the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Article of the descent of Christ into Hell, and the other of the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, and the Communion of Saints, &amp;c. But what doe you here talk of differences in understanding fundamentals, where the present question is, Whether the Protestants doe acknowledge their funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls to bee contained in the Creed? For, if Protestants declare that their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals are contained in the Creed, then your Title is gone, which saith, That <hi>they do not, nor dare not declare them.</hi> And surely it will aske a greater strength, and a farre
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:64025:153"/>
bigger volume then <hi>Charity mistaken,</hi> to prove that Protestants doe not rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Articles of the Creed. But secondly, the Authours objection is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not onely upon a new, but upon a false supposition, if his fellow Romists may bee Judges: For his supposed proposition is this, <hi>That all the Articles in the Creed are Fundamentall.</hi> Now this is different from the first proposall of our opinion, <hi>That all fundamentall Articles are in the Creed.</hi> It is also denied by his owne fellowes: For, though all fundamentall Articles be there, yet they say, that some Articles that are there may not bee fundamentall, or expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely to be known upon losse of salvation; as before hath been shewed out of <hi>Vasquez</hi> and <hi>Azorius</hi>: Therefore to stand upon a different understanding of those Articles, which are denied by your owne men to bee Explicites (or doubted) is besides the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But thirdly, Do we differ from you in understanding those points? What is that to the point undertaken in the end of the last Chapter and promised to be shewed in this, <hi>That wee differ among our selves in the number of Fundamentalls.</hi> You are now gone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:64025:153"/>
come to a ridiculousnesse of your owne, by your differing from us in the false understanding of some Articles of the Creed, which all your owne Prophets doe not account Fundamentals. But you add: <hi>It is to little purpose to know or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that the Creede containes all Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, unlesse there were some certaine way to understand them right.</hi> This is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine a ranging from shewing our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences among our selves, or that wee have not these Fundamentals: Yet I answer, Wee have a certaine, and the best way of understanding them right; wee have a learned Ministery endued with gifts from on high, which teacheth and preacheth these Fundamentals, and the right mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them. And the right meaning thus taught, the Spirit in the hearers doth so discover and certifie the truth of them, that the hearers see the Articles to bee Gods truth and not mans: And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, their faith thus beleeving them, resteth on God as the sole Foundation of their faith; and this teaching of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church wee use, commend, and allow. But that <hi>The single Article of the holy Catholick Church should containe the reason of all our faith fundamentally,</hi>
                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:64025:154"/>
seemes to mee an high kinde of Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. And this blasphemous doctrine, as wee have before shewed, is the very spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Popery or Antichrist, which sets up the Pope in Gods place, and makes his beleevers truely Papists or Antichristians. And this great offence and mysterie of iniquitie carryeth Papists by throngs into the Land of darknesse; and into this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of theirs the soules of the saved may not enter: True it is, that God useth the service of the Ministers, or, if you will, of the Church, in publishing the Articles of faith; but no other Foundation of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall faith there is but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, though speaking by man unto man; the Fundamentality of our faith passeth through man that is the instrument, and resteth wholly upon God. But saith hee, <hi>If wee understand it otherwise, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it selfe speakes of particular errours, which are damnable in them by whom they are imbraced; and yet they are not at all against any expresse Doctrine of the Creed: As namely, where Saint</hi> Paul <hi>calls it a Doctrine of Divels to forbid marriage, and meates, &amp;c.</hi> I answer, first, That the Authour hereby proves that which wee deny not, and disproves not that which
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:64025:154"/>
(hee saith) wee affirme: For the point is not, Whether there bee any damnable errours besides those that are against some expresse doctrine of the Creede: But, Whether there bee in the Creede those fundamentall points, which being truely beleeved, will cause unity with Christ the Head, and unity with his Body the Church. Other errours against other Truths in Scripture not fundamentall, wee acknowledge there are many, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Divell, the Father of Lyes, and in themselves damnable to such as hold not the true Foundation, Christ Jesus, by beleeving Fundamentals.

but the Romists themselves doe not place the lawfulnesse of meates and marriage among their chiefe Heads of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or Explicites and Fundamentals, and therefore this Authour doth ill require of us that which hee cannot obtaine of his fellowes.

                  <p>But being unhappily, as well as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently fallen into the mention of these damnable errours, hee saw, that as soone as they were brought in, they looked, at least asquint, on the Church of Rome, and claymed kindred of her: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee thought that there was need of an Apologie to put off this kindred and acquaintance: <hi>Which by the way is not to bee understood of the chastity and fasts of the Catholick Church (as Protestants doe most perversely affirme) which knowes that those things are lawfull; but that yet it is most gratefull to God, when his servants for his love deprive themselves of those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Presently there came in such a number of women, only inhabitants within the City of Sivil, that twenty Notaries, and as many Inquisitors would not have sufficed to take the complaints. Wherefore the Inquisitors gave 30. daies more.

                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:64025:156"/>Hee adds further: <hi>In like manner Saint</hi> Peter <hi>saith, That Saint</hi> Paul <hi>in his Epistles had written certaine things which were hard to bee understood, and which the unlearned and unstable did pervert to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction: Saint</hi> Augustine <hi>declares upon this place, that the places misunderstood concerned the doctrine of Iustification, which some misconceived to bee by faith alone, by occasion of what Saint</hi> Paul <hi>had writ to the Romanes; and of purpose to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that errour, hee saith, that Saint</hi> James <hi>wrote his Epistle, and proved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that good works were absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Act of Iustification. Hereupon wee may observe two things; the one, That an errour in this point alone, is by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Saint</hi> Peter, <hi>to worke their destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction who imbrace it. And the other, That the Apostles Creede which speakes no one word thereof, is no good Rule to let us know all the fundamentall points of faith.</hi> To this I answer, First, That this Authour goes on still upon a false ground, as if wee said that all errours in faith that may damne men were fundamentall, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely against some Article of the Creede. Whereas, wee have often af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, That any errour, though not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:64025:157"/>
may damne men that by a lively faith hold not rightly the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, and so are without Christ. And it seemes, that these men were not well grounded and founded by fundamentals in Christ Jesus, whom Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calls unlearned and unstable, and their errour the errour of the wicked; A generation of vipers turne wholesome food into poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and abuse Scriptures to their owne condemnation.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, That <hi>faith doth not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie, but that good workes are absolutely necessarie to the Act of Iustification,</hi> is most untrue, and against Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> himselfe: Untrue; for, a man is justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by faith in Christ, and not by his owne merits; which, in your language, are good workes, as divers of your owne Authours <note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pighius, Contarenus, Colonienses, Ferus,</hi> &amp;c. And the very Councell of Trent saith, That Justification is free, and not merited by faith or workes.

For first, hee chargeth falsly not Saint <hi>Austin</hi> onely, but Saint <hi>Iames</hi> with holding this errour, That good workes were absolutely necessary to the act of justification. And then secondly he will make him to say, that the not holding of this errour, is an errour which may worke their destruction that embrace it: Yea thirdly, that the Apostles Creed is no good rule to let us know all the fundamentall points of faith; because it speakes no one word, to teach us that the Cavaliers errour is a fundamentall point of faith.</p>

                  <p>BUt having quarrelled in vaine with the Creed, to prove the insufficiency of it for fundamentalls, now hee comes to the Articles; where he thus begins: <hi>Others say that the Booke of the 39.

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:64025:158"/>
confused) what the Church of England in most things beleeves; so it is true, that they are very carefull, that they bee not too clearly understood. And therefore in many Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, whereof that Book speakes, it comes not at all to the main difficulty of the question between them and us, and especially in those of the Church, and Free-will.</hi> While the Authour speaks of a confused manner, and which is extremely confused, his words do returne upon himselfe, and his owne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: For, that he may make his discourse confused, it seemes hee makes use of this doubtfull word <hi>Declare.</hi> For if wee say, That the Booke of Articles declares our fundamentalls of faith, wee doe not say, it declares all the knots of questions which are between us and the Romists. For it is well knowne there are divers controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies between us and the Romists, which are not of fundamentalls. And neither the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their rules of Faith, neither Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists in their Explicites doe declare the knots of questions which may arise even concerning fundamentalls themselves; if the fundamentalls be so expressed, that their true and saving sense may bee received and beleeved by the working of that Spirit, which makes Christs sheep to hear Christs
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:64025:159"/>
voice. They that thus beleeve, shall bee saved, though they know not all the knots which cunning and erring men doe make. They that write rules of Faith, Explicites, and Fundamentalls, doe not in the same undertake to write all knots of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies which concerne them. And the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier doth not find them in his owne Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors among their Explicites: wherefore the answer which he makes for them, let him take for us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for his particulars of the Church, and Free-will: First, for the Church; Doth our Church hold, that the visibility and inerrability of the Church are fundamentalls? And if shee doe not, how can this Authour accuse her for not shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fundamentalls; because she shewes not those points which she doth not hold to be fundamentall?

                  <p>And for Free-will, I might aske first:
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:64025:159"/>
Doth this Authour find in any of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors this knot of Free-will for an Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite? But secondly, Doth the Councell of Trent it selfe, called of purpose to end controversies, so set downe the knot of this controversie, that your owne Romists are agreed of it among themselves? True it is, that the maine body of the Papacy dotes upon Free-will, according to their Leaders, who, as this Authour well affirmeth, have many (profitable) Doctrines; as that of Merit, Supererogation, &amp;c. depending upon it. But yet there are among them some that hold the efficacy of grace on the will, which the Protestants do teach; and so the Authours confused manner doth now light on the precious Synod of his deare Mother, whose Champion hee is; but not without prevarication: For, while hee condemnes a confused speaking of Free-will, hee is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come that sonne of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who shameth his mother: For she hath taught, and, as he calls it, <hi>Declared Free-will,</hi> in such a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed manner, that her owne children cannot agree about her meaning.</p>
                  <p>And now hee sets downe the words of the tenth Article concerning Free-will, and concludes, <hi>That this is true Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which we beleeve better then they.</hi> A
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:64025:160"/>
man would have thought here, that we had been almost friends; but let not the Reader bee mistaken: for the worke of mistaken Charity, is not to make peace, but division. Therefore after a confessed agreement, a disagreement is to bee pickt out; <hi>They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare not</hi> (saith he) <hi>whether or no a man have freedome of will to doe a good worke, or not to doe it, when first hee is inspired and moved to it by God Almighties grace; which we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and they deny: which is the onely knot of our question, and the point upon which so many other Catholick Doctrines depend.</hi> I desire the Reader to take speciall notice of these words of the Cavalier, <hi>That upon the Doctrine of Free-will many Romish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines doe depend:</hi> For hence may arise a caution to those that affect this Doctrine of Free-will, since here they see it confessed by the Cavalier, that on this Doctrine many Romish Doctrines doe depend; so it concernes them to beware how they admit this Doctrine, which hath so much Popery in the belly of it.</p>
                  <p>But now to the maine knot of his que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion I give this answer, That in untying this knot there is yet left unfolded the chiefe pleat of the knot: For the chiefe fold of this knot is not, Whether the will,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:64025:160"/>
being inspired and moved by God, there bee freedome in it to will, or not to will; but whether the will be not at any time so moved by grace (especially in conversion) that though it may will, or not will; yet it will certainly &amp; infallibly move that way, to which Gods grace enclines it. For indeed the freedome which these men speake for, is a freedome of the will from the grace of God. For they would have the will so free from Gods grace, that grace should not actuate and worke it to will and to doe. For other freedome of the will wee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, even the most excellent freedome; affirming, that when the will is thus moved by God, it willeth freely that way to which Gods grace moveth it; yea, most freely, because most willingly. For this is the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of power issuing from the highest cause, that it worketh in second causes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own natures: and therefore it workes in the will of man, by making it most freely willing. Accordingly grace doth so worke in the will, that the will determines it selfe that way to which grace doth incline it. And thus (as it hath been well observed) <hi>The feare of overthrowing Free-will is removed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hist. Trent. lib.</hi> 2.</note> 
                     <hi>since things are vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently moved by a contrary cause, but never by
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:64025:161"/>
their owne: And God being the cause of the will, to say it is moved by God, is to say it is moved by it selfe.</hi> And indeed this is the chiefe freedome of the will which wee maintaine, when the will doth freely move, being moved by the highest cause, whose service is perfect freedome: Onely, because the word hath been abused, <note n="k" place="margin">Vocabulum ambiguum in altero sensum verum &amp; bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, in altero falsum &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niciosum. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this highest and most excellent freedome wee truly maintaine, even that by which the will is free, when God worketh it freely to will: Yet many Romists complaine, because no other freedome will please them, but that the will may be freed from God, and not be wrought by him to will as he will. But thus doe they mainly fight against Gods glory, and mans safety: For first, great glory is got hereby unto God, that hee can turne the wills that are most averse from him, and make them willingly and gladly to will what he willeth: Even <hi>Saul</hi> breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out threatnings and slaughter in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall will, hee can change into <hi>Paul,</hi> in his new and spirituall will,<note place="margin">Act 9.1, 6. &amp; 21.13.</note> 
                     <hi>ready not onely to be bound, but to dye for the Name of the Lord Iesus.</hi> And thus he that glorieth, can only glory in the Lord. Secondly, it gives God
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:64025:161"/>
the glory of performing his promises: God hath promised a Seed to the woman,<note place="margin">Rev. 12.17. Gal. 3.16, 28.29.</note> even Christ mysticall, as well as Christ personall; and hee hath promised a Seed to <hi>Abraham</hi> out of all Nations. Now, by this effectuall power on the wils of men, doth hee performe his promises: Therefore the Psalmist, when hee speakes of Gods establishing Christs Kingdome, saith rightly,<note place="margin">Psal. 110.2, 3. Psal. 2.8.</note> 
                     <hi>The people shall bee willing in the day of thy power:</hi> and accordingly, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> having received the promise of this Seed,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.21.</note> is said to beleeve, that <hi>what God had promised hee was able to performe:</hi> Hee did not beleeve in the wils of men left free from Gods ruling and effectuall grace, that they would performe Gods promise; for indeed so hee might have beene deceived: but hee beleeved in God and his power, that hee would performe this promised Seed; and accordingly the Seed of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is borne like <hi>Isaac,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 9.7, 8.</note> by the will and power of the Promiser. And in thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving it is said, That <hi>Abraham</hi> gave glory to God. Wherefore, this being <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> faith, and this faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> giving glory to God,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.11, 34.</note> Let men first consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether they can bee the Seede of <hi>Abraham</hi> that have not this faith of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:64025:162"/>
And next, If this faith of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> give glory to God, Let men bee affraid by a different faith, even a faith in mans free will for the performance of Gods promises, to rob God of his glory. Thirdly, it gives God the glory of our prayers; for therefore wee pray unto God that his Kingdome may come, and his will may bee done, because wee beleeve that Gods effectuall grace doth set up his kingdome in our Wils, and cause them to will the Will of God. Therefore we pray to God for this doing of Gods will, which wee could not pray for to God, if God did not produce this effect: for otherwise the Free-will-prayer must run thus; Lord give mee onely such free will, that I may chuse whether I will doe thy will or no; and not, that thy will may bee certainely done. But for the certaine and sure doing of Gods will, they must pray to their owne free wils, which they beleeve doe bring the possibilitie of doing Gods will into effect. But this is many wayes abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; One abomination it is to pray to God that I may doe his will, and yet not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that God worketh the will and the deed for which I pray. Another, not to pray indeed that Gods will may bee done,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:64025:162"/>
though Christ hath commanded it, but to pray that it may not bee done, as well as bee done. For if I pray onely to God that hee may meerely leave it to my will whether his will shall bee done or not, I doe not pray certainely that his will may bee done, but that it may stand in an even ballance, whether it shall bee done or not: and then it is very possible, yea likely, (as wofull experience hath too often shewed) that his Will will not be done. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, sure it is, to God they cannot pray; but (which is another abomination) must pray to their owne wils that Gods will may bee surely done, the certainty of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods will being suspended onely on their owne wils, and not depending on Gods effectuall grace. How much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth our Liturgie imitate this patterne of Christ Jesus, and fulfill his direction? It prayes for the King,<note place="margin">

                     </note> as on the other side, it would bee a mighty accusation, if they should so beleeve free will, that they could not say the Lords prayer. Lastly, It takes from God the glory of praise and thanks for our obedience; and especially, for our differing from others: for the free-will-men cannot praise God so well as the Pharisee, who yet was not justified; for, they cannot say, <hi>Father, I thank thee that I am not like other men</hi>; but they must say, Father, I thank thee that I was like other men, and had the same free will and grace which they had; but, That I am not like other men, I thank my owne free will, which, by a different use of the same grace, wherein by thee I was made like other men, hath made mee unlike to them. To conclude, This opinion of free will, as it robs God of his glory, so it robs man
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:64025:163"/>
of his safety; for it hangs mans safety upon mans free will: God and his grace doe not keepe man, but mans free will keepes grace, and by grace keepes man; grace dependeth on the will, whether it shall bee kept it selfe, and whether it shall keepe man or lose him: But thus the will, grace, and the man are not safely <note n="a" place="margin">Natura h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

his owne hurt, and runnes against them with a sword, whose point he turns against his owne soule, and the head against our Church: For hee saith, <hi>They are rather Iewes then Christians, for not admitting the Bookes of</hi> Judith, <hi>the Maccabees, &amp;c.</hi> But the Authour endangereth himselfe in this point, to be censured as neither good Jew, nor good Christian.<note place="margin">Rom 3 1, 2.</note> For Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who was an excellent both Jew and Christian, saith, That whereas great was the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Jew, yet herein it stood chiefly, <hi>Because that unto them were committed the Oracles of God.</hi> So that if that was the chiefe preferment of the Jew under the Law and Old Testament, that the Oracles of God were committed to them; what shall we say of that Christian, that takes this chiefe preferment from them, and scandalizeth them and others for following them, even in that wherein the holy Ghost by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giveth them a chiefe prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?

that Gods Oracles were committed to the Jewes.

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:64025:167"/>
because they have no proofe for them in the Canon. If the Canon prove not prayers for the dead, being beneficiall to the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, the Papacie must make Canon, to prove prayers for the dead. For surely, if Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha had not been made Canon, there had been no Canon to prove their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphall prayer for the dead.</p>
                  <p>But now concerning the Bookes of the New Testament, the Authour hath disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered an Elephant in an Atome: <hi>Observe,</hi> saith hee, <hi>what this booke of Articles saith concerning the Canonicall Bookes of the New Testament</hi>; it saith onely this: <hi>All the bookes of the New Testament, as they are commonly received, wee doe receive, and account them for Canonicall. But why doe they not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly enumerate all the bookes which they acknowledge to be of the New Testament, as they had done them of the Old?</hi> A strange wonder, and one that deserved observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and an observation that well deserved a question: but the question scarce deserves an answer; especially seeing the Authour answers himselfe before he makes the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. For first, who doth not see, that in the bookes of the New Testament, there being no differences between us and the Romists, it was sufficient to say, That those
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:64025:168"/>
are received for Canonicall, which are commonly received?</p>
                  <p>And secondly, this Authour himselfe so farre answers his owne question before he makes it, that hee acknowledgeth, the Page fore-going, <hi>That these men have been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, out of their great grace, to admit Saint</hi> James, <hi>Saint</hi> Jude, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet now he takes a deep exception for not naming St. <hi>Iames,</hi> which is so admitted, that hee himselfe can by name say that we admit him. So it seems wee had no great depth in hiding the name of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> which our Authour, as shallow as his pen runs, did so easily find. But I confesse, I am sorry both for him and my selfe: for him, that hee is troubled with working such Cob webs; and for my selfe, that I have the labour of sweeping them away. Yet will hee needs goe on in such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious vanities: <hi>But abstracting from all these insincerities, wherewith that booke of Articles is full fraught, they doe not so much as say, that the Articles of Doctrine which they deliver are fundamentall, either all, or halfe, or any one thereof, or that they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily to be beleeved by them, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary damnable if it be beleeved by us. But they are glad to walk in a cloud for the reasons which have been already toucht.</hi> Our Author
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:64025:168"/>
commends the booke of Articles, while he calls the Insincerities of it, <hi>These Insinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>; that is, these which before have been shewed to be invisible, and no Insincerities; Insincerities only in the eye of the Author, which did cast the shape of them on the booke, when he read it.</p>
                  <p>But, saith he, <hi>They shew not which are fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, and which are not:</hi> Neither did they ever promise you that they would do so. The fundamentalls are said to be there, but no man said, for ought I know, that there it was shewed which are fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, and which are not. Your selves hold points of importance, which are more fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, and to bee explicitely knowne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and doth every Romish Councell tell you which are these points, and which are not? And if it doth not, why doe you demand it of our Church in her Synod, more then of your own? Or if you can excuse your own, why doe you quarrell with ours? It was not the intended, much lesse promised busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our Church, there to distinguish fundamentalls from superedifications; but to set downe both fundamentalls, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peredifications. And these being taught to her children, the Spirit of Christ the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, will discover the fundamentalls to
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:64025:169"/>
his members, and thereby settle them on Christ, and further build them up by the superedifications, according to their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed measure. And I have before shewed how our fundamentalls may bee discerned, though I may say somewhat like to that of our Saviour to the Jewes, <hi>Why of your selves discern ye not that which is right, and rightly fundamentall?</hi> For if you know how to find out these grounds of Christianity, which must bee explicitely knowne, which your selves acknowledge to be more fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, you may easily find out our fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls; so that all this is but an empty out-cry, to affright the Reader with noise without reason: thus to call for a designment of fundamentalls, where none was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and where in like case your selves do it not; and to quarrell with fundamentalls, which your self and yours do acknowledge. Yet when Romists have agreed of the set number themselves, let them send to us their Catalogue defined by a Synod, and it may be we may deale with them upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</p>
                  <p>The Cavalier goes on: <hi>Master</hi> Rogers <hi>indeed in the Analysis which hee makes of those nine and thirty Articles, speakes loud enough by way of taxing the Doctrine of the

And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them hee sheweth some errours of a high nature, which make Saviours of Merits and Masses, and Popish Pardons; yea, which carry the faith of the soule from

And now he calls for Fundamentals, as <hi>Goliah</hi> for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants, <hi>Give mee a man that wee may fight together</hi>; and yet a man would thinke, that one trained up in the Schoole of Rome to such an eminence, as to take him to bee her Champion and Cavalier, should so know the first grounds of Christianity, which himselfe calls more fundamentall, that hee should not make it a quarrell against us, that wee doe not teach him: Yet, before

hath beene shewed, how a man that hath not much more skill then himselfe, may ghesse with as much certainty at our funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, as at his owne Romish Explicites.

But, both in the Head and many Branches, our Church hath declared her judgement; and therein may hee and his fellowes exercise their valour, if they doe so much overflow with it, even to complaining of want of quarrels: And when they have dispatched
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:64025:172"/>
these Controversies, and quit themselves in them like Cavaliers, then let them call for more, and find fault with want of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. And now if I would answer a wise man according to his wisdome, I would use his owne words, and make them speak against himselfe and his fellowes; <hi>We are not likely to see their Romish Explicites, whereof they talke so loud, avowed by their Universities, Colledges, or Councels, &amp;c. Yea, we are not likely to see the point of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping images with</hi> Latria; <hi>nor the Popes power to depose Kings, determined by any Councell: and yet of these points Papists speak aloud, &amp; for them fill the world with Treasons against God in heaven, and Gods Deputies on earth.</hi> And I might, with very little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, adjoyne his own following words; <hi>The reason of their Reservation is plaine: for, if a Councell should bee convinced of errours, their maine Cause would receive a mortall wound.

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:64025:172"/>
the ground. But a swelling, yet most empty vanity, is that saying which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour imagineth to bee great with reason; <hi>I have heard some Catholicks affirme (and that, to my thinking, with great reason) that they would hold it to bee no ill work for them, if the pretended Colledge of Chelsey, or any other, were founded by Protestants, expresly for writing Books of Controversie by common consent.</hi> For, as I said before, Our Church by common consent hath declared her judgement in divers points of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie already named, and the Romists have here worke enough to confute, if they can, what hath beene established by common consent, <hi>Hic Rhodus, Hic saltus.</hi> This they have assayed hitherto with shame and losse; and though they lose by the quarrels they have already undertaken, yet they are not ashamed to call for more quarrels, that is, for more losse. Besides, this vanity may bee turned against themselves: For, why should not we also demand, <hi>That the Pope and his Councell should establish a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at Rome, or Rhemes, which should write Controversies by a Pseudo-Catholcik consent? which when they have done, then let them call for a Colledge from us.</hi> I wish this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour

would try to speake something a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, wherein hee might not speake against himselfe. But our Cavalier is now like a Ship drawing neere to the Harbour, and his water is still shallower and shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower: yet hath he descryed one Doctor, of whom, if hee doe not make prize, all his Adventures are lost: But what if wee disclaime the Doctor, as Master <hi>Hart</hi> did <hi>Andradius</hi> and <hi>Cajetane?</hi> then is our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour put to silence, for want of a Colledge writing with common consent: Yet saving to our selves these and the like exceptions, Let us see what hee saith; and first, take notice of the Preface, which, like a Beadle, doth usher and make way for the Doctor; <hi>On the other side, at times they make eager Invectives against us for declaring so many, yea, and all the Doctrines of our Church to bee fundamentall; so farre forth as that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever refuses obstinately to beleeve any of of them, doth forfeit the salvation of his soule. And in the strength of this zeale of theirs, Doctor</hi> Dunne, <hi>in a Sermon made before his Majesty at his first happy comming to this Crown, doth bitterly exclaime against the Catholick Roman Church, as making every toy to bee fundamentall:</hi> And can
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:64025:173"/>
you blame our Writers or Preachers to reprove you, that you will damne so many soules for toyes, yea, for errours? For herein they have God for their patterne, and your patterne is that which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in <hi>Ionah.</hi> For we, with the Father of Mercie, would save many thousand soules, who by faith in Christ the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation are united unto God, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and regeneration doe strive and endeavour to obey him. But you, imitating the fault of <hi>Ionah,</hi> for the Popes honour and supremacy, will have many thousands of such beleeving and penitent soules to be damned (who know not the right hand from the left, in many of your frivolous Doctrines) if the Pope doe affirme it: For example; If a man beleeve all the Truths in the Bible, and all those which are in the Romish Decrees, and withall lives justly, soberly, and godly; yet beleeves not, that it is unlawfull for Gossips to marry, this man must bee damned. And how may not Preachers then say to the Romists, <hi>Now walke yee not charitably, when through your vanities the brother must perish, for whom Christ died?</hi> Christ would have saved him as a foundation of salvation; but the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:64025:174"/>
new and supposititious foundation, the Pope, damneth him whom Christ would save. But the best is, hee who by a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall faith is built upon Christ the true foundation, can never be damned by unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving any Article of faith created and coined by the Pope, a counterfeit founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>And here, while the Authour doth quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with the poornesses of the Doctour, not being able to maintaine a combate with his rich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Besides, he doth not say, that it is really so done; but premising this: <hi>When
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:64025:174"/>
every thing must be called Foundation, wee shall never know where to stop, where to consist. If we should beleeve their</hi> Sacrificium incruentum, <hi>their unbloudy sacrifice in the Masse; if we did not beleeve their</hi> Sacrificium cruentum <hi>too, that there was a power in that Church to sacrifice the bloud of Kings, wee should be said to be defective in a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Article. If we should admit their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysickes, their transcendent Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, and admit their Chimiques, their Purgatory fires, and their Mythologie and Poetry, their apparitions of soules and spirits; they would bind us to their Mathematicks too, and they would not let us be saved, except we would reforme our Almanackes to their ten daies, and reforme our clockes to their foure and twenty houres; for who can tell when there is an end of Articles of faith, in an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and occasionall Religion?</hi> So the Doctour only shewes how such an unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted making of fundamentalls, may goe on in a perpetuall procession, it having already made things not so profitable as Clocks and Kalendars, Articles of faith, and points fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall: Witnesse the Service in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue, the Lords Supper without wine, &amp;c. But the Cavalier fights in earnest
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:64025:175"/>
with this supposition, and tells us, that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists doe rather governe themselves with the lesse perfect Kalendar, which now is used in this place: Yea, hee gives a morall of this their deed; letting the world see thereby how willingly we can accommodate to them in all things, which belong not meerly to Religion.</hi> The controversie of Kalendars, I leave to the Critickes of time, to bee decided and rectified in their <hi>emendatione Temporum.</hi> But the argument of accommodation, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from our Almanackes, is retorted by a greater argument remembred in our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manackes: For, when in them wee see the Papists Treason on the fifth of November, wee are thereby put in mind, that Papists doe not accommodate to Protestants in all things that belong not meerly to Religion. For it is not meerly a matter of Religion for a King to sit in Parliament; and yet the Papists would have accommodated him, by blowing him up with powder, thus sitting in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>But the Cavalier having thus spoken to ill effect, to amend the matter, brings not forth the Doctours words, but his saying to this effect: But that the Reader may be his owne guide, and the Doctour the speaker of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:64025:175"/>
his owne effect, and the Cavaliers faire carriage may more plainly appeare, I will here confront the Doctours words with the Cavaliers. The Doctours words are these: <hi>Call not superedifications, foundations; nor call not the furniture of the house, foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; call not ceremoniall and rituall things, essentiall parts of Religion, and of the worship of God, otherwise then as they imply disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: for obedience to lawfull authority is alwaies an essentiall part of Religion.</hi> The Cavalier thus repeats him, <hi>That difference in beliefe in points which are not very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, is not to prejudice a mans salvation, unlesse by not beleeving them hee commit a disobedience withall. For,</hi> saith he, <hi>obedience indeed is of the essence of Religion.</hi> I thinke that the Cavalier, seeing his face in this glasse, finds that it lookes red with blushing at the mis-reporting of the Doctour. The Doctour speakes of ceremonies, the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier reports him speaking of differences in beliefe: The Doctour speakes of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies commanded by lawfull authority; the Cavalier of points of faith, commanded by the unlawfull authority of the Pope.

Again, in respect of the different capacities of the hearers, all are not capable of every little point and subtlety of faith: and I thinke no Pope hath power to command his disciples to beleeve that, which their capacity is not able to understand. But lawfull Rites or Ceremonies, not being points of faith, but of action; and being easie to bee understood, the obedience to lawfull authority in them may more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the essence of Religion, then obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Pope in those small points of faith, wherein the Pope hath no unerring power, and no authority to make a lawfull

command; for the people doe not sinfully disobey, where the Pope hath no lawfull authority to command.</p>
                  <p>The Author having thus lost his premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and proofes, yet goes on to a conclusion, which cannot but be lost in the losse of his premisses; so that his concluding inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>This shall serve for discharge both of what they object against our unity in faith, and of what they alledge in the behalfe of theirs:</hi> And, <hi>I conceive, that I have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently secured these two maine grounds, upon which this whole discourse is turned,</hi> are but commendations of a false conception, and of a discourse, which is turned upon grounds over-turned: For neither is his first ground sufficiently secured, <hi>That there is but one true Faith, and one true Religion and Church, out of which there is no salvation</hi>; the word <hi>Out</hi> being understood in the sense of the Authour, that is, That if a man be out of the faith professed in the Church in the least haire, part, or degree, that there can bee to him no salvation. Nor more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured is his second ground, <hi>That Catholicks and Protestants cannot possibly be accounted of that one Religion, Church, and Faith.</hi> For, as it may be true that Protestants and all Catholickes doe not agree in every small
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:64025:177"/>
title and mite of faith; yet it is most true, that true Catholickes and Protestants are so entirely of one saving Faith and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they are also of one Church. And from these Catholickes, I desire not to exclude all of the Romane Diocesse: But indeed Papists, whose humane faith is grounded on the Pope, as their foundation, being ready to beleeve Idolatry, Treason, or whatsoever the Pope shall decree for a matter of faith, these I know not how to account members with us of that true Church, whereof Christ is the Head. They are not so truly Christians of Christ, as Papists of the Pope.</p>
                  <p>But still I inferre, that when the Authour hath his two grounds granted, That if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants and Papists bee not of that one Church wherein is salvation; yet Papists are uncharitable for damning Protestants who are of that Church wherein is salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; so that neither are his grounds suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently secured, neither if they were, are Papists secured sufficiently from uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse. But after his pretended sufficient securing of his grounds (either by way of supererogation, or because hee was not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of his securing) hee yet brings in more proofe, that we are of two Religions: <hi>And
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:64025:177"/>
now for the finall proofe of this last point, according even to their practice as well as ours; Let my Reader but look upon the body of their Lawes made against us, and especially upon the Preambles thereof, wherein they plentifully shew how hatefull an opinion they have of our Church; Let him looke upon the severall Acts of State which have is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued from my Lords of the Councell: Let him look upon the Proclamations which have beene made and published from time to time: Let him looke upon the large Commissions which have beene granted to Pursuivants, whereby that scumme of the world hath beene, and is enabled both to ransome and ransack us at their pleasure.</hi> Surely, thus farre there is little said, but that many of the late Traytours against the French King may take up for a proofe that they were not of one Religion with that King, because against them there issued Acts of State, Proclamations, Messengers or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suivants (though all of them perchance were not the scumme of the Countrey) to apprehend and ransack them. But hee goes farther; <hi>Let him looke upon those speeches which have beene uttered in both Houses of Parliament, not onely against Professours, but even the Profession it selfe
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:64025:178"/>
of our Religion; and how his most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Majestie hath beene importuned by their petitions to add more weight to our miseries: for thus it will easily bee scene, how false, how rotten, how superstitious, how idolatrous, how detestable, how damnable, and even destructive of all truth and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse they professe themselves to esteeme our Religion: And in fine, that wee carry such a marke of the Beast in our foreheads, as must needs, in their opinion, shut up the gates of heaven against us, and set open the gates of hell to devoure and swallow us up: So that, certainly, wee are no more of one Church with them in their opinion, then they are of one with us in ours.</hi> Here indeed hee hath many good Epithites of Popery, rotten, superstitious, idolatrous, &amp;c. but I finde one great one wanting, and that is <hi>trayterous</hi>; for this Epithite had a great share in the Parliamentary Complaints and Accusations of Popery. But, to answer his many words in few, (because they were answered in that which last preceded) wee deny not, but that which wee call Popery, and Papists call their Religion (that is, a beleeeving in the Pope, and obeying of him comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Idolatry, Treason, Rebellion, and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:64025:178"/>
whatsoever else hee shall please to decree for a point of faith) is a rotten, supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, idolatrous, and traiterous Religion; And of this it is truely said in the prayers of the fifth of November, This their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is Rebellion, <hi>their faith is faction, their practice murdering of soules and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi> But yet wee charitably hope, that there are some, though two few, who have not so bowed the knees of their soules to this <hi>Baal</hi> of Rome, that they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their soules and faiths to him in all his idolatrous and trayterous Doctrines, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and Commands; but being rather in Rome then of Rome, are Christs and not the Popes; and therefore will heare Christs voice, and not the Popes, when the Popes voice is the voice of a stranger, and an enemy to Christ.</p>

Wherefore, not to make this work tedious by unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary repetitions, I referre the Reader to
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:64025:179"/>
the former severall confutations and anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilations of the particulars, out of which he would here frame this Recapitulation: and insteed of the Authour's not inferred, but intruded Conclusion upon forlorne and vanishing premisses, this Conclusion still stands right and strong for us, that since there is but one true Church, and one sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, and the Protestants (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any of this Authours hollow, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable, and answered objections, from difference in Sacraments, Traditions, &amp;c. doe hold and beleeve this saving faith, and so are the true Church; the Papacie and adherents thereof professing a difference and division from them, so farre as to bee of another Church and faith, doe excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate themselves most heavily, even to damnation. And secondly, The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants being the true Church, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists separating themselves from us, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting us and pronouncing damnation against us, doe herein exceeding unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, while they cut off, hate, persecute, and sentence unto hell and damnation the true Church, even the living members of Christ Jesus: For indeed, Papists can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prove against us any change of the Foundation, and therefore are uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:64025:180"/>
in damning those who are lively stones, built on that onely Foundation and corner stone, Christ Jesus. But, as if Rome were not enough uncharitable, and though the Title seemed to tell us that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier would but have recapitulated his former uncharitable speeches; yet hee breakes forth into new Capitulations and Incentives of uncharitablenesse: He doubts (yea seemes to bee grieved) that some of the Romish Communion, <hi>seeing the faire and just conversation of Protestants, may grow into love with them and their Religion.</hi> But let the Cavalier upon better conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration remember, that this is not the great and most dangerous and suspicable fault of Popery, that it is so in love with Civility, that for it it neglects Religion; but that Popery hath so mightily depraved and corrupted Religion, that Popish Religion hath destroyed Civility, and fairenesse of Nature: So that, whereas Religion should have advanced men beyond naturall can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and fairenesse; Popish Religion hath destroyed this naturall fairenesse, and made them worse then men, whom true Religion would have lifted up above men, unto Saints; an evident mark that it is not a true, but a false and foule Religion: This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:64025:180"/>
plainely in those of the powder Treason; divers of which were men of candid natures, and ingenuous dispositions; yet by Popish Religion turned out of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, made worse then themselves, and brought to the acting of the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall of Treasons. A foule Religion, that doth blacke even the white of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet the Cavalier desiring, Romish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>to dye white into black,</hi> hee prescribes Antidotes, and Remedies of Love and Charity; and thus adviseth his Readers to hatred and opposition against Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants: <hi>See how Saint</hi> John <hi>carryed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe towards</hi> Cerinthus, <hi>and</hi> Policarpe <hi>to</hi> Marsyon, <hi>and Saint</hi> Anthony <hi>to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and a thousand others. And lest it should bee thought that Saints fall not foule but onely upon such Hereticks that deny even the very prime Articles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, which concerne either God the Father, or the immediate person of Christ our Lord himselfe: Cast but an eye upon Saint</hi> Bernard, <hi>that milde and mercifull man of God, and see how hee treats the Hereticks of his time, who had too much affinity with those of ours;</hi>

make them <hi>fall foule</hi> with us; but indeed, his first Presidents are impertinent, for they shew a falling foule with such as wee are not: wherefore, because his first patternes were incongruous, and would not serve the turne (those heresies of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus</hi> not belonging to us) hee leapes over many hundred yeeres of the purer times of the Church, where, it seemes, hee could not finde grounds for his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter falling foule with us, and at length comes unto the times of Popish errours and superstitions; there hee findes a good old man, one, I thinke, of the seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand which belonged to Gods Election, though not altogether without a glasse on his eyes, party-coloured by the prejudice of his birth and education in those times of superstition: This good man hee seeth angry with some of his time that deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Baptisme of infants, Prayers for the dead, and the Suffrages of Saints; the former of which did justly deserve a sharpe reproofe; and indeede, upon that hee chiefely insists in his confutation.

                     <hi>Bernard,</hi> hee shall see more just and weighty reasons to accuse his owne Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists for crimes, which draw Almighty God himselfe to fall foule with some of their chiefe limbs and members. For here hee disputes against that forbidding of marriage which defiles the Church with adulterous, incestuous, and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall sinners, whom hee calls, <hi>The mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of men</hi>; yet by Romes forbidding marriage, such monsters have been too often found among those, who yet are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Priests, Abbots, Monkes, and Friars. But yet, that this Champion may still nourish his root of wormwood and divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that the Romish palates may be still kept in distaste and loathing of us, he saith of Protestants, <hi>That they are cruell enough to such as they see not, and withall their civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and curtesie, and suavity in ordinary conversation, they can find in their Hereticall hearts at a clap to rob all dead men of the help
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:64025:182"/>
and comfort of the prayers of the living, and all living men of the prayers of the Saints, who are in heaven; and the same Saints, of all the honour which Catholickes pay to them here on earth: to omit in this place their infinite and innumerable detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and slanders, and reproaches of the whole Church of God.</hi> But here is as little verity as charity; for the three <hi>Alls,</hi> are all three un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths. For it is not true, that Protestants rob <hi>all</hi> the dead of the prayers of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: For first, those dead which are in heaven, are not robbed of prayers by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying prayers to those that are not in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but supposed to be in Purgatory. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, those prayers that belong to the dead, wee give for them; and that is, to joyne with them in their own prayers: even the prayers <hi>of the soules of Saints under the Altar.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Revel. 6.9, 10.</note> We pray that God would hasten the comming of Christ, and so their resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and their consummation in glory. And to this end, that God will hasten the judgement of the great Whore,<note place="margin">Revel. 19.1, 2.</note> which hath shed their bloud, and avenge it on her. A second untruth is this, That wee rob <hi>all</hi> living men of the prayers of the Saints in heaven; I might indeed say, that this buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:64025:182"/>
is of another stuffe, and different from the foundation, <hi>That wee are cruell to those that wee see not</hi>; for wee see those that are living: But, howsoever, it is also untrue; for wee allow and imbrace the prayers of the Saints in heaven for the living; yea, wee doubt not, but that those soules who are in the triumphant part of the Church, and perfect in charity, doe love that part of the Church which is here militant, and pray for her victory, and that it may bee joyned with her in triumphant glory. True it is, that we find not in the Scripture, that the Saints departed have such knowledge of the particular affaires of the Saints living, that wee can beleeve by a supernaturall faith that they know our necessities, our thoughts,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.23.</note> and desires. And, <hi>what is without faith being sinne,</hi> we dare not offer prayers without faith,<note place="margin">Eccles. 7.1.</note> lest they should bee turned into sinne. Thirdly, it is no lesse untrue, That wee rob Saints of <hi>all</hi> the honour which true Catholickes pay unto them. The name of the Saints is to us as a precious ointment,<note place="margin">Psal. 112.6.</note> and it is kept by us in everlasting remembrance. We delight to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their heavenly vertues, of their vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant actions, and constant passions, of their wise counsells, powerfull exhortations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:64025:183"/>
expositions of divine truths in their sayings, sermons, and writings. We desire to follow their examples, to bee instructed by their knowledge to bee inflamed with their zeale, and enlived with their heats, who quicken being dead, as the dead Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet enlived the dead souldier. These ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours we doe them, and thus should it bee done to those whom God doth honour. And if thus we doe honour them, then far from truth is it, that wee rob them of all that honour which true Catholickes pay them. And lastly, where hee speakes of infinite detractions, slanders, and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the whole Church of God; this is a most unjust, and unjustifiable slander. We reverence the whole Church of God as our Mother, we love her peace; and to this end is that which is written in the first Chapter, and to this end are these lines, which write against this slander. Wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach not the whole Church; but a botch, a wen, a disease, and burthen in the Church: A faction, that disturbs and distracts the Church; and which, to set up a counterfeit head, teares the true body of Christ into pieces: And this seemes also to bee the businesse of this Champion in this worke; and even at this time, when by unjust accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations

hee both perswades to uncharitable divisions, and strives by his clamours to terrifie soules into the net of the Papacie. But this Champion, while hee liveth, will never be able to prove, that the Papacy (or the Pope and his faction) is the Church: And yet, untill he prove this, all his booke is but a carkasse, meere dead paper, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out strength and life: In the meane time, they are most guilty of detractions, slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and reproaches of the whole Church of God, that lay the title of damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes or Schismatickes on all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the whole Catholick Church, that are not subject unto the <hi>Man of sinne, which sits as God in the Temple of God.</hi>

that at parting hee may flatter the taste of his Reader with a farewell of sweetnesse, he puts this sugar to it: <hi>All which I have not said either by way of aggravating their sinnes, or of alienating men from their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which I esteeme and love, and desire to serve with my whole heart.</hi> If the Reader will make a due conjunction of this with the former, and make a right construction of the whole, he may see it runne into this confusednesse, <hi>The Romish faction must bee rigorous to Protestants, and avoid them, as Saint</hi> John <hi>did</hi> Cerinthus, &amp;c. <hi>Yea, they must fall foule upon them, though holding lesser heresies, and call them Dogs; they must take them for cruell Robbers of the living and the dead, for slanderers and detracters, and all this is well done, and may bee done without being alienated from their persons.</hi> But doth this Authour thinke that there will bee a <hi>separation, a falling foule,</hi> and an <hi>accounting of us for Dogs without alienating of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from our persons?</hi> Or would hee have such a not alienating from our persons, as, upon meeting with us, to part presently from us, or to fall foule upon us, and to call us Dogs? Surely, whatsoever this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour afterwards speakes of his intent, his former words teach such a separation, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:64025:184"/>
and hatred, that these later words doe not take them away; but onely make a faire shew by a mannerly distinction, teaching a counterfeit art of falling foule upon men, without being alienated from their persons. But will any wise man thinke it a charitable speech, if <hi>Catesby</hi> should say unto <hi>Faulx, Be not alienated from the person of the King, nor of his royall issue, nor of the Nobility,</hi> but onely fall foule upon them, and blow them up with gun powder? As for that following profession towards their persons so diversly expressed, <hi>which I esteeme, and love, and desire to serve with my whole heart,</hi> I acknowledge them to be faire words, and of a very good countenance: But perchance, by some other way there might have been given to a doubtfull Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der more solid satisfaction. For a scrupulous Reader may possibly say, that these words by Travellers are vented often but as the froth of complement, and by Romists are often eluded by a latent equivocation, or mentall reservation, and may now bee doubted, because they doe come in suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously with very bad company; even as attendants on exhortations and incentives, to separate from Protestants, to esteeme them as Dogs, and to fall foule upon them;
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:64025:185"/>

                  <p>As for his good intent, in shewing us what Heresie is, and how odious, we thank him for it, and doe make this use of it, That because Heresie is so odious, therefore we abhorre the Papacy, which hath in it sundry Heresies, Idolatries, and Doctrines of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, and is not the Church, but a faction in the Church; and desire by grace to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue true and lively members of the Church, truly Catholick, consisting of all Kinreds, Tribes, and Nations over the face of the whole earth, whereof Christ Jesus is the onely and unquestionable Head.

And what cause had the Venetians given of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, when their Restitution without penance shewes plainely, that they were without cause excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? And what cause had the Pope for
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:64025:192"/>
excommunicating Queene <hi>Elisabeth,</hi> and giving away her Kingdome? And whereas you say, Shee proceeds not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them as against Traytors to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or States; This is so true, that I cannot confute it. But to make your truth yet more true, I must also add this, That your Papacy proceeds against Protestants, because they will not bee Traytors to Princes or States; as appeares by the penance of the Irish Pilgrime formerly mentioned; and by the Bull of <hi>Pius quintus,</hi> where hee curseth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicateth those subjects that will not bee Traytors to their Soveraigne: And indeed, by that Bull the Papists themselves were exceedingly troubled betweene two feares; one of being tyed with the cords of this excommunication for want of Treason; and another, of being tyed up for Treason, in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Excommunication: Which griefe, with the remedy thereof, I finde thus described by Master <hi>Hart,</hi> a not unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Romist;<note place="margin">Execution of Iustice, pag. 16, 17.</note> 
                     <hi>The Bull of</hi> Pius quintus <hi>(for so much of it as is against the Queene) is holden among the English Catholicks for a lawfull sentence, and a sufficient dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of her subjects fidelity, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:64025:192"/>
in force; but in some points tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Subjects, it is altered by the present Pope. For, where in that Bull all her subjects are commanded not to obey her, and shee being excommunicated and deposed, all that doe obey her are likewise innodate and accursed; which point is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous to the Catholicks: for if they obey her, they bee in the Popes curse; and if they disobey her, they are in the Queenes danger: therefore the present Pope, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them, hath altered that part of the Bull, and dispensed with them to obey and serve her without perill of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; which Dispensation is to endure but till it please the Pope otherwise to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whereas this Authour saith, That <hi>the guilty consciences of Protestants make them not dare to punish Priests capitally, as for a corrupt Religion</hi>; I leave it to the wisdome of State to consider how farre such an imputation of guilt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to bee removed.

For, that many Priests have been actuall Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, our Chronicles too plentifully shew; and their owne <note n="b" place="margin">I hold dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative part, <hi>scil.</hi> That both her Majesties laws and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all sorts of Catholicks have bin milde and mercifull. <hi>Watson Quodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.</hi> 8. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.

                     </note> Pens have witnessed to the world the justice of our Lawes, even against those Priests who have not bin ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in actuall Treason. And now that this Authour may help us (as hee usually doth) towards his owne confutation, hee giveth us a sentence that is a sword for the slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his owne <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi>: His words are these; <hi>As the Catholick Church is most perfectly charitable, so withall shee thinkes shee cannot expresse the vertue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then by clearely distinguishing betweene truth and falshood, and by exhorting men to imbrace the one, and to avoid the other: so far off is she from demeriting by letting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants know, that if they dye impenitent in that Religion, they lose their soules.</hi> Here is that truth which I told him long since, and which hath already served to overthrow a great part of his former discourse; <hi>That Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity cannot be better expressed then by clearly distinguishing between truth and fashood, and by exhorting men to imbrace the one, and to
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:64025:194"/>
avoyd the other.</hi> For, herein doe the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists exceedingly offend against Charity, and can hardly better expresse the contrary (Uncharitablenesse) then by putting truth into place of falsehood, and by exhorting men to imbrace falsehood, and to avoyd truth. And untill the Authour hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved this mistaking, our Accusation of Romish uncharitablenesse still stands on foote, and his owne plea for Rome lyes still unproved: And Rome though very meritorious, yet doth much deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yea, sinne against Charity, for falsly telling Protestants, That they lose their soules if they dye impenitent in a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Authour having lost, or rather given away his cause in the premisses of his discourse, the conclusion sutable to such losing premisses should have been a meere surrender: and accordingly he should have said, <hi>That, notwithstanding all improbabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it is very probable that Romists want charity to Protestants, when they take them
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:64025:195"/>
for odious persons, fall foule on them, blow them up, burne them, and damne them.</hi> And secondly, That though it be true that there is but one Church, and one Faith, wherein is salvation: yet Protestants being of this one Church, and having this Faith, and so being in the way of salvation, it is not an untruth but a truth, that they want charity who hate and damne the Protestants which are saved.</p>
                  <p>Yet our Authour goes on like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and to him (as to <hi>Pharaoh</hi>) may be said, <hi>Knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?</hi> Doth he not know the citie, which is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually Egypt and Sodome, is going to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction? and the probabilities and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are dead, by which (as by garisons) this Egypt is maintained and defended? Wherefore it were good, that both he and Rome would <hi>let the men goe, that they may serve the Lord their God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Rome still goes on in her purpose of holding the Church in bondage; yea, shee sends forth Souldiers and Cavaliers to fetch back those who are gone out from her yoke, whereof this Champion is one. And now, that the sonnes of Rome may imitate the infirmities of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in especially their Fathers are his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:64025:195"/>
hee comes with a piece of that pitie wherewith Saint <hi>Peter</hi> would have Christ to have pitied himselfe; but so, that (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pitie) hee should have lost the salvation of the whole world; so would this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour have Protestants to pity themselves, even to the danger of their salvation; and by a deadly Apostacie to turne from the living God to Romish Idolatry: But hee doubts his pitie will prove but a sleight and empty perswasion, and therefore to a vaine pitie hee addeth some reasons which want nothing more then truth to make them forcible; Hee saith, <hi>That Protestant do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> (under his false Title of heresie) <hi>is a Nursery of corrupt principles concerning life:</hi> and when hee hath said it, hee brings (as hee is wont) proofes that do not prove it; yet thus hee begins even in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion; <hi>When they teach men that there is no merit belonging to good workes (though they bee confess'd by us to flow but from the grace and goodnesse of Christ our Lord) what courage doe they give men to bee frequent and chearfull in doing of good works?</hi> But is not this speech unworthy of a noble Cavalier, much more of a Christian? For, were it not ignoble in a Knight, when his Father commands him to doe some valiant service
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:64025:196"/>
for his honour or defence, to answer him, hee hath no courage to doe him service, because thereby he cannot merit any thing from him, seeing hee oweth all his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and himselfe unto him? Thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Father hath deserved all, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee will doe nothing. Againe, If a Father should tell his Sonne, Doe what thou canst to please mee; or as <hi>Isaac, Goe kill mee some venison,</hi> and I will freely give thee a blessing, though the venison deserve it not: should the Son wisely returne this answer to his Father, Sir, I have no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement by your free promise or gift of this blessing, except I can merit it from you by my venison? But ingenuous Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, Saints, and Sonnes of God, whose understandings and wils are truely enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the Divine Spirit, are farre of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other minde; they have indeed the divine gift of Love, and thereby love God as a Father, that hath already so merited of them all that they are and have, that his merit is to them a most sufficient motive to serve him heartily, even with all that might and being which they have received from him.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly, the man according to Gods owne heart calls upon all mankinde

                     <hi>Come let us kneele and worship before God our Maker.</hi> Againe, the love of God in redeeming us hath deserved all our love and service; and accordingly the Apostle rap'd into the third heaven, saith, <hi>The love of Christ constraineth us:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.14.2.15.</note> and why doth it constraine? <hi>because wee thus judge, that if Christ dyed for us, wee should live to him.</hi> Gods merits in creating and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming us are strong motives to serve him, though wee cannot merit of him: though Gods merit is so great, that it hath swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up all our merits; we are therefore to serve him not the lesse, but the more, the more hee hath deserved beyond our requitall. A good Sonne would serve and obey this heavenly Father for that which hee hath done, though hee gave him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hereafter. And surely, if there were not such an affection even in humanitie, how should thee sonne of a poore father ever doe him service? But yet wee doe not stop here, because the bounty of our heavenly Father doth not stop, but enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it selfe further; for though God hath already deserved of us all that we can doe, so that all that wee can doe were but our dutie: yet hee goes on, and promiseth to
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:64025:197"/>
give rewards even for doing our duty: And doth not this reward move us as much, being given by free promise, as if it were gotten by the workers merit? yea, much more in a noble worker: For, such a one will reason thus; My heavenly Father freely gives mee infinite rewards, even an excessively exceeding weight of glory for small and moment any passions and actions;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.17.</note> hee gives mee that which hee is not bound to give, hee gives that which I can never deserve; and shall I not couragiously and affectionately serve him who is so freely gracious and bountifull to mee far beyond my deserts? But indeed, much rather (and that contrary to Romish Divinity) out of a right consideration of Gods great rewards, and our great unworthinesse, (wee being, if <hi>Iacob</hi> say true,<note place="margin">Gen. 32.10.</note> 
                     <hi>lesse then the least of Gods mercies</hi>) wee may truely affirme, That we can have no courage to good workes, if wee will not worke without a true confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Merits:<note place="margin">Gen. 15.1.</note> For, if Gods rewards be beyond all merits (as it needes must bee, since hee himselfe, whom all that we have and are cannot merit, is our exceeding great reward) how should there bee good works raised from the confidence in that merit which is not? And though there be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:64025:197"/>
in the grace of the Spirit by which wee worke; yet even that grace is a free loane, and wee are debters to God for it, and how can wee merit of him by grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in debt unto him? especially, because the money wherewith we should pay those debts is of a baser Alloy, by the mixture of our corruption, then that which wee received, and whereby wee became debtors?

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:64025:201"/>
wherein with the new man begotten by grace, there is left a remnant of the old man begotten by nature, doth not lessen the power of Gods grace, but sets forth the wisdome of Gods dispensation. God, whose Spirit bloweth where, and how hee listeth, for many wise ends, and especially for his owne glory, dispenseth his grace in this manner, and measure, and mixture. For first, the corruption remaining with grace, doth humble man before God, and cause him to have a low conceipt of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and an high estimation of Gods grace, of which hee hath continuall need; the sufficiency whereof alone can forgive his falls, and raise him from falling, and enable him to stand, and walke in the pathes of holinesse in such a manner as the same grace will accept. Secondly, This life being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the Church militant for a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and the warfare for a way to the Crowne; this contrariety of the flesh to the spirit is not the least part of this warre; and to those that fight the good fight of faith, it serves for a way of advancement to the Crowne: For, the more combates of the flesh, the more conquests of the spirit, and so the greater enjoyings of the celestiall Crowne. And thirdly, God is
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:64025:202"/>
mightily glorified, who by a little grace, even a graine of mustard-seed, opposed by a strong concupiscence, and that backed by a world of tentations, and by those Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which are Principalities and Powers, (though through many foyles, faintings, and failings) the little graine becomes a tree, the smoking flaxe becomes a fire, and judgement is brought to victory. Though wee lose in some single combats, yet wee are gainers in the whole warre, and wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>more then Conquerours through him that loveth us.</hi> And indeed, this growing nature of the seed of grace, and especially the victorious successe which Gods grace giveth to it, is a most strong encouragement to good works; even such as all objected imperfection of righteousnesse can never overthrow: for, though it bee so little, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at first in the beginning of it, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance after in some spirituall desertions, (for there are ebbs and flouds of grace) yet wee are mightily encouraged to good workes, because that seed is not onely a remaining, but a growing seed; the house of <hi>Saul</hi> growes weaker, and the house of <hi>David</hi> stronger: wee come still neerer to perfection, though wee doe not fully attaine it; wee grow from babes to young
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:64025:202"/>
men, from young men to that measure of stature which is appointed to us in Christ Jesus. Lastly, our state of imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction doth serve for an incentive, to spur up our desires towards the state of perfection: For, when wee draw up hardly and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully towards Gods holy mountaine, with a weight of flesh pressing downe, and a body of sinne cleaving fast, wee pant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven, and send up grones of the Spirit, which speake in their language; <hi>when shall wee come and appeare before God? Wee desire to bee delivered from the body of sinne, unto the glorious liberty of the sonnes of God:</hi> our soules being wearied, and parched, and dryed up with the flames and vexations of tentations and sinnes, thirst for the living God, and desire to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their thirst in the River of pleasures, which floweth from his presence, whose streames are perfect holinesse, and perfect happinesse.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>That the doctrine of denying free will doth not abridge the doing of good, and justice of punishment for evill doing.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THere is yet one question more, which must have an answer, rather for some weakenesse which it may meet, then for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny strength which is in it, <hi>When they profess that men have not so much as free will to doe any good work at all, when they are first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and assisted to it by the good grace of God, with what sense can they encourage men to do any thing which is good? or with what justice can they punish them for omitting the same?</hi> The Cavalier is deceived himselfe, as it seems, and goes about to deliver over his deceipt unto his Reader; For, we doe not say, <hi>That men have not so much as free will,</hi> being moved by effectuall grace; But, <hi>That they have not so little as free will</hi>: For, wee hold, that the will being moved effectually by grace, is more then free will; for it is free will fortified, actuated, and animated by grace. So his Reader is deceived by him, if he be perswaded by these words, that wee doe not allow men actuated by grace so much as free will; for we allow them more.
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:64025:203"/>
And indeed, wee allow them much more then Romists, and they quarrell with us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wee allow them so much: Yet the more power and efficacy we allow grace in the will, the lesse efficacy hath the Cavaliers objection; but the more encouragement have men to good works: For the more God helpeth the will, the more couragious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may the will go on to working; and the more may exhortation call for good works. Indeed, if God did not worke in us to will and to do, but left man to stand only on the motion of his own will, exhortations might have but a cold encouragement, standing meerly at the mercy of the creature for successe and effect. But when God gives what he commands, then may exhortations call for the performance of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                  <p>As for humane justice in punishing, hee may know that our opinion doth not oppose but approve it. For even your own <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>BUt here I may give this returne to the Romists: Upon the love of God and man depends the whole Law; And in the love of God a principall place is given to the worship of God in spirit and truth: And in the love of man a chiefe place is given to the preservation of his life.

but I especially fasten on these two, whose eminent guilt is haunted with the continuall out-cry of the Prophets, and at length avenged with heavie judgements by the Judge of the whole earth: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, commonly these sins are twins, the same evil spirit first working by idolatry, as it were a not being of God in the faith and worship of man, and then provoking man to destroy the Image of that God whom he hath formerly abolished. But most fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sinnes they are, and their hideousnesse may be seen in the horrid face of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which have beene the counterparts and representations of them. He that would behold painted unto the life the lamentable countenance of these judgements, let him with an heart of life and sense read over the Lamentations of <hi>Ieremy</hi>;<note place="margin">Lam. 4.13.</note> And he that will see Idols and bloud to have been the maine meritorious causes of these judgements, let him reade the words both of other <note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 25.4, 5, 6. &amp;c. 2 King. 17.13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 2 King. 21.10, 11, 12, 13, 16. 2 Chr. 36.14, 15, 16.
