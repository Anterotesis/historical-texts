            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O all dispersed sorts of ARTS and TRADES,</l>
               <l>I write the Needles praise (that neuer fades)</l>
               <l>So long as Children shall be got or borne,</l>
               <l>So long as Garments shall be made, or worne,</l>
               <l>So long as Hemp or Flax, or Sheepe shall beare</l>
               <l>Their linnen-woollen fleeces yeare by yeare;</l>
               <l>So long as Silk-worms, with exhausted spoyle</l>
               <l>Of their owne Entrailes, for mans gaine shall toyle:</l>
               <l>Yea, till the world be quite dissolu'd and past;</l>
               <l>So long at least, the Needles vse shall last,</l>
               <l>And though from Earth, his being did begin,</l>
               <l>Yet through the fire he did his honour win:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:27975:3"/>
And vnto those that doe his seruice lacke,</l>
               <l>Hee's true as steele, and mettle to the backe.</l>
               <l>He hath I perse eye, small single sight,</l>
               <l>Yet like a Pigmey; <hi>Polipheame</hi> in fight:</l>
               <l>As a stout Captaine, brauely he leades on,</l>
               <l>(Not fearing colours) till the worke be done.</l>
               <l>Through thicke and thinne he is most sharpely set,</l>
               <l>With speede through stitch, hee will the Conquest get.</l>
               <l>And as a Soldier (Frenchefyde with heate)</l>
               <l>Maim'd, from the warres is forc'd to make retreate:</l>
               <l>So when a Needles point is broke, and gone,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>No poynt Mounsier,</hi> hee's maim'd, his worke is done.</l>
               <l>And more the Needles honour to aduance,</l>
               <l>It is a Taylors Iauelin, or his Launce.</l>
               <l>And for my Countries quiet, I should like,</l>
               <l>That Women-kinde should vse no other Pike.</l>
               <l>It will increase their peace, enlarge their store,</l>
               <l>To vse their tongues lesse, and their Needles more.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:27975:3"/>
The Needles sharpenesse, profit yeelds, and pleasure,</l>
               <l>But sharpenesse of the tongue, bites out of measure.</l>
               <l>A Needle (though it be but small and slender)</l>
               <l>Yet is it both a maker and a mender;</l>
               <l>A graue Reformer of old Rents decayde,</l>
               <l>Stops holes and seames, and desperate cuts displayde.</l>
               <l>And thus without the Needle we may see,</l>
               <l>We should without our Bibbs and Biggings be;</l>
               <l>No shirts or smockes, our nakednesse to hide,</l>
               <l>No Garments gay, to make vs magnifyde;</l>
               <l>No Shadowes, Shapparoones, Caules, Bands, Ruffes, Cuffes,</l>
               <l>No Kerchiefes, Quoyfes, Chin-clowtes, or marry-Muffes,</l>
               <l>No Cros-cloathes, Aprons, Hand-kerchiefes, or Falls,</l>
               <l>No Table-cloathes for Parlours or for Halls.</l>
               <l>No Sheetes, no Towels, Napkins, Pillow-beares,</l>
               <l>Nor any Garment man or woman weares.</l>
               <l>Thus is a Needle prou'd an Instrument</l>
               <l>Of profit, pleasure, and of ornament:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:27975:4"/>
Which mighty Queenes haue grac'd in hand to take,</l>

               <l>The Needles Art, they to their children show.</l>
               <l>And as 'twas then an exercise of praise,</l>
               <l>So what deserues more honour in these daies,</l>
               <l>Then this? which daily doth it selfe expresse,</l>
