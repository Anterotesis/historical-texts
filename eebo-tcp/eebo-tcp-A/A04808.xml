            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And so it came to passe by the good prouidence of God, that on wednesday, being the 17. day of this

moneth of Ianuary. I preached at Bla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Forum, in the Countie of Dorset, at the Session holden there, where both the honorable, and many of the worshipfull, which harde me, tooke my simple trauels in very good part, as both then, and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence I haue well perceiued. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, sundry, not onely of the multitude, but some of higher calling so much misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked my sayd Sermon, that they thought I spake somwhat more then became me, but yet I prayse God that those which take the matter most greuously, are but potte companions, who thinke that I haue done them an exceeding great miu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for that I opened to the Magistrates, how shamefully the Saboth day (which God would haue to be kept holy) was prophaned with druncken and vngodly reueling, and all kinde of iniquitie, in so much that some are cast, (I know not how,) into such a heate therewith, that it seemeth, they want but the chaynge and turne of tyme, to put me in a greater heat then they themselues would be in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, who also by their sinistrall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes of my Sermon, would very faine cause others which heard me not, to be of their owne corrupt, and peruerse iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. I haue therefore thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
<pb facs="tcp:7026:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and not without aduise &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faile, to call to my remembraunce my sayd Sermon, and to commit the same to writing (and to the iudgements of the godly) wherin I haue vsed such dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce if I be not much deceaued, that such as heard it shal finde not very many things added, but yet lesse left out or omitted, certenly, to my knowledge not one sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>And now (right honorable) if I should follow that laudable custome of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which commonly do dedicate their works to such personages as they thinke to be most worthy, and to such as be of honour, or worship, beyng desirous to further vertue, and the sincere religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iesus Christ, with the fauourers of the same: To whom should I dedicate these my poore simple trauels but to your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who being not onely my especiall good maister and Lorde, as full oft I haue felte, but also vnder God and the Queenes Maiestie, one of my chiefe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectours and defenders agaynst all such as would offer me iniury?</p>
            <p>And although I should laye a part all those respectes, yet (my case standing as it doth) I know not to whome by better right I should dedicate this my Sermon

then to your honour, who among many other, both honorable and worshipfull ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> witnes with me, that for the tyme I was with you in Newhauen the minister and preacher there, and also this last yeare with you in the North partes, one of the preachers of the Queenes Maiesties ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, I vsed at both places, when occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was offered to speake plainely before your honor and the rest, and yet not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting I trust, before whome I spake, yea and when I sawe that great necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie so required, and that duetie draue me thereto, I practised (your honour well knoweth) a certeyne kind of discipline, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon those, that by birth and paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage were farre aboue me.

The first is that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can be excused before God by ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, though he haue not heard the word. The 2. is, that where the word hath sounded, there can no man haue<note place="margin">No cloke where the Gospell is preached.</note> a cloke for his sinne. The thyrd &amp; last note is to shewe you what startyng holes the wicked haue to auoyde their sinne, and what shiftes they haue to put theyr sinnes to other, or to escape pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for sinne, thoughe to their owne confusion. But that I may haue grace so to entreate of these thinges as may be to the glory of God, and to the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of such as are present, I shall desire you that we all may ioyne

            <p>The first thing I wished you to obserue vpon this first argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ, was this, that ignoraunce should excuse no man before the iudgement seate of Christ, which assertion although it may be confirmed by many places of the scriptures, yet one or two places I trust may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at this present.

not put Iustice to silence. That same that is written of <hi>Domitian</hi> and <hi>Nerua,</hi> can not to oft be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to memorie. It is doubted whether the cruelty of the one, or foolish pity of the other, did more harme in the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth.

            <p>To conclude this second part, if Papistes, rebels, magistrates, ministers, &amp;c. can not be excused by ignoraunce, as ye heard in the first part, how much more vaine shall y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> excuses of such be, as haue heard the worde, and that Christ out of hys scriptures, and out of the mouthes of his ministers so often tymes haue spoken vnto

            <p>But now it is tyme that I<note place="margin">The thyrd note.</note> come to the third and last parte, and so an ende. Our Sauiour Christ knew how necessary it was to take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vnbeleuing Iewes all excuse, and that they might haue nothing to cloke &amp; to couler their sinne, for he was not ignoraunt how prone man was to sinne, and yet how harde a thyng it was to make hym con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse his sinne, how readie he would be to laye hys sinne vpon others fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himselfe, what clokes

he would haue to couler his sin,<note place="margin">Mans cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng and confessyng his sinne.</note> &amp; what starting holes to auoyde the punishment for his sinne. If ye will learne how harde it was to make the Iewes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse their sinne, read y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 8. of S. Ioh. where<note place="margin">Iohn. 8.</note> you may see, how stoutely they stoode to the iustifiyng of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. And when Christ at the iudgement shall charge the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that when he was hungry, they gaue hym no meate. &amp;c. They shall aske hym when they<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 44.</note> sawe him hungry, or thyrsty, and did not geue hym, as though Christ vniustly charged them.</p>
            <p>But if the fault be so euident, that it cannot be auoyded, yet will we couer &amp; hide our selues wyth figge leaues, and in the wods, as did our father Adam before vs, who, when God asked
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7026:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him whether he had eaten of the forbidden fruite, and that the thickets coulde no longer hide hym, yet he could be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented to laye the faulte to the woman, so<note place="margin">Gene. 3.</note> well as he loued her. And when God asked the like question of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woman, she posted it of, to the Serpent, and coulde not abyde that the faulte shoulde rest vpon herselfe.</p>
            <p>The most parte of men (and<note place="margin">The grace of Papistes in postyng their faults euer vnto others.</note> especially the Papistes) haue a singuler grace in thys, to shift of faultes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> themselues to others, and such as accuse them. And in very deede it is in all places a thyng to common. Let honest men vpon their othes, present great crymes, eyther before the temporall Magistrate, or the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall officer, it is oft tymes sene
<pb facs="tcp:7026:18"/>
that the offenders goe away lesse discouraged, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent them. What encourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are these to farther iustice, when matters passe so slenderly?</p>
            <p>There was of late a papistical Prelate of thys shyre, who in the<note place="margin">Such fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes would bee had in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce.</note> Pulpit cast out these, or such like wordes in effect: that where me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> merueyled he spake no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the Pope, he did them to vnderstand, that he knewe no hurt by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pope, if he were a good man, he prayed God to continue him in his goodnesse, if he were an ill man, he prayed God to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend hym.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7026:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a notable storie concernyng the the multitude, or number of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and how some tyme they are to be suspected.</p>
            <p>There was within my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce a Minister of this shyre, who vnderstandyng what great disorders there were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly at these Church Ales vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Saboth day, required his flock committed to his charge (as hee was preachyng vnto them) both in Gods name, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Queenes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties name, and the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenauntes name of the countrey, that they should not assemble the people together, to offende God by theyr vngodly behauiours, but rather geue them selues vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Sabboth day to serue God, accordyng to their duties. The people could in no wise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb facs="tcp:7026:20"/>
with this exhortation, but certaine of them, went to the Iustices to desire licence for the commyng together of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Sondry of the Iustices both godly and wisely denyed them. At le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ght one Iustice they founde who for good considerations (as he thought) gaue them a licence for certaine dayes I may not say to commit disorders, for we may well thinke no Iustice would be so vndiscret, but they abused hys authoritie. The Minister seyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great disorders in hys Parish, the next Sabboth day after they had obtained licence, wrote to the Iustice of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> same, and wrote nothyng but that he will yet sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to. The Iustice called those that had abused hys authoritie and reproued them, but now ye shall see the multitude.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:7026:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>There were (by the Iustices report) 36. whiche offred vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym theyr names (which was as much to saye, as that they would haue periured them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, if the Iustice would haue put them to their othes) to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie agaynst the Minister, that where he complayned of disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrarie affirmed, that there was no disorder at all. And yet it was manifest that the same Sabboth day was shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prophaned, with bulbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynges, boulynges, drunkennes, dauncynges, and such lyke, in so much as men could not keepe theyr seruauntes frome lyinge out of theyr owne houses the same Sabboth day at night, but yet in the Iudgementes of. 36. (or there about) there was no hurt, nor disorder at al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:7026:21"/>This I haue opened vnto you, to the ende ye may see what credit is some tyme to be geuen to the multitude, if it be a matter with toucheth the glory of God. But if ye will credite the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, I will shewe how ye may trust, and credite them without an othe, and not to be deceaued. Where as the Queenes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie in the begynnyng of her raigne, commaunded and gaue charge, that the Clergie should so playnely read the Scriptures that the people might be edified; and that the people should so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently heare the word of God, that they might make their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of the same: if we should sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the case that a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement had then bene ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but by some meane officer, that the old popish Priests (who

for lyuyng sake remayne still in their benefices) should so mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble out theyr seruice that none might vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d them, or where there are some whiche can read playnly, there the multitude to be so negligent in hearyng, that they haue for these xij. yeres, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned nothyng, no not the Lordes prayer in Englishe, if the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude would proteste before you both of popish Priestes, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they had folowed and obserued this contrarye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, assuredly ye might credite them, for neither do a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Popish Clergy so read, that the people may vnderstand them, neither do the people make their profite of that whiche they heare, where it is playnely read vnto them. Or, where as the Queenes Maiestie gaue charge

in the begynnyng of her raigne,<note place="margin">Disobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t are they that deface not all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numentes of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</note> that all monumentes of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie should be defaced, if but a very meane officer had then ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen a contrarye commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that both the Popishe Priestes, and Popishe people, should hide these monumentes of Idolatrie in theyr houses, and secrete places, in hope of that day they looke and long for, ye might beleue them that they had obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this contrary commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with all diligence as it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably falleth out at this present in prooffe.</p>
            <p>But in touchyng the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy of the multitude, I except such among them as feare God, who notwithstandyng be very few compared to the rest.</p>
            <p>

            <p>When the Iewes were so conuinced in theyr consciences, that they could not put of theyr sinne, and turne it to others, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they deuised a pretie tricke to<note place="margin">An other vsual tricke of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes.</note> quyte them selues, whiche was to make God (as it were) theyr feede man. And for the synnes they daylie committed, they would be very busie in offryng Sacrifices, and exercisyng them selues in Ceremonies, thynkyng by the very worke wrought, to bynde God to pardon theyr of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. A lyke kynde of policie was practised by the Papistes in
<pb facs="tcp:7026:23"/>
the tyme of Poperie to bynde GOD to forgeue them theyr sinnes. For where as in the tyme of Christmasse, the disorders were meruelous in those dayes, (and how it is now God seeth) at Candlemasse, whiche some counte the ende of Christmasse, the papistes would be euen with God, by that tyme they had offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hym a bribe, and such a bribe (beyng a candle or taper) as a very meane officer, would take foule scorne of, though he could do a man but small pleasure in his sute.</p>
            <p>Shroft Twesday was a day of great glottonie, surffeting, &amp; dronkennes, but by Ashe Wens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day at night, they thought God to be in their debt. On Goodfri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, they offered vnto Christe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7026:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
egges, and bacon to be in hys fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour till Easter day was past. The sinnes committed betwene Easter, and Whytsontyde they were fullye discharged by the pleasaunt walkes, and processi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the rogyng, I should say, Rogation Weeke. What offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces soeuer happened from that tyme to Midsommer, the fumes of the Friers dedicated to Iohn, Peter, and Thomas Becket the traytor, consumed them. And as for all disorders from that tyme to the begynnyng of Christmasse agayne, they were in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey all roonge away, vpon all Hallounday and all Soules day at night last past.</p>
            <p>But bicause the Iewes dyd so shamefully abuse the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and other Ceremonies
<pb facs="tcp:7026:24"/>
whiche were ordeyned to put them in mynde of the promised seede to come, therefore he reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth them, and sayth vnto them<note place="margin">Esay. 1. 11. and 12. 13.</note> in the first of Esay. <hi>What haue I to do with the multitude of your Sacrifices?

Papistes, who requireth these thynges at your handes whiche I neuer commaunded, as your candles at Candlemasse, your Popishe penaunce on Ashewens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, your egges, and bacon on Goodfriday, your Gospelles at superstitious crosses, decked lyke Idols, your fires at Midsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, &amp; your ringyng at Allhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lountide for all Christian soules?

            <p>But as the Iewes thought them selues by these their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses sure inoughe touchyng the sauegard of their soules: So had they an other shift in a readynes to auoyde suche daungers as might come towardes their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes,

in offendyng the politique lawes, whiche was to bribe the Officers, Rulers, and Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and to corrupt them with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes. And in dede the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures affirme that bribes are of that strength, that they blynd the wise. And that the Rulers of the Iewes, were geuen much to take bribes, is manifest by all the Prophetes, especially in Esay<note place="margin">Esay. 1. 23.</note> the first where God sayth. <hi>Thy rulers are companions of theeues, euery one loueth giftes, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth after rewardes, they iudge not the fatherles, neither doth the widdowes cause come before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> The very heathen dyd abhorre this bribyng, as may appeare by <hi>Cambises Cyrus</hi> sonne, who<note place="margin">Cambises the sonne of Cyrus.</note> though he were a wicked kyng yet he thought it a very semely sight that a brybyng Iudges

            <p>Wherfore, if such as be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth would assaye to corrupt those that be in office, and authority, by their bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes and rewardes to escape con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne punishment: Such as be officers should vse to aunswere them as GOD aunswered the Iewes, saying: <hi>Who requireth these thynges at your handes?</hi> So should officers say to offendours, who required these bribes at your handes? God sayd to the Iewes, will I eate the fleshe of
