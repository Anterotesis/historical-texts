         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <q>Thou haſt greedily gained of thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
by <hi>Extortion,</hi> and haſt forgotten me, ſaith the Lord God: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
therefore, I have ſmitten my hand at thy <hi>diſhonest gain,</hi> and <hi>at
thy Bloud,</hi> which hath <hi>been ſhed</hi> in the midſt of thee. Her <hi>Princes</hi> in the
midſt of thee, are like <hi>Wolves</hi> ravening the <hi>Prey to ſhed bloud,</hi> and to
<hi>deſtroy Souls,</hi> to get DISHONEST GAIN: The people of the
Land have uſed OPPRESSION, &amp; EXERCISED ROBBERY,
and have VEXED THE POOR &amp; NEEDY; yea, they have OP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRESSED
THE STRANGER WRONGFULLY. And I ſought
for A MAN among them, that ſhould make up the Hedg, and ſtand
in the gap before me for the Land, that I ſhould not deſtroy it: but I
found none: Therefore have I poured out my indignation upon them,
I have conſumed them with the Fire of my Wrath, their own way
have I recompenced on their heads, ſaith the Lord God.</q>

            <p>WE read in the 2 <hi>Sam. 23. 1, 3. That theſe were the
laſt words of</hi> David, <hi>the man</hi> WHO WAS RAI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SED
UP ON HIGH, THE ANOYNTED
OF THE GOD OF <hi>JACOB, and the ſweet Pſalmist of</hi>
Iſrael; <hi>The God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaid,</hi> the Rock of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſpake to me,
HE THAT RULETH OVER MEN MUST BE JUST,
RULING IN THE FEAR OF GOD. What it is for a
Ruler over men <hi>to be juſt,</hi> and to rule <hi>in the fear of God,</hi> we
may infallibly conclude, and learn from three Scripture-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents,
and three ſacred Texts, which may ſerve as a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary</hi>
on it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt Preſident is that of</hi> Samuel, 1 Sam. 12. 1. <hi>to</hi> 6.
<hi>And</hi> Samuel <hi>ſaid unto all Iſrael;</hi> Behold, I have hearkened
unto your voice in all that ye ſaid unto me, and have made a King
over you: And now behold, I am old and gray-headed, and have
walked before, and<note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 7. 15.</note> judged you from my Childhood to this
day: Behold here I am, witneſs againſt me before the Lord, and
before his Anoynted; Whoſe Oxe have I taken? Or whoſe Aſs
have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?
or of whoſe hand have I received any ranſome to blinde mine
eyes therewith? and I will restore it to you. And they ſaid, <hi>THOU
HAST NOT DEFRAUDED US, NOR OPPRESSED US,

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:167954:3"/>
NEITHER HAST THOU TAKEN OUGHT OF ANY
MANS HAND:</hi> And he ſaid, The Lord is my witneſs againſt
you, and his Anoynted is witneſs this day, that you have not
found ought in my hand: And they anſwered, He is witneſs. <hi>That
Governour or Ruler over men, who can make ſuch a chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
and proteſtation as this, before God and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and receive ſuch a teſtimony from both, of his integrity,
as</hi> Samuel <hi>here did after he had judged</hi> Iſrael <hi>above threeſcore
years, is certainly a</hi> juſt man, <hi>truly fearing God: And what
Governour this day ruling, though but for a few months or
years, can make ſuch a challenge, or receive ſuch a witneſs as
he did from all the people?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Preſident is that of King <hi>David,</hi> a man after
Gods own heart, who as he would by no means lay violent
hands on King <hi>Saul</hi> his Soveraign, who hunted him like a
Partridg, and ſought his life, though God gave him twice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his hands, and was perſwaded by his Souldiers and Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Officers to kill him; nor yet uſurp the Royal Throne,
or Government of Gods people, though ſpecially anointed
by God long before thereto, without a General Call and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
thereto by all the Tribes and Elders of the people;
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. &amp; 26. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 1. to 6. So it is recorded of
him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 15. and 1 <hi>Kings 15. 5. And</hi> David <hi>raigned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all</hi> Iſrael; <hi>and</hi> David <hi>executed Judgment and Justice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all his people; and</hi> David <hi>did that which was right in the eyes
of the Lord, and turned not aſide from any thing that he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him all the daies of his life, ſave only in the matter of</hi> Uriah
<hi>the</hi> Hittire; for which he penned, and left a<note n="a" place="margin">Pal. 51.</note> 
               <hi>Penitential
Pſalm</hi> on Record to Poſterity, to teſtifie his unfeigned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
for that <hi>bloody crime.</hi> And where can we finde ſuch
a <hi>David</hi> now?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third is</hi> Nehemiah, cap. 5. <hi>throughout; who when
the people</hi> cried and complained to him of their Debts, Engages,
Bondage and Oppreſſions by their Brethren, and that others had
their Lands, Vineyards, yea their Sons and Daughters for ſervants,
for moneys borrowed of them <hi>FOR THE KINGS TRIBUTE;</hi>
He grew very angry, and rebuked the Nobles and Rulers for it,
and ſet a great Aſſembly againſt them, and ſaid unto them: We

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:167954:3"/>
after our ability have redeemed the Jews our brethren, which were
ſold unto the Heathen, and will you ever ſell your Brethren? or
ſhall they be ſold unto us? I likewiſe, and my Brethren, and my
ſervants, might exact of them money and corn. I pray let us leave
off this Uſury: reſtore I pray unto them even this day their Lands,
their Vineyards, and their houſes; alſo the hundredth part of the
money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oyl that ye exact of
them. Then ſaid they, We will reſtore them, and will require no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of them; ſo will we do as thou haſt ſaid. Then <hi>Nehemiah</hi>
called the Prieſts, and took an oath of them, that they ſhould do
according to this promiſe: Alſo he ſhook his lap, and ſaid, So God
ſhake out every man from his houſe, and from his labour, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth
not this promiſe, even thus be he ſhaken out and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and all the Congregation ſaid, <hi>Amen,</hi> and praiſed the Lord,
and the people did according to this promiſe. <hi>After which, he
ſubjoyns this memorable teſtimony of himſelf.</hi> Moreover,
from the time that I was appointed to be their Governour in the
Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> from the 20. even to the 32. year of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>
the King, I and my Brethren have not eaten the bread of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour:
But the former Governours that had been before me,
<hi>WERE CHARGEABLE UNTO THE PEOPLE, AND
HAD TAKEN OF THEM BREAD AND WINE, BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIDES
FORTY SHEKELS OF SILVER (what is this to
our Contributions, EXCISES, Freequarter, Sequeſtrations,
Impoſts, &amp;c.)</hi> Yea, even their ſervants bear rule over the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
<hi>BUT SO DID NOT I, BECAUSE OF THE FEAR
OF GOD.</hi> Yet alſo I continued in the work of the Wall; <hi>NEI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER
BOUGHT WE ANY LAND:</hi> and all my ſervants
were gathered thither unto the work. Moreover, there were at
my Table an 150. of the Jews and Rulers, beſides thoſe that came
unto us from among the Heathen that are about us, &amp;c. <hi>YET
FOR ALL THIS REQUIRED I NOT THE BREAD OF
THE GOVERNOUR, (that is, his Salary, and ordinary
allowance, formerly paid by the people) BECAUSE OF
THE BONDAGE WAS HEAVY UPON THIS PEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE.</hi>
Think upon me my God for good, according to all that I have
done for this people.</p>
            <p>When our late and preſent Governours, and their under-Officers,

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:167954:4"/>
ſhall imitate <hi>Samuel, David,</hi> but more eſpecially
<hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and the Nobles, Rulers, and Officers under him,
in making full <hi>reſtitution</hi> of all their Chriſtian Brethrens, and
the publike Lands, Vineyards, Oliveyards, Houſes, Goods,
Poſſeſſions, Offices, Moneys, Corn, Wine and Oyl they have
forcibly ſeized on, without any legal Right or Title, or got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by uſurious or unrighteous contracts, Sequeſtrations,
Sales, Donations, Wiles, Diſſeiſins, Oppreſſions, Exactions,
Exciſes, Taxes, &amp;c. give a true and juſt accompt to our whole
Nation of the many Millions of Treaſure in few years ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
from them; and ſhall neither impoſe, nor exact from
them any more Moneys, Contributions, Exciſes, Corn, Wine,
or the bread of the Governour <hi>from the people, becauſe of the
fear of God, and becauſe of the Bondage that is heavy upon them;</hi>
we ſhall then pronounce them to be juſt, <hi>ruling in the fear of
God.</hi> But till then, neither God nor men will or can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
them ſuch. And upon conſideration of theſe three
ſacred Texts, to omit others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt is,</hi> Ezek. 18. 5. <hi>to</hi> 14. But if a man be <hi>JUST, &amp;
DO THAT WHICH IS LAWFUL &amp; RIGHT, &amp; HATH
NOT OPPRESSED ANY,</hi> but hath reſtored to the Debtor
his pledg, <hi>HATH SPOILED NONE BY VIOLENCE,</hi>
hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked
with a garment, hath not given forth upon uſury, neither hath
taken any encreaſe, hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath
executed true judgment between man and man, hath walked in
my Statutes, and hath kept my Judgments, TO DEAL TRU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY;
HE IS JUST; He ſhall ſurely live, ſaith the Lord. If
he beget a Son, that is A ROBBER, A SHEDDER OF
BLOOD, and that doth the like to any of theſe things to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that doth not any of thoſe duties, but hath eaten upon
the Mountains, and defiled his Neighbours Wife; <hi>HATH OP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRESSED
THE POOR AND NEEDY, HATH SPOIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED
BY VIOLENCE,</hi> hath not reſtored the pledg, &amp;c. hath
committed abomination, hath given forth upon uſury, and taken
encreaſe; ſhall he then live? He ſhall not live, he hath done all
theſe abominations, he ſhall ſurely die, his bloud ſhall be upon him,
&amp;c. <hi>Which is again there repeated, for the greater certainty.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:167954:4"/>
If the juſt men and Rulers of this latter age ſhall be judged
and tried by this Text, I fear we may take up the words of
the Prophet</hi> Micah 7. 2. <hi>and c. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. The good man
is periſhed out of the earth, and THERE IS NONE UP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIGHT
AMONG MEN:</hi> They all lye in wait for bloud,
they hunt every man his Brother with a Net, that they may do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
with both hands earnestly; the Prince asketh, and the Judg
asketh for a reward, and the great man he uttereth the miſchief
of his ſoul, (by coveting Fields and Houſes, and taking them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by violence, becauſe it is in the power of his hand, <hi>ch.</hi> 2. 1, 2.)
the beſt of them is as a Bryar, the moſt upright is ſharper then a
thorn-hedg; they pluck off the fleſh of my people from their bones,
they eat their fleſh, and flay their skin from off them, and they break
their bones, and chop them in pieces as for the pot, and as fleſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Caldron.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45. 7. to 10. and <hi>ch. 46. 18. A

the Sermon began; who repairing to me thither, I ſhewed him the
Ticket, in a friendly manner, which he owned; and then informed him
it was erronious, and voyd in Law, (becauſe directed to no particular

to be ſatisfied by him, touching the ſubſtance of his Warrant, and
that was, <hi>to make entry of what quantity of Hops I had growing
this preſent year, and to pay the Duty of Exciſe for them.</hi> For,
although I was a Lawyer and knew what Duties were by Law to be

that <hi>EXCISE</hi> in generall, much leſs for <hi>Hops</hi> in ſpeciall, was a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;

it for ever as ſuch, I could neither in prudence nor conſcience pay it
as a DVTY, till hee could make it appear to mee by ſome true
reall Act of Parliament to be ſo: deſiring him to ſhew me what Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
or other Authority he had to claim it as a Duty from mee. To
which he anſwered, <hi>that he had nothing elſe to ſhew for or claim
it by, but a late Ordinance of the Protector and his Counſell at
White-hall, continuing the Exciſe till ſuch a month in the year</hi>

at all to me; for I was certain, that by the fundamentall
Laws and Statutes of the Realm, and the reſolutions of our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

ever in any age make binding Laws, or impoſe any Tax, Tallage,

to maintain and defend the lawes and liberties of the
Realm, and Rights and Priviledges of our Engliſh Parliaments
in our ſeveral places, and callings, with conſtancy, faithfulneſſe,
and ſincerity according to our power,</hi> And this was that I then
alledged againſt <hi>Exciſe</hi> in generall.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Exciſe</hi> for <hi>Hops</hi> in ſpecial, and that is to be paid
by the owner and grower before any ſale, I proteſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, as moſt unjuſt, and unreaſonable for three
Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe men were inforced to pay full Monethly
<hi>Contributions</hi> (though illegally impoſed) all the year
long to the value of the Ground and Land whereon the
<hi>Hops</hi> do grow, which yields no other Crop or benefit,
but <hi>Hops;</hi> out of which both the <hi>rent to the Landlord,</hi> and
likewiſe <hi>Contribution</hi> muſt be raiſed: And to enforce men
to pay Exciſe out of that for which they pay full <hi>Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,</hi>
without any deduction for the Exciſe: is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Tax, and oppreſſion for the ſelf ſame thing, and they
may as well exact Exciſe for any ſort of Corn, and Hay,

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:167954:15"/>
as for <hi>Hops,</hi> without defalcation for the Contribution
out of the Land whereon they grow, there being the
ſelf ſame reaſon for both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe <hi>Hops</hi> are a great certain Charge, and moſt
uncertain Commodity and Gain. The laſt year before
this, there was ſuch a blight, that I and others, had not
the ſixth part of the ready money disburſed out of purſe
for the dreſſing and polling of them; and this year the
crop of <hi>Hops</hi> was ſo ſmall, that it would hardly quit the
coſt beſtowed in dreſſing, polling, tying, gathering. And
to enforce men to pay not onely monethly Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but exciſe likewiſe, for that domeſtick native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
for which they are out of purſe, and ſo great lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
without any gain, is to adde <hi>Oppreſſion to affliction;</hi> and
againſt all Rules of Juſtice and Conſcience.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe by the Common Laws of <hi>England</hi> no <hi>Toll</hi> is
due for any native vendible Commodity till it be ſold by
the Owner, as is reſolved, 9. <hi>H. 6. 45. Brook</hi> Toll 2. and <hi>if
a man buy Hops or any other Commodities, for his own private uſe
and family, no Toll by the Common Law</hi> 28. Aſſ. 53. 9. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 25
<hi>Brook Toll</hi> 1. 7. Therefore to exact <hi>Exciſe</hi> for <hi>Hops,</hi> before
their ſale; before we know when, or to whom, or at
what rate to ſell them, or if ſold to any for the uſe of their
particular families was both illegall and unreaſonable.</p>
               <p>Upon all theſe grounds and Reaſons, I declared and
proteſted to the <hi>Exciſeman;</hi> that I was reſolved upon no
terms whatſoever to pay any Exciſe at all for <hi>Hops;</hi> but
to queſtion and oppoſe it to my power according to my
Proteſtation, Vow, Solemn League and Covenant, for my
own and the whole Nations future caſe from this oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
illegal grievance and Dutch-Devill, as moſt ſtiled
it; which I conceived all Patrons of publique Liberty
would now cordially and unanimouſly joyn together
throughout the Nation, to conjure down to Hell again,
from whence it was firſt raiſed by thoſe, who formerly
condemned and ſent it packing thither. The <hi>Exciſe-man</hi>
hereupon anſwered with much Civility and reſpect; <hi>That
he would not have ſuffered any other, ſo to diſpute the buſineſſe

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:167954:16"/>
with him as I had done: but his reſpects towards me were ſuch,
having been an eminent ſufferer heretofore for Religion and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
liberty, for which he well knew I had ſuſtained very great
loſſes in my eſtate, and being a Gentleman whom be truly honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that he would by no means bring my name in queſtion; and
and herefore my Crop of Hops being ſo mean (which he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
far greater) he would demand nothing from me for them</hi> And
ſo the Miniſter calling on me, to <hi>go to the Sermon;</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
very friendly and fairly to his <hi>Iune,</hi> and I unto the
Church to the Lecture.</p>
               <p>Since which being informed, that other <hi>Exciſe-men in
Gloceſter ſhire</hi> have moſt ſtrictly exacted <hi>Exciſe for Hops from
others of my friends</hi> by colour of this <hi>Whitehall Ordinance;</hi>
and that the buyer will be forced to pay Exciſe for my
<hi>Hops,</hi> though nothing be demanded from me; which
will be deducted out of the price: although the value
conſidered in it ſelf will be very ſmall, yet ſince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of it, is and will be very great to the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as well as prejudiciall to my ſelf and friends, both
for the preſent and future; I held it my duty to make
this my private <hi>Declaration</hi> and <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> publick, for
the preſent and future benefit of the whole Engliſh Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to whoſe Judgements, Conſciences, Cenſures, I
humbly ſubmit it, at this ſeaſon. The rather becauſe it
pleaſed God the very next morning after this my <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

this vale of <hi>Miſery,</hi> my dearly-beloved <hi>Chriſtian Brother,
and fellow ſufferer, for Religion and liberties, Doctor</hi> John
Baſtwick: And therefore ſeeing I know not how many
