            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Lord-Lieutenant and High-Steward
of the Dutchy of Cornwal,

and One of the Lords of his Majeſties
moſt Honourable Privy-Councill.</head>
            <p>THeſe Verſes were an <hi>Epicedium</hi> of the Muſes
of <hi>Oxford,</hi> made to adorn the Herſe of your
Noble Father, who Dy'd ſo Gloriouſly at <hi>Lans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down,</hi>
in Defence of his <hi>Prince</hi> and Country. It is
Apparent what a Publique loſs his Death was, that
one of the firſt Univerſities of <hi>Europe</hi> ſhould think
fit to Lament it; A Reſpect, it may be, never done
before to any but to the Royal Family. But as there
<pb facs="tcp:98226:3"/>
are few Perſons (my Lord) ſo Deſerving to be Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
as your Father; ſo are there few Families,
which have had that Military Glory in them. Not
to go back ſo far as your great Anceſtor <hi>Hamon
Dentatus Earl of Corboil,</hi> deſcended from the
Warlike <hi>Rollo Duke of Normandy;</hi> Nor to Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
his two Renowned Sons, <hi>Robert Fitzhamon,</hi>
and Sr <hi>Richard de Granvill,</hi> who came over with
<hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> and Ayded him at the Battle
of <hi>Haſtings,</hi> to Wyn the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and
afterward in the Conqueſt of <hi>Wales;</hi> there are late
Inſtances of other of your Progenitors who have
Illuſtrated your Race by their valiant Actions.
In the War with <hi>France,</hi> betwixt <hi>Henry the</hi> 8<hi>th.</hi>
and <hi>Francis the firſt,</hi> Sir <hi>Roger Granvil</hi> loſt
his life at Sea: And his Son Sir <hi>Richard
Granvil,</hi> when he was very Young went a Volen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
into <hi>Hungary</hi> to ſerve the Emperour <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>
againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> and after that was with
<hi>Don John of Auſtria</hi> at the Battle of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> the
greateſt Day that ever was at Sea ſince that of
<hi>Actium.</hi> At his Return home, applying himſelf
to the Sea, he became an Expert Captain and
Admirall, &amp; after Several Voyages into the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi>
and elſewhere, &amp; Services done his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
with much Honour and Succeſſe, he was at
laſt Slayn at the <hi>Azores Iſlands,</hi> having with one of
the Queen's Ships alone, being unhappily Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb facs="tcp:98226:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from the reſt of the Fleet, whereof he was
Vice-Admiral, Suſtain'd a fight againſt the whole
Naval power of <hi>Spain;</hi> never yeilding, though
his Guns were diſmounted, his men almoſt all
hurt or kill'd, himſelf Mortally Wounded, and
his <hi>Decks</hi> blown up, that there was no place left
to fight upon; ſo that his Enemies were Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
at his valour, and Concern'd to ſave him,
as if he had been of their own Nation: but his
Wounds being too Mortall to be cured, he Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in a Few Hours, and was Buried in the Ocean,
which had been the Theatre of his Glory.</p>
            <p>I cannot forget another Sir <hi>Richard Granvill</hi>
your Lordſhips Uncle, who having done his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice-ſhip
in Arms in the <hi>Low-Countrys</hi> and
<hi>German-Wars,</hi> ſerv'd his late Majeſty in the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi>
Expeditions, and then in the Wars of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and at length coming to command one of the
Kings Armies in the <hi>West,</hi> kept that Country in
his Majeſties Obedience, till the Reſt of <hi>England</hi>
was loſt, &amp; the fortune of the Parliament prevail'd
every where: A ſevere Obſerver of Military Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;
and my Lord General the Old <hi>Duke of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemarle</hi>
was wont to ſay, one of the beſt Captains
we had in all the War of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
As the Name and fortune of your Anceſtors are
Deſcended to your Lordſhip, ſo is their Virtue too,
which appeared ſo early in you, that before you
<pb facs="tcp:98226:4"/>
were Seaventeen years Old, you enter'd into your
Fathers Command; and after you had ſerv'd the
King upon ſeveral Engagements in the Army, and
particularly in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> at the Defeat of the <hi>Earl of
Eſſex,</hi> you brought thoſe Valiant Companies, in
the Head of which your Father was ſlain at <hi>Lanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down,</hi>
to fight for his Majeſty at the Second Battel
of <hi>Newbery,</hi> where you were like to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
your Fathers fate, as well as Imitated his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
for being Engaged in the Thickeſt of the
Enemies, and having receiv'd ſeverall wounds, and
one moſt Dangerous <hi>One</hi> in the Head, with the
blow of a Halberd, which beat you to the Ground,
you lay for ſome time without Senſe or Motion, 'till
a Body of the Kings Horſe Charging the Enemy
a-freſh, beat them off the ground upon which you
fought, where you were found amongſt the Dead,
Cover'd with Duſt and Blood; and being known,
were carried into that place of the Field, where the
<hi>King</hi> &amp; <hi>Prince of Wales</hi> (his now Preſent Majeſty)
were, who ſent you to <hi>Dennington Caſtle</hi> to be
treated for your Wounds. It could not My Lord
but be matter of great Contentment to you, to
have his Majeſty himſelf a witneſs of the Blood
you had loſt for him, and a Spectator of that Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
and Courage, which are the Hereditary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of your Family.</p>
            <p>No ſooner were the Armies drawn off from the
<pb facs="tcp:98226:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Field of <hi>Newbery,</hi> but you were preſently Beſieged
in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Dennington,</hi> where for ſome time you lay in
Extream Danger of your life, not only by thoſe
Deſperate Wounds you had got in the late Battel,
but in the hazzard you were in, of Receiving new
ones from the Enemy, the Bullets flying continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
through the Room where you lay under Cure,
'till you were Releived by the Victorious Forces
of his Majeſty at the Third Battel of <hi>Newbery:</hi>
Nor have you only Serv'd the King with your
Sword in the Field, but been another way a Chief
Inſtrument of the Greateſt good that ever came to
<hi>England,</hi> I mean the Reſtauration of his Majeſty,
and of the Laws and Liberty of your Oppreſſed
Country. This my Lord was brought to paſs by
your Prudent and Succeſsfull Negotiation with my
<hi>Lord General Monck,</hi> you having a particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
from the King to treat with him; with
whom when you had Conſerted all things for his
Majeſties Return, and that without Impoſing the
leaſt Condition upon him, you Poſted away to
<hi>Bruxells</hi> to give him an Account of it: In which
Journey as well as in the Reſt of your Conduct
in this Affair, you expoſed your ſelf to no Ordinary
Danger, and moſt certainly ſerv'd the King your
Maſter more Effectually, then if you had won
more then One Battel for him.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Lord General</hi> who ſeem'd to be Inſpir'd in
<pb facs="tcp:98226:5"/>
the Carrying-on of this Great Buſineſs, was ſo Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect,
that he would not write to the King by
your Lordſhip, for fear you might be Searched
upon the Way, and what you carried Intercepted,
and his Great Deſign Diſcover'd before it was
Ripe, and therefore left all to your Care and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Management; But at your Return, he wrote
a Letter to his Majeſty, wherein he confirmed to
him under his Hand what he had Promiſed and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
in his Treaty with your Lordſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> That
he would Employ all the Power he had to ſet the
King upon his Throne, and that without Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
This Letter was delivered to his Majeſty at
<hi>Breda</hi> by your Noble Brother Mr <hi>Bernard Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill:</hi>
If ever Letter were wellcome to a Prince,
this had Reaſon to be ſo, ſince it contained no leſs
then a humane Aſſurance that his Majeſties Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
were at an End, and that the time was come
that Allmighty God would Reſtore him to his
<hi>Crowns</hi> &amp; <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> from which his Majeſty was ſo
long &amp; ſo Unjuſtly kept by moſt Bloody Uſurpers.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip is not only happy in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of your own Actions, and Virtuous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of thoſe who are gone before you, but in
the moſt hopefull Proſpect you have of your
Deſcendents. For my <hi>Lord Landſdown</hi> treading
in the Steps of his Brave Anceſtors, hath been
already Courting Honour in the Wars of <hi>Hungary,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98226:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where he hath diſtinctly ſignalized himſelf in all
thoſe great Occaſions, particularly at <hi>Kornenberch,</hi>
where the <hi>Duke of Loraine</hi> Defeated Twelve
Thouſand Spahyes in a raſe <hi>Campagne</hi> at the
Releiving of <hi>Vienna,</hi> which was Beſieged by an
Army of Two Hundred Thouſand Combattants;
At the Battel of <hi>Baracan,</hi> where the <hi>King of Poland,</hi>
&amp; his whole Army had been Certainly loſt, if the
<hi>Duke of Loraine,</hi> with whom my <hi>Lord Lanſdown</hi>
then was, had not come in, &amp; turn'd the Day at the
very inſtant that fortune was Declaring for the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels;
&amp; laſtly, at the taking of <hi>Gran,</hi> the Second Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Kingdom: and now he is retnrn'd Home
with Laurells, &amp; a laſting Monument of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements,
being Dignified with the Quality of
Count of the Empire, and Honoured to bear his
Paternal Coat of Arms upon the <hi>Roman Eagle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is an Epiſtle (My Lord) that I am wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

               <head>TO THE MEMORY
of Sir BEVILL GRANVILL.</head>
               <l>IT is not He. I'le not believe mine Eye.</l>
               <l>He that could never Fear, can never Dye.</l>
               <l>Duſt, Sweat, and Bloud, mixt in that Face, conſpire</l>
               <l>To ſay 'tis GRANVILL. Truſt 'em not. The Fire,</l>
               <l>That warm'd his Breſt, was Veſtall, Star born Light,</l>
               <l>Flame, that no Ocean, Day that fear'd no Night.</l>
               <l>It is not He. But weeping Truth ſays, 'Tis:</l>
               <l>That Corps of Glory can be None's but His.</l>
               <l>So hovers Valour o're that Brow; ſo yet</l>
               <l>(As, after Tempeſts, empty'd Clouds ſtill Threat)</l>
               <l>Terror leaps from thoſe Eyes, and Rebells Run;</l>
               <l>The Souldier lives ſtill, though the Man be gone.</l>
               <l>The Man! Courage ſaid More. But Honour, ſitting</l>
               <l>With Fame in Councell, found it far more fitting</l>
               <l>The World ſhould know him Mortall; that he Fought</l>
               <l>On equall terms; that to the Field He brought</l>
               <l>Nothing Impenetrable, but his Mind;</l>
               <l>Knew Danger and deſpis'd it: Since, we find,</l>
               <l>Cowards, Secur'd, Act Valour. All elſe than</l>
               <l>Speaking Him more, Death was to prove Him Man.</l>
               <l>Then; when, as a Deſtroying Angell, ſent</l>
               <l>To Mow a Guilty Nation down, He lent</l>
               <l>Blow's like to Whirl winds LANDS-DOWN ſaw Him Stand</l>
               <l>Not with a Pike, but Thunder-bolt in's hand.</l>

               <l>Thy famous Actions in thine own ſtout Heat,</l>

               <l>Their ſtrong Inſpirer, firſt felt trance, then ſpoke,</l>
               <l>And utter'd Anſwers, which from Labours broke;</l>

               <l>So <hi>Homer</hi> ſtrove with his <hi>Achilles,</hi> who</l>
               <l>Should bravelier write, or who ſhould bravelier do.</l>
               <l>So what at firſt He meant an Ode, and Song,</l>
               <l>Swell'd to a Work, and Story ten years long.</l>
               <l>And what at firſt was deſtin'd to one Shade,</l>

               </l>
               <l>Had'ſt Thou, like Others, fought by Rule, and Line,</l>
               <l>Who call it Valour Wiſely to decline</l>
               <l>Aſſaults, and Dangers, and maintain that there</l>
               <l>Can be no Fortitude, where is no Fear;</l>
               <l>Hadſt thou beleev'd that They, who do ingage</l>
               <l>Themſelves beyond relief, fight not, but rage;</l>
               <l>Or that, when men beyond a mean do ſtray,</l>
               <l>Their Fury's only Valiant, not They;</l>
               <l>We on thy Temples now had planted Bays,</l>
               <l>And Thou had'ſt liv'd to hear and feel thy Prayſe.</l>
               <l>But Thou did'ſt ſcorn ſuch Rules, and call'dſt ſuch Laws,</l>

               <l>Countedſt thoſe falſe, whom Others do count wiſe,</l>
               <l>And their diſcreet Fear, order'd Cowardice.</l>
               <l>Far above all cold precepts, which do preach</l>
               <l>Eſcapes, retreats, and fallings back, and teach</l>
               <l>Advantages of Time, and place, and thus</l>
               <l>Learnedly make Men Puſillanimous;</l>
               <l>Or at moſt, valiant to a Point, and all</l>

               <l>Methinks I ſee Thee ſhaking thy bold ſpear</l>

               <l>A Siege on theirs, a Duel on our Side.</l>
               <l>Great Soul! who didſt contract the Battel to</l>
               <l>Thy Solatary ſelf; and there didſt do</l>
               <l>Things, which made all our other Forces be</l>

               <l>While'ſt ſafer by thy Side, then at their home,</l>
               <l>Their buſineſs was to ſee, and overcome.</l>
               <l>O what a Terrour iſſued from thy Look,</l>
               <l>Which fought as well as Thou, and Priſoners took</l>
               <l>By th'eye, as by the Hand; which but beheld</l>
               <l>Made the firſt Skirmiſh, and at diſtance quell'd;</l>
               <l>Thy unarm'd face ſhew'd dreadful as our Lances,</l>
               <l>The foe felt new Artilleries from thy Glances;</l>
               <l>Which ſtill, like Native Engines, from Thee flew,</l>
               <l>And at once routed, chas'd, and overthrew.</l>
               <l>Thus, then, ſecur'd by thy Great ſelf, at once</l>
               <l>To us a Bulwark, to thy ſelf a Sconce,</l>
               <l>As in a Circle 'bout Thee drawn by the charms</l>
               <l>Of thine own Courage, which did arm thy Arms,</l>

One of her Majeſties Ships Commanded by Sir Richard
Granvill, commonly called Grenvill, Vice-Admiral,
and an Armada of the King of Spain; Penned by the
Honourable Sir Water Ralegh, Knight.</head>
               <p>BEcauſe the Rumours are diverſly ſpred, as well in
<hi>England,</hi> as in the Low Countrys, and elſewhere,
of this late encounter between her Majeſties Ships
and the <hi>Armada of Spain;</hi> and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their uſuall manner, fill the world with their vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious
vanity, making great appearance of victories,
when on the contrary, themſelves are moſt commonly
and ſhamefully beaten and diſhonoured; thereby hoping
to poſſeſs the ignorant multitude by anticipating &amp; fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running
falſe reports: It is agreeable with all good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
for manifeſtation of the truth, to overcome falſhood
and untruth; that the beginning, continuance and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of this late Honourable Encounter of Sr <hi>Richard Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi>
and other her Majeſties Captains, with the <hi>Armada
of Spain;</hi> ſhould be truly ſet down and publiſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

than the <hi>Spainard</hi> ſhould ſeek by falſe and Slanderous
Pamphlets, adviſoes and Letters, to cover their own loſs,
and to derogate from others their due Honour, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this Fight, being performed far off: Seeing they
were not aſhamed in the year 1588. when they purpoſed
the Invaſion of this Land, to publiſh in Sundry Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in Print, great victories in words, which they plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

not only of their own Kingdom, but ſtrengthened with
the greateſt <hi>Argoſies, Portugal Caracks, Florentines,</hi> &amp; huge

from their Anchors, were chaſed out of the ſight of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
round about <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Where for the
Sympathy of their barbarous Religion, hoping to find
Succour and aſſiſtance, a great part of them were cruſht
againſt the Rocks, and thoſe other that landed, being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many in number, were notwithſtanding broken, ſlain,

of her Princely and Invincible diſpoſition, diſdaining to
put them to death, and ſcorning either to retain or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
them; they were all ſent back again to their
Countrys, to witneſs and recount the worthy Achieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their Invincible and Dreadfull Navy: Of which
the number of Souldiers, the fearfull burthen of their
Ships, the Commanders names of every Squadron, with
all other their Magazines of proviſions, were put in
Print, as an Army and Navy unreſiſtable, and diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
prevention. With all which ſo great and terrible an
oſtentation, they did not in all their Sailing round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98226:21"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> ſo much as Sink or take one Ship, Bark,
Pinneſſe or Cock-boat of ours; Or ever burnt ſo much
as one Sheepcote of this Land; Whereas on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> with only 800. Souldiers not long
before, landed in their <hi>Indies,</hi> and forced <hi>Sant Iago, Santo
Domingo, Cartagena,</hi> and the fort of <hi>Florida.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And after that, Sr <hi>John Norris</hi> marched from <hi>Peniche</hi>
in <hi>Portugall,</hi> with a handfull of Souldiers, to the gate of
<hi>Lisbone,</hi> being about 40 Engliſh miles. Where the <hi>Earl

the City of <hi>Lisbone,</hi> encamped at the very gate; from
whence, after many days abode, finding neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
party, nor proviſion to batter; they made retrait
by Land, in deſpight of all their Garriſons, both of
Horſe and Foot. In this ſort I have a little digreſſed from
my firſt purpoſe; only by the neceſſary compariſon of
theirs and our actions: The one covetous of honour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vaunt of oſtentation; the other ſo greedy to purchaſe
the opinion of their own affairs, and by falſe Rumors to
reſiſt the bluſt of their own diſhonours, as they will not
only not bluſh to ſpread all manner of Untruths: But
even for the leaſt advantage, be it but for the talring
of one poor Adventurer of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> will celebrate
the Victory with Bonfires in every Town, always
ſpending more in Faggors, then the purchaſe was
worth they obtained. When as we never thought it
worth the conſumption of two Billets, when we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Eight or Ten of their <hi>Indian Ships</hi> at one time,
and Twenty of the <hi>Braſill Fleet:</hi> Such is the difference
between true Valour, and Oſtentation: and between
Honourable Actions and frivolous Vain glorious vaunts.
But now to return to my purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lord Thomas Howard</hi> with Six of her Majeſties
Ships, Six Victualers of <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Bark Ralegh,</hi> and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98226:22"/>
two or three other Pinnaces riding at Anchor near
unto <hi>Flores,</hi> one of the <hi>Weſterly Iſlands</hi> of the <hi>Azores,</hi>
the Laſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in the afternoon, had intelligence
by one Captain <hi>Middleton</hi> of the approach of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Armada</hi> Which <hi>Middleton</hi> being in a very good
Sailer, had kept them Company three days before,
of good purpoſe, both to diſcover their Forces the
more, as alſo to give advice to my <hi>Lord Thomas</hi> of
their approach. He had no ſooner delivered the news
but the Fleet was in ſight many of our Ships Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panys
were on Shore in the <hi>Iſland;</hi> ſome providing ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt
for their Ships; others filling of Water, and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves from the Land, with ſuch things as
they could either for Money, or by Force recover. By
reaſon whereof our Ships being all peſtered and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maging
every thing out of order, very light for want
of balaſt, and that which was moſt to our diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
the one half part of the men of every Ship ſick,
and utterly unſerviceable: For in the <hi>Revenge</hi> there
were Ninety diſeaſes: in the <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> not ſo many
in health as could handle her Main-Sail. For had not
Twenty men been taken out of a <hi>Bark</hi> of Sr <hi>George Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reys,</hi>
his being commanded to be ſunk, and thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to her, ſhe had hardly ever recovered <hi>England.</hi>
The reſt, for the moſt part, were in little better State.
The Names of her Majeſties Ships were theſe as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
the <hi>Defiance,</hi> which was <hi>Admiral,</hi> the <hi>Revenge
Vice-Admiral,</hi> the <hi>Bonaventure</hi> commanded by Captain
<hi>Croſſe,</hi> the <hi>Lion</hi> by <hi>George Fenner,</hi> the <hi>Foreſight</hi> by Mr
<hi>Thomas Vavaſour,</hi> and the <hi>Crane</hi> by <hi>Duffild,</hi> the <hi>Foreſight</hi>
and the <hi>Crane</hi> being but ſmall Ships<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only the other
were of the middle ſize; the reſt beſides the <hi>Bark Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh,</hi>
commanded by Captain <hi>Thin,</hi> were Victuallers,
and of ſmall force or none. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet having
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98226:22"/>
ſhrouded their approach by reaſon of the <hi>Iſland;</hi> were
now ſo ſoon at hand, as our Ships had ſcarce time to
weigh their Anchors, but ſome of them were driven
to let ſlip their Cables and ſet ſail. Sr <hi>Richard Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi>
was the laſt that weighed, to recover the men that
were upon the <hi>Iſland,</hi> which otherwiſe had been loſt.
The Lord <hi>Thomas,</hi> with the reſt very hardly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the Wind, which Sr <hi>Richard Granvill</hi> not being
able to do, was perſuaded by the Maſter, and others,
to cut his Main Sail, and caſt about, and to truſt to
the Sailing of the Ship; for the Squadron of <hi>Sivil</hi> were
on his Weather-Bow. But Sr <hi>Richard</hi> utterly refuſed
to trun from the Enemies, alledging that he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
chooſe to dye, then to dishonour himſelf, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and her Majeſties Ship, perſuading his Company
that he would paſs through the two Squadrons, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight
of them, and enforce thoſe of <hi>Sivil</hi> to give him
way. Which he performed upon divers of the formoſt,
who, as the Mariners term it, ſprang their Luff, and
fell under the Lee of the <hi>Revenge.</hi> But the other courſe
had been the better, and might right well have been
anſwered, in ſo great an impoſſibility of Prevailing.
Notwithſtanding, out of the greatneſs of his mind, he
could not be perſuaded. In the mean while as he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
thoſe which were neareſt him, the great <hi>San
Philip</hi> being in the Wind of him, and coming towards
him, becalmed his Sails in ſuch ſort, as the Ship could
neither make way, nor feel the Helm: ſo huge and
high-carged was the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship, being of a Thouſand
and Five Hundred Tuns, who after laid the <hi>Revenge</hi>
abord. When he was thus bereft of his Sails, the Ships
that were under his lee luffing up, alſo laid him abord:
of which the next was the <hi>Admiral of the Biſcaines,</hi> a
very mighty and puiſſant Ship commanded by <hi>Brittan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dona,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:98226:23"/>
the ſaid <hi>Philip</hi> carried three tire of Ordinance on
a ſide, and eleven Pieces in every tire. She ſhot Eight
forth-right out of her Chaſe, beſides thoſe of her
Stern-Ports.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Revenge</hi> was entangled with this <hi>Philip.</hi> four
other boorded her; two on her Larboord, and two on
her Starboord. The Fight thus beginning at three of
the Clock in the Afternoon, continued very terrible
all that Evening. But the great <hi>San Philip</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Lower Tire of the <hi>Revenge,</hi> Diſcharged with
Croſs-bar ſhot, Shirted her ſelf with all diligence from
her ſides, utterly miſliking her firſt entertainment. Some
ſay that the Ship Foundred but we cannot report it
for truth, unleſs we were aſſured. The Spaniſh Ships
were filled with Companys of Souldiers, in ſome Two
Hundred, beſides the Mariners, in ſome Five, in others
Eight Hundred. In ours there were none at all beſides
the Mariners but the Servants of the Commanders, and
ſome few Voluntary Gentlemen only. After many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchanged
Vollies of Great Ordinance and Small Shot,
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> deliberated to enter the <hi>Revenge,</hi> and
made divers attempts, hoping to force her by the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of their Armed Souldiers and Musketters, but
were ſtill repulſed again and again, and at all times
beaten back into their own Ships, or into the Seas.
In the beginning of the Fight, the <hi>George Noble of
London,</hi> having received ſome Shot thorow her by the
<hi>Armadas,</hi> fell under the Lee of the <hi>Revenge,</hi> and asked
Sr <hi>Richard</hi> what he would Command him, being but
one of the Victualers and of ſmall force: Sr <hi>Richard</hi>
bid him ſave himſelf, and leave him to his fortune.
After the Fight had thus, without intermiſſion conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
while the Day laſted, and ſome hours of the
Night, many of our Men were ſlain and hurt, and one of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98226:23"/>
the great Gallions of the <hi>Armada,</hi> and the Admiral of the
Hulks both Sunk, and in many other of the <hi>Spaniſh Ships</hi>
great Slaughter was made. Some write that Sir <hi>Richard</hi>
was very dangerouſly hurt almoſt in the beginning of the
Fight, and lay Speechleſs for a time e're he Recovered;
But two of the <hi>Revenges</hi> own company, brought home
in a Ship of <hi>Lime</hi> from the <hi>Iſlands,</hi> Examined by ſome
of the Lords, and Others, affirmed that he was never
ſo Wounded as that he forſook the Upper Deck, 'till
an hour before Midnight; and then being ſhot into the
Body with a Musket, as he was a dreſſing, was again
ſhot into the Head, and withall, his Chirurgion wounded
to death. This agreeth alſo with an Examination taken
by Sr <hi>Francis Godolphin,</hi> of four other Mariners of the
ſame Ship being returned, which Examination, the
ſaid Sr <hi>Francis</hi> ſent unto Maſter <hi>William Killegrue,</hi> of
her Majeſties Privy Chamber.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Fight, The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships which
attempted to boord the <hi>Revenge,</hi> as they were wounded
and beaten off, ſo allways others came in their places,
ſhe having never leſs then two mighty Gallions by
by her ſides, and aboard her: So that e'ere the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
from Three of the Clock the day before, there
had Fifteen ſeverall <hi>Armadas</hi> aſſailed her, and all ſo ill
approved their entertainment, as they were by the
break of day, far more willing to hearken to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
then haſtily to make any more Aſſaults or
Entries. But as the day encreaſed, ſo our men decreaſed:
and as the light grew more and more, by ſo much
more grew our diſcomforts. For none appeared in
fight but enemies, ſaving one ſmall Ship called the
<hi>Pilgrim,</hi> commanded by <hi>Jacob Whiddon,</hi> who hovered
all night to ſee the Succeſs: but in the morning
bearing with the <hi>Revenge,</hi> was hunted like a Hare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98226:24"/>
many ravenous Hounds, but eſcaped.</p>
               <p>All the Powder of the <hi>Revenge</hi> to the laſt Barrell was
now ſpent, all her Pikes broken, Forty of her beſt men
ſlain, and the moſt part of the reſt hurt. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Fight ſhe had but one hundred free
from Sickneſs, and fourſcore and ten Sick, laid in Hold
upon the Ballaſt. A ſmall Troup to man ſuch a Ship,
and a weak Garriſon to reſiſt ſo mighty an Army. By
thoſe hundred all was ſuſtained, the volleis, boordings,
and entrings of fifteen Ships of War, beſides thoſe which
beat her at large. On the contrary, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> were
always ſupplied with Souldiers brought from every
Squadron: all-manner of Arms and Powder at will.
Unto ours there remained no comfort at all, no hope,
no ſupply either of Ships, Men, or Weapons; the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
all beaten over-bord, all her tackle cut aſunder,
her upper work altogether raſed, and in effect evened
ſhe was with the water, but the very foundation or
bottom of a Ship, nothing being left over-head either
for flight or defence. Sir <hi>Richard</hi> finding himſelf in
this diſtreſs, and unable any longer to make reſiſtance,
having endured in this fifteen hours Fight, the Aſſault
of fifteen ſeverall <hi>Armadas,</hi> all by turns aboord him,
and by eſtimation eight hundred Shot of great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery,
beſides many Aſſaults and Entries: and that
Himſelf and the Ship muſt needs be poſſeſſed by
the Enemy, who were now all caſt in a ring
round about him (the <hi>Revenge</hi> not able to move one
way or other, but as ſhe was moved with the waves
and billow of the Sea) commanded the <hi>Maſter Gunner,</hi>
whom he knew to be a moſt reſolute man, to ſplit
and ſink the Ship, that thereby nothing might remain
of Glory or Victory to the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> Seeing in ſo
many hours fight, and with ſo great a Navy they were
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98226:24"/>
not able to take her, having had Fifteen hours time,
above ten Thouſand Men, and Fifty and
three Sail of Men of War to perform it
withall:<note place="margin">The Spaniſh 53. Sail.</note> and perſwaded the Company, or
as many as hee could induce, to yeild them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unto God, and to the mercy of none elſe: but as
they had, like Valiant Reſolute Men, repulſed ſo many
Enemies, they ſhould not now ſhorten the Honour of
their Nation, by prolonging their own Lives for a few
Hours, or a few Days. The <hi>Maſter Gunner</hi> readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſended
and divers others; but the <hi>Captain</hi> and the
<hi>Maſter</hi> were of another opinion, and beſought Sr <hi>Richard</hi>
to have care of them; alledging that the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
would be as ready to entertain a Compoſition, as they
were willing to offer the ſame; and that there being
divers ſufficient and Valiant Men yet living, and whoſe
Wounds were not Mortall, they might do their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and Prince acceptable Service hereafter. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
Sir <hi>Richard</hi> had alledged that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould
never Glory to have taken one Ship of her Majeſty,
ſeeing they had ſo long and ſo notably defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
they anſwered, that the Ship had Six-foot Water
in hold, Three ſhot under Water, which were ſo weakly
ſtopped, as with the firſt working of the Sea, ſhe muſt
needs Sink, and was beſides ſo Cruſht and Bruiſed, as
ſhe could never be removed out of the Place.</p>
               <p>And as the matter was thus in diſpute, and Sr <hi>Richard</hi>
refuſing to hearken to any of thoſe reaſons; the Maſter
of the <hi>Revenge</hi> (while the Captain wan unto him the
greater Party) was conveyed aboard the General <hi>Don
Alfonſo Bazan.</hi> Who (finding none over-haſty to enter
the <hi>Revenge</hi> again, doubting leaſt Sr <hi>Richard</hi> would have
Blown them up and himſelf, and perceiving by the
Report of the Maſter of the <hi>Revenge</hi> his dangerous
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98226:25"/>
diſpoſition) yielded that all their Lives ſhould be ſaved,
the Company ſent for <hi>England,</hi> and the better ſort to
pay ſuch reaſonable Ranſom as their Eſtate would bear,
and in the mean Seaſon to be free from <hi>Gally,</hi> or <hi>Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
To this he ſo much the rather condeſcended as well,
as I have ſaid, for fear of further leſs and miſchief to
themſelves, as alſo for the deſire he had to recover
Sir <hi>Richard Granvill,</hi> whom for his notable valour he
ſeemed greatly to Honour and Admire.</p>
               <p>When this anſwer was returned, and that ſafety of
Life was promiſed, the Common ſort being now at
the end of their Perill, the moſt drew back from Sir
<hi>Richard,</hi> and the <hi>Maſter Gunner;</hi> being no hard matter
to diſſwade men from Death to Life. The <hi>Maſter
Gunner</hi> finding himſelf and Sir <hi>Richard</hi> thus prevented
and Maſtered by the greater number, would have ſlain
himſelf with a Sword, had he not been by force with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
and locked into his Cabbin. Then the Generall
ſent many Boats aboard the <hi>Revenge,</hi> and divers of
our men fearing Sir <hi>Richards</hi> diſpoſition, Stole away
aboard the General and other Ships; Sir <hi>Richard</hi> thus
over-matched was ſent unto by <hi>Alfonſo Bazan</hi> to remove
out of the <hi>Revenge,</hi> the Ship being Marvellous unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory,
filled with Blood and Bodies of Dead, and Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men like a Slaughter houſe. Sir <hi>Richard</hi> anſwered,
that he might do with his Body what he liſt, for he
eſteemed it not, and as he was carried out of the Ship
he Sounded, and Reviving again deſired the Company
to pray for him. The General uſed Sir <hi>Richard</hi> with
all Humanity, and left nothing unattempted that tended
to his Recovery, highly commending his Valour and
worthineſs, and greatly bewailing the danger wherein
he was, being unto them a Rare Spectacle, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
ſeldom approved, to ſee one Ship turn towards
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98226:25"/>
ſo many Enemies, to endure the charge and boording
of ſo many huge <hi>Armadas,</hi> and to reſiſt and repell the
aſſaults and entries of ſo many Souldiers. All which
and more is confirmed by a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain of the ſame
<hi>Armada,</hi> and a preſent actor in the fight, who being
ſevered from the Reſt in a Storm, was by the <hi>Lion of
London,</hi> a ſmall Ship, taken, &amp; is now Priſoner in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The General Commander of the <hi>Armada,</hi> was <hi>Don
Alphonſo Bazan,</hi> Brother to the Marqueſs of <hi>Santa Cruz.</hi>
The Admiral of the <hi>Biſcaine Squadron,</hi> was <hi>Britandona,</hi>
of the <hi>Squadron</hi> of <hi>Sivil</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Arumburch.</hi>
The <hi>Hulks</hi> and <hi>Flyboats</hi> were Commanded by <hi>Luis
Coutinho.</hi> There were Slain and Drowned in this fight,
well near One Thouſand of the Enemies, and Two
ſpecial Commanders <hi>Don Luis de Sant John,</hi> and <hi>Don
George de Prunaria de Mallaga,</hi> as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain
confeſſeth, beſides divers others of ſpecial account,
whereof as yet report is not made.</p>
               <p>The Admiral of the <hi>Hulks</hi> and the <hi>Aſcenſion of Sivil</hi>
were both Sunk by the ſide of the <hi>Revenge;</hi> one other
recovered the Rode of <hi>Saint Michael,</hi> and ſunk alſo
there; a fourth ran her ſelf with the Shore to ſave her
men. Sir <hi>Richard</hi> died, as it is ſaid, the Second or Third
day aboard the General, &amp; was by them greatly bewailed.
What became of his body, whether it were buried in
the Sea or on the Land we know not: the comfort
that remaineth to his Friends is, that he hath ended
his Life honourably, in reſpect of the reputation won
to his Nation and Country, and of the ſame to his
Poſterity, and that being dead, he hath not out-lived
his own honour.</p>
               <p>For the reſt of her Majeſties Ships that entred not
ſo far into the Fight as the <hi>Revenge,</hi> the reaſons and
cauſes were theſe. There were of them but ſix in all
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98226:26"/>
whereof two but ſmall Ships; the <hi>Revenge</hi> ingaged paſt
recovery: The <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Flores</hi> was on the one ſide,
53 Sail of the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> divided into Squadrons on the
other, all as full filled with Souldiers as they could
contain: Almoſt the one half of our men ſick and not
able to ſerve: The Ships grown foul, unromaged, and
ſcarcely able to bear any Sail for want of Balaſt, having
been ſix months at the Sea before. If all the reſt had
entred, all had been loſt: for the very hugeneſs of the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, if no other Violence had been offered,
would have cruſht them between them into Shivers.
Of which the diſhonour and loſs to the Queen had
been far greater then the ſpoil or harm that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
could any way have received. Notwithſtanding it
is very true, that the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> would have entred
between the Squadrons, but the reſt would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend,
and the Maſter of his own Ship offred to
leap into the Sea, rather then to conduct that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Ship, and the reſt, to be a prey to the Enemy,
where there was no hope nor Poſſibility either of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
or Victory. Which alſo in my opinion had ill
ſorted or anſwered the diſcretion and truſt of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
to commit himſelf and his charge to an aſſured
deſtruction, without hope, or any likelyhood of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing:
thereby to diminiſh the Strength of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Navy, and to enrich the pride and glory of the
Enemy. The <hi>Foreſight</hi> of the Queens commanded by
Mr <hi>Thomas Vaviſor</hi> performed a very great Fight, and
ſtaid two hours as near the <hi>Revenge</hi> as as the Weather
would permit him, not forſaking the Fight, 'till he
was like to be encompaſſed by the Squadrons, and
with great difficulty cleared himſelf. The reſt gave
divers volleis of Shot, and entred as far as the place
permitted, and their own neceſſities, to keep the weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98226:26"/>
of the Enemy, untill they were parted by night.
A few days after the Fight was ended, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Priſoners diſperſed into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Indie</hi> Ships,
there aroſe ſo great a Storm from the <hi>Weſt</hi> and <hi>North-Weſt,</hi>
that all the Fleet was diſperſed, as well the <hi>Indian</hi>
Fleet which were then come unto them, as the reſt of
the <hi>Armada</hi> that attended their arrival, of which 14
Sail, together with the <hi>Revenge</hi> and in her 200 <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
were caſt away upon the <hi>Iſle</hi> of St <hi>Michael</hi> So it pleaſed
them to honour the burial of that renowned Ship the
<hi>Revenge,</hi> not ſuffering her to periſh alone, for the great
honour ſhe atchieved in her life time. On the reſt of
the <hi>Iſlands</hi> there were caſt away in this Storm 15 or
16 more of the Ships of War: and of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and odd Sail of the <hi>Indie</hi> Fleet, expected this
year in <hi>Spain:</hi> What in this Tempeſt, and what before
in the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and about the <hi>Bermudas,</hi> there
were 70 and odd conſumed and loſt, with thoſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by our Ships of <hi>London,</hi> beſides one very rich <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Ship, which ſet her ſelf on fire, being boarded
by the <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> and five other taken by Maſter <hi>Wats</hi>
his Ship of <hi>London,</hi> between the <hi>Havana</hi> and <hi>Cape</hi>
S. <hi>Antonio.</hi> The fourth of this Month of <hi>November</hi> we
received Letters from the <hi>Tercera,</hi> affirming that there
are 3000 bodies of men remaining in that <hi>Iſland,</hi> ſaved
out of the periſhed Ships, and that by the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
own confeſſion, there are 10000 caſt away in this
Storm, beſides thoſe that are periſhed between the <hi>Iſlands</hi>
and the <hi>Main.</hi> Thus it hath pleaſed God to fight for
us, and to defend the Juſtice of our Cauſe, againſt
the ambitious and bloody pretences of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
who ſeeking to devour all Nations, are Themſelves
devoured. A manifeſt teſtimony how injuſt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing,
their attempts are in the ſight of God, who
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98226:27"/>
hath pleaſed to witneſs by the ſucceſs of their affairs
his miſlike of their bloody and injurious deſigns pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
and practiſed againſt all Chriſtian Princes, over
whom they ſeek unlawfull and ungodly Rule and
Empery.</p>
               <p>One day or two before this Wrack happened to the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, when as ſome of our Priſoners deſired
to be ſet on ſhore upon the <hi>Iſlands,</hi> hoping to be from
thence tranſported into <hi>England,</hi> which liberty was
formerly by the General promiſed: One <hi>Morice Fitz.
John,</hi> Son of Old <hi>John of Deſmond,</hi> a notable Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
Couſin German to the late Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> was
ſent to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from Ship to Ship, to perſwade
them to ſerve the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the arguments he uſed
to induce them were theſe. The increaſe of Pay
which he promiſed to be trebled: advancement to the
better ſort: and the exerciſe of the True Catholique
Religion, and ſafety of their Souls to all. For the firſt,
even the beggerly and unnatural behaviour of thoſe
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebells, that ſerv'd the King in that
preſent action, was ſufficient to anſwer that firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of rich Pay. For ſo poor and beggerly they
were, as for want of Apparell they ſtripped their poor
Country-men Priſoners out of their ragged Garments
worn to nothing by ſix Months ſervice, and ſpared
not to deſpoil them even of their bloody Shirts, from
their wounded bodies, and the very Shooes from their
feet; A notable teſtimony of their rich entertainment
and great Wages. The ſecond reaſon was hope of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
if they ſerved well, and would continue
faithfull to the King. But what man can be ſo block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly
ignorant ever to expect place or honour from
a forrain King, having no other argument or perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98226:27"/>
then his own diſloyalty; to be unnatural to his
own Countrey that bred him; to his Parents that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
him; and rebellious to his true Prince, to whoſe
obedience he is bound by Oath, by Nature, and by
Religion: No, they are only aſſured to be imployed
in all deſperate enterpriſes, to be held in ſcorn and
diſdain ever among thoſe whom they ſerve. And that
ever Traytor was either truſted or advanced I could
never yet reade, neither can I at this time remember
any example. And no man could have leſs becommed
the place of an Orator for ſuch a purpoſe, then this
<hi>Morice of Deſmond.</hi> For the Earl his Couſin being one
of the greateſt Subjects in that Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
having almoſt whole Countries in his poſſeſſion; ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
goodly Mannors, Caſtles, and Lordſhips; the Count
Palatine of <hi>Kerry</hi> five hundred Gentlemen of his own
name and family to follow him, beſides others (all
which he poſſeſſed in peace for three or four hundred
years) was in leſs then three years after his adhering
to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and Rebellion, beaten from all his
holds, not ſo many as ten Gentlemen of his name left
living, himſelf taken and beheaded by a Souldier of
his own Nation, and his Land given by a Parliament
to her Majeſty, and poſſeſſed by the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> His o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Couſin Sir <hi>John of Deſmond</hi> taken by Maſter <hi>John
Zouch,</hi> and his body hanged over the Gates of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
City to be devoured by Ravens: the third Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sr <hi>James</hi> hanged, drawn, and quartered in the
ſame place. If he had withall vaunted of his ſucceſs
of his own houſe, no doubt the Argument would have
moved much, and wrought great effect; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he for that preſent forgot, I thought it good to
remember in his behalf. For matter of Religion it would
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98226:28"/>
require a particular Volume, if I ſhould ſet down how
irreligiouſly they cover their greedy and ambitious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
with that veil of Piety. But ſure I am, that there
is no Kingdom or Common-wealth in all <hi>Europe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but if
they be reformed, they then Invade it for Religion ſake,
if it be, as they term Catholique, they pretend Title; as
if the Kings of <hi>Caſtile</hi> were the naturall heirs of all the
world: and ſo between both, no Kingdom is unſought.
Where they dare not with their own forces to invade,
they baſely entertain the Traytors and Vagabonds of all
Nations: ſeeking by thoſe and by their runnagate <hi>Jeſuits</hi>
to win parts, and have by that means ruined many noble
Houſes &amp; others in this Land, &amp; have extinguiſhed both
their Lives and Families. What good, honour, or fortune
ever Man yet by them atchieved, is yet unheard of, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written.
And if our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſts do but look into <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,</hi>
againſt which they have no pretence of Religion, how
the Nobility are put to death, impriſoned, their rich men
made a Prey, &amp; all ſorts of People Captiv'd; they ſhall
find that the Obedience even of the <hi>Turks</hi> is eaſy and a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
in reſpect of the Slavery and Tyranny of <hi>Spain.</hi>
What have they done in <hi>Sicill,</hi> in <hi>Naples, Millaine,</hi>
and in the Low-Countries; who hath there been ſpared
for Religion at all? And it cometh to my remembrance
of a certain Burger of <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> whoſe Houſe being
entred by a Company of <hi>Spaniſh Souldiers,</hi> when they
firſt Sacked the City, he beſought them to ſpare him
and his Goods, being a Good Catholique, and one of
their own Party and Faction; The <hi>Spaniards</hi> anſwered,
that they knew him to be of a good Conſcience for
himſelf; but his Money, Plate, Jewels, and Goods,
were all Heretical, and therefore good prize. So they
abuſed and tormented the Fooliſh <hi>Fleming,</hi> who hoped
that an <hi>Agnus Dei</hi> had been a ſufficient target againſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98226:28"/>
all force of that Holy and Charitable Nation. Neither
have they at any time as they proteſt, invaded the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> and elſewhere, but only
led thereunto, rather to reduce the People to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
then for either Gold or Empery; whenas in
one only Iſland called <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> they have Waſted
Thirty Hundred Thouſand of the Naturall People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
many Millions elſe in other places of the <hi>Indies:</hi>
A poor and harmleſs people Created of God, and might
have been wonn to his knowledge, as many of them
were; and almoſt as many as ever were perſuaded there
unto: The Story whereof is at large, Written by a
Biſhop of their own Nation, called <hi>Bartholomew de las
Caſas,</hi> and Tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and many other
Languages, intituled, <hi>The Spaniſh Cruelties.</hi> Who would
therefore repoſe truſt in ſuch a Nation of Ravenous
Strangers, and eſpecially in thoſe <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which
more greedily thirſt after Engliſh Blood, then after
the lives of any other people of <hi>Europe,</hi> for the many
overthrows and Diſhonours they have received at our
hands, whoſe Weakneſs we have diſcovered to the
World, and whoſe forces at home, abroad, in <hi>Europe,</hi>
in <hi>India,</hi> by Sea and Land, we have even with hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls
of men and Ships, Overthrown and Diſhonoured.
Let not therefore any <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> of what Religion
ſoever, have other opinion of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but that
thoſe whom he ſeeketh to winn of our Nation, he
eſteemeth baſe and Traiterous, unworthy perſons, or
unconſtant fools; and that he uſeth his pretence of
Religion, for no other purpoſe but to bewitch us from
the Obedience of our Naturall Prince; thereby hoping
in time to bring us to Slavery and Subjection, and
then none ſhall be unto them ſo odious and diſdained
as the Traytors themſelves, who have ſold their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98226:29"/>
to a Stranger, and forſaken their faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
contrary to Nature and Religion; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that humane and generall honour, not only
of Chriſtians, but of Heathen and Irreligious Nations;
who have always ſuſtained what labour ſoever, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
even Death it ſelf, for their Country, Prince, or
Common wealth. To conclude, it hath ever to this day
pleaſed God to proſper and defend her Majeſty, to break
the purpoſes of Malicious Enemies, of forſworn Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and of unjuſt Practices and Invaſions. She hath
ever been Honoured of the Worthieſt Kings, Served
by faithfull Subjects, and ſhall by the favour of God,
Reſiſt, Repell and Confound all whatſoever attempts
againſt her Sacred Perſon or Kingdom. In the mean
time, Let the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and Traytor vaunt of their
Succeſs, and we her true and obedient Vaſſals, guided
by the ſhining light of of her Vertues, ſhall always
love her, ſerve her, and obey her to the End of our
Lives.</p>
