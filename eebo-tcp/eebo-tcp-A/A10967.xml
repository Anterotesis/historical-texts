            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For my part Right Honorable, some-what

I haue done, and by Gods assistance and the
lawfull fauour of my Superiours, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
to the displaying of her filthines more
and more to the world. For wel I see, which
that most Reuerend Father and blessed mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,
<hi>Maister Latimer</hi> did long since obserue,
that th'impudencie of this whore is excce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great and intolerable, and therefore,

               <hi>where occasion shall be giuen she is to

               <note n="i" place="margin">M Latimer his last wordes in his confer. with B. Ridley bout the Lords Supper.</note>, seeing
no better she will prooue. That which I looke
for at her handes, is but mortal hatred, for
my labour. For so do harlots requite such as of
good-wil, laie open vnto them their vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
that they may amend.</p>
            <p>And surely as in some thinges aboue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
so otherwise me-thinkes she doth nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
resemble the brothels and harlots of the
world, &amp; therfore diuinelie by Gods spirite is
entituled the whore of Babylon. For harlots, if
they loue you, and you will not with like loue
answere them againe, they will hate you as

               <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 39. v. 7. 8. &amp;c.</note>, and those

your selfe to lead an honest life, either solelie or
in holie wedlocke, and they will pursue you
with malice euen vnto the death, as the late

So this whore of Babylon, if you loue her
not againe, she louing you, she wil hate you euen

            <p>Of <hi>England</hi> this whore would be loued, but
<hi>England</hi> will bee chaste still with <hi>Ioseph,</hi>
and <hi>Susanna:</hi> and therefore <hi>England</hi> is
extremely hated. <hi>Spaine</hi> loueth this whore,
and <hi>Spaine</hi> is abused, shee sitteth on the
Kinges right hand, shee taketh his Crowne
with her right hand, &amp; puts it on her owne
hed, and with her left hand she strikes him
on the face; hee gapeth and gazeth on her,
poore soule; if shee laugh at him, hee laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,

not in those termes with mouth, as did
that cursed Pope, that they knowe were

knowen of vs to be verie Antichrist. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

haue the same roialties, dignities and offices
