            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So should we erect the frame of our actions vpon the foundation of preuailing effects, and not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing without a speciall limitation. For euen little children, that sport in the aire at randome can say, they meant to exercise themselues, or in emulation to shoot higher then their fellowes. This inciteth me (right Honorable) to anticipate their calumniation, or derision, that shall startle me with these que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, why I presumed like a seeled doue to flie at randome with such disguises, and amongst all others firmed my selfe on the sun-shining beautie of your house.

Therefore Great Lord let me I pray you behold you like a faire moouing Planet in a sufficient Orbe, from whose influence can proceede nothing but sweete presages, and if there be any thing in these triuiall discourses, that may boast of your acceptation, and noble construction, make me the prouder, because I come so simply naked

So that it cannot chuse, but I must incurre the like imputation, yea peraduenture ridiculous contempt; when I haue nothing to say, but for the glory of my Countrey, and seeme to maintaine a Position, which few English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men deny, and that I doe herein no more, then the <hi>Swizer</hi> or <hi>Sauoian,</hi> who preferreth his snowy hils, before the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">All nations loue their owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey best.</note> of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and rageth in his disceptation, if you ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vilipend his barren Mountaines and dangerous pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, or preferre any other glorious nation before him.

ouer all kingdomes, and people in such things, wherein God doth blesse any Nation, you now would a little procrastinate my iourney, and cannot but suppose me ouer-liberall and ouer-partiall in my iudgement, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if 1. either you are a stranger: 2. Or haue beene a Traueller: 3. Or looke no further, then on the bescar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and deformed face of antiquity as Authours haue wounded the same: 4.

Onely the methode I would vse is somewhat intricate, and the desire I haue to shunne confusion, will make a greater confusion like a true and modest Louer, who fearing to disclose her affection by her lookes, doth in that restraint make the next looke more passionate.</p>
            <p>But to the purpose. If you be a stranger, which you <note place="margin">1 Strangers.</note> may be either by ignorance, or nation: then peraduenture you looke no further, then what you see, or know, and not vnderstanding the honourable secret of our Countrey,

as <hi>Othoman, Barka, Allau, Tamberlaine</hi> and others, whose noble exploits made Fame flie about the world to divulge how glorious valour and vertue was in some worthy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ouer others. But amongst many hundreds, none ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained so much at the hands of history and report, as <hi>Barka</hi> and <hi>Allau</hi> both named Emperors at one time. For when many battailes had filled the fieldes with the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kasses of as many thousands, the people weary of such slaughters, and they themselues amazed at the crueltie, it was concluded betweene them to diuide the Empire, hauing indeed a world of ground to satisfie ten Emperors: but some Authors are willing to maintaine, that they scorned such partition, and so in a noble combat deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the controuersie themselues, till the Controuler of men and kingdomes made <hi>Barka</hi> triumphant, who in the next lustrum of his gouernment had by the beautifull <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tara</hi> a sonne for his mothers sake named the Author of Peace, and proclaimed besides <hi>Barka Tartarus:</hi> so that when he leauing three sonnes behinde him, gaue them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so leaue to diuide the Empire.

For although the <hi>Tartar Chrim</hi> would faine challenge affinitie with the <hi>Turke,</hi> expecting if the line of <hi>Othoman</hi> should faile the greatest share of the worlds magnificence: yet without question it is but a couert presumption, and the fanaticall hopes of some imposturing prediction: Otherwise hee dare not but acknowledge the Emperor <hi>Cham</hi> for his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame; and is affrighted, when he heares of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints

to his preiudice: As for his further enlarging his credit, because <hi>Tamberlaine</hi> was extracted from him, who conquered <hi>Persia, Asia minor,</hi> and <hi>Baiazet,</hi> it will stand him in litle stead to startle from his first obedience, as I said before, and helpe him as litle to intrude into <hi>Turkie.</hi> for all he diuulgeth, that the sonnes of <hi>Tamberlaine</hi> brought with them the daughters of the <hi>Persian Sophy,</hi> and <hi>Othoman</hi> familie into <hi>Tartary,</hi> from whence he is now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neally descended.

you, that the world is a stage of variety and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, whereon are placed more strange things of truth, then the wit and policie of man can invent to seeme fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: but as at a stage the spectators onely are a few in number to the infinite multitudes for the time excluded; so in the exploration of Countries not one amongst ten thousand either take the paines, or haue the iudgement to looke into the wonders of the world, and therefore I would be loth to exclude all enlargements of histories from the closet of truth: yet concerning those fabulous reports of Pigmies and Cranes, of men with long eares, one eye, one foote, and such like, the Iudicious take vp the bookes to read, as if they would excite laughter; and I dare be bold to maintaine, there are no such men or people in the world: but all Gods images are miraculous in this distinction of voice, reason, and an erected counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, with a proportion of shape, and what is not thus established, is meerely a monster, or a beast.

                        <p>Another will relate, how worthily their honest matrons liue after they haue had children, how euer they yeelde their chastities at the first to their louers for the price of an Elephant, which yet neuer exciteth any exprobation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.

                        <p>Another will tell you, that they once esteemed two sorts of wisemen, by the names of <hi>Samaraei</hi> and <hi>Bracha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> both which were charactered for <hi>Gymnosophists:</hi> but the <hi>Samaraei</hi> for their precisenesse were better estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Kings; for liuing more moderate then the rest, as eating neither fish nor flesh, it added to their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that the peace of their Kingdomes was established by their <hi>orizons,</hi> and the prosperity of the countrey con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed through their holinesse.</p>
                        <p>Another will demonstrate, how S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Thomas</hi> conuerted them to Christianity, how euer with the Syrians in <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> they haue since intermingled horrible idolatry, and vntill the Portugals came amongst them, would scarse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the most grossest abuses.</p>

Yet hath this idolatrous superstition acknowledgement of a God, whom they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest with a triple crowne, not yeelding any reason for the same, but that he commandeth Heauen, Earth, and Hell. The Iesuites haue taught them to baptize infants in some places, and to fast, wherein they are now tedious obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants (as barbarous people are best maintainers of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes and ceremonies) and they vse the signe of the crosse, but it is where they are enforced by the Spanish ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons,

otherwise, what I spake before of <hi>China:</hi> for all their silkes, clothes of gold, delicate beds, houses of canes, Serpents, Elephants, precious stones, minerals, pearles, perfumes, drugs, spice, sweet wood, barkes of trees, shels, nuts, and other things of estimation, I may with a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nn-like sorrow amplifie, concerning their turpitude and morosity. As for their cities, euery one would affoord a story, and I am vnwilling to runne into the errour of ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or miracle, considering your best Cosmographers haue onely extended the relations of others, and besides the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of contradicting one another, would now be amazed to see so bewtifull a face of many countries, which they left most glorious, so deformed: and so vnpleasant a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, as they imagined, so illustrious and exalted.</p>
                        <p>And thus much for that part of <hi>Asia,</hi> who are all Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, barbarous, inhumane, treacherous, haters of strangers, and so remote from the happinesse I would relie vpon, as my ioy exceedeth for not being a natiue amongst them.</p>

proud to be the reporter of the iudgement: But when the Queene vnderstood the cruelty of that doome, and from the tendernes of her sex began to compassionate the guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les soules, she was not onely amazed to see such an error seduce the wisdome of Gouernors; but stepped a litle more forward, and in debating the matter, brought them to a hansommer path of preuention, which was by exile to expose them to the fortune of the world, and keep the conscience cleare from shedding innocent bloud, which no doubt in time would once lye heauy vpon the most obdurate heart.</p>

the European Princes, and confirmed the Archbishops in the ostentation of a Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> and absolute power of the gouernment of all, which yet the secular Noble men not onely repined at, but sought by noble courses to preuent; and at last, when no deuise could make gentill the hard wound pullies of the Clergies ambition, they were resolute to effectuate it by force of armes, so that many contentions arose betweene the Byshoppe, Nobles, and Citizens, which ended not without effusion of blood, and ouerthrow of whole armies drawne into the field by particeans, whereby the Citie it selfe felt the smart of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like scourges, and saw her walles and houses puld on heapes of rubbish, according to the nature of rage and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the end of tumultuous vprors.

                           <p>It now bendeth like a bow, as you see our great Citie from <hi>Surreies</hi> side: the key before the wall is a place of great pleasure; the ports and ramparts worth the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, the Palace stately and magnificent, the houses beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and comely, the streets sweet, spatious, and well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, the Inhabitants ciuill, sociable, and superstitious. For amongst the Churches they are of opinion, that the three Kings haue a memorable monument, concerning the birth of our Sauiour, when they were commaunded to returne another way home, but comming hether it was the fortune and glory of this place, not onely to be their refuge from the fury of <hi>Herod</hi> in their life; but a recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle

for their bodies after death; but how the truth would proue all this ridiculous, it were pity to dispute.

                           <p>For although <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. had the fortune to imprison the <hi>Lantsgraue</hi> of <hi>Hesse,</hi> and by the seruice of the Duke of <hi>Burbone</hi> to possesse the Castle of Saint <hi>Angelo,</hi> and punish the Pope with a terror of vsurpation, euen ouer his spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all authoritie; yet was it a sudden greatnesse, and like the blaze of a bauin, lasted but a while.

                           <hi>Sauoy</hi> hath many other hills, as <hi>Aguabelle,</hi> and <hi>Agabellette,</hi> and is euery way full of strange and vneuen iournies, so that it shall not be amisse to deriue our discourse from the etymologie of the word, which may serue to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front ignorance, and enrich vs with the knowledge of things, which is no great burthen, but rather a happines, according to the Poet, <hi>Foelix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas:</hi> You must then vnderstand, that this strange and vnsauoury nation, by reason of the streight and narrow waies to trauell in, was euer subiect to theeues, and being slenderly inhabited had not sufficiency to protect either themselues or passengers from the confused rages of men addicted to spoiles and murthers: wherevpon it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the name and scandall of <hi>Maluoy,</hi> the ill or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheeuous way, vntill a worthy aduenturer of the countrey attempted a reformation, and shew'd these disordred people the strength of a more powerfull arme, preuailing so farre, that by his industry and fortune, these enormities were not onely purged, but the first causers remoued, I meane the robbers and theeues were either slaughtred outright, or publikely executed for a terrifying example, and as a reward to his vertues, the end of his labours had a quadruplicitie of blessings: First, the Emperor made him a DVKE, gaue him part of <hi>Italy</hi> called now <hi>Piemont,</hi> as if it would speake for it selfe, that it is a countrey at the foote of the mountaine, and inuested him with <hi>iura rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> not to be accountable to any Prince for his actions within his owne territories. Secondly, the countrey it selfe changed her title from <hi>Maluoy</hi> into <hi>Sauoy, quasi salua via.</hi> Thirdly, these incredible mountaines erected hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, entertained husbandmen, and cattle, and builded Chappels, where a man would imagine an impossibilitie

of footing. Last of all, it was stored with forts and castles, in such a defensiue manner, that some of them at this day rancke themselues in the highest forme of bulwarkes and and ramparts. But I must not thus passe ouer their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, nor vilipend their glory. For they boast of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Kings, as that <hi>Hanibal</hi> found <hi>Brunco</hi> disseised of his inheritance by his yonger brother, and so rectified that discord. That <hi>Bitultus</hi> or <hi>Bituitus,</hi> another King, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken prisoner by <hi>Q. Fabius Maximus,</hi> some 50. yeeres after <hi>Hanibals</hi> passage into <hi>Italy.</hi> And that <hi>Cotius</hi> raigned in the time of <hi>Augustus</hi> the Emperour, so that till the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> dissolued all gouernments of the West, these coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries remained firme in their former renowne, as part of <hi>Gallia Cisalpina:</hi> but afterward mischeefe was added to mischeefe, till it was concluded otherwise by time and worthy endeauours, as you haue heard: whereupon <hi>Chambery</hi> was the cheefest towne on this side the Alps, sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated in a delicate rich valley, full of Gentle-mens hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, on the other side of the mountaine <hi>Agabella,</hi> ouer which the traueller spendeth commonly fiue or six hours: it hath a handsome castle now manned with Spanyards, in the behalfe of the Duke, the City is orderly ditcht and fortified, &amp; by the fauor of a pretty riuer, hath commodity of a reasonable water, otherwise it is snowy through the countrey, and the people are <hi>Strumosae,</hi> as in <hi>Switzerland.</hi> The suburbs are not fully recouered of her ruines, which they were subiect vnto in the yeere 1600. when the King of <hi>France,</hi> as stomaching the cunning violence of the Duke of <hi>Sauoy's</hi> detention, of the <hi>Marquisat</hi> of <hi>Salust,</hi> came to <hi>Grenoble</hi> by the marches, and after good surueigh besieged <hi>Chambery,</hi> lodging in the suburbs, and commanded <hi>Villeroy</hi> to parley with <hi>Iacob</hi> and the President <hi>Rochet,</hi> about the

surrendring the towne and castle, whom at last the people compelled to a composition, as finding it impossible to resist the French forces: thus within three dayes was the towne, and within six the castle surrendred, and <hi>Le Buise</hi> a Gentle-man of <hi>Daulphine</hi> left for Gouernour: but the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of these actions was not comparable to the fortune of attaining mount <hi>Melian,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Katherines</hi> fort, two of the strongest holds that euer I saw. For mount <hi>Melian</hi> is <note place="margin">Mount Melian.</note> seated on the top of an high and rocky mountaine, the ditch bankes very steepe, and the defences consist of fiue great bastions flanked in most warlike manner, to which is but one passage, and that from the towne. The King (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the condition of men) transported onely with outward shewes, sayd it was impregnable, but vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himselfe afterward a little better, commanded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege it: so the Marquis <hi>Rosny,</hi> great master of the artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, drew vp seuen canons by the force of armes, and strength of men, and two batteries were made by <hi>De Bourdes,</hi> Lieutenant Generall of the artillery, against the bastions of <hi>Maiuosin</hi> and <hi>Bouillars,</hi> besides an old Tower, which had beene shaken by <hi>Francis</hi> the first.</p>
                        <p>The Fort was commanded by the Earle of <hi>Brindis,</hi> who had all prouision for his defence, and like one of <hi>Dauids</hi> Worthies, prooued an honourable Seruitor, had not the <hi>Duke</hi> failed, and brake his word, leauing him to such a fortune, as extremities accustome. For hee held it out foure months, after many thousand shot of fortie canons, whose voyces sounded out nothing, but terrour; and effects made way vnto feare and mistrust: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, seeing the French had too good footing to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued, a composition was condescended vnto, and the castle surrendred.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="97" facs="tcp:2947:58"/>
The towne of <hi>Aguabelle</hi> is scituated at the foot of a great rocke, as if it lay asleepe in the lap of security. By it <note place="margin">Aguabelle.</note> runnes the riuer of <hi>Arck,</hi> it was surprized by the good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours of the <hi>Signeurs</hi> of <hi>Crequy</hi> and <hi>Morges,</hi> not giuing them of the castle any leasure to burne it. At the same time was <hi>Conflans</hi> commanding the passage of <hi>Tarentaies</hi> and <hi>Carboniers,</hi> with all the straights of <hi>Morien</hi> in the Kings hands: but if you would know what pleased him indeed, it was the braue surprizall of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Katherines</hi> Fort, a gift as if fortune should open her lap, and bid him with cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse be his owne caruer. For it is scited on a high hill within six mile of <hi>Geneua,</hi> and not onely ouerlookes the Countrey, but raiseth her rocky sides in such a manner, as if it cared neither for battery, nor bullet, but would return them backe againe, as you see a man spit against the winde to his owne defiling.</p>
                        <p>Concerning <hi>Geneua,</hi> by the water it seems impregnable, <note place="margin">Geneua.</note> as washed with the pleasant billowes of the lake <hi>Lemanus,</hi> and yet made vnaccessable, by reason of certaine marishes, ouer which neither horse nor cart can trauell: by the land it hath all the helps of art &amp; nature, yet not without danger of treason and stratagems: but that I am perswaded God hath reserued it, as little <hi>Zoar</hi> was a city of refuge, when all the cities of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> were on a blaze round about it. So <hi>Sauoy,</hi> the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> and her owne treasons were all disappoynted, and it still remaines in the freedome of ablessed protection, boasting of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, then her 300. yeeres continuance in an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of religion, and that it retaineth the true method of the Primatiue Church. But to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Katherines</hi> Fort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. It consisteth of fiue bastions, which are not walled but ditcht. well furnished with artillery, and had 600. men
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:2947:59"/>
to defend it, who yet were in seuerall distractions, when they perceiued the confidence of the Kings army, not to take all that paines without further satisfaction; so they submitted to the clemency of Count <hi>Soysons,</hi> after the King was departed, to goe meet the Queene at <hi>Lyons,</hi> and thus were these impregnable places made the tennis-ball of fortune, and left vs this obseruation, that men, money, and endeauours, will ouercome all disasters, and make the very mountaines yeeld to heroike resolutions. This is that Fort, which was excepted in the composition between <hi>Sauoy</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> This is that Fort, that was to keepe the Countrey in obedience. This is that Fort, whose gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being denied to Duke <hi>Byron,</hi> startled his resolutions, and plunged him in the irrecouerable gulph of disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted treasons. The towne of <hi>Moriana</hi> is beautified with a Colledge, Monastery, and Churches, and tooke the first name, either because the people are swartish &amp; blacke; or the earth (like some places of <hi>Aethiopia)</hi> resembleth clots of pitch, and so indeede their swine are of the same colour. A little further lies <hi>Bramont,</hi> a city of that antiquity, that <hi>Caesar</hi> filleth some part of his Commentaries with her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. The passages to all these places are somewhat fearefull to strangers. For to ride vnder, and behold such mighty mountaines and rockes, to see the snow dissolue and runne downe with that impetuous force, making such <hi>anfractus</hi> and ruptures, that diuers hundred mils are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the same, to heare the terrible noyse of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, whose foundation is huge stones disseuered from the hils: to see the pine trees stand vnder like a carpet, ready to receiue the falling of the snow, is a thing both of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and pleasure. But for mine owne part, it startled me not at all, in regard I had marched ouer some moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2947:59"/>
and places in <hi>Ireland;</hi> especially <hi>Pen men mawre</hi> in <note place="margin">Pen men mawre in Wales.</note> 
                           <hi>Wales,</hi> which for the length of the passage, is the feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest that euer I saw, because the stony rocke hangeth ouer so many hundred fathome high, and the sea lieth vnder as great a depth: so that a quarter of a mile together, the way is not eight foot broad, and (as it were) patch vp in the broken places, with furrs and bauin, to keepe both horse and man from slipping. Besides, after a great frost you shall haue an hundred load of stones fall at once from the rocke into the sea, and almost batter the fence in peeces, which in the fearefull report, and sudden viewing by a new commer, must needs be troublesome, and indeed surmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth any place of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> or the Alps.</p>
                        <p>Thus much for <hi>Sauoy,</hi> whose eldest sonne is now called Prince of <hi>Piemont,</hi> hauing his court a part from the Dukes palace, with a small guard of <hi>Switzers,</hi> and liueth in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable eminence, knowing his father to bee an absolute Prince, himselfe a nephew to <hi>Spaine,</hi> &amp; neerly allied to the house of <hi>Austria.</hi> As for the Dukes iealousie of the power of the Clergy, and the Spanish encroachments, I am resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (like a smoothering fire) it will one day burst foorth into flames of despight, and did he not rather feare <hi>France,</hi> as a neere neighbour, and more dangerous aduersary, he would peraduenture attempt further into <hi>Italy,</hi> in despight of <hi>Spaines</hi> ouer-watching. But because it is a thanklesse labour to gleane the fields of other folkes haruest, and that you haue whole volumes of the Spanish, French, Low-Countries, Hungary, Venice, Portugall, and Turkish af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, I will entermeddle no further: onely I must speake a little concerning <hi>Millane,</hi> and so leaue <hi>Italy</hi> betweene the straights of her owne pleasures at home, and suspicion of forraine intrusion abroad.</p>

For this Pope was a <hi>Spanyard,</hi> by the name of <hi>Roderick Borgia,</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixt, whom the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Millane</hi> beeing an vsurper at that time, established in the Papacy, because they might bee assisted from him in all their demands.

All this yet hindred not the next iourney of <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth, King of <hi>France,</hi> who now pretending a very right to <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicilia,</hi> with much adoe was incited to passe the Alps, and take his pleasure in these plenteous fields, in which, that his walkes might be the more smooth, hee condescended to certaine articles with this Vsurper
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2947:60"/>
                           <hi>Lodwick,</hi> much about the time that <hi>Iohn</hi> the true Duke of <hi>Millane</hi> died, leauing behinde him one son and daughter, in whose minority <hi>Lodwick,</hi> as hee had before wrested the gouernment, now assumeth the title, had not his forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse beene somewhat intercepted by this French visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereupon he perswaded the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues were suspicious enough, when they saw the French Kings glorious entrance into <hi>Florence,</hi> to some interposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so both <hi>Millane</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> grew iealous of King <hi>Charles</hi> his proceedings, which yet could not bee so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly trauersed, but hee was made acquainted with their vnconstancy, and held his peace till a fitter opportunity. For now he was to make his pompous entrance into <hi>Rome,</hi> where the wals both of the City, and the Castle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Angelo</hi> fell downe miraculously before him. By which occasion, as if the sword of <hi>Iehu</hi> should kill the Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> is prognosticated, that by the hand of <hi>France,</hi> the enormities of the Church, and the monstrous abuses of the Clergy, should be winnowed and throughly fanned: but it should seeme there was a tricke of preuention put vpon him, and the name of an Emperour taught him another way to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Popes fauour. For 1495. about the 12. of <hi>May</hi> he enters <hi>Naples</hi> in an Imperiall habit, as Emperor of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> by the Popes grant and confirmation: but he had not possessed it fiue months, before there was a generall reuolt concluded against him, as at the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>Millane</hi> had done with <hi>Lodwick:</hi> whereupon the King somewhat fearefull of an Italian receipt, or other strange surprizals, returnes the next yeere home againe, with purpose to renew the warre, and reintegrate his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer losses: but the Cardinall of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Malo</hi> hindred it at that instant, had not the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> perceiuing how the

                           <hi>Venctian</hi> and <hi>Millenois</hi> triumphed for the departure of the <hi>French,</hi> incensed the King againe to punish them both 1497. which was also interceded against by his brother the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> who disclaimed in his owne name or person to disturb the peace of <hi>Millane:</hi> yet had not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient authority to diuert the Kings designes, and so the warres of <hi>Italy</hi> were renewed.</p>
                        <p>Now is <hi>Lodwick</hi> perplexed indeede, and compelled to prostrate himselfe before the <hi>Couchant Lyon</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> and lower then the same vseth so his submission, that the noble beast enclineth to succour him: yet in such a manner, as <hi>Israel</hi> assisted <hi>Iuda</hi> against <hi>Assyria,</hi> being fearefull of extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation her selfe; but as soon as the publike enemy was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, the emulation at one anothers greatnesse drew whole armies into the field: so playd <hi>Simeon, Eleazer</hi> and <hi>Ichoconon</hi> with the <hi>Romans,</hi> when their ciuill mutinies bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racadoed the streets with heaps of slaughtered carkasses, and filled the channels with the spilt-out bloud of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered men.

The castle was yet protected with the guard of 3000. men, and committed to the loyalty of <hi>Bernardine</hi> of <hi>Corte</hi> borne in <hi>Pauia,</hi> who by his good beginning gaue life to their opinion, which supposed it impregnable, and not to be taken by force. But what men cannot in the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they compasse with the Foxes skin, and thus farre deride both the strength of souldiers, and pride of fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, that where the minde may be corrupted vpon any tearmes of disloyalty, neither wals, ramparts, nor man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, can preuent the power and deceit of bribery. This appeared in the disposition or <hi>Bernardine,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Fresques;</hi> whom the cunning of <hi>Triuulce,</hi> and the disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing 20000. crownes, quickly diuerted from their first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions, and made a breach in the <hi>Citadle</hi> without mine or battery.</p>
                        <p>Thus was the French possessed of this Duchy without competition, or diffidence, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12 made his royall entry accordingly.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2947:62"/>
this vse may be raised thereby: How euer men satisfie ambition for the time, yet are they certaine of nothing vnder the sunne. Againe, when by indirect courses de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes are concluded, they must stand the better on their guard, and prepare their patience when any alteration startleth resolution: thus fared it with <hi>Millane</hi> againe. For as you see a glooing heat in Aprill changed on the sodaine to bitter blasts and cloudy tempests, so was <hi>Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zas</hi> iollity reuersed, himselfe surprized, taken and caried prisoner to <hi>Lions,</hi> where denied the benefit of a princely execution, and resolued nothing can be so acceptable to a man in misery, as a noble death, worthy the name of a Romane, hee dies at once, whether for griefe, or great heart, it matters not: yet doth the King of <hi>France</hi> pardon <hi>Millane,</hi> and at last keeps all in quiet. But the warres of <hi>Naples</hi> are renewed 1501. and the kingdome is diuided betweene <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Aragon,</hi> so that great alteration hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in <hi>Italy,</hi> and within two yeeres there is a generall ouerthrow of the French with the taking of the Castle at <hi>Naples</hi> by the Spaniard: yet is not <hi>Beniamin</hi> discomfited, but calleth his brethren together, and with more setled courages reintegrate their estates, and so the French make head againe, attending the good hower of a better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity.</p>
                        <p>About this time in August died Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixt of poyson, which he had prepared for the Cardinals: but his taster by mistaking the flagons tooke away both his life, and the pride of his expectation concerning <hi>Caesar Borgias</hi> glory, or his further desires to set the fuell of <hi>Italy</hi> on a blaze: After him to stint the strife of many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons expecting the Papacie, old <hi>Francis Piccolamini</hi> Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of <hi>Sienna</hi> was chosen Pope, by the name of <hi>Pius</hi> the

and title of <hi>France:</hi> so that howsoeuer some will haue <hi>Loraine</hi> absolute of it selfe, and no subiect: some stomach, that <hi>Burgoine</hi> is revolted: some repine, that <hi>Daulphine</hi> was vnited by donation: some confound <hi>Gascoigne</hi> and <hi>Guienne,</hi> abolishing quite the name of <hi>Acquitane:</hi> some remember, that <hi>Normandy</hi> was <hi>English:</hi> some presume of <hi>Britany,</hi> as a <hi>Principate</hi> of her owne: some make <hi>Sauoy</hi> afraid, when <hi>Geneua</hi> calls the King of <hi>France</hi> patron and protector; and some by diuision and subdiuision would extenuate her greatnes: yet is now all <hi>France,</hi> and the worthy Princes are resolued to keep correspondency with strangers, but suffer no new intrusion, nor any forreine claimes to preuaile at their marble table: I will therefore desist from any further vnwinding the yarne of strange bottomes, but spread a moderne cloth, and giue you some slender taste of her present dainties, whereby you shall not depart away altogether vnsatisfied.</p>

and boasteth of an Vniuersitie, but more properly of the great concourse of Merchants: It is beautified with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny monuments, especially the Pallace, wherein King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the second, the sonne of the blacke Prince was borne; and another without the Towne, a worke euer since the Emperor <hi>Galienus,</hi> and then supposed a glorious <hi>Amphitheater.</hi> The towne of <hi>Tholouse</hi> is more proud of antiquitie, and telleth of time before <hi>Troies</hi> devastation: yea remembreth since <hi>Deborah</hi> Iudge of <hi>Israel</hi> was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for her wisdome and gouernment. It hath now a well disciplined schoole, a court of Parliament, populous streets, and reasonable buildings, but indeed they seeme very ancient, and for some speciall structures may carry the credit of magnificence. The other townes are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and very good, except countrey villages, which are as rude as in other places, and the Pesant liueth like a drudge, not daring scarse drinke of the wine of his owne garden, lest he should not raise such profit, as would answer the proportion of his rent. But herein our English Merchant hath somewhat ouer-reached them: For they hire the gardens themselues, and make the best vse of them, not trusting their labourers and husbandmen to handle the presses, but as they be hired by the day, or great.</p>

The Marquisate of the Empire.

In these are numbred 228. great townes, murited with wals, ramparts, ditches, warlike ports, bridges, and fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. Besides, their guards are continuall, either of their owne Burgers, or Souldiers lying in garison, according to the proximity of the enemy, importance of the place, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of affaires, or inconueniences of the time. The vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages or dorps are 6300. beautified with embattelled Churches of many seuerall fashions, frequented with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourses of people, adorned with handsome markets, and priuiledged by ancient immunities, faires, solemne fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiuals, and neighbourly meetings; besides granges, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, religious houses, towres, and Yonkers mannor-pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The aire seemeth moyst, especially of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with the sea-coasts of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> yet not preiudiciall to the health of the inhabitants: for in the champaine of <hi>Brabant</hi> men liue an hundred yeeres. The Countrey is euery where visited with nauigable riuers, nor come they empty handed, but affoord delicate water and excellent fish: but what talke I of fish? when the large O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean is so nigh, out of whose store-house a man may take, without being called in question, or repining. It is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with many woods, affoording timber to build with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and the pleasure of hunting. It is smally, or not at all mountainous, except about <hi>Namurs, Luzenburg</hi> or <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault,</hi> It is fruitfull of corne, grasse and herbs, fit for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture for cattle, and medicine for health: yet in some places of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Gelderland</hi> full of heath, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is not so barren, but cattle are fatted with the same, and their flesh hath an extraordinary sweet taste: It is free from those creatures, which are either noysome, or dangerous to man, and wanteth none of those blessings, wherewith the God of all blessing marketh a Countrey:
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2947:72"/>
but a noble Prince, vnity of religion, and a quiet go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.</p>
                        <p>The Countrey of <hi>Limburck</hi> hath many names, and is a <note place="margin">Limburck.</note> prouince full of villages, it containeth part of the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Boloigne,</hi> the Marquisate of <hi>Franckmount,</hi> the Earledome of <hi>Haspengo</hi> and <hi>Lootes,</hi> with many other Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. There are brought into the lists 24. great townes, amongst whom we begin <hi>inprimis</hi> with <hi>Leege,</hi> situated on the <hi>Mase,</hi> as hauing a Bishops See, a delicate castle, &amp; many well-ordred edifices: the dorps are reckned 1700. besides Abbayes and religious houses: toward the North adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to <hi>Brabant,</hi> it flourisheth in corne &amp; hath some vines. Toward the South, neighbouring <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Lutzenburg:</hi> it is more barren, as intermingled with hils and woods, the remainder of that great forrest of <hi>Ardenia,</hi> of which so many fabulous accidents are recorded. It containeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers mines of marble and cole, and in such goodnesse of euerything, that a prouerb raiseth it selfe, to haue bread better then bread, fire hotter then fire, and iron harder then iron.</p>
                        <p>The Dukedome of <hi>Lutzenburg</hi> is for the most part mountainous and full of wood, in the rest well tilled, and <note place="margin">Lutzenburg</note> where they haue stocked vp the trees, excellent ground: what neighboureth <hi>France</hi> conserueth both their language and customes, the rest speake Dutch. The names of the Prouince and principall City haue one sound, but it is ill diuided, part on a hollow by the riuer <hi>Essa,</hi> part on a rocky mountaine: so that it proposeth no great vniformity: but yet yeeldeth a gracefull obiect, and in retaining the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Parliament, hath a preheminence of many greater and prouder townes. The next is <hi>Arlunum, quasi ara Lunae,</hi> as supposed, that they heere worshipped the Moone.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2947:73"/>
The rest are sutable, some for strength, as <hi>Thion</hi> on the <hi>Mosell;</hi> some for commodity, as <hi>Baston,</hi> the mart of the Countrey, and adiacent to the forrest; and some for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and orderly conueniency, as 26. others.</p>
                        <p>The countrey of <hi>Henault</hi> is sutable to the rest, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth with the same equipage of plenty and pleasure: the <note place="margin">Henault.</note> cheefe cities are <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Valenciens.</hi> To <hi>Mons</hi> is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the precedency, for antiquity, strength and riches: yet is it almost neere the center of the Land, and on a little riuer called <hi>Trulla,</hi> whose visitation makes the common people wealthy and industrious, especially in weauing of a stuffe called Sayes, which heere exceede all the townes of the <hi>Low-Countries. Valenciens</hi> is better sited on the riuer <hi>Scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> and is very spacious, well walled, and full of ancient buildings, the Citizens are great trades-men, and gaine much by the making of fustians, the rest are brought into the account with the number of 22. Amongst whom <hi>Binchium</hi> might haue showne you a goodly palace, erected by <hi>Mary,</hi> sister to <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, and beautified with gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of pleasure to these vses. To beguile idle houres, to countenance a solitary retiring from the great encombran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the world, to quicken meditation with a correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of time and place, and to inuite the body to a better aire, then commonly populous cities affoord, it was yet destroyed, some would faine say defaced, by <hi>Henry</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, King of <hi>France,</hi> in those times of desolation, when intestine mutinies could not be appeased without effusion of bloud, and the rage of Princes exasperated one another to sore reuenges. Heere is also the ancient towne of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                              </gap>aies,</hi> which flourished in the time of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. The rest are <hi>Charlimont, Manburg,</hi> and <hi>Philips</hi> towne, wherein the first founders, or rather re-edifiers,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2947:73"/>
made strong defences against the eruptions of the <hi>French,</hi> and were resolued to diuide the house of <hi>Burgundie</hi> for euer from the <hi>Flower-de-luce.</hi> Many other townes with the villages might be spoken of; but because there are few memorable things in them, I passe all ouer with such a slightnes, as is required in a man, that maketh haste out of an idle iourney, till he come to his place of rest, and better consequence.</p>
                        <p>The countrey of <hi>Artois</hi> did once absolutely belong to the <hi>Flower-de-luce,</hi> as by the antiquitie and scituation <note place="margin">Artois.</note> may appeare: But afterward in the contract 1529, it was patible of diuision, when the Emperor and the French King were weighed in the ballance of successe to set forward the renowne of eithers preuailing; so that when <hi>France</hi> was found too light, in regard that the false hand of fortune turned the scale on tother side, twelue pretty townes fell from the King, as stones pull'd from a ruinous wall, leauing the whole Prouince in hazard of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling too, had not the other part of the countrey succor'd it selfe vnder the supportation of <hi>Picardy,</hi> and now tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs of good corne, many riuers, much wood, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth of the raining wooll by the testimonie of Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> and others, who set it in the account of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                        <p>The Prouince of <hi>Namurs</hi> is plentifull of all things, that <note place="margin">Namurs.</note> belongeth to the vse of man, as if the horne of <hi>Achelous</hi> were not onely reserued here for a monument, but distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted abundance by reason of the vertue following the possession: it hath many iron and cole mines, of whose nature and condition this is obserued, that whereas other coales are extinguished with water, and enflamed with oyle; these are set on fire with water, and rebated in their
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2947:74"/>
heat with oyle. It hath onely fowre walled Townes, who dare thus lift vp their heads aboue water to keepe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies from sinking. 1. <hi>Namurs,</hi> scituated on the two ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers <hi>Mosa</hi> and <hi>Scambra</hi> vnited by a well compacted bridge of stone, retayning a Bishops sea, and keeping the solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of a Parliament. 2. <hi>Bouinum</hi> on the banke of <hi>Mosa,</hi> much defaced by the warres, being of late a rich, stately, and populous Citie. 3. The third is <hi>Charlemont,</hi> one of the strongest Castles in <hi>Europe,</hi> mounted on a high look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rocke, whose foundation is washed by the riuer <hi>Gillet,</hi> and from the Emperor retaineth both glory and denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. 4. The last is <hi>Vallencuria,</hi> whose etimology doth almost expresse it selfe: For here are all ciuill causes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and the villages of the Prouince bring their controuersies to be decided.</p>
                        <p>The Dukedome of <hi>Brabant</hi> challengeth a more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull description: For it hath 26 walled townes, and at <note place="margin">Brabant.</note> least 700 villages well inhabited, industrious people, and proud of their glory in retaining the presence of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta,</hi> and the Court of State in <hi>Brussels,</hi> where, by reason of the pleasure and conveniencie of many delicate foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, diuers well ordred pallaces invite you to behold euen obiects of magnificence, and the Noblemen boast, how they are better accommodated here, than in other parts of the countrey. <hi>Antwerp</hi> is scited on the riuer <hi>Scaldis,</hi> and so glorious for goodly buildings, famous marts, a beautifull Statehouse, delicate Churches, an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for Merchants, an house for Englishmen, a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull Cittadle, an admirable harbour, and such like illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, that not long since it stroue for the Coronet of <hi>Europe,</hi> and to be the Queene of Townes. <hi>Louaine</hi> is very populous, and graced with an Vniuersitie, which the

Duke of <hi>Brabant, Iohn</hi> the 4. erected. <hi>Mechline</hi> hath her estimation from the assembly of States, and deciding of controuersies. <hi>Busumduce,</hi> a towne of note for a publike schoole, and the peoples meeting to solemnize triumphs. <hi>Tiena,</hi> neighbouring the riuer <hi>Geta,</hi> from whence the cheese hath a particular estimation. <hi>Leuua,</hi> famous for drinke brewed there. <hi>Niuella,</hi> proud of a monasterie only of noble women. <hi>Arscot</hi> by the riuer <hi>Demera,</hi> in times past a <hi>Marquisate,</hi> but by the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> aduanced to a Duchy. <hi>Berghen-op-zoome,</hi> named so for the kisses of the riuer that saluteth it, and famous for the auncient Marte, and frequentation of Merchants; yet since <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi> flourished vtterly decaied. <hi>Megen,</hi> a place of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, glorying in the passages of the riuer, playing the wanton with her shores, and running vp and downe, as if it brought glad tidings of prosperitie. <hi>Breda,</hi> a towne of delicacie; yet may you in respect of her building adde the Epithet of magnificent. <hi>Steneberg</hi> vpon the sea, which once had wealth enough to invite Merchants to a banquet of commercing. <hi>Lira,</hi> a place so sufficiently pleasant, that diuers Noblemen haue retired thither, as repining against the troubles, which debarred them from more oftner entercourses. <hi>Vileuord</hi> raiseth her fame from the strength of a well scituated Castle, and the feare of a soule-terrifying prison. <hi>Gembloures</hi> can shew you a Lord Abbot, as free and imperious, as a Count Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine in his iurisdiction. <hi>Iudoigna</hi> boasteth of her nurse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Princes, and that the wholesomnes of her aire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiteth them to an abode of wantonnes and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Hannutum</hi> maintaineth the credit and estimation of an Earledome, and addeth withall the blessing of a most fertile countrey. <hi>Landen</hi> lifteth vp the head of age
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:2947:75"/>
in such a manner, that shee warranteth her selfe the first, though not the best of Townes. <hi>Halen</hi> is notorious for the warres and many deuastations by battery of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and breaches made in her walls and bulwarks. <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It retaineth the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and aduanceth the walls of 28 Cities, plowing the fields of 1200 villages, whose enclosures yeeld plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of grasse toward the West, and bringeth forth strong oxen for tillage, and horses for seruice, as you may see by

their beautifull mares, of whom we make such good triall, and vse in our Carosses. The blessings of milke and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fill their cups euen to ouer-flowing, and the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of wheat might once haue told them, that it was no miracle, when <hi>Isaac</hi> sowed in the land of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and receiued a 100 for one, because they haue reaped, and found after haruest 60 for one. The people are gentle, and the women streight and comely: their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sbandry is graced with the sale of linnen cloth, and their Semsters boast of bone-lace, and delicate needle-workes: but concerning the Townes the principall are thus the subiect of relation. <hi>Gaunt</hi> hath a wall of 9 mile cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, but possessing much waste ground is not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry populous, nor filled with houses, although three ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers are at strife for her partition, and making 20 Ilands of her territories, challenge one another for lifting vp most land aboue water: but in truth the inhabitants in her behalfe complaine of the misery of many sieges, and that her fortunes haue bin as it were tossed to and fro with extremities: For shee hath tried the seuerall dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of <hi>French, English, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Spanish,</hi> boasting of nothing so much, as the famous birth of <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> sonne of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and in the right of his wife King of <hi>Castile;</hi> and that memorable retreat, wherein <hi>Generall Norris</hi> with a few resolute <hi>English</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted the whole Armie of the Prince of <hi>Parma. Bruges</hi> for delicacie of buildings, sweetnes of streets, frequenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of merchants, and strength of walles did once sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe all the townes of the Low Countries, and still boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth, that howeuer her reputation is somewhat dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, she was yet the occasion of the credit and glory of <hi>Flanders.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2947:77"/>
Ilands, which are environed with water, and knowne by 15 seuerall names, against whom the sea hath much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed, and not long since with violent invndations swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed 300 of their inhabited townes; so that now you may saile by the steeples of Churches, and not knowing the reason, wonder to what purpose the Towres were so erected. There remaine now three principall, which are preserued against the rage of the Ocean with exceeding cost, and powerfull industry, namely <hi>Walcheren, Schouen,</hi> and <hi>South-Beueland:</hi> and foure inferior, <hi>Diuelant, Tolen, North-Beuelant,</hi> and <hi>Woolfersdike;</hi> which are graced with the prerogatiues of eight walled townes, whereof six continue their Estates Deputies for the whole County. <hi>Midelborough, Flushing, Camphere,</hi> and <hi>Armenden,</hi> which hath no voice, although it cry out neuer so loud, that it standeth with the rest in <hi>Walcheren.</hi> In <hi>Schouen, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rexee,</hi> and <hi>Bucers</hi> hauen, which hath likewise no voice. In <hi>South-Beueland</hi> which is the greatest and fertilest Iland, the towne of <hi>Tergowse;</hi> and in the land of <hi>Tolen,</hi> the towne of <hi>Tertolen,</hi> and <hi>Martins dike,</hi> which hath also no voice. These Ilands are preserued by the downes, which be certaine bankes of sand cast vp with the tides, and where there are no sands, as toward the south, the dikes are raised by the industry of man, and proportioned with equall height to the rest; all so rammed with mats &amp; casses of fagots 6 or 7 foote long, that it not only performeth the effect of their securitie, but seemeth an artificiall gracefulnes, and being so neere <hi>England</hi> is worthy the ouer-viewing. In times past the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>La Vere,</hi> and <hi>Flushing</hi> were onely at the Generall Councels of the countrey, now the places are supplied with Deputies, and new times haue giuen way vnto new orders: For these

The cheefest trade of the inhabitants is nauigation, fishing, and making salt: yet within the land they imploy themselues to tillage, and feeding of cattle. The people doe so multiply and increase, that they are compelled to inlarge their Townes, as well for their owne inhabitants, as frequentation of strangers, who since the troubles of <hi>Antwerpe</hi> resort hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extraordinarily; but if I should adde the brauery of fortifications, I should do them no wrong, nay I might augment their glory: For <hi>Flushing</hi> is one of the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest Townes of <hi>Europe;</hi> and <hi>Midleborough</hi> so rampar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and guarded, that a very militarie renowne is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted vnto them, and the Burgers themselues deserue well of all good reports.</p>

an Iland by the inundation of the sea, which with vngen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle violence (at that time) washed away whole fields of firme ground, and like a barren vnsatiate wombe, filled her paunch with aboue 200. villages: It is a beautifull long towne, and graced with the staple of Rhenish wine, corne and timber, brought in great, strange and long boats called <hi>Punts,</hi> which neuer goe backe againe, but serue in these ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers as a receptacle of diuers families, and many people who haue no other dwelling then on shipboord, &amp; if you demand how they liue the voyage ended, &amp; maintain their estates when the first businesse is determined. They spin, fish, follow the league with prouision, carry corne and turffe from towne to towne, and are employed for the vse of bridges, to transferre whole armies ouer riuers; but to tell you that some of them are 160. foot long, and haue three or foure diuisions or houses in one boat, would raise a suspicion, and peraduenture make you smile at the ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but admire the truth. <hi>Delft</hi> is so named of a ditch, cut out betweene it and the <hi>Hague,</hi> and is a sweet and pleasant towne, although the inhabitants are emploied for the most part about brewing, and spinning of wooll. <hi>Leyden</hi> boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth of her antiquity, as deriuing her originall from the Legions of the Roman souldiers heere resident, when the custome of warre, and the coldnesse of winter did enforce them to garison, and orderly sequestration: it is now an Vniuersity, beautified with walkes of pleasure and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence: yet cannot wash away the imputation of many trayterous reuolts and vnconstant resolutions against the gouernment of the <hi>States.

                           <hi>Holland</hi> exceedeth any countrey in the world, challenging no more circuit of ground, as may be ghessed by the yeere 1587. when there was 600. ships arrested in the <hi>Sont</hi> by the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and in 1588. it is well knowen, that in very short warning they supplyed vs with an hundred men of warre, as for <hi>Cales</hi> voyage, the third part of that Nauie was theirs: but if you looke further, in the West and East-Indies, in the hauens of <hi>Barbary</hi> and <hi>Affrick,</hi> in the <hi>Arches,</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in the Gulph of <hi>Venice,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the frequented places of the world, the <hi>Hollander</hi> aduentures, and is now a glorious Marchant and Mariner.

                           <hi>Vtrech</hi> is principall, as retaining an ancient Bishops See, and shewing the ruines of a castle, erected to suppresse the insolency of the inhabitants, who in a pride of their owne greatnesse, made a continuall sport of rebellion, it is now vtterly defaced, and the loyalties of their harts seeme more firme, then the workes of mens hands, assuring vs that so noble a citie and populous territories would yeeld a very ambitious Prince reasonable satisfaction, if it might bee commanded by the authority of a Monarch, and had the vnity of a well-ordered Common-wealth and Kingdome.</p>
                        <p>The Countrey of <hi>Freesland</hi> would require an ample dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery <note place="margin">Freesland.</note> to extract her originall, and relate her stories: so would <hi>Cleeueland,</hi> the land of <hi>Luke Munsterland,</hi> and some others reputed <hi>Neuters,</hi> that is, neither maintaining the <hi>Spanyard</hi> in his military inuasion, nor supporting the <hi>States</hi>

                        <p>The Prouince of MVNSTER hath some Townes well <note place="margin">Munster.</note> aduanced by the sea coasts, and many excellent harbours, wherein <hi>Ireland</hi> may boast ouer all the countries of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope:</hi> The grounds adiacent are very fertile, and in many places afford cause of ostentation; but more inward they are very barren and mountanous, full of boggs, wood, and other remote places, whose fastnes hath incited the people to ouer-great presumption: yet because of the spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnes with men desiring good order, it might be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and reformed, as enioying plentifull and sweet ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, full of fish, and some of sufficient depth to transport reasonable boates into the land.</p>

goodly riuer called the <hi>Shanon,</hi> being as I take it the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of any Iland in the world: For it fetcheth a course of 200 mile, and filleth his channell along the shores of <hi>Longford, Meths, Ormond, Limrick,</hi> and <hi>Kerry,</hi> yet serueth them in no great stead: For their shipping commeth no further, than <hi>Limrick,</hi> where it is fiue mile broad fresh water, and 60 mile from the maine sea, from thence small cotts, as they tearme their boates, carry their wood, turff, fish, and other commodities: but for fish, as Salmon, Breame, Pike, and diuers other sorts, I shall not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued to relate the numbers, and hugenes, by such as are enemies to obseruation, or the beleefe of the blessings of other countries. Within 20 mile of <hi>Limrick,</hi> as I take it, a litle beyond, the praecinct of <hi>Caher-Castle</hi> a strange rock hath taken her lodging euen crosse the riuer, and filleth the roome in such a manner, that almost the nauigation is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thereby: but what cannot men and money doe? and why should not these idle people be industriously im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to remoue the same, &amp; so free the passage to <hi>Ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:</hi> As for an obiection of impossiblitie; the iudgement of men hath yeelded to suruey, and many examples haue confirmed the effects of more laborious attempts.

On the other side the County of <hi>Maio</hi> consorteth with the pleasingest place in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, by whose beaten banks lye those famous <hi>Ilands of life,</hi> of whom a ridiculous tale is fathered, that nothing dies in them, so that when the inhabitants grow old, they are caried else where, which custome they haue of late su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitiously obserued both in these Ilands of <hi>Aran,</hi> and some other adioyning of the same condition, as they suppose.</p>

                        <p>Through the Kingdome generally the winter is neither so cold, nor the summer so hot as in <hi>England,</hi> by reason whereof Haruest is very late, and in the North wheat will not quickly ripen, nor haue they acornes once in a dozen yeere: their principall corne is oates, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly burnt out of the straw, and then trod from the husks with mens feete; of this they make their bread in cakes, being first grownd by calliots and drudges very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and beastly sitting on the ground, with the mill like our mustard quernes betweene their legs, and then vpon broad yron presses they bake the meale when it is knea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; which custome the best obserue in <hi>Munster</hi> with their cheefest corne. The continuall showers and mists make the countrey more dangerous to our Nation, debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the absolute assurance of wholesome aire, and the consequent health: seldome any frost continues, or snow lieth long, but on the mountaines, in which are great store of Deere both red &amp; fallow. The abundance of Wolues compels them to house their cattle in the bawnes of their Castles, where all the winter nights they stand vp to the bellies in durt: another reason is, to preuent theeues, and false-harted brethren, who haue spies abroad, &amp; will come 30 mile out of one Prouince into another to practise a cunning robbery. The people are generally haters of bondage, and beyond measure proud: so that the yonger brothers, and bastards, who are as deare as the other, scorne all endeuours, but liberty and warre.

not thinking it yet any disgrace to receiue a nickname at their christning, as <hi>Con Oneale banco,</hi> because hee was lame.

Then was <hi>Salomon</hi> in his royalty, when he asked wisdom at the hands of God, and distributed equity to all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when hee spake 3000. prouerbs, and 1000. songs, when he related the nature of trees, plants, beasts, fowle, fishes, and creeping things, when he appoynted the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his houshold, and Commanders ouer Prouinces, first 3300. then 300. lastly 250. as Princes and principall ouer the other, when the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> came to prooue him with hard questions, and brought him odours, golde, and precious stones: when she saw his wisdome, the house he had built, the prouision of his table, the sitting of his seruants, the ordering of his ministers, and their apparrell, his drinking-vessels, and burnt offerings, when there came
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2947:89"/>
of all people to heare his wisdome, when hee excelled all the Kings of the earth in riches, and administration of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, when hee blessed the people, and praised God in publike, giuing the Priests and Prophets liberty to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the cause of the Lord of hosts, and not permitting the corruption of the world to transferre them beyond the limits of true deuotion, and religious piety, and when he so ouer-looked &amp; ouer-awed all Officers of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that neither the mighty made their greatnesse a bar to descend to the practise of charitable actions, nor the better sort tooke ill example by the higher to practise vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>befitting policy, or oppressions of the poore: nor the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour had cause of clamorous repinings, or tumultuary insurrections against the gouernment, abusing the people.</p>
                     <p>Then was <hi>Salomon</hi> in his royalty, when he had built ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of store, cities of chariots, cities for horse-men neere <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> when hee went in person to <hi>Hamah Zobah,</hi> and ouercame it, and re-edified <hi>Bethoran</hi> the vpper, and <hi>Betho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> the nether, cities defenced with walls, gates, and bars: when he built the cities of store in forraine parts, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in all places expugned and depopulated by the wars of <hi>Saul</hi> and his father, or if you will, the house of <hi>Beniamin</hi> and <hi>Iuda,</hi> contending for the Diadem. When hee had 40000. stalls of horses for his chariots, 12000. horse-men for his guard, and fortified diuers places of garison, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining martiall discipline, and by example of <hi>Dauids</hi> Princely rewarding men of merit, not permitting the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of well-deseruers to mourne for want of acceptation. Then was <hi>Salomon</hi> in his royalty, when he built a nauy of ships by the red sea, when King <hi>Hiram</hi> sent him mariners, and they were entertained for their experience, industry, and knowledge: when they went to <hi>Ophir,</hi> and brought
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:2947:89"/>
from thence 400. tallents of gold, when hee ioyned the nauy of <hi>Tharsus</hi> with the nauy of <hi>Hiram,</hi> which once in three yeeres brought gold, siluer, iuory, apes, and peacocks, when he had horses out of Aegypt, and fine linnen, which the Kings Marchants receiued at a price, when he went to the red sea to view his nauy, when he mustred his chariots and horse-men, marching with his armies like an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour indeede, and making his peaceable progresses like a magnificent Prince. Then was <hi>Salomon</hi> in his royalty, when the King of <hi>Tyrus</hi> contracted a league with him, when the Aegyptians and Moores sent him presents, and all the neighbouring Princes combined amity, and were (as it were) either emulous of his greatnesse, or proud of his friendship. Then was <hi>Salomon</hi> in his royalty, when the cities of his Kingdome were populous, opulent, and full of delight, when <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> dwelt without feare, euery man vnder his vine and figg-tree, when they were many as the sand of the sea, eating, drinking, and making merry, when the people reioyced in mutuall entercour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, liuing with reciprocall obseruations, no man repining, no man malicious, no man iealous, no man elated, no man oppressing, no man insulting, no man ambitious, no man an Vsurer, or traduced for such raging sinnes, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are supported in all gouernments by Princes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, conniuency of Magistrates, power of authoritie, corruption of officers, and wilfulnesse of offenders: not that the times were so cleere, and free from abuses, as if men were Angels on earth, without errours or imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but that they liued in a more modest fearefulnesse for offending God, then in these presumptuous times, and durst embolden one another to make a pastime of iniquity, and vex the honest neighbour with a violent prosecution

of wickednesse: otherwise in all ages, times, and nations, as you endure at natures hands frosts, thunders, tempests, vnseasonable weather, barren yeeres, and raging invnda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; her hereditary defects: so must you tolerate the vaine-glory and prodigality of Courtiers, the couetousnes of Magistrates, the legall dissembling of Citizens, the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Artificers, the idlenesse of Gentle-men, the stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornnesse of Pesants, the contumacy of Souldiers, and such like offences, as inconueniences of life, and somtimes nationall vices, or customary sinnes.

As for the newer sort of Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, first for my selfe, they shall haue no such aduantage ouer mee, as to challenge mee for felony in stealing any wealth or riches from them, or exprobrate me of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for being beholding vnto them, and not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the same: Next concerning themselues, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they are not ashamed to fill vp their leaues with the lines of falshood, and maruell they are so litle acquainted

with honest trauellers, that may tell them the truth, or at least instruct them in an arte of seeming probabilitie; as for example: in plaine honestie I wonder, how <hi>Munster</hi> that learned man, and famous <hi>Chronologer,</hi> could be so deceiued or abused to talke of <hi>Pigmeies,</hi> of men with long eares, and one foote, and such like? I could name many others, as <hi>Sir Iohn Mandeuill,</hi> the description of <hi>India,</hi> diuers pamphlets of voyages, and peraduenture histories of acceptation, in which not onely absurdities passe for current, but vntruths and impossibilities carry the sway of licence, and approbation. Therefore (as I said) for my owne part, I disclaime them all, and either tye my selfe to my poore endeuours, or aduenture on such passages of ciuill authoritie, as come neere probabilitie and religion: onely in this I will play the truant with others, that as in vnknowne countries they fill vp the Map with gyants, beasts, monsters, and some strange battailes: and in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Chronicles they passe ouer the liues of their first Princes with only names, and peraduenture suppositions, because they would say some thing: so in these, or of these remote Nations, I will onely tell you what I haue seen my self in some cursory trauels, or learned of others, with whom by an Interpreter I haue of purpose entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned communication: As when I was in <hi>Turky</hi> I saw the Armie of the <hi>Tartars</hi> mustred by the fields of <hi>Scideret,</hi> and had the priuiledge of a <hi>Ianizarie</hi> to protect me from wrong, and be my interpreter for such things, as my wit and memory incited me to make vse of. At my <hi>L: Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors</hi> againe I presumed on a conference with the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Embassador,</hi> and as farre as my memory and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing was capable of instruction, made benefit of some relations: and going to sea to <hi>Alexandria</hi> there were

both <hi>Indians, Iewes, Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> aboord, from whom I catched what I could, supplying my desire of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties with their discourses: of whom concerning the purpose in hand, I learnt, that <hi>China</hi> was a great and oppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent countrey in continuall warres with the <hi>Tartars,</hi> ielous one of another, and an enemy in the highest degree to all strangers, yea so farre from hospitalitie, and pious inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to entertainment and commiseration, that they studie to circumuent their passengers, and come aboord with hypocriticall desire of satisfaction in nouelties, and then at aduantage either surprize the ships, or endanger the weaker company by ouer-mastring them, as many of our <hi>English</hi> both at the <hi>Philippines,</hi> and landing in <hi>Iapan</hi> haue had cause of testification: nor amongst themselues is there any such appearance of happines, or plenty.

But if you would be acquainted with the true condition of their tyranny &amp; imperiousnes, then looke vpon the new admission of their Emperours, into the sublime chaire of Maiesty, and you shall heare him commanding all his brethren to bee strangled before him, except one; reserued, if the time allow it, for propagation of children, who likewise vpon the <hi>Turkes</hi> suppliment that way, shall miscarry by one meanes or other: yea, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it happens, that when the aged father, or eldest bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is contented to admit of his sonne or yonger to the coparcinary of administration, or if you will, absolute power in the Empire, by reason of impotency, age, luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or other naturall defects, they are most inhumanly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with death, as <hi>Zelimus</hi> poysoned his father <hi>Baia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet,</hi> and the sonnes of <hi>Soliman</hi> the <hi>Magnificent</hi> shouldred one another into the pit of destruction.</p>

confessing that <hi>Mordecai</hi> had not bin rewarded; but secret politicians supplied the roome, intimating still and still matter against him, which kindled the fire of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ielousie to such a blaze, that nothing but his personall appearance could quench the same.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Viceer</hi> perceiued the danger of such ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watchings, and began to be acquainted with too many princely messages, he absented himselfe a while, and with dilatory excuses laid as it were open his suspition of the Emperors ielousie against him, whereupon followed an obstinate deniall of comming, lest the affaires of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes might be intermitted; and when that serued not the turne, he determined to stand on his guard, till at last the <hi>Gran Signeur</hi> was aduised not to regard him at all: whereupon the <hi>Mufti</hi> was called to councell, which is their principall Churchman, who together with diuers Doctors of their law resolued, that he was too dangerous to liue, and yet policie must be vsed in cutting him off: When the foundation of this building was laid, letters were contriued from the <hi>Prince</hi> vnto him deceitfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting thus much: That he had great cause to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the great Prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi> for his indulgent care ouer the house of <hi>Ottoman,</hi> euen in these suspitious times to prouide, that a man of such courage, wisdom, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity gouerned the sterne of the ship of his affaires, &amp; like a discreet pilot knew how to conduce the barke of the Common-wealth to safe harbour. He accordingly assumeth the glory to himselfe, with full resolution, that either the yong Prince durst not finde fault, or nothing was fault-worthy, like <hi>Aesops</hi> asse, who supposed, that the Lyon would be terrified with his braying. For at last he came to the Emperors presence into the <hi>Seralio,</hi> who was
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:2947:98"/>
taught to entertaine him with a politicall acceptation, which lasted a while, and with the continuance of 14 daies seemed to wipe out the print of former vnkindnes: But when the day of his fatall destruction approched, (after the yong Prince had bin a hawking, and meeting with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine inhabitants of <hi>Bogdonia,</hi> and the borders of <hi>Russia,</hi> who made petition vnto Him for diuers redresses, gaue them a kinde of audience) hee was sodenly sent for to a priuate conference, which he verily supposed, according to some speciall inferences, tended to that purpose: nor did he once rebate the glory of his former iollity, but went at least with 300 <hi>Ianisaries,</hi> and his other officers toward the gates of the <hi>Seralio,</hi> where by the way the <hi>Haga</hi> or <hi>Captaine</hi> of the <hi>Ianisaries</hi> met him to tell him, how the Prince was retired to a <hi>Caska</hi> by the sea side, and he must goe through the garden, and enclosure of Roe-bucks vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, which he performed accordingly, and neuer seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed once staggering in his resolutions, till he came to the yron gate, and saw his company prohibited to enter, and the gate fast barred, as soone as he was admitted.</p>
                     <p>Here he must needs passe through a guard of <hi>Capogies,</hi> who demanded his <hi>Semiter,</hi> which he furiously denied, and with increase of rage and choller railed vpon them all. But they being too well instructed to forbeare any such opprobrious speeches, spared a reply of words, and tooke an opportunitie to ouer-master him with the company, who most cruelly cut him all to peeces: yet some would raise the Emperors ielousie from a suspition of loue to his mother, who taking a fitting opportunitie, as was imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, came with him to admonish her sonne from his <hi>pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rastria,</hi> or accompanying with boyes, but belike they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it with vnseasonable wisdome; for in his furie he
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:2947:99"/>
spurned her away, and bad him remember, he was but a slaue. Some report that the first motiue of the <hi>Emperors</hi> displeasure was occasioned by reason of his buildings, which ouer-looking some priuate walkes in the <hi>Seralio,</hi> was both irkesome to the maiestie of the <hi>Prince,</hi> and a dore to let in his euerlasting hate, to which there wanted not the seuerall suggestions of many flatterers, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizers. But let his death, and the cause be what it will, there is no gaine-saying their wilfulnes, nor moderating their rage and tyrannie, witnes his fathers killing of his elder brother, a Prince of great expectation: but comming one day (though he did it with reuerence and teares in his eyes) to put him in remembrance of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> glory, and inlarging the Empire, which euery Prince had done sauing himselfe, the admonition was so vnsauoury, or the ielousie of his vertues so forcible, that he beat him to death with his owne hands, to the amase of all the Iani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries and soldiers: insomuch that the grandmother, a woman of excellent parts, who is yet liuing, had like to haue perished in the hurly-burly.

Thus he so followed the humors of this wanton woman, that at last the noble Prince <hi>Mustapha</hi> his eldest sonne was prohibited his presence, and his former chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren slightly regarded, in respect of hers: which when shee had fully apprehended, and politikely entertained, the next businesse was to make vse of the same, yea such vse, as cunning fauourites, and newly aduanced officers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triue, who suspecting some sudden alteration, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Prince cannot last long, care not by what meanes they enrich themselues, and many times runne in the race of indirect courses to establish their hopes.</p>
                        <p>Wherevpon shee wonde vp her wilfulnes on the pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent bottome of <hi>Rustan Bashawes</hi> ambition, who had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her daughter, and hauing likewise corrupted the principall <hi>Mufti</hi> to second her enterprise, they all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined a league of amitie, and proiected to cast the Empire on her owne sonnes: which was no sooner ratified, and confirmed betweene them, but on a sudden shee became very deuout, and being rich with the fauours and presents bestowed vpon her, proposed a meritorious worke for her soules health by erecting some religious monument or <hi>Mosque,</hi> which was intercepted by the high Priest, as

discouering the invaliditie of the same, because shee was yet a slaue, and therefore laboured in a busines, whose me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and effects must tend to the good of another. This caused such a dissimiled pensiuenes, that <hi>Soliman</hi> himselfe was in a manner exanimated to behold the darling of the world in such a confusion and heauines: shee againe well lessond how to act her part, filled the scene with teares of disconsolation, related all occurrences from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and finely vrged, how her godly zeale had certaine obstacles, which must be remoued, ere her former alacrity could gaine the field of this sullen meditation and vnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sadnes: whereupon the Doctors and Interpreters of the <hi>Alcaron</hi> were sent for, and commanded to deliuer the truth without praeuarication, who thus animated, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the secret most plainely, and with impudent asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerations concluded, that she had iust cause to complaine, &amp; insist on the meanes to procure her redress, which made such impression into the ouer-worne heart, and easily-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded disposition of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> that he presently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numitted hir, &amp; by sound of trumpet proclaimed her free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and so cheered her, that he might the better reioyce in her company. But when shee had thus raised her selfe vpright vpon the honorable steps of liberty, shee stood vpon higher termes, and was not ashamed to assure him there was another lesson to be taken out, than now to dally with her as his slaue: for being free it was against the law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> to be commanded as a strumpet, and therefore, how euer he could dispence with religion, and ouer-awe the same, shee would not, nor durst betray her soule, as a delinquent in such impiety: yet she prostrated her life before him, and was ready to yeeld her necke to the blocke, if so it pleased him to inforce it. Here againe
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:2947:100"/>
were the Doctors summoned, who maintained her cause, and with exceeding admiration at her piety and zeale fell humbled on the ground before him, with request not to cast her headlong to destruction, and damne her soule for euer, which so enflamed him, as <hi>Nititur inuetitum,</hi> that without looking aduisedly on the pretended mischiefe, and searching too narrowly in the closet of her deuises, in a foolish passion he solemnely married her.</p>

But to our Story. This Bashaw liuing in great pompe to the outward show, seemed yet much excruciated in minde with meditation on the latter iudgement, and the sauing of his soule, whereupon he communed with one of his principall slaues to the same purpose, admitting all free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of speech, and animating him so farre to deliuer his opinion, that at last hee attempted his patience in this sort. Sir you know, or at leastwise should know, that God at the first did chuse vnto himselfe a people called the Iewes, giuing them a law, priesthood, and Prince named <note place="margin">The doctrin of the Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices or mendicant Priests of Turkie.</note> 
                           <hi>Moses,</hi> who questionlesse is the Mediator still in heauen for honest Iewes imploring his assistance on earth; but when this wretched people despised the blessings of so great a God, falling to idolatry, and other horrible abuses, they were cast out of fauour, and vanished like smoake, or if you will, resembled, water spilt on the ground neuer to be gathered vp againe. Then did God select another nation called Christians, and admitted of their worthy acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of Iesus Christ, whom they suppose God and man, and borne of a Virgin, and in whom still the good Christian beleeueth; this caused their increase of wealth, maiesty, and greatnesse, till at last growing wanton with prosperitie, they tooke the same or worse courses with the Iewes, and by degrees became flat Apostates, so that God was weary of them likewise, &amp; gaue a third nation power to thrust them from their firmenesse, and disiointed their established foundation of religion, and happinesse: which was acted by the hands of Turkes, who succeeded them, and had likewise their Prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi> to instruct and direct them to loue the great God of heauen more religiously than the others, from whose supportation the maiesty you now behold, spreadeth the wings of glory
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:2947:102"/>
ouer the imperiall Citties both of Iewes, and Christians, namely, <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Constantinople:</hi> nay, if you looke into <hi>Asia,</hi> we haue <hi>Tauris</hi> and <hi>Babilon;</hi> and in <hi>Egipt</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse <hi>Cairo</hi> or <hi>Memphis,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria:</hi> so that no doubt we shall multiply blessing vpon blessing, if wee continue confident toward him, and his elected Prophet; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise some strange and barbarous nation shall expell and extirpate vs, as we haue vsurped ouer others. Thus then you see with what successe these three religions haue bin caried in the current of estimation both with God and man; namely the Iewes, who haue <hi>Moses</hi> to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for them: The Christians, who haue IESVS their Mediator; and Mahumetans, who depend vpon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and exaltation of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> But for you, that are of no religion, nay, haue denied the faith, wherein you were borne and baptised, there is sure no redemption, but the Deuill himselfe to fetch you away. Which answere was so distasting, although as you heard, it went vnder safe conduct, that the tyrannous Lord not onely commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to be broken on a wheele to shiuers, but inflicted many Christian slaues in his house with the like punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thus much for their crueltie amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: now you shall see their behauiour toward Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>

                     <p>When <hi>Soliman Catanea</hi> was Bashaw of <hi>Algier,</hi> Master <hi>Christopher Willoughby</hi> a Gentleman and Merchant of <note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby.</note> LONDON had his shippe and goods seazed on most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuriously to the valew of 50000. duckets, whereof many complaints were made, and diuers letters from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of ENGLAND in his behalfe; but still distasting an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers

But hee perceiuing a trecherous conueiance of the busines, procrastinated the Sessions, had not the Ianisaries and common Turkes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed

against our retardance, and vrged, that seeing the Officer suffred death there should be either a commutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of liues, or full restitution, which in the end cost 10000. dollers, 6000. for the French, and 4000. for the English, a summe that stopped the mouth of fury, and brought the Tigre at last to more lenity.</p>
                     <p>About the 20. of <hi>October</hi> 1607. the Viceer, that came <note place="margin">The Viceer of Arabia.</note> from <hi>Arabia,</hi> and had beene resident before in <hi>Gran Cairo</hi> presented the Emperour and rest of the Bashawes with many rich iewels, by which occasion the opinion of his inestimable wealth filled very quickly the dangerous eares of Repiners, and diuers murmured against him, as if hee grew too mighty for a subiect; nay, there wanted not malicious instruments to sound out the harsh discord of his ouerthrow by traducing him for many sinister actions in his gouernments; for ambitious insinuating into vulgar respect; for attempting to winne the Ianisaries by vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious expences; for releasing of slaues, in whom ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man had a propriety; for repining at the former Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceers supplantation; for complaining on the Emperours vicious louing of boyes, with such like: all which added but fewell to the fire, which at last consumed him. For within two daies hee was found dead, some said of the plague, some that he was strangled, some poysoned, and some that he entertained two vnwelcome guests griefe and discontent: Howsoeuer, his goods, treasure, children, houses, and all belonging vnto him, were seazed vpon to the <hi>Gran Signeurs</hi> vse, which confirmed their opinion, that supposed him murthered for his wealth.</p>
                     <p>The shippe of the <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> being in <hi>Zio</hi> about the beginning of <hi>Nouember</hi> the same yeare, was searched by Turkes for the Cooke, vpon a supposition, that hee was
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:2947:105"/>
confederate with a French slaue about his escape; but he denying the accusation was imprisoned, had his hands al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most flead, and suffered great torment to enforce a confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. At last meere hunger compelled the Offender to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer himselfe, and most voluntarily to lay the guilt vpon his owne shoulders, whereby the Englishman was after great suite discharged, otherwise no doubt he had felt the effect of Turkish iustice.</p>
                     <p>In the yeere 1605. amongst other Trauellers, and sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers for nouelties out of curiosity, a French Gentleman presumed to tell the artillery, and canons before the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinaw, as they lay by the sea shore, which was taken for so great an offence, that he had a 100. blowes giuen him on the feete according to the manner of such reuenges, and not dismissed without great intercession of the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.

For from their suffrages and obedience, the <hi>Gran Signeur</hi> is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: from their repinings, disorders are multiplied: from their partiality, a sonne deposeth a father: and from their mutinies confusion riseth, and like a swelling sea casteth downe the bankes of all gouernment.</p>
                     <p>The third sort are <hi>Capogies,</hi> employed as porters of gates, purseuants on errands, attenders on the <hi>Viceers,</hi> as <note place="margin">3</note> they sit at meat in their great <hi>Dowana's,</hi> which be open hals trauersed, as occasion shall serue with Persian hangings, and sometimes trusted with secret murthers, and such like dangerous businesse.</p>
                     <p>The fourth place is appropriate to the <hi>Spahyes,</hi> who are inferiour horse-men, with high fethers in their strange fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned <note place="margin">4</note> hats, somewhat more glorious then the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> their arming, as also the <hi>Ianizary,</hi> keepes some correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with the <hi>Persian.</hi> On foot, either bow and arrowes, and a semiter, or hargabush and a semiter: on horse-backe the very same, with addition of a shield made of sinewes, or the barke of an Indian tree, cast behinde at their backs, with addition of a pollax, hatchet, or iron mace, which are made like scepters: but, for the most part, none pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes to weare them vnder the degree of a <hi>Chiaus,</hi> who haue them in the city of siluer for shew, and of steele for execution.</p>
                     <p>The fift roome is supplyed by the <hi>Chiaus,</hi> a degree of <note place="margin">5</note>

honourable eminence and may ranke with our <hi>Barons.</hi> For they ride in veluet gownes, siluer-plated saddles, costly stirrups, and rich turbanes: with these I may almost equall the Captaines of castles, forts, frontire townes, bands of foot, cornets of horse, and such like Commanders, known by the name of <hi>Haga's.</hi> Heere also, though hee seeme to step a little higher, may be seated the <hi>Cady,</hi> who is a Iudge or Magistrate ouer criminall causes, ouer whom there is one principall called <hi>Cadeleskier,</hi> as our Lord cheefe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, in some places they haue also <hi>Sub-Bashawes</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his <hi>Sansacks, Trimatriots,</hi> or countrey diuisions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for maintaining his armies, or prouision ouer his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Then may you name with a little better reputation the Treasurer called <hi>Testerdy,</hi> ouerseer of customes, which is an office farmed by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> his <hi>Chancellor,</hi> Doctours of the Law, and such like.</p>
                     <p>On the sixt step ofhonour is the <hi>Bashaw</hi> lifted vp, who is a principall Viceroy, or at least hath beene, ouer King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes <note place="margin">6</note> and Countries, such as <hi>Arabia, Aegypt, Tauris, Tunis,</hi> and diuers others, both in <hi>Asia, Affricke,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> and <note place="margin">Beg, in Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish is great or honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> according to the dignity and maiesty of the place called <hi>Beglerbeg:</hi> these are euery three yeeres <hi>mansuold,</hi> that is to say, remooued. For as they be subiect to strange ouerseers, so they are not permitted to grow rich, and indeed seeme iealous of their liues and estates, if any extraordinary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or greatnesse be imposed vpon them, except the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw</hi> of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> who either is so permitted to haue, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his place hereditary, daring sometimes to doe actions befitting an absolute Prince.</p>
                     <p>The last and greatest place of account is a <hi>Viceer,</hi> who commonly exceede not fiue in number, besides the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi>

the Empire, and to whose trust all matters depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in controuersie are committed. But you must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that times haue altred their first strictnesse, when in the inchoation of goodnesse they resolued on a perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance &amp; stedfastnesse. For amongst the best of them, abuse hath bespotted that faire promising countenance, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-vailed that beauty, which shewed true Iustice, puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed extortion, and made adultery one of their haynousest offences, with fowle deformity, and new fashions of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. And thus much for their persons. Now to their customes, and generall conditions.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Turkes,</hi> by the law of their <hi>Alcaron,</hi> should drinke nothing but water, or water mixed with honey, which they <note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Turks, and their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.</note> call <hi>sherbert:</hi> yet the better sort haue certaine <hi>Iuliups,</hi> which be syrups of roses, violets, and such like, of which a spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or two will season a pinte of water, and is not onely pleasant in taste, but powerfull enough in operation: they shaue all their head, sauing one tuft on the crowne, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitiously imagining to bee pull'd vp to heauen thereby: they maintaine their beards with great formality and cost, and haue them in such reputation, that they sweare by them: they sildome doe any thing in vaine, or speake an idle world, but in a substantiall grauity passe the time, euen at their pleasure and sports: they sit crosse-legg'd, and so commonly eat on the ground, or higher bench: they hate prophanation, and will not suffer <hi>Christ</hi> to be ill spoken of. Their religion generally carries a reuerent shew, but no substantiall commendation, as allowing God Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, a father, inuincible, and creator of the world, and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ</hi> as the Prophet of his time, as <hi>Moses</hi> had beene before, but haue opinion that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was sent to them, as the last <hi>Mediator,</hi> with promise ofreturne to consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate

their eternity after 1000 yeeres, which time is almost expired, whereupon hee enrolled a booke called his <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> in which he bound together, both lawes touching re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and precepts for ciuill administration, with prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of disputing on their probability, and warrantize of the flourishingest Common-wealth vnder the sunne, vpon their obseruation; coniuring them to a strict obedience, if euer they hoped to thriue in glory and terrestriall maiesty, and attaine the blessednesse of an immortall Kingdome, and a trebled felicity in the world to come: wherein hee imitated <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> who compelled the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and bound them by oath to the resolute keeping his instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vntill his returne, which they ratefied by a solemne vow, whereupon coniecturing the subsequent good, hee banished himselfe for euer; or, as some suppose, threw himselfe from a cliffe of <hi>Olympus.</hi> The like wee reade of <hi>Empedocles,</hi> but with greater suspition of ambition, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede affecting a god-head, who cast himselfe into the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teres</hi> of <hi>Aetna,</hi> after hee had combined the <hi>Sicilians</hi> to the iudicious allowance of his decrees.</p>
                     <p>They loue their Churches, reuerence the Priests, make account of Naturals, dumb men, and Lunaticks, and must <note place="margin">Their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> not enter into their <hi>Mosques,</hi> either with their shooes on, or fowle hands, or any vnreuerent gesture. Amongst these the order of <hi>Deruices</hi> or Turners are of greatest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as men liuing a contemplatiue life, and no way tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported with mundane affaires. They celebrate diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious dayes, especially Friday, and haue many ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of preaching, musike &amp; solemne silence: concluding their seruice with a strange turning about, encreased by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from a slow stillnes to a violent circular whirling, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

to the modulent sound of certaine instruments, which haue a primordiall solemnity, and so by little and little encrease to a swiftnesse, in which time they with strange gestures looke vp to heauen, and when they haue done thus a quarter of an houre, all in a sweat they fall groueling to the ground, and haue certaine garments cast ouer them, to preuent taking of colde; then after a while they beginne againe, and so foure times together: the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp hath relation to extraordinary visions, and that they are rauished with high inspiration, forgetting the world, and all affaires in the same: the prostitution on the ground would acknowledge the vilenesse of mans creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and their humility to consider of the same: they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the ceremonie of praying for the dead, bewailing their losse, and bemoaning ouer the graues; they repaire to their Mosques or Temples foure times a day, and on Friday fiue: and they haue a solemne fast and a solemne feast, called <hi>Ramdam</hi> and <hi>Byrame,</hi> much about our Alhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-tide, at which time their Mosques, and the turrets, are solemnely furnished with burning lamps night and day, fiue weekes together: with diuers other particulars, much like the absurd ceremonies, both of Greeke and Romish Churches, consisting all in forme and outward adoration, as you shall heare anone.</p>
                     <p>They circumcise the men, &amp; in <hi>Arabia</hi> cut their women, they sell all things by weight, write Bias, like the ancient <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> read backward as the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and obserue many other customes of <hi>Moses</hi> Law. For their women are sildome or neuer seene abroad, except the meaner sort, who yet couer head and face (sauing their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eyes: what rich apparrell soeuer shee weares, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward garment is a long cloth gowne with wide sleeues,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:2947:110"/>
breeches, boots, or rather buskins, and an ill-fashioned tire on their heads: their hands are without gloues, their nailes and eye-browes painted, which they learnt of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> and all outward appearance most vncomely; but within doores they are more stately, and with a comely presence entertaine those which are to be admitted. Their marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are somewhat strange; for they neuer see their wiues, vntill they lie with them, vnlesse it bee such as are able to buy slaues, and keepe many concubines; and then expect no dowry, either of land or money, but <hi>vtensells</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents of apparrell, which are carried in delicate baskets on boyes heads, singing of songs in the street before the Bride, vntill shee come to her place of aboad. In which negotiation are elder women employed, and dare not but tell the truth, vntill the matter be fully determined. Thus are also their incontinences satisfied by entercourses of Pandars, yet for aduantage they haue brothels and stewes; yea, the very <hi>Balnea's</hi> serue for meeting places.</p>
                     <p>Thus could I runne ouer a large field of discourses: but my purpose is onely by demonstration to bring the defects <note place="margin">The compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison layd together.</note> of this Empire in question, for all their ostentation of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and proud boasting of magnificent gouernment, yet so farre short of our example and comparison, as they are from iudgement and loue of religion, who extoll it for the greatest, best, and richest Kingdome of the world. <hi>Salomon</hi> led the Vantguard of royalty, and like a noble minded Land-Lord, let happinesse to farme amongst all his Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants rent free. The <hi>Turke</hi> is so farre from augmenting the peace and plenty of his subiects, that as soone as any of them is but entring into the field of thriuing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, he puls them backe, and thrusts them doggedly into the dungeon of penury and wants. <hi>Salomon</hi> was an
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:2947:110"/>
honourable King, and sat on a throne to decide the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies of his people. The <hi>Turke</hi> is an absolute Tyrant, and neither commeth amongst them, but for glorious magnificence, nor admitteth any to approach neere him, but for pleasure and wantonnesse. <hi>Salomon</hi> had Princes ouer the Tribes, and the sonnes of Lords enioyed their fathers immunities. The <hi>Turke</hi> hath none of eminence, but himselfe, and the name of slaue obscureth all light of posterity. <hi>Salomon</hi> kept an order in his cities and townes, whether they were places of harbour, traffique, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; or for concourse, sacrifice, and reposednesse. The <hi>Turke</hi> alloweth none, or very few, with <hi>Decorum</hi> and glory of Citizens. In the dayes of <hi>Salomon,</hi> the Country-man liued at peace vnder his vine, and the <hi>Israelites</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number eat, dranke, and made merry. Amongst the <hi>Turkes</hi> nothing but feare and terrour is threatned, like a tempestuous storme hanging ouer the heads of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. For the cities lie deuasted, the townes depopulated, and confusion is powred out in full measure amongst them; yea, spred like a menstruous cloth, to make mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and true gouernment ashamed, so that if you returne to the ouerlooking the gallant fields of <hi>Greece,</hi> which in times past was a subiect for Philosophers and Poets to write vpon, except some few, namely <hi>Constantinople, Gratianopolis, Andrinople, Philipopolis, Gallipolis, Salenica,</hi> and such like, and heere and there a pretty towne in an Iland, the rest are vnwalled, the people vnarmed, their goods taken by force, their daughters reserued for incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, and the whole Countrey a true patterne of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, insomuch that the Inhabitants being Christians, in a manner creepe into their houses at a little doore through a wall, otherwise shall a <hi>Turke</hi> come and make a stable of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:2947:111"/>
his hall, rauish his daughter, abuse his wife, and consume him like a lingring disease, which washeth away the flesh, and leaueth nothing but skinne and bone: besides, he dare not manure the ground to grow rich, lest an intruder reap his haruest, and make his endeauours fruitlesse: so that though this great Emperour be so mighty in people, spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in territories, opulent in wealth, and glorious in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periousnesse: yet receiueth hee not the fift commodity of his countries, by reason the fields are vnplowed, the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards vndressed, the medowes vnstored with cattle, and the very trees vnpruned, all which were plentifully suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and compassed about with the embracings of husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry in the time of <hi>Salomons</hi> peace. Nay, such is the misery of corrupted times, that whereas the <hi>Turkes</hi> haue been euer a true and religious people toward their Prophet, obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the lawes of his <hi>Alcaron</hi> very strictly: in these dayes they are all transported with prosperity, and seduced with filthy and abhominable wickednesse. For they endure both sloth and idlenesse, augment their desires of inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, maintaine the extremities of gluttony, and will bee drunke, against their owne prohibitions and naturall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.</p>
                     <p>I haue insisted the longer on these Turkish particulars, because of all the Empires of <hi>Asia,</hi> and Kingdomes of <hi>Affrick,</hi> it affoordeth matter of discourse, and mine owne commorance amongst them warrants the truth of what is published, whereby you may thus conclude, after a sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary collection, that their Common-wealth may rather bee termed a coniuration of tyrannies, then method or forme of good gouernment: their Emperours masters of a slaughter-house, then fathers of the countrey: and their Gouernours such as the Iudges of <hi>Israel,</hi> when euery man
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:2947:111"/>
did what was best in their owne eies, then <hi>Iosua</hi> or <hi>Samuel,</hi> who washed their hands in innocency, either from doing wrong themselues, or winking at others vnder them, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the stories you haue heard, and thousands other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repeated. But if this will not yet exclude them out of our palace of happinesse, nor diuert their conceits, which are onely carried away with nouelties, why then let vs extract these fearefull particulars amongst them. First, that fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall <note place="margin">1</note> poynt of establishment, by murthering all their brethren. Next their ambitious supplanting their fathers <note place="margin">2</note> and elder brothers, and rather then they would bee disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted in their proiected drifts, thrusting them into a slaughter-house. Thirdly, the policy and cunning of their Concubines, who haue destroyed very worthy Princes for <note place="margin">3</note> degenerating persons. Fourthly, the raging cruelty and iealousie against <hi>Bashawes,</hi> neither permitting the lawfull <note place="margin">4</note> discent of the sonne, nor continuing long a constant opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion toward the well-deseruing father (for euen the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Cigala's</hi> themselues, had much a doe to keepe their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit without murmuring, and repining of others. Fiftly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the maine position of preseruing Iustice, their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting <note place="margin">5</note> by bribes and presents, euen to the peruerting of manifest causes, especially against <hi>Christians.</hi> Sixtly, the miserable estate of the country-man, and poore commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, <note place="margin">6</note> who are in as ill condition as their asses, fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to haue heauy burthens layd vpon them. And last of all, their confusion of diet, both for the time and <note place="margin">7</note> plenty, wherein nothing is gracious or acceptable, nor any thing worthy the name of a happy countrey, or weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy people. Now to the rest.</p>

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:2947:112"/>
and wretchednesse. First concerning religion, the maine point and foundation of all goodnesse, in the daies of <hi>Salomon</hi> they knew not what a groue meant; a strange altar was odious vnto them, and vntill his later falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from God, which was reuenged with the falling away of 10. Tribes from his sonne, there was no mention made of idolatry, and the very sound was a harsh kinde of discord. In <hi>Muscouia</hi> they are both ignorantly superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ambitiously affected to superiority: for although in that poore knowledge they haue, they euer depended vpon the authority of the Greeke Church, as by their Saints may appeare, which be Saint <hi>George, Demetrius,</hi> and <hi>Nicholay,</hi> to whom is consecrated one of the richest Abbies of the world: yet haue they presumed in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumpting the same to themselues, boasting of a bargaine by commutation, wherein the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> was contented to resigne to the Metropolitane of <hi>Mosco</hi> all his authority, and supremacy for a great summe of <note place="margin">1588.</note> gold. But see the iust iudgement of God, as he returned into Greece, he was robbed of the same, and most treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously murthered. Thus yet doe they presume of the glory of the Church amongst them, and in <hi>Russia</hi> thinke it sufficient to cry out IESV thou sonne of God: as for the Scriptures, in some places they haue the Greeke Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment onely, and heare of the Bible a farre off. For preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or interpreting, they know not what it meanes; and the common people beleeue any thing their Priests tell them, allowing of nothing but some ridiculous ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, strange fasts, and idle feasts. Concerning their Princes, oh how farre are they from the reciprocall duties between themselues and subiects, and those excellent prescriptions which <hi>Samuel</hi> prescribed to <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> practised to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:2947:113"/>
his eternall honour. For such hath beene the confused and disordred intrusion of these Emperours, that they haue without care of posterity, conscience, or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth shouldred one another from their thrones by treasons, murthers, deuises, and publique hostility. For euer since that old <hi>Iuan Vasellowich</hi> grew odious to his subiects, horrible stratagemmes haue succeeded, and euen <hi>Poland</hi> like a neighbour hath feared the burning of his owne house, when the next hath beene on a blaze; especially in the vsurpation of <hi>Borris Pheordiwich,</hi> who to aspire to the dignity made away <hi>Demetrius</hi> the second sonne to <hi>Vasellowich,</hi> and so from other monstrous effects of policy obtained the Diadem, wherein at the first by his bounty and worthy promising demeanor, he in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner blotted out the print of his former vniust proceedings, and taught them as it were away to forget the wrongs done to their lawfull Princes, till at last growing odious to the subiect, a new search was made, and a further hurli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burly about another Emperor confounded all estates, and for many yeeres hath turmoiled the Countrey round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. Concerning the gouernment, there is onely some forme of iustice, &amp; punishing of adultery; but so far from <hi>Salomons</hi> magnificense, <hi>Salomons</hi> pallace, <hi>Salomons</hi> proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>Salomons</hi> nauy, <hi>Salomons</hi> Nobles, <hi>Salomons</hi> tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and peace, and <hi>Salomons</hi> worthines in euery thing, that I am ashamed to name them for Christians. For the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, though they lie not with other mens wiues, yet they change their owne as often as they list, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the better sorte mainetaine many wiues, yet doe they practise nothing more then gurmondize and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, with Strumpets and Concubines, whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorte vnto in certaine stoues or hot houses, as the hotter
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:2947:113"/>
Countries haue Balnea's and washing places. Concerning their Citties? in a word both their Citties and townes are subiect to such bestialitie and confusion, that they seeme rather so many smoakie cotages, and Irish cabbines, then hansome dwellings, or conuenient places of aboad; and in <hi>Mosco</hi> it selfe for all her populousnesse, and large exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of ground, there is not any thing worthy the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or imitation, more then the markets of furres, and some rich ornaments of the skinnes of beasts; as for the Citizens, or Countreymen, I rather resemble them to some scattered troupes of a discomfited army, then men orderly disposed to the managing affaires either for mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all commerce, or noble trade of Merchants. And thus could I runne ouer all other particulars, but that I shall ouer-runne my owne discourse, considering there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a meere disparity betweene them and our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>

For although <hi>Aegipt</hi> hath bin counted the garner of corne, and that the watrey <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> hath dispersed her rivulets ouer many Countries, yea comming out of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> hath taken along sundry swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling fountaines to accompany her into the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> sea; so that diuers Historiographers haue numbred 6000. Citties on the bankes of the same, and boasted of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their Emperors, and mightinesse of their armies: yet (not once speaking of the barrennesse of the rest) could any of these places take vpon them any glorious exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a well compacted Common-wealth, or terrestriall happinesse of a Nation. For you may read, that when it flourished in the height of prosperity (as when there was a generall famine in many Countries) there was corne in <hi>Aegipt, Saba</hi> the Queene of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> came to visit <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in his roialty, and went away with admiration, when she saw the difference betweene her owne Countrey, and the blessednesse of <hi>Iudea,</hi> so that the particular relation of the Court, and gouernment, was occasioned from this Empresses willingnes to be instructed, and desire to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the King for his extraordinary magnificense, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Common-wealth: whereby I am not incredulous of their information, that report, how that many times the Parents sell their children to Merchants for corne, and at all times send the people to the market for slaues, which are bought vp at easie rates, and disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed ouer the world: nor will I much contradict their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that haue fashioned their Common-wealth out of an vnfashionable gouernment without law, terrour of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, ciuill institution, orderly precepts, and soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:2947:114"/>
louing of one another. For since they marched vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the colours of Christianity, it hath not beene much better, and except it be such as are borne vnder the same Climate, no man of a temperate Countrey can liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them. Their manners and customes I haue partly described, and could here adde, that howeuer they boast of their antiquity, as being the first Countrey inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by <hi>Chus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Cham,</hi> which in the Hebrew tongue signifieth blacke, and that afterward they changed their name from the sonne of <hi>Vulcane:</hi> I cannot finde ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any setled gouernment, or state worthy the imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or noble enterprises befitting a story, or slender praise. Howeuer they are commended for the first acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging a diuine power, and entertaining a religious Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and manner of celebration of sacrifices; I cannot see, that there now remaines any thing amongst them, but idle customes, and corrupted abuses, beleeuing the incarnation of Christ onely, without a better progression to sanctifying graces; and neuer disputing further then a barren obseruation of ridiculous ceremonies. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they haue some scattered Cities, and nobilitie in esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as the Captaines of their Souldiers, and Leaders of their armies, I cannot finde either orderly preseruation of families, or louing entertaining of one another, but rather thefts, rapines, murthers, and spoyling of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and passengers. Howeuer their Countries are very spatious, and haue a great quantity of ground with variety of people; yet is the barrennesse, and vnfrequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Citties a barre to their estimation; and as we say a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good is worth a great deale of badde; and one corner of <hi>Canaan</hi> equalled tenne times as much ground for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision, and plenty of riches. As for their tying their haire
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:2947:115"/>
in knots, their odoures, perfumes, sweet wood, spices, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liphants teeth, almugge trees, and such like; alas, there is neither milke, nor honey, neither good prouision for backe or belly, neither comlinesse of rayments for ornament, or necessity,; neither order for glory, or good neighbour-hood; neither prouision for hansomnes, or magnificense. To conclude in a word, it wanteth many things, wherein barbarous Nations (after their account) come neerer prosperitie, and retaineth nothing, which either happy kingdomes stand in neede of, or desire by way of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As for such blessings, wherewith God hath stored their Countries, and they haue corrupted the Merchants of <hi>Europe;</hi> I answere in one word for all, both for <hi>China, India,</hi> and themselues, that they resemble poyson throwne into a wholesome potion, which of it selfe had beene a <note place="margin">The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize from India and Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous things and such as we neede not.</note> preseruatiue, but now is a dangerous receipt, and not fit for euery one to drinke: or else they are like sluttish maskes, which couer more beautifull faces, and debarre one another from pleasing themselues with their owne natiue comelinesse. But say, that both iewels, pretious stones, perfumes, spices, mineralls, mettall, and other glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious riches are befitting the Maiesty of Princes, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of pallaces, the ornaments of Kings, and the benefit of Countries; I hope wee haue them in more abundance then themselues, and like the Seruant that proued better workeman than his Master, make more commodious vse of them, then any Countrey in the world: so that our Merchant is a noble aduenturer, and our Cities rather store-houses of blessings, then shops of wares: and as for LONDON it selfe, I protest, I rather wonder at it for her excelling prerogatiues, then commend it for a thriuing Emporium.</p>

You know how I haue already stept into her enclosures, and opened the very gates of her secrets.

For heere the cheefest
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:2947:116"/>
townes liue in freedome, and the Burgers boast of their wealth and policy, in manumitting themselues, and (as it were) sealing the honour of cheefe commanding; yea, sometimes contesting with the Emperor himselfe on their owne gates. As for the countrey commodities and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision tending either to necessity or pleasure; alas, the commutation consisteth in enriching particular persons, and smally to the augmentation of the Emperours Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, wherein all the tracts of auarice, corrupt mixtures, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-reaching one another, and putting off either refuse things, or paltry trifles, as the <hi>Italians</hi> call them <hi>Baggatini:</hi> are trod amongst them, and euen beaten smooth with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall entercourse. So that their marts and faires are so many boothes of drunkards, and instead of ships at sea, fill the fields with waggons of such strange creatures, who make their bellies as great deuouring gulphs as the sea, so that their eating and carowsing is farre from the moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mirth, which the <hi>Israelites</hi> accustomed, or the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian banquet, where none were compelled: but letting that passe, as an imperfection proprietory to the countrey and nation. I can traduce them further, for mangling the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of God bestowed vpon them, by the cuttings and hackings of many grosse sinnes, as vsury, rebellion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy, prophanation, swearing, drunkennesse, murthers, and such like: but especially for vilipending the high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the Almighty in two principall matters. The one, in murmuring and repining at strangers, not suffering any to haue any commorance, or dwelling amongst them. For how euer in some of the cheefest townes there is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious shew and formall entertaining of Marchants and passengers, who come stored with crownes to powre them into the laps of Inn-keepers, and houses of wantonnesse:
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:2947:116"/>
yet will they neither releeue the wants of indigent beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, nor permit Gentle-man or Artificer to dwell amongst them, or be entertained as a free Denizon, being a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of another countrey, except in some sparing cases, and times of necessity, wherein a bribe or great Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory letters preuaile, by way of entreaty and insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. The second is, their grossenesse and simplicity in refusing the right of Kings, and succession of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, debarring so the best of gouernments, which is the Monarchy, from ruling ouer them, and whereas they may alledge, that the suffrages of men are vncorrupt, and a Prince so chosen shall be the worthier, in regard his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues must be eminent, whereas the father may leaue a son compounded of so many vices, which ouerruling his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, shall make him odious: or otherwise he may prooue simple, tyrannous, dishonest, or irregular. First, it is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly erroneous, because we are not to contest with the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of Kingdomes about his <hi>Vice-Gerents,</hi> in regard, that sometimes as a fatherly correction hee permitteth a defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue Prince, rather then folding vp a sorer mantle of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, to spred it abroad to their more greeuous punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Next they haue failed in this also amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: for many of their Emperours thus elected, haue prooued doltish, lasciuious, cowardly, and rather mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Empire, then prouident stewards to augment the wealth and reputation of the same: nay, the best of their <hi>Caesars</hi> haue beene affrighted at the fulmination of a tyrannous Pope, and seduced with the imposturing cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of deceiuing Priests, and a corrupted religion, nor could they goe with the wise King to view his nauies, visit his cities, fortifie the townes, erect store-houses, or come neere the six steps of golde on <hi>Salomons</hi> throne, which was
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:2947:117"/>
most apparant, euen the other day, in one of their glorious Princes, from whom the house of <hi>Austria</hi> hath taken such firme rooting, that it hopes to spred so largely, and so high, that no daring hand shall presume to lop a bough, or breake off a principall stem. I meane <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, who for all his seeming corroborated mightinesse, quickly lost the loue of the Princes, and for want of ceremonies main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the glory of a King, was euen scorned of Pesants. The story is breefly thus. Vpon the report of the losse of his gallies at <hi>Argier,</hi> he had a purpose to re-enforce his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Charles the fift, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised for his meane habit.</note> and as the Poet sayes, <hi>saepe premente Deo, fert Deus alter opem,</hi> to hope, that as one misfortune had ouerclow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the faire shining sunne of his glory: another happy winde would ouer-blow the threatning storme, and make a serene element, which caused him to come into <hi>Italy,</hi> for his better and speedier passage, either at <hi>Ligorn</hi> or <hi>Genoa:</hi> but entring into <hi>Millane,</hi> a leane olde man in a blacke cape cloake, the people thronging to see a glorious Emperour, or at least some magnificent shew and pompous ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: they were so daunted to be thus frustrated, and in a manner scorned to bee so disesteemed, that they neither gaue him a <hi>Viue le Roy,</hi> nor scarse opened a window to looke toward him: nay more, when hee set forward for <hi>Spaine,</hi> indeede there scarse went a voluntary Gentle-man with him, and the very Waggoners put their thumbs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene their fingers, in contempt of his troopes, which is as disgracious a thing in <hi>Italy,</hi> both amongst themselues, and against strangers, as either the lie in <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Beco</hi> to the Gentle-man of <hi>Venice,</hi> whereat hee tooke such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that he neuer returned into <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Germany</hi> againe, howeuer some would impute it vnto his greefe, for not preuailing against the <hi>Mahumetans:</hi> or deuotion, as desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

to giue ouer the world, and not be entangled any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with disaduantagious encombrances. And thus you see, why <hi>Germany</hi> cannot match our example, especially as the Eagle flies now, with broken wings and bruized sides</p>

I must not now dispute, what it was in the flourishing times of <hi>Augustus</hi> and other Emperors, sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning contentment with the delicates of riches and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, till God sent strange and cruell Physicians to purge them for their surfetting in gormandize and wantonnesse, I meane the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandalls:</hi> nor will take vpon mee to presage what it might be, if some diuine power would ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her plights together, and make it one handsome and magnificent garment for a sole soueraigne: but shew her, as she is now loose, vnlaced, and hath her ornaments di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacerated, and euen rent from her sides and shoulders. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, it is far worse with them, then it was with the <hi>Israelites</hi>
                        <pb n="222" facs="tcp:2947:118"/>
in the time of the Iudges, when euery man did what hee listed, and hauing no King (as if they had beene embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the <hi>Tanist</hi> law in <hi>Ireland)</hi> ranne like sheep without a shepheard, and through the presumption of their owne forces, wrested the enheritance from the true heires. But more properly I may resemble them to the <hi>Anarchies</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> who through emulation at one anothers greatnesse and credit in the world, kept true prosperity indeed from a noble race and happy thriuing amongst them. For as in ciuill warres, while diuers factions fight one by one, all are in the end subdued; whereas if they did vnite themselues with a stubborne holding together, they might peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hazard and propulse the greatest strength, and raised forces against them. So in the plenties of peace and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes of happinesse, the best portion diuided into many parts will quickly bee spent, and a flowing riuer hath not that brauery, when it is cut out into small brookes, as in his owne streame running in a deep and fashionable chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell. Againe, as in noble families, when the mannour houses, capitall messuages, and populous Lordships de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to one immediate heire, the dignity &amp; honour of the same, is more and more vpheld, whereas if they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided amongst many sonnes, the glory would soone bee extinguished, and strength of the first firmnesse rebated. So fareth it with <hi>Italy,</hi> the very blessings affoorded by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are disioynted, and the diuiding it into Principates, hath also deuided her fortunes, and former credit of raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing beauty. For in one corner rules the <hi>Spanyard,</hi> at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end encrocheth the <hi>Sauoyan,</hi> on this side the <hi>Venetian</hi> keepeth all in awe, on that the <hi>Hetrurian</hi> Duke maintaineth a iurisdiction, heere the Church with the contraries of blessing and cursing locketh vp S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peters</hi> Patrimony, as
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:2947:118"/>
the Pope himselfe in the castle of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Angelo,</hi> there many petty Princes are iealous of forraine trecheries, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they doe maligne the common enemy, yet can they not agree amongst themselues, but repine with an emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous hate against one another.</p>
                     <p>But would I could vnite them together, and set vp the wals of <hi>Rome,</hi> placing her seuen hils in such an order, that the city might boast of twenty mile compasse, and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment lift vp a head, as in <hi>Daniels</hi> visions. Or that I might in a yeere of <hi>Iubile</hi> settle you vnder the wings of the Angell on the top of the palace, and shew you the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of Cardinals, the triumphs of a Popes inauguration, his stately carrying on mens shoulders, his triple crowne, and such like ostentous and pompous ceremonies with all the glorious celebrations of the other Princes, either at their owne elections, or entertainment of forraine Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, yet would all this come farre short of our example. For the very prouision of <hi>Salomons</hi> palace would exhaust the countrey, consume the commodities, and like a barren ground drinking vp the raine, deuoure the plenty of the land, and pull in peeces their best compacted husbandry, of which wee haue had many instances in former times, when <hi>Italy</hi> suffered diuers famines and want of corne: so that if <hi>Aegypt</hi> had not beene a store-house and garner of graine to let in a supplyment, as it were an vnlookt for way, the people had perished for lacke of food, and the countrey beene wasted for want of husband-men and til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage. Againe, say they could drinke in vessels of golde (wherein yet I finde them very sparing) and that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to expose the glory of some ambitious triumph. Wherewith should their cups ouerflow, considering their wines are not only small, but in such a penury and scarcity,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:2947:119"/>
that if the women and children were not not prohibited, or at least from the customes of modesty did not limit themselues, a stranger should either drinke water or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and had not wherewithall to satisfie their thirst. As for the <hi>Villano,</hi> he is glad of any water, and quencheth his heat from the muddy channells, which fall from the mountaines of snow, and are cleansed with much adoe by the swift courses of <hi>Eridanus,</hi> which sendeth her streames into the Adriatick sea, and makes a confederacy with other riuers for the same purpose, though the places require stranger titles. Many other defects haue, and must bespot this countries face, and debarre it from boasting of that happinesse, I would propose vnto you. For though the Inne-keepers daughter goe in a sattin gowne, and that the brauery of their women is amplified from their attire, as if the burs had golden kernels, and euery corner were full of silke-wormes; yet doe they neither eat good meat, feed cleanely, nor meet together with friendly neighbor-hood, or inuitation. As for ciuill gouernment and administration of Iustice, euery Prouince hath a seuerall method, and the pride of one anothers liberty and power to defend a delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent flying to them for succour, raiseth a presumption of strange committing offences, and perpetrating horrible thefts, rapes and murthers: so that whether they by <hi>bandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> or no; when reuenge or wicked instigation hath set any man on worke, the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> flies vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to <hi>Florence,</hi> the <hi>Florentine</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> to <hi>Mantua,</hi> and so in all the rest. And for the more peaceable Inhabitants, they sildome reioyce vnder a vnity, and very sparingly admit of any customes, tending to the smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of loue and true contentment: so that in a manner all the defects, which deforme the naturall beauty of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:2947:119"/>
may be heere lookt vpon with pitifull eyes, and much lamented with passionate heart greefe. As for those ostentous heapes of stone, which transport the slight cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of the ignorant, to beleeue that it surpasseth for ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, buildings, and outward magnificence, any countrey in <hi>Europe,</hi> when you come to examine particulars, you shall finde it onely, as we deceiue our children, in sugring ouer a little course bread, made in the forme of delicate manchet on the outside. For what saies <hi>Tacitus,</hi> cities are the men; gouernment, feeding; and obedience of people, subiect to formall orders and handsome ceremonies, and not houses or palaces made of lime and stone, vnfurnished of dwellers, voyd of hospitality, and iealous euen of one anothers best enclinations, when they are furnished at the best. So that besides all naturall imperfections: In <hi>Italy</hi> there is neither roome in the house for thy seruants, nor litter for the cammels, especially out of their frequented high road wayes, as <hi>Rebecca</hi> promised the steward of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> family: neither can you fetch the well-fed veale from the droues to entertain the man of God with the Patriark, dresse fine venison with <hi>Esau</hi> for olde <hi>Isaak,</hi> nor kill the fat calfe with the good father, that welcomed home his peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent sonne, which makes me remember a merry reason, by one of the same countrey, who being demanded why the muttons, calues, and other cattle, were so few, small, and leane; replyed very soberly, because the <hi>Italians</hi> deuoured the grasse in sallets, and robbed the pastures to deceiue the poore cattle: but in truth the sunne kisseth the ground with that feruency, and the fields are so matted with dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that for the most part the medowes are vnbefitting to satisfie much store of cattle, nor can feede oxen to any purpose.

For the least affrighting newes of a Pirat, shall detaine them three months in harbour, and an vnexpected storme driue them into euery Port and Iland. Thus haue I my selfe beene witnesse, that an <hi>English-man</hi> hath left two great <hi>Italian</hi> ships in the towne of <hi>Xant,</hi> for feare of <hi>Ward,</hi> supposed to houer about <hi>Sapientia</hi> an Iland adioyning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound for <hi>Scanderon,</hi> and sayled to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> vnladed, dispatched, and returned backe againe, ere they were on their iourney.

Thus could I tire you with distasting particulars against the reputation of <hi>Italy:</hi> but I meane not to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looke them with any maleuolent aspect, or disparage them, to bring my speeches within compasse of defamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but onely keep my example in practise, and conclude, that it wanteth many things (with <hi>Germany)</hi> to make it proportionable with <hi>Salomons</hi> greatnesse, and <hi>Canaans</hi> goodnesse.</p>

                     <p>If <hi>Spaine</hi> be the richest Kingdome of <hi>Europe,</hi> and that some of them boasted, when time was, in ouerlooking the beautifullest worke in the world, I meane the Chappel at <hi>Westminster,</hi> that their King was able to make such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of siluer: where is <hi>Salomons</hi> golde amongst them, or <hi>Ierusalems</hi> plenty? when siluer had no better reputation then stones, and euery man in <hi>Iudea</hi> was rich indeed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out abusing others, or others repining against them: where is their care to store the countrey, which questionlesse mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney would doe, from other exuberant prouinces, though nature had denyed them orderly prouision?

but euen in his gouernment of <hi>Millane, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Sicilia,</hi> the souldier wanteth, and many times is compelled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit one halfe, to purse vp the other: Is not all this ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for want of treasure (the opinion whereof hath made his pride swell vncontrollable) or orderly distribution? the spring from whence the fluent plenty of <hi>Salomon</hi> had encrease. Be not therefore affrighted at this monster opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, nor seduced with the vanity of report.

And thus much for their wealth. Now to the rest.</p>
                     <p>What hath <hi>Spaine</hi> worthy commendation, much lesse any prerogatiue of happinesse? why, <hi>Canaan</hi> flowed with milke and honey, yeelding such blessings of encrease, that the King not onely had his great store of prouision with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repining: but <hi>Israel,</hi> as the sand of the sea, eat, dranke, and made merry, and can this bee done in <hi>Spaine?</hi> The burnt hills and desart places will quickly answer the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the country-man hides his garlike and onions, as ashamed of his diet; the Citizen powders his fish, and buyes cheese of the Dutch-man; the Gentle-man is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted what he shall eat, and how much hee may carry home to his family; the Court hath much adoe to be supplyed, and many concussions are practized from the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue, to furnish the offices with reasonable allowance, and the whole Kingdome is sometimes affrayd to want

bread; whereupon certaine agents are employed, euen in remote countries, to bring in both corne and victuall, tempting both them and our selues with golde and ready payment of money: for which purpose onely is a <hi>prouiso</hi> in their acts of Parliament, concerning exportation of coyne, of which in truth though they haue great cause to boast, yet are they tied to so many inconueniencies for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wants, that in their best cities is neither good fare, nor good lodging, nor any thing worthy the name of a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. As for their silly praising of sallets, fruits, and herbs: I remember S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Roger Williams</hi> answer to an idle <hi>Spanyard,</hi> boasting of his countries citrons, orenges, oliues, and such like: I, but (sayd he) in <hi>England</hi> we haue dainty veale, and well fed capons to eat with this sawce, and many delicate dishes worthy the name of sustenance indeede. For God made the beasts of the earth to liue on the grasse and fruits of the same; but man to liue vpon them, and command all. So that <hi>Adams</hi> wisdome gaue them titles, and his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioriry prescribed subiection: but how? for mans vse, mans delight, mans necessity, mans conuersation, mans triumph. Thus doth oyle make a cheerfull countenance, wine a gladsome heart, bread a strong body, and flesh a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of bloud: thus was <hi>Salomons</hi> palace and tables fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and <hi>Dauid</hi> praised God for infinite blessings: thus were odours and incense prouided, and the loue of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren compared to the deaw and balsome of <hi>Hermon,</hi> or the costly oyntment on <hi>Arons</hi> vestures: thus in <hi>Peters</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he might kill and eat, and the Sauiour of the world li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued amongst Publicans, feasted at marriages, and allowed of honest conuersation: and thus had <hi>Canaan</hi> neighbourly meetings, banquets of triumphs, and times of publike and priuate celebrations. But in <hi>Spaine</hi> no such matter; they

For farre worse then in <hi>Italy,</hi> idle iealousie, filthy malice, feare of expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, arrogant menaces, wicked suspition, and such like, will debarre you from the pleasure of inuitation, from the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of entercourses, and cannot sauour the noble liberty of mutuall amity. <hi>Canaan</hi> had the temple furnished as God commanded, the Priest obedient to the King, the Prophets in estimation, and the feasts of the Leuiticall Law orderly celebrated. <hi>Spaine</hi> is polluted with Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme, and inuented that cruell office of Inquisition to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the Moores, or such as adhered to their superstition, is ouerawed by the Cleargy, and is so terrified with the thundring voyce of excommunication, that he durst not but put his owne sonne to death, to please the Pope. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> was a receptacle for strangers, loued princely solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and could not endure neither begger, nor whore of their owne nation. <hi>Spaine</hi> hates all men, or at least vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends them in respect of themselues, commits them to fire and sword, that exclaime against their stewes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation, and cannot order many solemne festiuals, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept at a Kings inauguration, a Princes marriage, or a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals iollity: where yet an <hi>Italian</hi> inuention shall fill a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with painted trenchers and dishes of <hi>China:</hi> but a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry belly may cry for meat, and not be satisfied.</p>

Amongst our selues before the conquest we had a <hi>Gueudoline</hi> Queene of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delia Vaodicea,</hi> and some other; and since two Daughters of HENRY the 8. Amongst whom ELIZABETH was such a Prince, that forrane report hath established her for the Miracle of all ages, howeuer some of our selues haue beene too sparing in her admiration, and enlarging her greatnesse.

Whereby I cannot but wonder, that neither example, nor precept can preuaile with them, considering in all kingdomes, with all sexes, and at all times such inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions to debarre the right of kingdomes from the true and indubitate successors did not passe without the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of intrusion, tyrannie, and wrong.

For howeuer they deny their owne naturall daughters this prerogatiue, by a contrary fashion they admit of stranger women to bee more imperious ouer them: as by the two late Queene mother Regents, and both <hi>Italians</hi> of the house of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices,</hi> is made apparant by lamentable experience: what the one contriued, and how like a firebrand she had like to haue set all <hi>Fraunce</hi> on a blase; the History is pregnant, and the Legend of the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> composed by that true hearted Frenchman <hi>Francis de Lisle</hi> a man of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, is most apparant; &amp; how the other is suspected is now no newes: But to the rest.</p>

                        <hi>Salomon</hi> made diuers nauies, went in person to view his shippes, had great custome from his Merchants, loued and maintained good Marriners and pilots, contracted leagues with forraine Princes, making the confirmation of them honourable, and performed all good offices, that
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:2947:127"/>
tended to the expatiating his glory. <hi>France</hi> wanteth ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, is carelesse of nauigation, raiseth few Saylors, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome attempteth voiages, or discoueries, and hath many times incurred the imputation of perfidious breach of faith, vnder that diabolicall position, <hi>fides non est conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanda cum Haereticis:</hi> as also that iesuiticall doctrine of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocation: witnesse their horrible massacres, the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning the Princes of the bloud, their tragicall warre, the inhumane murther of the Admirall, the Guisian pride, and the terror <hi>Francis</hi> the third was put into, when he was put into the Lovure. <hi>Salomon</hi> had that good order and obedience in his townes and cities, that he knew his cities of store, his cities of traphique, his cities of fortification, his cities of refuge, and his cities of composition. But in <hi>France</hi> both cities and townes with their inhabitants, and Merchants are vnfashionable, sluttish, dangerous, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, and the people neither of wealth, nor eminence: In <hi>Paris</hi> they dare talke of a Kings wantonnesse, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with tractates of Parliament, and State, call any Prince <hi>Hugonet,</hi> that onely saies the <hi>Nostre Dame</hi> is but a darke melancholly Church, and iustifie very monstrous and abusiue actions: Besides, to tell of their inconstant and refractary dispositions, would be too tedious, and sooner discouer their loathsome treasons, then preuent the customary, and mischeeuous practises of the people.</p>
                     <p>The peace of <hi>Salomon</hi> caused plenty, and that spred it selfe ouer all <hi>Israel</hi> like a shady tree, which as a double shelter kept backe the cold of winter, and tempered the burning heate of summer: so that it is apparant with the Kings magnificense at Court, the husbandmans peace and wealth in the Countrey was enlarged, whereupon most of them were <hi>Berzalites</hi> and would go no further, then ouer

                        <hi>Iordan</hi> with <hi>Dauid,</hi> but rerurne to their owne houshold, sit vnder their owne figg-trees, and bee gathered together into the graues of their ancestours. But <hi>France</hi> knowes not now what to say: For the Court is a meere mapp of confusion, and exposeth many actions more ridiculous then worthy imitation: as for the Countrey-man, hee is called a Pesant, disparaged in his drudgery and seruile toylsomnesse, liueth poore and beastly, is treacherous at aduantage, and yet afrayd of his owne shadow, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not free the vineyards from theeues and destroyers: yea, all the countrey swarmeth with rogues and vagabonds, whose desperate wants driue them to perpetrate many horrible murthers, although for the most part the Prouosts of euery diuision are very diligent. The wisdome of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> setled his cities, that strangers were admitted at all times, except in frontire townes, which peraduenture were guarded in the night, according to martiall disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, prouided that the passages were easie and secure, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of all complainants, and leuiated their greeuances, aduanced himselfe on a golden throne to entertaine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Iustice, allowed of the Prophets, who yet out of zeale cryed out against the abuses of the Temple and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and commanded the subiect, first to remember his duty to God; then his obedience to the Prince; and last of all, his loue to his neighbour: and this hee performed by admonitory preceps to enstruct the ignorant, and princely indignation to punish the obstinate. <hi>France</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth all to Parliaments and Presidents, excludeth the reformed Churches out of the walls of the cities, hath the name of Prophet in derision, suffered the <hi>Iesuites</hi> to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two famous Princes, permitteth them still a Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and from worldly policy excludeth true religion out
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:2947:128"/>
of doores. In <hi>France</hi> the passages are toylesome and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, dangerous for extraordinary robberies, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der officers shuffle vp diuers times most notorious abuses. To conclude, in <hi>France</hi> many particulars choak the breath of happinesse, from giuing life to a glorious Kingdome indeede, if the reciprocall duties betweene Prince and subiect were but easily extended: so that with these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects I cannot chuse but exempt her from sitting on any hand of <hi>Salomons</hi> throne. Whither shall wee then goe to match our example? or at least to come so neere, that a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill censurer will neither flatter nor detract: you know my first purpose, and I now determine to lead you into the sweet and orderly fields of <hi>England.</hi>

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:2947:128"/>
Iustices, and other inferiour officers: insomuch, that it hath layd an imposition on the endeauours of a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall scholler, and hee (according to the secret of satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) hath most worthily vnclasped the records of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and with such sufficient ampliation, that our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries haue beene silent in excepting against it. But to my first purpose: I say, that to match all the particulars, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I haue stored <hi>Salomons</hi> magnificence and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries prosperity, there is not at this houre any Kingdome in the world, so ready, apt, or worthy to take him by the hand, to pace out the measures of true glory and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as the Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning our glory abroad, what worthy voyages haue we made? I hope no people or nation euer equalled vs, witnesse S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohn Mandeuill</hi> into <hi>India</hi> by land; <hi>Stafford</hi> ouer <hi>Europe,</hi> much about the same time; <hi>Ienkinson, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby, Borogh,</hi> and many others into <hi>Russia</hi> and <hi>Muscouia; Forbisher</hi> and <hi>Hawkins</hi> to discouer the northerne passages: the <hi>Fenners, Ralph Lane, Iohn Clarke,</hi> and diuers into <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica;</hi> another voyage, where of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> was the proposer; our setling in <hi>Virginia;</hi> our traffique to the <hi>West Indies, Brasill, Peru, Caribana,</hi> and <hi>Guiana;</hi> Captaine <hi>Drake</hi> round about the world, twice or thrice; <hi>Thomas Candish</hi> the like, our trauels to the <hi>East Indies,</hi> or <hi>Philippines;</hi> the Earle of <hi>Cumberlands</hi> worthy voyages, &amp; amongst others, that to <hi>Santo Port-Ricco;</hi> the <hi>Portugall</hi> voyage; <hi>Cales</hi> voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; the Iland voyage, and sundry others; as in Master <hi>Hackluits</hi> booke about this subiect only. Besides moderne trauellers, both of Noble-men &amp; Gentle-men, although euery man is not a free Denizon of prosperities Kingdom, nor can boast of natures bounty in the gifts of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or fortunes liberality in disposing her treasures. If
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:2947:129"/>
you would see how our marchants are bestowed, look into all the Ports of the world, you shall find them setled, &amp; our shipping in harbour? If you could view all the countries of the earth, where men dare or can come, we are nobly dispersed, &amp; I beleeue might be pull'd out of the center of the same, if such a passage did euer excite man to explore for secrets, marchandize, or wealth. If you were admitted into the remotest palaces of Emperours &amp; Kings; yea <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> it selfe, <hi>English-men</hi> would salute you, and speak your owne language: and if you haue a purpose to affright idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with any enterprize in the world, especially to make them beleeue, that the hand of profit will fill their laps with plenty, <hi>English-men</hi> dare set endeauours on their best feet, and can tell how to tumble all blockes and hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces aside, which may either terrefie them from such enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, or detaine them from the glory of the actions: only heere lies a secret of traducing them, that a supposition of the wants of others, or feare of cumbersomnesse, when they meet with an indigent countrey-man abroad, hath debarred free conuersation, and doth make the mutuall supplying the necessity of strangers, a harsh-kinde of wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; yea, an absolute leauing them to misery, if they haue not bills of exchange or letters of credit, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare mischances.</p>
                     <p>But our glory abroad is truely expatiated, when you shall know how helpefull wee haue beene to other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both with purse and forces; yea, contrary to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the world, concerning our penury, opened the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closures of riches, and hononrably supplyed the defects of other Kingdomes. Wee haue made peace betweene <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> and pacified those troubles long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe. We haue releeued the Estates of <hi>Holland</hi> with men,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:2947:129"/>
money, and munition, vnderpropping them, as if a man should vndershore a ruinous wall, vntill the foundation were repaired. We haue assisted the Protestant Princes of of <hi>France</hi> in their first ciuill warres, and beene auxiliary to many noble houses of <hi>Germany,</hi> we setled the last King in his greatnesse, and lifted him vp to that honour, that none of his Predecessours had their crownes shining with such a lustre. We playd the Physician with <hi>Geneua,</hi> and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred her such an antidote, that no aconite of Pope or <hi>Sauoy</hi> could envenom her to death, or contriue her destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. We brought the distressed Prince <hi>Antonio</hi> to knock at the gates of <hi>Lisbone,</hi> and had he not found a fatall vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of times and occasions; yea, the minds of inconstant men corrupted with by-respects, and priuate following the stronger side, we might questionlesse haue preuailed in the proiect, and vpon the least filling the sailes of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation with the winde of home assistance, brought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery to receiue the fulnesse of life. Wee haue made <hi>Spaine</hi> weary of the warres, and at last desire a peace, which I would be loth to resemble to still waters, wherein are the deepest gulphs and most dangerous places to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture. We returned the <hi>Polish</hi> Ambassadour, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration at our Princes greatnesse and magnanimity. We haue setled the good opinion of the <hi>Muscouite.</hi> Wee haue emboldned the <hi>Venetians</hi> in their last dissentions against the Pope. Wee haue accorded the Arch-Duke, who not onely admitteth vs into entertainment, but giueth way vnto such, as yet maintaine the cause of the contrary. We haue welcomed the Prince of <hi>Moldauia,</hi> and as farre as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy or charity could goe, brought him along into the faire fields of expectation to regaine his enheritance. We haue lately ouerlooked the fields of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Russia;</hi> yea,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:2947:130"/>
thought it befitting to send a martiall supply into <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marck,</hi> and howeuer the <hi>Polander</hi> repine, must in the end (I beleeue) determine those controuersies. To conclude, (though it shall be no cause of ostentation) wee haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered in so many glorious thriuings, that the <hi>Spanyard</hi> in his prophanation hath sworne IESVS CHRIST to become a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> and railed on report, for filling the world with the sound of so many memorable actions.</p>
                     <p>Concerning our glory at home, lay abroad our exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">The glory of England at home.</note> and spare not, and marke the emptiest place, which we will not fill vp with comparison. First, the best manner of gouernment from Gods own mouth, which is monarchal; and philosophicall principles, which is a King; and morall enstructions, which is a distributer of Iustice; and peoples desires, which is an honourable preseruer of Common-wealths: all vnited in one person, from a continuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent of princely ancestours, gaining the loue and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of many nations, by excelling induments of nature, as wisdom, learning, iudgment, peaceable desires, honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble liberality, magnanimity, &amp; such like. And did it please him to add some glorious repairing, or rather magnificent quadrant, to his palace at White-hall, being the principall place of entertainement, and the eye to ouerlooke such a city, as is not in the world, it would come neere our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample indeede. For the Kings house in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeere a building, and no one thing addes more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to a nation, then regardable edifices, and eminent workes of Maiesty, being the very fruit of peace, and (as it were) the birth-right of prosperity, whether it bring forth sumptuous structures or adorning monuments. And (if it were not a pride &amp; elation of hart to number the people, looke how many nations and languages are vnder subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:2947:130"/>
namely <hi>English, Scottish, Irish, Welch, Cornish, Ments, Ilanders</hi> both <hi>Hebrides</hi> and <hi>Orchades,</hi> &amp; the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Gersy</hi> and <hi>Iersy:</hi> so that if the honour of a King consisteth in the multitude of his subiects, what Prince hath more, and such variety? If you looke on his palaces, where are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and so good, belonging to any Kingdome in the world? If you will behold his court; I hope for state, good order, expences, entertainment, and continuall attendan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, other places come farre short? If you will view his shipping and nauies, I am sure you passe away with asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, when you are enstructed in the secrets of their seruice and strength? If you will behold his armours and munition, they exceede report, and the Arsenalls of other countries haue neither such equipage nor sufficiency; but when you shall finde euery Noble-man and Gentle-mans house so well furnished, euery Hall and Company so well prouided, euery Shire so willing to continue their prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, euery Master so cheerefull in storing himselfe, and euery man so ready to giue eare to any martiall summons, and prepare with ioy to attend the seruice; you must needs returne, not louing vs with feare and trembling, but affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting vs with triumph and well wishes, for our preuailing against the proudest aduersary? If you will number vs at sea, I know there is not so many good Mariners and Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in <hi>Europe,</hi> excepting the Low Countries. If you will muster vs at land, who can shew such companies of foot? such troopes of horse? so many worthy seruitours? and so well appoynted? Insomuch that I know diuers Gentle-men of <hi>England,</hi> who can conduct 3000. men into the field (in their King and Countries name) of their owne tenants, seruants, and friends. If you will examine our Nobility, I confesse they doe not boast of factious greatnesse, as in
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:2947:131"/>
                        <hi>France,</hi> &amp; the Princes of <hi>Germany:</hi> but their number, noble disposition, &amp; willingnes to be obedient, may passe in the best items of Fames account. If you would see our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, prepare a reuerence, and settle your estimation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them for their orderly life, probity of manners, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity in deciding controuersies, &amp; affability in admitting suters: &amp; though you come from the <hi>Grandes</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Principalities of <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Electors</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>France,</hi> &amp; the States of other Countries, yea, the osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous pomp of <hi>Cardinals:</hi> yet bee not too preiudicate, nor transported with selfe-conceited wilfulnes; for you shall see as great brauery, retinue, &amp; obseruation amongst vs, as any subiects in the world dare challenge or put in practise, for outward glorious ostentation: nay more, the order of our <hi>Garter,</hi> and the ceremonies of enstalling, are continued with that triumph and maiesty, that no one celebration of petty Princes dare lift vp a countenance of such iollity &amp; regardable honor. And if you will behold the other Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, they are generally so many, so handsome, so seruicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; of their own retinues so well prouided, that I protest they so farre exceede other places, both for gracefull shewes and sufficient estates, that I wonder, how such a corner of the world should haue such a generall conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all happinesse and courtship, as if a raised winde should beat the swelling sea of prosperity to one shore.</p>
                     <p>But if you will be rauished indeede, or transported with the loue of the world, come and behold the beauty of our Ladies, and the disposing them at a night of solemnity, to which if you adde the generall contentment, which our English women affoord generally, without sophisticate and adulterate additions, either to comelinesse or fauour, there is no man can hold his peace, but proclaime our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:2947:131"/>
Againe, if you would see <hi>Iustice</hi> proud of her entertainment, and how shee presents both <hi>praemium</hi> and <hi>poena</hi> to the seuerall attendants on her throne of equity; looke into our <hi>Starre-chamber,</hi> and view the <hi>Sunne</hi> in most perspicuous splendour, without so much as the least clow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy respect of persons. If you will enter our Gentle-mens houses, I hope, there is no such cupbords of plate, beds of of veluet and embroidery, hangings of tapistry, variety of roomes, duty of seruants, order of house-keeping, store of pastime, and all that man can desire in any countrey in the world. If you will search our cities and townes, what they want in outward deceit of formality (and yet I cannot so extenuate our buildings) is supplyed in sweetnesse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy, and within doore surpasseth the best of them for wealth and furniture. As for expences, I am sure some Citizens of <hi>London</hi> are at more annuall charge of diet, then the Dukes of <hi>Venice, Florence,</hi> or <hi>Genoa,</hi> for their own palaces. If you will examine our marchants, howeuer some great <hi>Foulker</hi> or agent for a whole Kingdome, in <hi>Genoa, Antwerp, Brussels,</hi> or other citties may surpasse vs for vsury, venting commodities, or supposition of wealth: yet I am sure, there died not two such in one yeere, out of one towne in the world, as <hi>Spencer</hi> and <hi>Sutton.</hi> As for the rest, they surpasse for curious fare, statelinesse, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their pleasures, handsome education, comely enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and orderly contribution, Besides, they liue at home in ease, purchase land with security, bring vp their children in daintinesse, maintaine their families in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and cannot be matched by any forraine opposition. Would you be acquainted with the Trades-man, Artezan, and others of mannuall occupation, looke how hee liues, looke how he fares, looke where he dwels, looke what he
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:2947:132"/>
weares, looke whether he goes to buy his meat, to such markets and shambles, that the very sight astonisheth all strangers, and once made acquainted with their variety and goodnesse, they are amazed at our blessings, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how so much prouision can bee orderly deuoured. Would you be refreshed with the pleasant countrey aire; our Yeoman and Husbandman liueth in such delight and sweetnesse of situation, that you may repine at his health and prosperity: but if you consider in what comelinesse and decency, in what peace &amp; tranquility, in what neatnes and hospitality, in what wealth and good condition; you will fall to praising of God, for imparting his blessings to our nation, and wishing the like to your owne deficient countrey in this kinde: For beleeue it (as you shall heare heereafter) whether he be Purchaser or Farmer, our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies haue repined at our prerogatiues in this kinde, and our friends embtaced our noble customes with desire of imitation. I could adde many things to the ampliation of our glory, as our hauens and harbours, especially in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> our riuers, high wayes, secure trauelling, vniuersities, castles, bathes, mines, and honorable orders of watchings, trainings, and musters: but I referre them to their due pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when I shall prooue our excellency and transcending prerogatiues beyond other nations. And thus much for our glory.</p>

But to particulars; if it bee a blessing for euery man to eat vnder his owne roofe, to sit with the pleasure of conuersation in his orchard or garden, to enioy the fruits of the earth with plenty, to liue in neighbourly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuities: and in a manner our doores open all night, to haue many children, seruants, and store of cattle, to purchase great estates, marry our daughters beyond expectation, and strengthen one another in worthy families and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing affinity: looke amongst vs, and tell mee where is the like? If it be a blessing not to be suppressed with supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, not to haue the Common-wealth rent in peeces with tyrannie, not to see others enioy the fruits of our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, not to be tormented with intrusion, vsurpation, or malicions lookes of ouer-couetous Land-Lords: looke amongst vs, and demand who can complaine, or at least,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:2947:133"/>
who is so wronged, but hee may haue satifaction or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse. If it be a blessing to enioy the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, to be free from corrupting and absurd ceremonies, to reioyce in the liberty of vpright consciences, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in a true, perfect, and established religion (as heereaster shall be more amply explained) to abound with reuerend learned men, to haue liberall accesse, and dispute of our faith with moderate perswading and disswading, and to haue all controuersies tried vpon the touch-stone of Gods truth; come and heare vs, and tell me wherein you are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied. If it bee a blessing to haue sociable conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet with honourable respect to continue the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of neighbourly meetings, exempted from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable yoake of iealousie and suspition, to loue one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other with those comfortable conditions of charity, to seast without scandall, to entertaine without repining, and to be merry without lasciuiousnesse? Examine the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition of vs all generally, and setting mens imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aside, which follow life, as the shadow the sunne, and tell me where is lesse offence in so great fulnesse offelicity. If it be a blessing to make the best vse of natures blessings, to be rather helpfull, then indigent of others help, to be at peace with all the Kingdomes of the world, to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining Princes gratefie vs by Embasie, to haue the greatest Monarchs allied, or desiring our alliance, to welcome all comers with a noble and correspondent inuitation, and to thriue euery day more &amp; more in the propagation of our worth, Take vp the example, put vs to the triall, and see whether I speake vaine-gloriously. To conclude with the best of all blessings, if it be a blessing to liue in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a royall succession, to bee confident of hopefull Princes, to haue adioyning countries study our obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:2947:133"/>
to see our owne country and people flourish with all abundance, and to suspect nothing but the corruptions of greatnesse, through wantonnesse and ease: looke vpon vs; pensill out our defects, if you can, and let not emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which sometimes dependeth on vertuous deserts and desires, bee turned into enuy, or so attended on by malice, that you will not yet confesse our neernesse in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching our example, when I am sure no Kingdome is so beautified with vnstainable colours.</p>
                     <p>But you will say, for all this, we neither fetch gold from <hi>Ophir,</hi> nor are our cities and buildings of any sufficiency, to hold out against a military expugnation, nor satisfie the high looking eyes of magnificence. To the first, I answer directly, we may if we list, either fetch treasure where it is, or bee the cause, that it shall bee brought vs euen to the doores of our Exchequer in peace. For I am sure, we haue not onely ships and men, but such hands and spirits, as with <hi>Dauids</hi> Worthies, can pull the speares out of the hands of the <hi>Philistims,</hi> and with <hi>Sampsons</hi> riddle take meat out of the eater, and sweetnesse from the strong, and who shall hinder vs? I hope not <hi>Spaine,</hi> if there were such occasion, nor the gallies of the middle-land sea, nor the confederate Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> nor the Turkish <hi>Carmisans</hi> or gallies, nor the fortifications of <hi>China,</hi> nor any one world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Monarch. But see the conditions of true worthinesse; valour and a noble spirit dare doe no wrong, and our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent King (out of true addictions to vprightnesse) hath rolled vp all ensignes of defiance, and therefore will not infringe the honourable couenants of his compacted peace, nor giue example to his sonne, to stirre the poole of <hi>Silo,</hi> vntill the Angell descend for the good of the people.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="254" facs="tcp:2947:134"/>
Concerning our buildings and cities: first for the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and brauery of them; I answer, <hi>Ars non habet ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micum nisi ignorantem,</hi> and men are too preiudicate, that either condemne vs for want of knowledge; or effeminate, that vilipend vs for defect of formality; because of mine owne knowledge, I dare say, generally there are not so many beautifull Churches, handsome castles, glorious palaces, sweet townes, stately houses, and of great capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and delicate structures, within the circular dimension of so much ground in the world: so that if our Gentle-men (admitting the custome of liuing in cities, as they doe in most parts of <hi>Europe)</hi> would compact all the edefices and conuenient houses of a shire within a wall, or that we were sited in a continent, like the through-fares of <hi>France, Germany,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> we might questionlesse haue more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, great, and populous cities, then any one kingdome vnder heauen. Secondly, for the strength; what care wee for extraordinarie fortifications amongst our selues, the onely darings of presumption, and inducements to vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall treasons, when times and worthy gouernment so curbs the ambitious subiect from any dangerous attempt, that they are so farre from affrighting the Prince, or one another, with factious hostility, that they can quickely v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite themselues for the common good: as for the feare of forraine enemies, and inuasion of any enraged foe, wee haue the sea for our walls, the shores as strong as brasse, and such a nauy for our defence, that I protest my heart leaps for ioy, when I see the channell so plentifully stored, the Kings harbours so magnificently filled, and know that all the hauens of the world entertaine vs for one respect or another. But say, we doe not this way put the ambitious man in any hope ofthriuing in fowle pretension offormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:2947:134"/>
actions against the peace of our State: or the quiet man in any feare, that well fortified places may be surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by treasons, and maintained by power, to the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the whole Realme, and animating forraine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to expect such coadiutement by corrupted and abused men. I am sure we come neerer our example (some fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire townes or speciall landing places excepted) both for hospitality and the generall blessings of the kingdome, reciprocally imparted to poore and rich. And for our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther townes and villages, such as they are, considering the vse and necessity of trauell, surmount by farre the Hoste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and deformed villages of other nations, and am sure, if you let loose the Queen of cities, as you terme <hi>Paris;</hi> the <hi>Sacra Porta;</hi> or the beautifull, as <hi>Constantinople;</hi> the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible within the impossible, as <hi>Venice;</hi> the happy and fashionable, as <hi>Augusta;</hi> the populous, as <hi>Norremberg;</hi> the great, as <hi>Millane;</hi> the delicate, as <hi>Florence;</hi> the Gentle, as <hi>Naples;</hi> the spatious, as <hi>Cracow, Mosco, Cayro,</hi> and tripar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite <hi>Prage:</hi> not one of them all (as for infinite other towns, they are not once to be named to this purpose) can looke so bigg, or angerly vpon our LONDON: but shee can affront them with a matching countenance; yea, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match them in many seuerall exercises and excellencies, wherein for your better instruction we will dispute a little.</p>

For the Tower containeth a Kings palace, a Kings prison, a Kings armoury, a Kings mint, a Kings ward-robe, a Kings artilery, and many other worthy offices: so that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants within the walls haue a Church, and are a sufficient parish.

Insteed of Gentle-men on dirty foot-clothes, and women in the miry streets: the one with an idle Lacquey or two; the other with no company of respect: wee haue fashionable attendancy, handsome and comely going, either in Carosse, Coatch, or on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and our Ladies and women of reputation, sildome abroad without an honourable retinue.

                     <p>To conclude, if you looke on and in our <hi>London</hi> truly, as it is composed of men following trades &amp; occupations, there is not such a city, such a gouernment, such a method of conuersation, such a vnity of good fellowship, such a glasse to see vnity and beauty in, such a treasury of wealth, such a store-house of all terrestriall blessings vnder the sunne. If you will view it without at all times, and yet consider the customes of keeping our country houses, you will say there are not so manie Gentle-men in anie place, nor gathered together to better purpose, nor can the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Paris</hi> bring you into the walks of such pleasure, with so little charge and offence, as <hi>London.</hi> For with vs our riding of horses, musique, learning of all Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, dancing, fencing, seeing of commedies or interludes, banquets, masques, mummeries, turnaiments, shewes, lotteries, feasts, ordinarie meetings, and all the particulars of mans inuention to satiate delight, are easie expences, and a little iudgement with experience, will manage a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meane estate to wade through the current of pleasure, although it runne to voluptuousnesse. But if you come to our Court, I hope you finde not such another for stately attendants, dutifull seruice, plentie of fare, resort of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:2947:138"/>
comelinesse of Ladies, gallantrie of Gentles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of people, princely pastimes, noble entertainment, and all things befitting the Maiestie of a King, or glorie of a nation: so that I may say for <hi>London,</hi> as the King of <hi>France</hi> answered the Emperors tedious titles with <hi>France, France, France,</hi> and nothing but <hi>France:</hi> so crie I <hi>London, London, London,</hi> and nothing but <hi>London,</hi> to their proudest and all their cities.

                     <p>What I haue said of <hi>Paris</hi> by way of comparison, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and compared with London</note> the gouernment and orderly managing the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of a citie, I may well conclude against <hi>Constantinople:</hi> but because this imperiall place looketh with a more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesticall countenance then other cities, and lifteth vp (as it were) a daring head against all contradiction, for her supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie: I must needes pensill out the line of her praises at some length, and tell you truely, wherein her worthinesse consisteth, and yet may deceiue opinion without true iudgement. <hi>Constantinople,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Stanbole,</hi> the Beautifull, hath a handsome and formall triangle of a wall, the first part whereof reacheth from the seuen towers (which is a place for suppliment of a prison, a treasurie, and ward-robe) vnto the <hi>Seralio,</hi> some three English mile. The second from the <hi>Seralio</hi> to <hi>Porta del Fieume,</hi> a little more and both toward the sea, which runneth one way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> into the <hi>Euxinum,</hi> and another way to encounter a pretty fresh water riuer, beyond the North of <hi>Pera.</hi> And the third ouerlooketh the fields of <hi>Thracia,</hi> with a greater compasse and strength, because it is a double wall, and openeth three or foure gates, as <hi>Andri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, Gratianople,</hi> the Tower gate, &amp;c. into the countrey, which flourished when <hi>Pausanias</hi> was contented with the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:2947:138"/>
title of Duke and Captaine of the <hi>Spartanes,</hi> and built this wonderfull towne by the name of <hi>Bizantium,</hi> in honour of his father <hi>Bize,</hi> who was Admirall of the Grecian Nauy, when <hi>Thebes,</hi> and other cities stroue for superiority. The wal is orderly beautified with square towers of hard stone, whose equall distance makes a reasonable shew, but that it resembles a painted Curtezan of outward good becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, yet within full of corruption and danger. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the streets, citizens, houses, or order of a well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted Common-wealth, it retaineth nothing comming neere our <hi>London,</hi> or happinesse. The situation is yet a stately ascent from the sea, as if it had a pride to mocke at the swelling of any tempest: and embolden the Marchant with the security of the <hi>Sacra Porta,</hi> being indeede the goodliest habour in the world, twenty fathom deep close to the shores of two cities. Thus it containeth ten English mile in circumference, hauing no suburbs, and shewing much waste ground in the vnfrequented places toward the land, especially where the Bashawes houses are seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred from the hurliburly of the Trades-man.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Seralio</hi> is the palace of the <hi>Gran Signeur,</hi> yet is a <note place="margin">Why Seralio</note> name appropriate to diuers sequestred places, wherein his women are detained, and hath questionlesse the deriuation from our Latin word <hi>Sera,</hi> or locked vp: it is a receptacle for diuers thousands, enclosing as much ground, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iames</hi> parke. For the courts are very large, with seuerall guards of <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> according to the necessity of the times, or neernesse to the Emperours person. The gardens spacious, with embattelled walls, stored with artillery, the gates most of them iron, kept by <hi>Capogies:</hi> the buildings are many and stately, bearing in their front certaine <hi>Dowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's</hi> or open hals, which haue trauesses of Persian stuffe, and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:2947:139"/>
are roomes of great receipt, wherein the officers of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace sit in open view at their feasts and diet. The ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting-houses, wherein his concubines and boyes are aparted from the court hurliburly, expose diuers manner of structures, and seeme indeede seuerall palaces, amongst whom there is one called a <hi>Caska</hi> without the wall of the <hi>Seralio</hi> close to the sea-side where hee accustometh to take his gally, of the delicatest and richest presence, that euer I beheld: for it is a quadrant of seuen arches on a side cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster wise, like the <hi>Rialto</hi> walke in <hi>Venice,</hi> in the midst riseth a core of three or foure roomes with chimnies, whose mantell trees are of siluer, the windowes curiously glazed, &amp; besides protected with an iron grate all guilt ouer most gloriously: the whole frame so set with opals, rubies, eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds, burnisht with golde, painted with flowers, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with inlayed worke of porphery, marble, iet, iasper, and delicate stones, that I am perswaded there is not such a bird cage in the world. Vnder the walls are stables for sea horses called <hi>Hippopotami,</hi> which is a monstrous beast taken in <hi>Nilus,</hi> Elephants, Tygres, and Dolphines: sometimes they haue Crocadiles and Rhinoceros: within are Roe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buckes, white Partridges, and Turtles, the bird of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and many beasts and fowles of <hi>Affrica</hi> and <hi>India.</hi> The walkes are shaded with Cypres, Cedars, Turpentine, and trees which wee onely know by their names, amongst which, such as affoord sustenance, are called figs, almonds, oliues, pomegranets, limons, orenges, and such like: but it should seeme, they are heere as it were enforced, and kept in order with extraordinary diligence: for the sunne kisseth them not with that freuency, as may make them large, or ripen in their proper kindes.</p>
                     <p>The city is very populous toward the harbour, the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesteine,</hi>
                        <pb n="265" facs="tcp:2947:139"/>
Bashawes houses, Mosques, conduits, tombs and monuments, open as it were a store-house of magnificent workes: yet when I read, that <hi>Constantine</hi> vnplumed <hi>Rome,</hi> and as it were robbed all the world, making this place accessary to the theft, and cannot finde the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in mine inuentory, I maruell who hath either dared to purloine them, or presumed to ruinate and deface them. For the cheefest structures and monuments are now the great <hi>Seralio,</hi> the lesser <hi>Seralio's,</hi> the seuen towres, the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wall, diuers Bashawes houses, before some of which are spacious quadrants graced with antiquities, recording the ancient manner of turnaiments, when the <hi>Greekes</hi> flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished: the Mosques or Temples, amongst whom the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, Solimana</hi> and <hi>Amorata,</hi> are indeed heaps of ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fabricks of great delight, the place called <hi>Iobs</hi> tombe, sequestred for the buriall of the Emperours chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who are commonly all strangled on the day of his elder sonnes inauguration by <hi>Mutes,</hi> and then enclosed in coffins of Cypres, and so receiued by the <hi>Mufti</hi> into chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples consecrated for that purpose; the Patriarcks house; certaine <hi>Balnea's; Aquae ductus; Constantines</hi> palace; and the Towers on the wall. To these you may adde the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesteine,</hi> a place like our Exchange, for varietie of marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, market of virgins, selling of slaues, and the vaults vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground fenced with iron gates to secure their treasure, which especially belongeth to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who farme the office of <hi>Dacij</hi> or customes, and are (as it were) the <hi>Turkes</hi> receiuers, so that these places must needes bee strongly guarded, both to preuent the furie of the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> who are very irregular in their tumults, and the extremity of fire and earth-quakes, to whose violence the Citie is many times subiect.</p>

                        <pb n="266" facs="tcp:2947:140"/>
The next diuision is of <hi>Galata,</hi> a city ouer against it diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded onely by sea, no broader heere then our <hi>Tamisis,</hi> of great antiquity, walled about, and retaining a particular name and renowne, for holding out a yeere and better, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Constantinople</hi> was surprized: it standeth likewise vp a hill, and equals it both for beastlinesse, confusion, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely streets and houses: heere liue many <hi>Greekes,</hi> and the <hi>Francks,</hi> as they terme the Papists (of what nation soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer) haue a Church by permission; the Curtezan likewise liueth at some liberty; yet is it death for any Christian to lie with a Turkish woman or Iew.</p>
                     <p>The third part of this great city comprehendeth the vine of <hi>Pera,</hi> which is a huge suburbs, compassing <hi>Galata</hi> round about, a place of quiet dwelling, good aire, and pleasant gardens: yet in regard the many thousand tombs of <hi>Turkes</hi> (for you must know, that neither <hi>Turke, Iew,</hi> nor <hi>Christian,</hi> interre any corps in their Mosques or city, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they build a chapple of purpose, or haue the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Franck Church) fill vp a great quantity of ground, with disordered, confused noysome, and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full graues. On the one side toward the north-east, you haue an Arsenall for gallies, a little beyond, a handsome Seralio, &amp; somwhat further a pretty fresh water riuer, as if they lay in sequence, by whose banks are certaine houses erected of purpose, for the pleasure &amp; reposednes of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Bashawes. On the other side toward the south-west, the office of artilery called <hi>Tapinaw,</hi> inuiteth you to the view of such ordnance and munition, that for number, greatnesse, and vse, surmount any one city of <hi>Europe:</hi> you haue likewise another Seralio, and in these suburbs are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident the <hi>English, French,</hi> and <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambassadours: as for the <hi>Persian,</hi> Emperours of <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Polacks,</hi> they
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:2947:140"/>
liued in the great city, and sometimes visited one another, as either necessitie of businesse, or pleasure of inuitation affoorded.</p>
                     <p>The last quarter of this diuision affoordeth the obiect of a towne in <hi>Asia</hi> called <hi>Scideron,</hi> or <hi>Scideret,</hi> betweene which and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the sea runneth 20. English mile in length, and onely two in bredth, as farre as <hi>Pompey's</hi> pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and the blacke Tower, resembling a lace fringed with spangles and purles: for the Bashawes and Chawses hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, so stand on both sides, as if they were made to answer a proportion of handsomnesse: but when time and a daies trauell hath taken away the pleasure of this spectacle, then fall you into a larger gulph, once called <hi>Euxinum mare,</hi> now the blacke sea, extending a thousand mile, as farre as <hi>Trebisond:</hi> on the farther shore of the continent now called <hi>Russia,</hi> is shouldred vp close <hi>Maeotis Palus;</hi> into which the great riuer of <hi>Tanais</hi> sendeth his streames, as if a messenger of glad tydings and businesse should hasten to discharge his duty. Thus I confesse, if on the towers of the <hi>Amorata,</hi> or battlements of the <hi>Sophia,</hi> you beheld all at once, as it were one vnited body, it would equall, if not surpasse <hi>London,</hi> for spaciousnesse of grounds, some monuments, and diuers palaces and houses: but yet come no way neere my satisfaction, as being defectiue in many things, which I supposed to excell in it, &amp; deficient in all things, wherin a happy countrey supplieth the wants of her enhabitants. For heere is neither good lodging, proportionable fare, free recourse, gracious entertainment, true religion, secure abiding, allowable pleasure, orderly gouernment, or any thing wherein a noble city is made glorious indeed: nor is it so populous as report hath busied vs, but <hi>famarialum,</hi> and it may be, the plague hauing consumed 80000. and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:2947:141"/>
the army of 200000. deducted, diminished somewhat the glory, &amp; left the rest of the people to enioy more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And thus much for <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Now a word or two for <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Venice</hi> I confesse is both rare in situation, and wonderfull for gouernment, as cementing together diuers Ilands with <note place="margin">Venice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, and compared with London</note> small bridges, and not trusting their liberty either into the the hands of one Prince, or iudgement of inferiour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Thus hath the Duke but a binding voyce, and the sword is carried before the Senate: thus is nothing done without the consent of the Nobility, who are very neere 1500. in number, and the trades-man is in no sort admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongst them, till either he purchase the freedome, or deserue it by some heroicke imployment; therefore they doe them wrong, that call the <hi>Venetians</hi> marchants. For though some of them haue a traffique at sea: yet doe the better sort of the Nobility scorne to trade for profit, and those which are aduenturers, are either newly raised hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or licensed by the state for speciall purposes: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, hee leaues the managing of affaires to inferiours, and the drudging (as we say) for money, either to the Iew as an Vsurer; or to common banke for the good of the city; or to the Shop-keeper, for the entertaining the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of people, sitting at home in ease, and going abroad for some variety of delight, as the true Gentle-men of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> and <hi>Millane</hi> accustome, who suppose nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, which sauours of curbing liberty, and tying them to seruile attendance. But yet in all this, so farre short of our <hi>London,</hi> as a dumb painted statua of a liuing substance. For neither are the Noble-men permitted the eminency of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther natious, nor patible of such degrees, as our greatnesse looketh vpon one another withall: nor can the Marchant
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:2947:141"/>
equall the twentieth part of our comparison for number: nor in that which they boast of, which is wealth, can they generally match our <hi>Londoners:</hi> as for the Trades-man and Shop-keepers, as I sayd before, neither for order, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, libertie of meeting, diet, purchasing of land, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate furniture, and all the particulars whereby a city is made famous, worthy, or wealthy: onely some few hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses haue a handsome shew of comelinesse, and (according to the custome of their stone-buildings) seeme pretty piles for the receipt of a small company. But where are their fiue hundred ships at sea; when all <hi>Venice</hi> hath not aboue thirty marchant men, and ten galleasses; onely they boast of three hundred gallies, according to the custome of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall</hi> encounters in the <hi>Leuant?</hi> where are their voyages and setled aboad in all the harbours in the world? where are their large and braue streets, antique monuments, when their city is scarse eight hundred yeere old, glorious gates, magnificent structures to lodge Princes and all their reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, houses of entertainment for trauellers and strangers, such as our Tauernes and Inns? where are their conduits and good waters? where are their fields and pleasant walkes? where are their exercises and heroike pastimes? where are their triumphant shewes and magnificent specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, with infinite other particulars, wherein they must yeeld, if <hi>London</hi> had no other Commander then the Maior and Senatours? after this manner could I runne into <hi>Affrick,</hi> and fetch <hi>Cayro;</hi> into <hi>Russia,</hi> for <hi>Mosko;</hi> into <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for <hi>Craccow;</hi> into <hi>Germany,</hi> for <hi>Augusta,</hi> or <hi>Norrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg;</hi> into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> for <hi>Prage;</hi> into <hi>Austria,</hi> for <hi>Vienna;</hi> into <hi>Spaine,</hi> for <hi>Leon,</hi> or <hi>Madrid;</hi> into <hi>Portugall,</hi> for <hi>Lisbone;</hi> and so in all the rest: but if they were brought before the barre of comparison, they might bee quickly arraigned of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:2947:142"/>
presumption for contending with our <hi>London</hi> in any of those things, wherein a city looketh vp with a iustifiable countenance, to shew her comelinesse, beauty, glory, bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery or antiquity.

So that if I store this discourse with some collected ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracts, intimating nothing from enuy, or malice against the greatnes and wealth of other Kingdomes, which are Idolaters, I hope we shall thereby auoide in our selues the least sauouring of those monstrous customes of <hi>India, China,</hi> or other dangerous Kingdomes, and adulterate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses <note place="margin">The foolish excuse of Idolaters.</note> of misled Christians, who thus farre agree with the grossest idolaters, that their images are but representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of more excellent spirits, and no man is so senselesse to kneele to, or adore the dumbe and dead things, but onely to resuscitate our stupide memories, either of God, or his Saints, in regard the nature of man is so slender of it selfe, and the condition of the Diety so gentle to giue way to any thing, which may further the adoration of his glory, and the confirmation of our saluation: in both which how grosse and palpably they abuse the great and wise God, and deceiue ignorant and simple men, shall here appeare.</p>
                     <p>In the 17. of <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> there is as it were a solemne quest of enquiry against the peruerters of true religion in this kinde, and the conclusion tendeth to the punishment of stoning to death; and because we should haue no star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hole or tricke to deceiue our selues, God is contented in the 28 to establish to his people a contract of blessing, and cursing, all tending to discouer the vses and reasons of either: following it so farre, that he plainely nameth idolatry, or if you will, erecting of images, for any cause to exasperate his displeasure, that plagues, punishment, and vtter extirpation must follow: to which end and purpose <hi>Iosua's</hi> exhortation for the worshipping the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, true, and wise God, and after his owne onely, true, and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:2947:144"/>
wise way, was so enlarged, commended, and applauded after his so many and great victories, and established qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes. How neere to vtter destruction, and desolation, were the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the time of the IVDGES, when the Angell rebuked the people for liuing wickedly in the sight of the Lord, and seruing <hi>Baalam,</hi> wherevpon follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a casting them away by God, and the hands of <hi>Midian</hi> fettred them in chaines seuen yeere: nor could the Princes of <hi>Iuda</hi> deliuer them, although <hi>Gedeon</hi> began well, and set vp preuailing on his strongest legs, to stand vpright for their behoofe. But what followed? He and all his house fell into the pit of destruction: and wherefore? for making an ephod, wherein hee presumed yet to doe well; but it was the step and staire of idolatry, and that the cause of a following vengeance; then if you looke into <hi>Micahs</hi> story, you shall finde that euery man did what was good in his owne eyes, whereby ensued murthers, rapes, robberies, and such like intolerable enormities, all hauing their cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from this spring, that his mother made him images of siluer, and he consented to the wicked worke. If you ouerlooke the story of <hi>Sampson,</hi> howeuer hee lost his strength, and was inflicted with a seuere punishment, of being bereaued of his sight, and disgracefull captiuity; yet you saw, as the Eagle casts her bill to renew her youth, for the punishment of Idolaters, God raised vp another wall of fortification, and when his vigour was restored, he pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led downe the prophane temple vpon the heads of two thousand soules: when the <hi>Philistins</hi> brought the arke of God into the house of <hi>Dagon,</hi> the Idoll fell downe before it, and the men of <hi>Ashdod</hi> were plagued for abusing the same. Did not <hi>Salomon</hi> reioyce in all worldly felicity, and was not the mantle of pleasure and happinesse spred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:2947:145"/>
him? vntill he fell to idolatry, then did his priuate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies cast it out of sight, and God diuided ten Tribes from his sonne, which was a strange disparity, considering his father built the Temple, consecrated the same, and blessed the people. Wherein was God so offended with <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> that he made him the capitall authour of the sins of <hi>Israel?</hi> but by reason of his golden calues, the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof was thus farre extended; His sonne died, his hand was dried vp with leprosie, the seduced Prophet was killed by a Lyon, and the same <hi>Abiah</hi> that made him King, confirmed the extirpation of his family, and for all his wife went to delude him, yet she heard the iudgement of terrour, which she could not preuent. In the story of <hi>Ahab,</hi> what was the cause of so many troubles in <hi>Israel,</hi> tyranny in the Common-wealth, murthering of Gods Prophets, vsurpation of other mens inheritances, wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of <hi>Iezabel,</hi> witchcrafts, whoredomes, and in the end a generall defection from his obedience, and coniuration against his house, was it not idolatry? wherupon followed the slaughter of the King, the casting the Queene out of a window, the killing of <hi>Baals</hi> Prophets, first by <hi>Eliah,</hi> then by <hi>Iehu,</hi> and an vtter confusion in <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Israel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherein was <hi>Iehoiada</hi> so acceptable to God, as when he destroyed the altars of <hi>Baal,</hi> and layd his images on a heape? looke amongst all the Kings of <hi>Iuda,</hi> or <hi>Israel;</hi> and whereas you finde some of them murthered, some of them deposed, some of them taken away in the pride of their yeeres, some of them lepers, and some of them carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to captiuity: it was all by reason of idolatry, &amp; transfoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the adoration of the onely true God, with the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious leprosie of mens traditions: thus <hi>Azariah</hi> of <hi>Iuda</hi> became a Leper, <hi>Zacharia</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> was slaine by <hi>Shallum,</hi>
                        <pb n="277" facs="tcp:2947:145"/>
                        <hi>Shallum</hi> by <hi>Menahen,</hi> and <hi>Menahen</hi> purchased his peace of <hi>Assyria</hi> by money. The wicked idolatry of <hi>Ahas,</hi> and that horrible consecration of his sonne in fire, was a motiue of trouble and desolation to all <hi>Ierusalem. Hosea</hi> King of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> was ensnared, and he and his realme caught in the net of Assyrian policy, by reason of their confidence in Idols, &amp; that euery one worshipped the God of his nation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Moses</hi> Law; but what ensued? curses, plagues, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter desolatenesse, adumbration of the sunne-shine of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly fauours, and when they presumed of well-doing, in making a hotchpotch of religion in <hi>Samaria,</hi> the Lyons of the forrest came into the city, and deuoured both Priests and people.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Manasses</hi> restored idolatry, giuing life to filthy prophanation, which viper-like abused the curtesie of him which warmed her, and stung him to death. I will bring (sayes God) an euill vpon <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that who heareth of it, both his eares shall tingle, &amp; I will stretch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the line of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and the plummet of the house of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and I will wipe <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as a man wipeth a dish, and turne it vpside downe: so <hi>Ammon</hi> was slaine by his seruants, and the poyson of idolatry that had choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the people of God with the dreggs of abomination, made <hi>Iuda</hi> so vlcerous and deformed, that God would not know his owne handyworke, but suffered them to be led into captiuity, and brought into the schoole of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous correction.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ezekiels</hi> visions were most against <hi>Israel,</hi> and his mouth opened the fearefull indignation of the Lord against <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> because their altars were erected to strange Gods, and that they made images of the sunne, to pollute their soules worse then the carrion of a dunghill: then procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth he against them with personating names, calling <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem, Aholah</hi> and <hi>Ohalibah:</hi> the end onely to discouer their idolatry, and intimating Gods wrath for their notorious wandring from the true path of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, insomuch that from the parable of a seething pot, <hi>Iuda's</hi> destruction is threatned: yet for all this, God will not condescend to any treatise of pacification, vntil all the nations round about, namely <hi>Edom, Moab, Aegypt, Chaldea, Tyrus, Sidon, Gog,</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> taste the bitternesse of the same fruit, corrupted and made irksome by the same trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions.</p>

But because we hope for our established saluation in the merits and mercies of Iesus Christ, and know, that the excellency of the Trinity is described in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, when God said, <hi>Let vs make man,</hi> when the great King saw the image of one like the sonne of man in the furnace, when <hi>Iob</hi> knew that his Redeemer liued, &amp; when the mysterie of the Trinitie is reuealed in many places: let vs leaue the vanitie of the Heathen with their obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, the abomination of Idolaters with their grosse abuses, the antiquity of the Iewes with their stiffneckednesse, the innouation of the Mahumetans with their errors and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities, and be onely proud of our liuery of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. But now we must subdiuide againe, and say, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:2947:148"/>
Christians there is a tripartite separation. For the Greeke Church runneth one way with the title of East: the Latine Church rangeth another way with the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of West: and the reformed Church spreadeth a modest glory with the liberty of Protestants.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Greeke Church I will be bold to tell you, that I haue heard some of their Protopapans and Archimandritans maintaine their greatnesse, precedency, and truenesse of Religion before the Latine, and thus they assume the defence. For greatnesse it containeth most parts of <hi>Armenia, Georgia, Mengrelia</hi> neere the <hi>Caspian,</hi> many places in <hi>Natolia,</hi> or <hi>Asia minor,</hi> the Countries of <note place="margin">The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Creeke Church.</note> 
                        <hi>Aethiopia</hi> in <hi>Affricke,</hi> which may equall them of the West <hi>Indies,</hi> of whom the Pope doth now boast so much: In <hi>Europe</hi> all <hi>Grecia:</hi> many great Ilands (except such as are diuerted Papists, incurring the scandall of Heretickes) <hi>Muscouia</hi> or <hi>Russia:</hi> some parts of <hi>Poland, Lithuania, Bogdonia,</hi> and the shores of the <hi>Euxinum,</hi> much more ground, then the Pope can challenge, where he is the most offen siue Vsurper.</p>
                     <p>For Precedency it claimeth likewise the prerogatiue, both waies: First, by priority, in regard they were first <note place="margin">The prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the Greeke Church.</note> Christians, and the Apostles planted Churches amongst them, before either <hi>Paul</hi> preached at <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Linus</hi> was appointed Byshoppe. Secondly, by authority, as by translation of the Empire, from whence <hi>Rome</hi> challengeth hers: For when there was no such ambition thought vpon <hi>Iohn Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> vsurped the title of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Byshoppe, and practised the supremacy ouer all other Churchmen, by reason the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> had so enobled and enabled the great Citie, where hee would haue the Byshoppe to be principall in regard of the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:2947:149"/>
maiesty of his person and the brauery of the place, and therefore not onely graced him with the elated title of Patriarch, but inuested him with many roialties, and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, and temporall iurisdictions, to which the Byshoppe of <hi>Rome</hi> did then intercede, interposing a negatiue euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the very title, disprouing it as Antichristian, and <note place="margin">Gregory sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named the Great.</note> traduced <hi>Iohn</hi> the Patriarch, as a wicked and malicious man for practising such ostentation: nor desisted he so, but writ whole volumes of letters tending to a manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation: some entreating him to disclaime such elation of heart: some disalowing the presumption, as exorbitant in a Byshoppe, who should rather imitate the humilitie of Christ: some thundring the cursed prediction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ by such apostacy, and all of them disswading the true Ministers of Gods word from poysoning their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously redeemed soules with the venome of pride, and vaine-glory: then followed the fearefull history of <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clerus</hi> a strong papisticall writer, on whom they lay the imputation of a fable: But he saies plainely, that that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry instant, in which <hi>Constantine</hi> the great enfeoffed the <note place="margin">Nauclerus.</note> Church with temporary lands, and sumptuous edifices, the heauens seemed to frowne, the aire was thickned with a cloude, the earth troubled with a tempest, and after great thunder and lightning, a voice was heard; now is poyson throwne into the pure streame of Gods truth. Vpon this the matter was a while respited with a grant on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of sitting downe first at generall Councells, naming in Commissions, and the binding voice in equality of censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; all which, if they were priuiledges, enlarged first the precedency of the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Afterward, when the sinnes of the Empire, like a fluent streame ouer-spread the bankes of his enclosures, and that
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:2947:149"/>
God determined the vtter subuersion of all: two wicked men contriued the most lamentable desolation, both of the gouernment of the Empire, &amp; religion of the Church, which were <hi>Phocas</hi> and <hi>Bonifacius;</hi> the one conspiring thus with the other against God and Angells, against hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, against men and Deuills, that to establish <hi>Phocas</hi> in the Empire of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> he would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, that <hi>Bonifacius</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> should be consecrated with the title of Vniuersall Byshoppe; whereupon <hi>Phocas</hi> by the murther of his Master <hi>Mauritius</hi> and other inhumane treacheries was inuested Lord of the Easterne Monarchy, and <hi>Bonifacius</hi> by the cousoning his Predecessor <hi>Siluester,</hi> and other religious practises obtained the papacy: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that <hi>Platina</hi> and diuers of their owne writers (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other pasquills and satiricall inuections) exclaime, that he came in like a fox, raigned as a lyon, and died like a dogge: so that all premises considered, if there be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie in any such precedency, the Roman Byshoppes be but vsurpers. For <hi>Constantinople</hi> had it at generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, and was permitted all the fauour of titles, which the Church, and most Christian Emperour collated at that time.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the truth, it is well knowne, that <hi>Peter</hi> of whom they boast so much was Byshoppe of <hi>Antioch</hi>

As for his visiting of <hi>Rome,</hi> howeuer <hi>Eusebius</hi> adhereth to some formall discoueries, and other Authors produce instances of his owne death and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Martyrdome vnder <hi>Nero,</hi> it is both fanaticall, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,

and vnwarrantable by Scripture: nay I will say more, neither by collected circumstances, probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures, or authenticall Authors is there any inducement to beleeue it: But say he did visit <hi>Rome,</hi> and conferred with <hi>Paul,</hi> what sense, reason, or honesty can allow the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his owne Byshopricke out of <hi>Asia</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> an intrusion into another mans iurisdiction. For <hi>Paul</hi> was constituted to be the light of the Gentiles, and lost his head at <hi>Rome</hi> in iustifying his innocency: how then could <hi>Peter</hi> be condemned of so functory a negligence, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed to the dispersed Iewes of <hi>Asia,</hi> hee would vilipend them, and intrude himselfe into the gouernment of the Gentiles of <hi>Italy:</hi> so then considering <hi>Antioch</hi> and the 7. Churches spoken of in the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> were the first receiuers of the Gospell, from whence the Greekes in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> were the next embracers of the truth, who can oppose against her residence and conseruation rather, where it was first published, then in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the remoter places of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> whereas yet some of their Countries are not quite purged from Paganisme.</p>
                     <p>Thus doe they dispute, and with stomachous ardency enueigh against the pompous and ostentous glory of the latine Church, putting them to silence, as our Sauiour did the Pharisies, when hee questioned their opinion of <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme, &amp; exprobrated them for aduancing the <hi>Hidra's</hi> head of confusion through enormous ceremonies, and mens traditions, wherein they saw the inconueniences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their faces, that they were not onely patible of altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but would grow in time to a Congeries and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of deformitie, as men &amp; deuises did augment them: notwithstanding time being weary of stabilitie, and the Deuill affraid of impeachment in his kingdome, hath
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:2947:150"/>
scattered many corruptions in the fields of Gods farmes, which haue ouergrowne the seedes of verity in these parts, that it now resembleth the corne sowne amongst tares, which choaked the growth of the best seede, and came vp with such a violent ouerspreading, that at haruest there was little benefit to the owner. For all the Greeke Churches are very small, full of idle painting, lampes, candles, tapers, and such like: their seruice and language Greeke, and when they write or print it is a reasonable good Character, though farre from the atticke Dialect: and yet I will be bold to say, a good Scholler of our gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer instruction, shall scarce vnderstand the phrase of their common speakers, no more then a southerne man, one borne farre north, or in Scotland. Their Monasteries are poore, vnhansome, and farre from the state of the Romish Church; and surely if in any thing they imitate the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, it is in their scorne of worldly pompe, carelesnesse, wants, and sometimes austerity of life, although naturally they are the merriest and most iouiall men in the world: their chiefe Abbots are called Archimandritans, but all in generall submit to the Episcopo of the Dioces, who wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth coloured apparell of silke with a crosse ouer his hat, which is low crown'd, broad brimmed, and tied vnder his beard with long strings, hee carrieth a crosier in his hand, but it hath a plaine crosse; they call him also Protopapan the first Father of the congregation (from whence the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe of <hi>Rome</hi> assumeth his <hi>Papa,</hi> or if you will the name of Pope) acknowledging the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> at this very instant for supreame, and absolutely contesting against the Popes tyrannicall vsurpation: yea such is their hate to the Latins, I will not name their corruptions and Church, that they had rather liue in slauery and bondage

vnder the Turke, then either implore the aide of <hi>Italians</hi> for their restitution, or submit to that strange ambition of that Cleargy-man, as some of them ironically tearme the Pope. They obserue foure lents in a yeere, eat flesh on Saturdaies, but on Fridaies and all the lent, with other prohibited times, they neither eat flesh, fish, butter, cheese, or any meat, but like the Christians of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> are absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent beyond reason, the ordinary desire of man, or any prescription of Scripture, or example of the Primatiue Church. They baptize with water and oyle, deny purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, neuer cut their haire, adore no pictures, nor images out of the Scriptures, and yet are superstitious in diuers fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiuals, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Nicholay</hi> about sea matters, and <hi>Celestinus;</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Demetrius,</hi> a feast about the 25. of October, called their drunken feast; and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>George,</hi> who as our Ladies Knight hath obtained sufficient reputation. Their marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, dancings, festiuals and burials, haue the seuerall passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of many and strange ceremonies: but because whole volumes are written against their erroneous superstition, I referre you to such commentaries, concluding; that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are some way more tolerable then the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish abuses, yet are their best garments so plighted with errours, and layd vp vnhandsomely with wrinckles, that when you come to vnfold them, you either exclaime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the negligence of the seruant, or carelesnesse of the Master: who should be a better ouerseer. And thus much touching the Greeke Church. Now a little concerning the Latin.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are so many bookes and disputations concerning the enormities of papisticall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that little children can in a manner <note place="margin">The corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses of the Romish Church.</note> retort an argument, and cite you common places of Scripture, against their absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and idle traditions. I will therefore referre you to the larger dilations of matters of faith, and fundamentall points of saluation: and concerning the strength of their props, which now vphold their suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and monarchall iurisdiction; in a few leaues of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Edwin Sands</hi> his worthy discourse, you shall see them tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpside downe, as if an arme of <hi>Heccate</hi> were put into the throat to pull the entrailes outward, and shew you the strange diseases both of heart and lungs: or else examine the paraphrase of the Reuelation, and you shall heare di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly prooued the seat of Antechrist, the pride of the whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the persecution of the Saints, and the enormities of this <hi>Hosean</hi> strumpet, that hath broken the bands of her first wedlocke, and bedashed her selfe with lusts loathsome charriot. For mine owne part therefore, I will leaue that common way of inuection, or mustring vp the forces of argument out of the maine battell of Gods word, and breefly summe vp the accounts of her condemnation in this manner. 1. First, concerning their gouernment, it is meere politicall, as allowing all positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of tyranny, reuenge, disloyalty, licenciousnesse, wealth,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:2947:152"/>
and liberty, and wherein <hi>Euripides, Demosthenes, Isocrates, Tully, Salust, Perseus, Horace, Sigonius, Lipsius, Machiauell,</hi> or any other absolute or moderne writer opened a school<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house doore of diuellish deuices and distasting principles, to modest and orderly gouernments: they haue culled out the same to serue their owne turnes, and with the Iesuites, repute all others simple, that cannot labour in the worke of alteration of Kingdomes, and setting Princes at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to corroborate their owne greatnesse. 2. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning religion, it is meerely ridiculous, and a dart out of the quiuer of mans inuention; yea, so Diabolicall and Turkish, that it interdicteth the searching of Scriptures, disputing of matters of faith, or any opposition of their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious decrees, councels, and consistorian statutes. 3. Concerning society and conuersation, it is meerely mundane, voluptuous, and sauouring nothing but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightsome liberty: so that if there were not a God to bee prayed vnto and beleeued in, a heauen to bee expected, a saluation to be hoped after, and an account to bee made vpon a dreadfull summons indeed, I had rather be a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Rome,</hi> then a Noble-man of <hi>Naples,</hi> who of all the Gentles in the world spred the largest cloth of vanities and voluptuousnesse. 4. And lastly, concerning their seeming vowes to obedience, chastity and pouerty; it is like <hi>Ianus</hi> face looking two wayes, and with the Lapwigg crying farthest from her nest: for they sauour not one word of truth in the same, as you shal see in the next chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So that I will onely relate vnto you three seuerall sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of three seuerall sects, in which the absurdities of the Latin Church most plainely appeare.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Rome</hi> amongst diuers others there liued a certaine <note place="margin">The story of a conuerted Iew.</note> Iew, who had many controuersies with Christian Friers
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:2947:152"/>
about both their religions, alledging for himselfe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing arguments against their idolatry, or worshipping of images, wherein they would faine distinguish with the differences of <gap reason="foreign">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, &amp;c. praying to Saints, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning of the Saboth, incontinency of life, and burning candles in the day time, as it were in scorne of the glorious light of the sunne, all which though they were vnanswera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet the Frier pleading the calling of the Gentiles, the destruction of the temple, the disanulling of Iewish cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, the birth and comming of Christ, as a prefixed time of another religion, the authority of the same, and the orders of the Church, preuailed so farre with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he enclined a little to bee a Proselite, which the Frier reioyced to heare, triumphing exceedingly at the good successe of his oratory: nay soft (quoth the Iew) it is not thy perswasion hath coapted me to this course, but a certaine impression, that some great and good God is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour of this place, or the prayers of an holy Patriarch (as <hi>Abraham</hi> disputed with <hi>Iehoua</hi> about the sauing of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha)</hi> are acceptable to heauen in the behalfe of some vnknowne good men; otherwise the sinnes of <hi>Rome</hi> are so many, the liues of Priests so corrupt, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse of men so abominable, the villany of politicks so mischeeuous, and all things so discrepant to true religion and honesty, that I haue wondred a thousand times, how the whole countrey, especially the city, hath beene prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and supported from sinking to hell.</p>
                     <p>At another time, a sober <hi>Turke</hi> liuing in <hi>Rome,</hi> and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the riot of their Carneuall or Shroue-tide, at his <note place="margin">The story of a Turck con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his opinion of Rome.</note> returne to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> being demanded his opinion of the Christians, answerered, that they had some tolerable customes, eat good meat, weare good clothes, or rather
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:2947:153"/>
spoyled much stuffe with fantasticke slashing and cutting it, and liued in good townes; but they were madd twice a yeere: For at one time they ranne like Diuels in a play vp and downe the streets with squibs of fire, making a noyse both on horse-backe, and on foot, keeping a coyle with Curtezans and Bawds, sporting with scurrulous and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly gambols, and performing actions of strange vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies, which indeed is their time of Carneuall, a time of such sluttishnesse, vnrulinesse, and venerious riot in all the cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> that in <hi>Venice</hi> one <hi>Iceppo Marcello</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten an inuectiue against it. Shortly after they went how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the streets like dogges, mourning with lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gestures, and whipping themselues vntill the bloud came, and this was on good Friday, when the Penetencia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are couered ouer with a cassocke of canuasse, except two holes to looke out at, and all to belash themselues, vntill the blood runne downe their shoulders, whereby great Princes are so impostured, that contrary to a maine position of Scripture, against such voluntary humiliation and ridiculous inflictings, they haue entertained the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and vndertaken the stripes, witnesse <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. who left his rod of cords, as a iewell of his tresury to King <hi>Philip.</hi> Duke <hi>Ioieuse,</hi> called father <hi>Angelo;</hi> who returned to his orders, which was a bare-foot, or Mendicant Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin Frier, as soone as the league was dissolued, and many other both men and women of noble families, who enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned penance by their ghostly fathers, either by punishing their bodies, vnsauoury pilgrimages, fasts, abstinence, or such like endurances, are very zealous in the execution, and vpon confidence of some meritorious act, condiscend to dangerous and laborious miseries, yea, terrours abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to nature.

It is well knowne, that in the last dayes of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The story of the olde wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at Strasborogh</note> those dayes of firy triall, our roods and images in <hi>England</hi> were so palpably abused, and diuellishly stored with deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that the Priests had diuers trickes to moue either eies, heads, or hands, yea to make them speake with variety of voyces, and palpable gesture, as if the Idols of <hi>Molech</hi> and <hi>Chemosh</hi> were to entertaine the presents of the people, and <hi>Bell</hi> had life indeede to deuoure the Kings allowance: which course is continued still in many places of <hi>Europe,</hi> insomuch that a while agoe in the Froe Church at <hi>Strasbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogh,</hi> when certaine olde deuout women came to worship our Lady, the knauish Priests caused the childe to salute them in her armes, and (as it were) courteoufly to thanke them for making such account of his mother, which they not onely wondred at, but seemed in a manner offended, that the sonne should bee so bolde in the presence of our Lady: whereupon one more zealously angry then the rest, cryed out aloud; <hi>Peace I pray you young Gentle-man, I haue nothing to doe with you, let me heare what my good Ladie your mother sayes;</hi> and so when shee had no further reply, went away discontented.</p>
                     <p>Of this sort in our owne Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the beginning of his Maiesties raigne, when the townes were <note place="margin">Irish deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> commanded to frequent the Churches, I was my selfe an eare-witnesse of many strange grudgings and murmurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, amongst which I yet encountred with this facete and indifferent deuotion; while two neighbours of <hi>Dublin</hi> were disputing about Church-matters, the one an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Protestant, the other a superstitious Papist, and yet so seeming cunning, that she durst dispute between the Popes supremacy and the Kings authority, with a willing minde to satisfie either; her neighbour thus aduised, to goe to

Church a Gods name, and for the Popes sake to say <hi>Pater noster,</hi> for the Kings <hi>Our Father,</hi> let God take which hee will: and so it was merrily concluded, and the woman went accordingly to her deuotion. And thus much concerning the Latine Church. The parelell of which with ours would sufficiently shew our happinesse: And this you may see at large deliuered in the workes of many learned Diuines of our Country, to whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre you.</p>

                        <hi>Salomons</hi> glory extended it selfe from the abundance of his people, when euery man did eate vnder his owne Vine, or fig-tree, when Israell were many as the sand of the sea, making merry one with an other; when the Husbandman plowed in peace and reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in content; and when the wrongs of the common sort were as well streightned by the line of Iustice, as the oppressions of the mighty reformed by the hand of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.

In <hi>Turkie</hi> hee is with the rest a most poore and vnfortunate slaue; for whether <hi>Mustleman</hi> or Christian, he dare not manure his ground to the best profit of his endeauours, liuing so poorely with such sluttish and drudging company, that I haue pittied his fortune, and commiserated his distresse.

In <hi>Italy</hi> they are a little better, as long as they be able to pay their rents, and husband their grounds; yet doe they seldome liue of their owne, or execute any thing befitting the freedome of conuersation: Besides in many places they are so terrified with the troublesome incursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Banditi, who euen make a prey of their wealth and cattle, that although they know of their robberies and murthers, yet dare they neither detect them, nor deny to entertaine or releeue them.

The 20 yeere hee went into <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> dismantled her Townes, spoiled <hi>Cane,</hi> and as a messenger of reuenge brought fire into the Harbours vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the ships were consumed and set on a blase. <hi>Anno</hi> 24 he encountred the power of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and vnplumed their fethers of ostentation by taking 28 great ships, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the rest vnseruiceable. <hi>Anno</hi> 33 he sailed into <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy,</hi> and so preuailed, that the sea yeelded him safe pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, and all <hi>Burgundy</hi> safe conduct. <hi>Anno</hi> 41 with a memorable victory both at sea and land did the blacke <hi>Prince</hi> resettle <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and in despight of all the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:2947:162"/>
sea forces, or other warlike opposition passed and repassed at pleasure. In the time of <hi>Rich:</hi> 2. about the 10 yeere the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> sailed into <hi>Spaine,</hi> but how glorious that victory was on our side, and how surmounting our Nauie before theirs, the wonderfull successe attested, and their owne inventories record the losse with lamentable <hi>Items.</hi> The next yeere following <hi>Richard Earle</hi> of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Earle</hi> of <hi>Notingham</hi> encountred at sea with an infinite number of <hi>Flemmings;</hi> but victory is in the hands of God, and multitudes of men faile in their ostentation: For in that maritime contention were taken a 100 ships and better, the successe filling our Cities with commodities, and our mouthes with praises and thanksgiuing. In the 5 of <hi>Henr:</hi> 4 when the <hi>French</hi> came to the Ile of <hi>Wight,</hi> and assailed <hi>Dartmouth</hi> with a great Nauy, the rusticall people preuailed against them, and manning out but the fisher-boats of the country, with certaine Pinaces attending the seruice, tooke 16 of their best ships, and compulsed the rest to be the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of their owne obloquy. The 3. of <hi>Hen:</hi> 5. was a yeere of triumph, and a 1000 saile of ships filled the narrow seas, cleared the passage into <hi>Normandy,</hi> amased all men, who had notice of our brauery, and reioyced the rest of <hi>Europe</hi> with <hi>Encomians</hi> of our successe, which followed presently in <hi>France.</hi> In the 15 of <hi>Edw:</hi> 4. it pleased the King to passe ouer to the aide of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> but howeuer his inconstancie proued vnsauory to vs at land, it matters not: I am sure the seas gaue vs way, nor durst their Nauy presume to intercept vs. In the 5. of <hi>Hen:</hi> 8. the former encounter, which I named at <hi>Britaines bay</hi> was a day of terror, and we tooke, burnt, and spoiled as many, as we mustred out of harbour. The
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:2947:163"/>
next yeere threatning <hi>Turwin</hi> and <hi>Turnay</hi> our Nauy ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying all afore it like a swelling riuer, beating downe the slender banks, there scarce appeared an opposite: for the former losses were so great, that they halted downe-right in their recouery, and <hi>France</hi> once lamed in her shipping, cannot euery yeere bring a new Nauy into the channell with good equipage, or aduantage. The 14 yeere the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Surrey</hi> was <hi>Admirall,</hi> and not onely preuailed in all encounters at sea, but by vertue of our shipping con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered diuers townes both in <hi>Britaine</hi> and <hi>Picardy.</hi> The 15. the Duke of <hi>Suffolke</hi> was sent into <hi>France</hi> with an army of 30000, who passed the seas, yea the water of <hi>Some</hi> without battaile, and so terrified the French with all their coadiutors at that time (for you must vnderstand in those repining and murmuring daies against our glory, <hi>France, Spaine,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confederate, or entertained for wages: so that almost all the mercenary shipping of <hi>Europe</hi> attended on the payment of the crownes of the sunne) that they thought it the best part of their securitie to absent themselues. The yeere 35. <hi>Sir Iohn Dudley Vicount Lisle</hi> high <hi>Admirall</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> with a Nauy of 200 saile, passed the seas into <hi>Scotland,</hi> in despight of all the power the confederates could raise, and not onely performed actions beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, but taught them the true knowledge of English shipping and mariners. The next yeere the French Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy came into <hi>Sussex;</hi> but vpon very short warning were dissipated, and in a sudden encounter felt the smart of presumption. Presently as in diuers aduantages of such petty roades and excursions; they landed at <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> and the <hi>Ile</hi> of <hi>Wight,</hi> but with what successe or satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I cannot compare it better than to a bowle of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:2947:163"/>
spilt, irrecouerably to be gathered vp againe: For they neuer durst aduenture, when our ships looked bigg vpon them, but vnderstanding of their imployment abroad, and sequestration farre off, then hurried they suddenly vpon vs; yet I hope neither found vs vnprouided, nor returned backe againe with true cause of insulting. In the 3. of <hi>Edw:</hi> 6. the French Kings gallies and Caricks invaded <hi>Gernsey</hi> and <hi>Iersey:</hi> but with what face fortune looked vpon them, the losse of a 1000 men, with the spoile of their greatest ships and gallies suddenly discouered. Why may I not name here our iourney to <hi>Newhauen</hi> in the 4. of <hi>Queene Elizabeth,</hi> when through the power of our Nauy, at which both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> began to repine, the Earle of Warwicke made the seas wanton with iollity, and affrighted the land with those small troopes of old souldiers from the Garison at <hi>Barwick,</hi> vnited to others raised from the willing musters of our country: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though some enuious hand would stop the mouth of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from ecchoing our applause at this time, yet I am sure <hi>Count Ringraue</hi> and his armie felt the smart of affliction, and the sorrow of many defeatures, and dare auouch, that the seas lay open vnto vs in despight of opposition, or any encounter our enemies durst or could prepare to invite vs to. In the 18. yeere was <hi>Forbishers</hi> first voyage, and by reason that this glorious Queene had as it were tied the obseruation of all Nations to her actions and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a peace being generally contracted, diuers presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous persons tooke aduantage of the same, and filled the narrow seas with rouers and pirats, who ranne vp and downe without controll, like vntamed colts, scorning all enclosures and bounds', vntill <hi>Captaine Holstock</hi> with 4. good ships and two pinaces was appointed the reformer
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:2947:164"/>
of these abuses, who presently brought into the schoole of correction 200 rouers, 8 Flushingers, diuers Barks and Pinaces, and pacified the outragiousnes of these pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thefts. The 19. <hi>Forbishers</hi> second voyage. The 20. <hi>Forbishers</hi> third voyage, with many other of famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, amongst whom <hi>Hawkins, Drake, Candish,</hi> and such worthy sea-men (preuailing in all their explorations) as they attempted great matters, deserue as great commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. About the 23. that famous busines of <hi>Desmonds</hi> rebellion breathed insolencie into those people, by reason the Pope and Spaniard had fortified themselues in <hi>Smir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and with a sufficient number of ships blocked vp the hauen, vntill certaine of her Maiesties Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, and the Deputies forces at land (being then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Lord Grey)</hi> behaued themselues with such good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and successe, that all the passages of victory to vs, and miserable discomfiture to them were set open, and we tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed with a plenary satisfaction to our endeuours. In the 24. <hi>Monsieur</hi> returned into the Low-countries to bee invested with the Duchy of <hi>Brabant:</hi> but when he beheld our glorious fleete, and iudiciously looked vpon their strength and brauery, he burst out into a passionate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause, and sware, that howeuer men were enemies to our peace, they were enemies to truth, if they did not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it without comparison. The yeere following <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Borough</hi> with one ship, and a small Barke went to sea against Rouers, and although the Councell at that time suspected vs ouer-weake to withstand an vnited despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratenes; yet the fight continued against 7 or 8, and all men can witnes our memorable successe in that encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The triumphs of 88 are of such renowne, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy celebration, that the world still remembers our illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious

Nauy, and admirable victory: but this secret was not fully reuealed, that wee were not prouided, nor throughly furnished: so that as true hearts praied for vs, the great God of heauen fought for vs. The yeere fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the <hi>Portingall voiage,</hi> and (as it were set on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees) <hi>Cales voiage,</hi> the <hi>Iland voiage, Sir Richard Leusons</hi> noble exploits, and his place since supplied by <hi>Sir William Mounson,</hi> haue set forward our reputation to runne the race of vnresistable preuailing, and hold vp our glorious countenances in despight of any confronting looke, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining eyes. Nor doe I heare reckon vp our Merchant Aduenturers, and the sundry times encountring with greater and more aduantagious forces: witnes the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Royall in those times, when <hi>Iohn King</hi> was Master, which alone encountred with 3 ships, and 10 gallies, and came off with such iollity, as they fretted to be so disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and we triumphed to welcome home so well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing a man. Since when, although those of <hi>Malta, Florence,</hi> the confederates of the Arches, and many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate Pirats, haue conspired against our traphique, and made our iourney into the <hi>Leuant</hi> somewhat dangerous: yet we haue still gone forward, and could not bee pull'd backe by any wrenching arme whatsoeuer: especially in those daies of tryall, when we stood on our guard, and made our warlike preparation a very paire of tarriers to the Spaniard. For in those daies the <hi>Conuoy</hi> for his we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne treasure was so toilesome, troublesome, chargeable, and dangerous vnto him, that one million defraied but the charges of another, and by that time it came to distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there was a strange account cast vp of losses, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable expences.

Competitor, whether for loue, or displeasure. But if you will truly consider the admirable composition of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, and extraordinary glorie of Kingdomes, it consisteth in sedation of troubles, and in the enriching of priuate men: yea euen <hi>Salomons</hi> greatnesse was raised to a stupendous mountaine of amasement, from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a well compacted peace; in which his Temple was built, his Pallaces were finished, his Cities disposed of, his Souldiers maintained, and his glory spred abroad with sufficient fulnesse: For horses were brought him out of <hi>Arabia,</hi> fine linnen from <hi>Aegipt,</hi> perfumes and odours from <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> spices from <hi>India,</hi> precious stones from the Ilands, gold from Ophir, beasts and strange fowle from <hi>Affricke,</hi> and many other things both for exornation and pleasure from the remotest parts of the earth.

For from a Prince to a Peasant no body liues, but may be traduced in the selfe same kinde, that you would lay imputation on the shoulders of the Merchant: therefore I will absolutely conclude, that the true Merchant-aduenturer, as he is one way the supporter of politicall States by commerce, conuersation, and bringing in of wealth, so is he another way the <hi>Atlas</hi> of honour and magnificent maiesty by his customes, filling the store-houses of a Court, supplying the wants of a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, pleasing the desires of nouelty, cooling the heates of pride, and satiating the vanitie of wishes; nay if you would</p>

In the 12. yeare the Earle of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and many Princes out of France and other Countries came to a Iusts in Smithfield, and made a iust estimation of our vnualuable glory.

King of England the Emperour of Constantinople came of purpose as the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> to <hi>Salomon,</hi> to set report on the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of truth, and see whether custome had enlarged our fame or no, and here he was entertained with all the sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and attractiue showes, and delights, that Arte and expences could deuise to satiate the minde of man: But when Dame IANE Dutches of <hi>Britaine</hi> came ouer to marry our King HENRY, I hope our enemies will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, her traine and Attendants to bee much augmented with the company of many forraine Princes and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates: And if you steppe forward to the 8. yeare of his raigne the Earle of <hi>Marre,</hi> and the great lords of <hi>Scotland</hi> came to solace themselues, and made their triumphes both at Tilt and Turney acceptable to the beholders. The like was performed the 10. yeare, when the <hi>Seneschall</hi> of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault</hi> with all those Princes reputed the Court of England a very Schoole of chiualry, and put in practise according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the braueries of marshall discipline. But when the Lady LVCIA the Dukes sister of <hi>Millane</hi> came to marry EDMVND Earle of <hi>Kent,</hi> both citie and pallace was so furnished with strangers, and the concurses of people so well ordered, that inferiours were amased at so extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary attraction, and the better sort gaue a plaudite to our glory.</p>

If you ouer-looke the time of <hi>Henr:</hi> 5. surnamed the <hi>Champion</hi> of <hi>Honor,</hi> though it was lamentable for the breuitie, yet was it vnmatchable for the royalty. For after his coronation he was scarse three yeeres in his own Kingdome, and yet in the third of his raigne he welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Emperor</hi> of <hi>Almaine</hi> and King of <hi>Rome,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after graced the daughter of <hi>France</hi> and all her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, with many forreine Princes, who would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, till they saw their <hi>Lady Katherine</hi> Queene of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> To which if you adde the entertainment of the Duke of <hi>Holland,</hi> and many Princes of those countries, especially <hi>Freesland,</hi> you cannot chuse but make vp a plentifull breuiary of Heroicke Maiesty, and worthy princelines.</p>
                     <p>About the yeere of Grace 1502. and the 17. yeere of the raigne of <hi>Henry</hi> 7. the expectable <hi>Prince Arthur</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Katherin</hi> daughter to <hi>Ferdinando</hi> King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and his eldest sister <hi>Margaret</hi> was affianced vnto <hi>Iames</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> at whose inaugu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>About the end of <hi>August</hi> 1546. <hi>Flawd</hi> high Admirall of <hi>France</hi> was so royally entertained in <hi>England,</hi> that the King lying at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> met him comming to haue audience with a 1000 horse, whereof 500 were in one liuery, the coates of veluet halfe embro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with gold, and one sleeue of cloth of gold: let other Princes acknowledge this magnificence. <hi>Holinshed</hi> saith 2000 horse.</p>

In the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12. of <hi>France</hi> maried <hi>Mary</hi> the Kings yongest sister: and 1520 the great Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. came into <hi>England</hi> to visit his Aunt, and within two yeere after made a second returne to view <hi>London,</hi> and bee acquainted with our country, from whose example <hi>Christiern</hi> King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> and his wife about the 15 yeere arriued in <hi>England,</hi> and was welcommed to the pleasures of our country, and variety of our pastimes.

In the second yeere of her raigne <hi>Ecmondine</hi> a Prince of <hi>Germany,</hi> and other Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors were sent from the Emperor. In the third yeere <hi>Emmanuel</hi> Prince of <hi>Piemont,</hi> with other Lords came into <hi>England,</hi> and the next moneth the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> landed at <hi>London.</hi>

                     <p>But let mee passe forward to the mirror of all times <hi>Queene Elizabeth:</hi> how proud was the Prince of <hi>Sweden,</hi> that he was graced in <hi>England</hi> with so glorious entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the beginning of her raigne. Not long after 1565 <hi>Christopher</hi> Prince and Marquesse of <hi>Baden</hi> came of purpose to haue his childe borne amongst vs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in the fortune of such a godmother. About the 11. yeere of her raigne <hi>anno</hi> 1568 <hi>Mary Queene</hi> of <hi>Scots,</hi> though shee was surprized in her flight to <hi>France,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated

in her maine proiects; yet for a long time misliked not her imprisonment, and was glad to confesse the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues of her natiue soile and country. In the 14. yeere <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Memorancy,</hi> and <hi>Betrawde de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligniers</hi> Knights of the order of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Michael,</hi> came both into <hi>England,</hi> with other great Princes to gratulate her Maiestie, and acknowledge her worthines. In the 21. of her raigne 1578. <hi>Cassimirus</hi> Count Palatine, and Duke of <hi>Bauaria</hi> was entertained the better, because he came of purpose to admire her Maiestie, and commend her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Not long after 1581. <hi>Francis Burbon Prince Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine</hi> of <hi>Auergne, Arthur Cass Marshall</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> with <hi>Lusignian</hi> and others came to make way to <hi>Monsieurs</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, who accordingly <hi>anno</hi> 24, as Duke of <hi>Aniou,</hi> the French Kings brother, and next heire to the <hi>flower-de-luce,</hi> was welcommed beyond expectation, and entertained with such sumptuous showes, and variety of delight, that they know not, how to put it ouer with true noblenes, considering the disparity betweene their customes and ours. About the yeere 1583. <hi>Albertus Alasco</hi> free Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of <hi>Lasco Vaiuode,</hi> or <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Siradia</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> was an eye witnes of our many prerogatiues, such as we may terme Court brauery, Cities excellency, countries happines, vniformitie of our Vniuersities, strength of our Nauies, and glorious contentation in all estates.</p>

                        <hi>Anno</hi> 1596.

Prince and subiect. Yea 1601. that vndaunted soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier <hi>Duke Birone,</hi> who seldome gased at any <hi>meteor,</hi> or setled <hi>planet</hi> out of his owne sphere, came ouer amongst vs with 300 attendants, and returned with this resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Queene and Court of <hi>England</hi> vnder such a Queene, was the true mirror of maiestie, and map of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, had not some of them misliked the broken and vnsauoury structures of <hi>Whitehall,</hi> which indeede if it might hold vp a head of outward vniformitie and stateli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as it doth when it list of inward maiestie, and greatnes, I know not then who could compare with vs any way: except the gallery of <hi>Paris,</hi> being the worke of 60 yeeres expences, and pride of many seuerall Princes; and the <hi>Turkes Seralio</hi> in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> a vast aedifice for many purposes, and receptacle for 20000 people, which one way or other are lodged in and about it. For in truth within the walls and iron gates it containeth as much roome or more, than all <hi>S. Iames</hi> parke, and <hi>Whitehall</hi> together.</p>
                     <p>When our <hi>King Iames</hi> was established to the admiration of all the states of <hi>Europe; Monsieur Rosne</hi> from <hi>France; Don Iohn de Tassis</hi> from <hi>Spaine;</hi> and many other extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Princes from all the Courts of Christendome, came ouer to gratifie his happines: but 1604 <hi>Don Iohn de Velasco, Constable</hi> of <hi>Castile</hi> was as an extraordinary Prince extraordinarily entertained: to which if you vnite the glorious welcome and admission of <hi>Prince Vlrick Duke</hi> of <hi>Holstaide:</hi> as also of <hi>George Lodwick Lantgraue</hi> of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenburgh</hi> sent from the <hi>Emperor Rodulph,</hi> you may well expose their entertainment against the greatest magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of other countries. <hi>Anno</hi> 1606 <hi>Don Iohn de Mendoza Marquisse</hi> of <hi>S.

Maiestie; and presently the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> came to visit his sister. The next yeere 1607. <hi>Prince Ienuile</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond sonne to the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> sported amongst vs, and much applauded our Court and customes. Then in 1608. followed the welcome of <hi>Christianus</hi> Prince of <hi>Henault;</hi> and presently after the admission of many great personages, besides the <hi>Leigers Embassadors</hi> of diuers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

you looke on Kings Colledge chappell, the sumptuous quadrant of Trinitie, and the delicate compacting of our new Colledges, you cannot but imagine, we had a hope in the structures to contriue some thing for admiration. If in <hi>Oxford</hi> you consider the Diuinitie schooles, the foundations of <hi>Christs Church, Sir Thomas Bodleis</hi> library, and other things of account, you must needs conclude, that we striued to exalt our Nation for such rarities.
