         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHat a day of diſtreſs, and revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the righteous Judgment of God, is to come upon the wicked and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly World (even upon man, who was created in the Image of God, but is now fallen from it, and found out of it, and in another I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage very unlike it) the eye which the God of this world hath blinded, and the heart which he hath hardened by ſin and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion, hath no ſenſe of.</p>
            <p>What a day of diſtreſs and miſery ſome in this nation (and in other parts of the World) have already met with; how they have felt the Weight of Sin upon their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and what a ſore thing it hath been to them to feel their Souls ſeparated from that God that made them (who is the Husband and Father, King and Preſerver of Souls that are found in his Image and Nature)
<pb facs="tcp:104957:4"/>
how they have been inwardly captivated by a Forreign Power, and oppreſſed, and made to ſerve under ſin, and could hear no effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Tidings of his appearance who was able to ſave, but their Spirits were ready to ſink, and their Hope of Redemption, from that which oppreſſed and captivated them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt cut off; this being an inward State and Condition, hath been altogether hid from the Eye which is outward.</p>
            <p>How the Lord at length appeared unto theſe (his Bowels having long rowled over them, and he having long waited to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to them, even till the fully acceptable and ſet time was come) how his Light hath ſhined in and upon them, how he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered thoſe dry Bones together, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed Life into them, and made them live; this is alſo altogether an hidden thing from the Eye of the World.</p>
            <p>How the Lord, who appeared to them, hath exerciſed and tried them; how he hath judged them, and how he hath ſaved them; what Deſolations he hath made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in them, and what he hath built up there; what an Hammer, a Sword, a
<pb facs="tcp:104957:4"/>
Fire, &amp;c. his pure Word of Life hath been in them; How that Birth which could live without God, without his inward Life, or upon Words and Knowledge without Life, hath been famiſhed, until by the Pain of the Famine its very Life and Breath hath been taken from it, and it crucified with Chriſt, by the Pain of the Croſs of Chriſt; and what Birth hath been raiſed and crowned afterwards, and beautified with the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Righteouſneſs and Salvation, yea, with the endleſs Love and Mercy of its God; and how the Lord is with his People, and dwells and walks in them, and how he hath humbled them to walk with him; and how in Fear and Humility they do walk with him in the Light of the Day everlaſting, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as God is Light, and walks in the Light of his own Day; theſe are very ſtrange and unknown things to the Wiſeſt and moſt Prudent in Religion at this Day, who are not gathered into the Myſtery of Godlineſs (nor into the Spirit, Power and Glory of the Father) where theſe things are revealed in and by the Son.</p>
            <p>What Faith the Children of Wiſdom
<pb facs="tcp:104957:5"/>
have, in the Wiſdom and Power which hath appeared; what Confidence they have in the Lord their God, that he will ſtand by them in all their Exerciſes and Trials, both inward and outward; and what Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences they have had of the Lords ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by them in both; how his Faithfulneſs doth not fail, and how their Faith in him is upheld and preſerved by him, that it doth not fail in the ſtormy time, or Hour of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Diſtreſs; and how their Eye is unto him, and their Hearts with him in the Calms, ſo that their God is all in all unto them continually; (And who knows this, but they that have it!) Oh who can utter or declare the Sweetneſs and Certainty of this, where it is enjoyed!</p>
            <p>What Love alſo the Lord ſheds abroad in their Hearts, and how he teacheth and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to love, by often circumciſing their Hearts, and cutting off that which hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the pure Love from ſpringing in them; and how they love others in the Love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God (who is Love) hath loved them; and how natural it is to them to pray for their Enemies, and to bleſs them that curſe
<pb facs="tcp:104957:5"/>
them, and do Good for Evil, but cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite Evil for Evil, being tranſplanted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and growing up in the Root that is good, and ſends up good ſap and Virtue into them, which nouriſheth all that is good in them, but is Death and Deſtruction to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of evil, as the Lord purſueth and findeth it out; Oh how impoſsible is it for the Heart of man to conceive or underſtand!</p>
            <p>Now, I alſo having taſted of the Mercy and Goodneſs of the Lord, and having been brought out of a State of great Miſery and Sorrow of Heart into the Redemption and Joy of God's choſen; and having found the Lord faithful to me, and giving me Faith in the Appearance of his Spirit and Power in me, and true Love (tender Love) not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to my Brethren in the Truth, but to all Mankind ſpringing in me, and divers Fruits iſſuing forth from it, ſome of them at this time I cannot but publiſh, and the Lord open the Hearts of thoſe whom it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, that they may find ſome Help, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and Furtherance by it; for it is the Joy of my Heart to receive Good from God, to be filled with his Bleſsings, to have my Cup

               <p>O the Glory of your ſtate outward, who were the people whom God once choſe and loved, and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Power and Preſence among, above all People!

And when the Arm of the Lord did deſtroy them before thee, thou didſt dwell in ſafety alone, and the Lord was a Fountain of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to thee, and his Heavens did drop down Fatneſs upon thee. Happy waſt thou O <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> who was like unto thee, O People ſaved by the Lord, the Shield of thy help, and who was the Sword of thy Excellency! And thine Enemies were ſound Lyars unto thee, and thou didſt tread upon their high places: And it might have been ſtill ſo with thee, hadſt thou not been unmindful of the Rock that begat thee, and forgotten God that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thee: For thy Glory ſhould not have been taken from thee, but ſwallowed up in a higher Glory, wherein thou mighteſt have had the firſt and chiefeſt ſhare, hadſt thou not, by thy almoſt conſtant Rebellion and Unbelief, provoked the Lord againſt thee; not only often to afflict, but at laſt utterly to caſt thee off from being a People, and choſe a people in thy ſtead, who ſhould bring forth better Fruits to the Lord of the Vine-yard, then thou in thy Day hadſt done.</p>
               <p>Yet when thy ſtate was thus glorious, it was not a ſtate of the truly-ſubſtantial, laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glory, but a ſhadowy ſtate or repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative

This is of the Nature of God and Chriſt, this is a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Light, of his pure life, this is the law and commandment everlaſting, which God writes in the hearts of the ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael,</hi> For the inward <hi>Jew</hi> hath inward tables, where the inward law is w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But, alas, men are in their ſeveral ſorts of Dreams, and take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it. What ſhall the Lord do to awaken this Nation? In what way ſhall his Power appear, to bring down Unrighteouſneſs, and to bring up Righteouſneſs in the Spirits of People? Do ye not think the Lord hath been at work, and is ſtill at work? How could Deceit be ſo waſted inwardly, and Truth ſo grown inwardly, and overſpread more and more, and gain ground in the Nation, if the hand and Power of the Lord were not with it, bleſſing it. O take notice of the handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of the Lord, ye children of men, and wait to feel Truth near, and to partake of the living Virtue and Power of it; that ye may feel your Hearts creating anew, and the old Heavens and Earth may inwardly paſs away, wherein dwells Unrighteouſneſs and the new Heavens and the new Earth may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly witneſſed, wherein dwells Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

O that this Nation might become a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe of God! O that every one might be ſenſible of his Preſence, and Power, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and righteous Government inwardly in the Heart, from the King that ſits on the Throne, to the Begger on the Dunghil. Surely man was not made for himſelf! ſurely he was not made ſuch a Creature as now he is! but in the holy Image of God, with love in his heart to God above all, and to his Neighbour as to himſelf. O what are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions and Profeſſions of ſeveral ſorts, where this love is not found! The Lord is reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Image, and bringing forth the true, pure Religion again. The Pearl, the Truth contains &amp; comprehends it.

Nay, nor the ſecond Beaſt neither, though he had Horns like a Lamb, and ſpake like a Dragon, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed all the power of the firſt Beaſt, and did great wonders, and had power to give Life unto the Image of the former Beaſt, and would kill all that would not worſhip the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Beaſt; and would ſuffer none to buy or ſell, but ſuch as had the Mark or Name of the Beaſt: Yet neither could this Beaſt overcome the Followers of the Lamb, as to their inward Life and Teſtimony, though it had power to kill and ſuppreſs them outwardly, ver. 11. to the end, &amp; chap. 14.9. to ver. 13. which plainly ſhews the ſaints had patience, and kept the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God and the Faith of Jeſus, and would not worſhip the Beaſt and his Image, nor receive his Mark, either in Forehead or Hand.</p>
