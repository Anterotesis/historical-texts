         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ACcording unto your Commands I drew forth neere
nine hundred Foot, and my Troop of Horſe, and upon
advice from the Governour of Glouceſter I marched
unto him, but finding the way which was intended al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
fruſtrate, and the Governour of Glouceſter not very
well, I went with Sir <hi>John Bridges</hi> neere to Hereford, and ſent
for thither the two Gentlemen who Sir <hi>John</hi> had treated withall
about the buſineſſe, who were then out of Hereford fearing to
come to Towne, whom I ſatisfied my ſelfe of the Enemies ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and the negligence of the Guards, which cauſed me to
thinke of ſome other way; and amongſt others this was moſt
prevalent with me, which by Gods bleſſing tooke effect, the
way was his; To march in one day and night to Hereford from
Glouceſter, which done I had provided ſixe men in the forme
of Labourers, and one with them to be a Conſtable, with a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to bring theſe men to worke in the Towne to them, I
gave a good ſumme of Money in hand, and promiſed them a
large reward; theſe men with 150. Fire-locks in the darke of
the night I intended to lodge neere the Gate, and ſo neere
them as the ground would admit out of ſight; I intended to
draw a Body to ſecond them and enter with them, and ſo to
ſurpriſe the Towne upon the letting downe the Bridge in the
morning; then I came backe to Glouceſter and enformed Col.
<hi>Morgan</hi> of it, deſiring him to joyne with me to put it to tryall,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113338:3"/>
which he condeſcended unto, and we marched munday to that
purpoſe all night, but fell ſhort, and therefore to delude the
Enemy retreated backe within nine miles of Glouceſter; the
next day at night we returned againe, and with carefull Spies
and Scouts kept back intelligence from them, ſo that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
diſcovered us; but I laid my Country-men and Firelockes
within three quarters Musket ſhot, a place which I had enquired
out for the purpoſe, which Party I left to be managed by my
Lievtnant Colonell, who behaved himſelfe very gallantly, and
the maine body of Foot. I led my ſelfe, Col. <hi>Morgan</hi> being with
the Body of Horſe which he undertooke; and this morning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the letting downe of the Bridge the Country-men went with
their Pickaxes and Spades to the Bridge, the Guard beginning
to examine them, they killed three of the Guard, and kept the
reſt in play untill the Fire-locks came up to them, then made
good until the Body came up; and it pleaſed God the Deſigne 
ſo tooke, that we entred the Towne with ſmall loſſe; in which
we had 11. peeces of Ordnance, much Armes, and the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
here inſerted, there being many more in Towne as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
which one day will diſcover. The Mercy is wonderfull, I
deſire the Lord may have the honor of it, for it is his own Work.

City of <hi>Hereford,</hi> by our Intelligence to be ſo ſtrong,
both in it ſelfe and the reſolution of the Defendants, that
much hazard would be in the gaining of it; Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

reſolved to make tryall by falling on upon the place; unto
which endeavour the Lord was pleaſed ſo to adde his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
that this morning about breake of day we forced our
entrance, God putting ſuch a ſpirit into the Souldiers; as was
beyond expreſſion: Our ingagements to them was very large,
the deſigne being very deſperate, and alſo to ſome other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
who were very helpfull, and behaved themſelves very
gallantly in the falling on: Which ingagements, that we
may be able to diſcharge, we humbly deſire your Lordſhips 
to give Order for that ſumme which you were pleaſed to
promiſe for this ſervice. After they had marched this
night in the ſnow up to the mid-legge, almoſt twenty miles
in and out, which that the Enemy might not be jealous of,
we marched the ſame march upon Munday night, though
with ſuch hardſhip, that three of our men died in the ſnow;
and retreated upon Tueſday almoſt to <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> they then
beleeving we had beene cleare gone, were more ſecure, and
we fell on unexpected; Our loſſe was not conſiderable, God
be bleſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe goodneſſe was plainely ſeene, (to him be
the glory.) The Enemy fought it out in the ſtreets, where

divers are ſlaine, and the reſt priſoners: We are not able at
preſent to particularize them, onely thoſe whoſe names wee
can at this inſtant be informed of we have here inſerted.
The Towneſmen have ſuffered by the Souldier, by reaſon
we entred it by force, and that the Enemy ſhot out at the
windowes and in the ſtreets, the Souldier was ſo inraged
that we could not prevent them from plundering, which we
indeavoured much to have done, and ſhall be alwaies rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
