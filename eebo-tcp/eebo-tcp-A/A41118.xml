            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>THE KILLING POWER OF THE LAW.</head>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>Rom. 7. 9.</bibl>
                  <q>For I was once alive without the Law, but when the Commandment came, ſin revived, and I died.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe words the Apoſtle ſhewes<note place="margin">The Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Text.</note> Two things; <hi>Firſt,</hi> What a jolly man he thought himſelf to be whilſt he was a Phariſee, before the Lord wrought upon him by the Law: <hi>Secondly,</hi> What a miſerable wretched crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he ſaw himſelf to be when the Lord took him
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93432:4"/>
in hand, and diſcovered his ſins unto him, before the Law came home unto him, and convinced his Conſcience; he thought himſelf to be alive, but when the commandment came, ſin revived, and he died.</p>
               <p>1. In the former we may obſerve Two things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, The jollineſs of the Apoſtle, he thought himſelf to be alive; I was alive without the Law, I was a Phariſee, and thought my ſelf to be alive, I faſted twice a week, and prayed every day, and made long prayers each day; when he conſidered how he walked thus in all the Ordinances of God, he thought if this was not to be alive, he knew not what it was to be alive; I was alive once without the Law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We have here the cauſe why he had this good conceit of himſelf, it was becauſe he was without the law, the law of God had not convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him, it had not diſcovered his miſerable and wretched eſtate unto him; though he had ſome underſtanding in the literal ſenſe of the Law, yet the Law was not yet come home unto him, he was as yet without the law, and that was the reaſon of that good conceit he had of himſelf, he did eſteem himſelf to be alive.</p>
               <p>And then again in the latter part; When the commandment came, ſin revived, but I died. There we may alſo obſerve Two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The law ſhewed him what a wretched e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and condition he was in, for all his ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſſe, ſin revived and I died: though I thought before I was alive, yet when the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement came, ſin revived, and I died; I ſaw I was a dead man, when the Lord took me in hand, to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93432:4"/>
deal with me, and let me ſee how my caſe ſtood before him. Howſoever I thought my ſelf to be in a good caſe before, now I ſaw I was but a dead man; I did not ſee ſuch evil, and ſuch a maſſe of corruption before; but when the Lord diſcovered my ſelf unto my ſelf, and when I ſaw the Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the law, then I ſaw that ſin was alive in me, and I died; when I ſaw how I ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have my ſelf in my affections, and in my inward man, then ſin revived, and I for my part was a dead man, I was fain to come down from thoſe high conceits, and imaginations I had before.</p>
               <p>Secondly. We have here the cauſe why he was thus brought down, it was becauſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God which came home unto him, the law of God came home unto his conſcience, and diſcovered unto him, how it was with him, and it made him to ſhake in the apprehenſion of his own eſtate, that he was but a dead man, and that he had gone to hell, and periſhed everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he had continued in that eſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I intend at this time to treat of the former part, Without the law I was once alive: and here Two things muſt be opened: Firſt, what doth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle mean, by without the Law: Secondly, What doth he mean when he ſaith, I was once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.</p>
               <p>1. For the firſt, When the Apoſtle ſaith he was without the law, he doth not mean ſimply, that he did think himſelf without the Law, that is, without the binding Authority of the Law, for ſo no reaſonable creature is, yea, indeed no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at all is without the law of God, for there is a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93432:5"/>
Law of Obedience impoſed upon all the creatures and the unreaſonable creatures do keep the Law that is impoſed upon them by God; and howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reaſonable creatures depart from this law and break it, yet they are under the binding power of this Law; therefore the Apoſtle doth not thus mean that he was without the Law, therefore we muſt know, that to be without the law is taken Four wayes:</p>
               <p>Firſt, To be without the Law, is meant, to be without the promulgation and publiſhing of the Law, and ſo the Heathen only are ſaid to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law, as we may ſee <hi>Rom. 2. 12.</hi> there the Heathen are ſaid to be <hi>without the Law:</hi> that is, without the promulgation of the Law, it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed only to the Jewes upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> was not without the law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is taken in regard of the literal knowledge of the Law, and ſo ignorant people are ſaid to be without the law of God; they know not the Law of God; and in this ſenſe <hi>Paul</hi> was not without the law, he was trained up in the law, he was learned in the law, for he was <hi>brought up at the feet of Gamaliel,</hi> Acts 22. 3. ſo that he had the logical meaning of the law, and was able to ſpeak of the points of Religion, better then a thouſand millions of carnal men, he had the literal knowledge of the law.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is taken in regard of the moral obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the law, and ſo wicked men are ſaid to be without the law, as we may ſee, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 9. The law is not given to a righteous man, but to the lawleſs and diſobedient;</hi> wicked men are lawleſs, they live as if there were no law, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93432:5"/>
and prophane perſons, as they are ſaid to live without God in the world, ſo they are ſaid to live without law, as if there were no law to bind them; they are people that are not to be held within any compaſſe, they take notice of no command to rule in their hearts, and rectifie their lives; and in this ſenſe <hi>Paul</hi> was not without the law neither, for he lived after the moſt ſtrict and exact ſect of the Phariſees, <hi>Phil. 3. 4, 5. If any man think he hath whereof he may truſt in the fleſh, I much more, circumciſed the eighth day, of the ſtock of Iſrael, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews, as touching the Law, a Phariſee;</hi> he was one that faſted and curbed himſelf, yea, he kept two Faſts a week, (as thoſe Phariſees did, that were of the better rank) he prayed daily, and performed the duties of Religion, and there was no outward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the Law, which he performed not; he was one that was conformable to the letter of the law, according as he underſtood the Law; he was morally obedient to the Law; he was no extortio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor unjuſt perſon; no, he did the works of the Law, and thoſe things contained in the Law; nay, there was no body that could challenge him with any blame; none that were familiar with him, could ſay any thing to tax him withal, when he was in his ignorance, and blindneſs; therefore in this ſenſe he was not without the Law.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Therefore in the Fourth place, we are ſaid to be without the Law in regard of the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſenſe of the law, and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> was without the law; he did not clearly underſtand the divine and ſpiritual ſenſe of the law; he did not ſee the glory and the beauty of the law of God, how it did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93432:6"/>
all the breaches of righteouſneſs, how it reached to all the inner parts, how contrary the law of God was to all his nature; thus <hi>Paul</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not the ſpiritual nature of the law, he had not the ſpiritual underſtanding of the law, and thus he was without the law.</p>
               <p>2. Now for the other words, I was alive once;</p>
               <p>1. It is meant here ſpiritually towards God; he doth not mean naturally, for he was alive natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both before and after the commandment came; but the meaning is, he did not think himſelf to be ſuch a wretched curſed creature as he was; he thought he had the fear of God in him, and true obedience in him; he thought he had a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual kinde of life, as we may ſee <hi>Rom. 6. 11. Ye are dead</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to ſin, but are alive to God in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And, <hi>Rom. 7. 13. Give not your members as weapons unto ſin, but give your ſelves unto God, as thoſe that are alive from the dead.</hi> i.e. As thoſe that have the pure and ſpiritual life of grace in them: ſo <hi>Luk. 15. 24. This my ſon was dead, and is alive again;</hi> that is, ſpiritually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live again; he was a dead creature, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from his father, which is the fountain of life; he was dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, he was a dead man, but now he is alive again, he hath ſpiritual life again.</p>
               <p>2. To be alive is taken to be conceitedly ſo, alive in his own conceit, he hath not true life in him, yet he doth imagine that he hath life in him, he thinks he hath life, and is dead, <hi>Rev. 3. 1.</hi> I know thy works, thou haſt a name thou liveſt, but thou art dead: Here the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> did imagine
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93432:6"/>
ſhe was alive, and others conceived ſo; ſhe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be alive, and yet notwithſtanding was dead, ſhe had no true life in her: ſhe ſeemed to be alive, not only in the ſight of others, but in her own apprehenſion; ſhe ſeemed to be alive, and yet was dead; now this is the meaning of the words, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the law I was alive once; that is, I thought my ſelf to be alive; I apprehended my ſelf to be no dead man, no damned man; I thought not my ſelf to be under the wrath of God, and one that ſhould periſh evermore, if I continued in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate wherein I was; I hoped better things of my ſelf, I ſaw theſe ſigns of grace and life in me, and I thought I was alive indeed, till the commandment came, till the law of God was preſſed upon my conſcience, and ſhewed me the contrary; I thought my ſelf to be a very live man, and one that had ſome hope of eternal happineſs, and one that might enter into glory, I took my ſelf to be alive; thus we ſee the meaning of the words.</p>
               <p>Now the Point I intend at this time to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> is the livelineſs of a carnal mans heart, before the law comes home to him, and is preſſed to him, and ſhews him his damnable eſtate, and that he is dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, he hath ſome colour of righteouſneſs, that he is moral and civil, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and he hath ſomthing that is like grace and life, he hath ſome hope towards God, and hath ſome kind of obedience, he ſeems to be obedient to the commandment of God; before he is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the law of God, he is a live creature. Here St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews it by his own example, <hi>Without the law I was once alive,</hi> noting out unto us, how it is with every unhumbled man, with every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93432:7"/>
man, that is not yet converted to God, he hath many things to ſay for himſelf, but he doth not underſtand the pureneſſe of the law, the law hath not yet killed him, it hath not yet pulled him flat down before almighty God: a man that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbled by the law of God is a live man, he will not be perſwaded, that he is a dead, damned crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; he doth apprehend and hope he hath life, it is ſo with men, before their converſion, they will not believe that they are damned creatures, and they think it uncharitableneſſe in any to ſay they are damned creatures, and dead creatures, they will not believe it; ſo long as the law is not char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon their conſciences, ſo long as they ſee not how it is with them, they do verily apprehend that they have life in them, their hearts are not killed, their ſpirits are not dead within them, they are not pulled down in the apprehenſion of their own curſed eſtates before Almighty God: this is the thing I intend to inſiſt upon.</p>
               <p>2. For the Proof of the point, we may ſee, 1 Tim. 5. 5. there the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows that lived in pleaſure, ſaith, <hi>She that liveth in pleaſure, is dead while ſhe is alive;</hi> that is, dead in pleaſure, dead in ſin, dead in the vanity of her own heart, and yet ſuch a Widow liveth, ſhe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not only a natural life, but ſhe is alive in her own conceit in regard of a ſpiritual life; for if ſhe conceived ſhe were a dead creature, a damned creature, it would kill all her pleaſure, it would kill the heart of any creature under heaven, it would break the neck of all her pleaſure, but in that ſhe took her pleaſure, it was a plain token that ſhe was not killed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:93432:7"/>Now for the Opening of the Point, I will do theſe Three things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, I will ſhew what this livelineſſe is, and wherein it conſiſts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I will ſhew what the effects of it are.</p>
               <p>Thirdly the Uſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt I will ſhew what this livelineſſe is, and it conſiſts in theſe Three things; I could branch them into Four, but I will reduce them into Three Heads.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, It conſiſts in the non-appearance of a mans dead, and damned eſtate: So long as a mans dead and damned eſtate doth not appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, ſo long a man thinks he is alive, and that he is not a dead man, he is not a man that hath the ſentence of condemnation lying upon him, ſo long as the law hath not come, and ſhewed a man his wretched eſtate, and made his damnable eſtate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in its own colours unto him, why he is a live man, he conceives himſelf to be alive becauſe the law of God hath not convinced him of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: if the law of God doth ſeiſe upon a mans heart, and in its own colours appear to a mans eyes, and hold it ſelf as a glaſſe to a mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and ſhews him his wretchedneſſe, and what a curſed eſtate he is in before God, this will kill his very heart, and break the livelineſſe that is in him, and make him burſt out into out-cries, Oh! I am a dead man, I am a damned man; ſo that the livelineſſe that is here ſpoken of, conſiſts in the non-appearance of a mans dead and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable eſtate: As for example, an Adulterer, his damnable eſtate doth not appear to him, he knows
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93432:8"/>
not that he is a dead man, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 18. <hi>He knows not that the dead are there, and that her gueſts are in the depth of hell:</hi> when he goes to lie with his Whore, and commit his wickedneſſe, he doth not think that they are dead and damned men that are there, nor that they are in the pit of Hell. Though his Conſcience may tell him, that he is wicked, and ſinful, and wretched, and that he is half dead; yet he is not a dead man, he is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely a dead man, he doth not know this: It may be he will confeſſe it, Lord, I am a dead man, Lord, I am a damned man; it may be he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe this in his prayer, becauſe he hath ſome light, but yet his heart is not taken down, the livelineſs of his heart is not killed. I will prove it to you: for let another man, a Miniſter of God, or a child of God, ſay he is a dead man, a damned man, one that lies under the wrath of God, he will deny it, and ſay he is uncharitable, and judgeth hardly, and why may he not be a live man, and a good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an? he hopes he is, he doth not know that he is a dead man; as the wiſe-man ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 12. <hi>There is a way that ſeemeth right to a man, but the iſſues thereof are death:</hi> that is, there is a way that ſeems to be a way of life, and a man ſeems to be alive that walks in that way; but the truth is, it is a way of death, and a man that goeth in that way is a dead man, and a damned man; but yet in the mean time, while he walks in that way, it ſeems to be a way of life unto him; there is a non-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the deadneſſe, and damnedneſſe of a mans eſtate and condition that walks in that way, and therefore it ſeems to him to be a right way, and a way of life, and there is great hope in him
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93432:8"/>
that he ſhall live for evermore, and many men do walk in that way, and therefore it ſeems to him to be a right way, and a way of life; it ſeems right to a man, but the end thereof is death: and this is the Firſt thing, wherein this livelineſs conſiſts, the non-appearance of a mans dead and damned eſtate.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, It conſiſts in Performance; he is able, as he conceives, to do the duties that God commands; he hath wiſdom and ability at home to go about his affairs; he hath underſtanding and ſupply at home; he hath life, and ſufficiency to go about theſe and theſe duties and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances; let the law tell him, he muſt be ſober, he hath life to avoid the Ale-houſe, and if he commit a Drunken Act, he would have you think he hath grace to be ſorry for it; and let a man tell him, he is a dead man, he hath no grace in him, no life in him; he will tell you, he doth thus and thus, he hears Gods Word, and he Prayes to God, and he Truſts in God, and he Believes in God; your tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of him this, doth not kill his heart, he thinks he is alive for all this; nay, let the law of God, come and tell him, He is a dead man for all his doing; this will not kill him neither, ſo long as the Lord himſelf doth not open his eyes, and clear his eye-ſight, and diſcover his ſins, and convince his Conſcience; though the law ſay he is a dead man, and a damned man, this doth not kill him, he can wait upon God and perform theſe and theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Then let the law of God ſay, He is a dead man for all this, he muſt deny himſelf: why ſo he will; I confeſſe, Lord, I am an unrighteous man, a wretched man, a ſinful creature, and all my righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is as menſtruous raggs; and now he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93432:9"/>
thinks all is well, but the law of God, hath not yet come home unto him, and ſhewed him his heavie eſtate, but he is alive in regard of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the duty, and thinks verily he hath life at home in him; whereas, if the law of God did come home and charge his eſtate upon him, and ſhew him, what obedience the law requires, what ſeverity, and truth in the inward parts, it would break a mans heart, and kill him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all performance: but in the mean time that a mans heart is not killed, and the law hath not given him his deaths wound, he thinks he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live: <hi>Cry aloud,</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>lift up thy voice like a trumpet, ſhew my people their tranſgreſſions, and the houſe of Iſrael their ſins,</hi> Iſai. 58. 1. there the Lord looks upon the people as dead, wretched ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and abominable people, but yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they thought they were alive in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, as we may ſee, <hi>verſ. 2. Yet they ſeek me daily, and delight to know my wayes, even as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that did righteouſly, and had not forſaken the ſtatutes of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of Juſtice, they draw near to me, ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We have faſted, and thou regardeſt it not.</hi> We ſee here they take delight in approaching unto God, they take delight in Gods Ordinances, and ſeek God early, they can do thus, and thus, and are alive in all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances; but that man whoſe ſpirit the law hath pulled down, and the Lord hath convinced him of his infinite inability to perform the law, he cannot ſee any livelineſſe in him, unto any performance. Let any duty come, it kills his heart: I ſhould now hear the Word of God, but my heart is unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and my ear uncircumciſed, and I cannot
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93432:9"/>
hear aright. Let an opportunity be offered to pray, it kills his heart; I ſhould now call upon the Name of the Lord, but I have ſuch a curſed heart I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray, I cannot ſpeak one right word before God. Let an occaſion be offered of holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, it kills his heart; alas, ſaith he, I want pure language, my tongue was never touched with a coal from the Altar, my lips have not ability to drop forth ſavoury ſpeeches, I am not able to ſpeak one ſyllable aright to Gods glory; it kills his heart, he ſees no life at all in him, unleſſe he can have life from without, and ability from without, he is dead, all is nothing to him, the law hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the livelineſſe that was in him: But he that is not humbled by the law, he is alive, he hath life in himſelf, it is nothing with him to Pray, and go to Church, and hear Gods Word, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but thruſting to do the duty; he hath life in him to do duties, and wait upon God in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, but when the law comes home to him, it plainly lets him ſee that he hath no life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to do any good, he muſt ſeek for life and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity from without, elſe he is a dead man, he can do nothing in this caſe: <hi>David</hi> in this caſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lookup: <hi>Mine iniquities are gone over my head, I cannot look up,</hi> Pſal. 40. <hi>Moſes,</hi> he is a man of uncircumciſed lips, and cannot ſpeak unto <hi>Pharaoh; Paul</hi> cannot do any thing that is good, <hi>In me dwelleth no good thing,</hi> Rom. 7. And ſo for the reſt of Gods people, when the law hath killed them and laid them dead, in regard of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, they muſt have life from without, there is no life at home, no grace at home, no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding at home, they muſt go out for all: but a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93432:10"/>
carnal man, he is alive unto all performances. Many a man is like unſavoury ſalt, good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but to throw upon the dung-hill. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver received the Holy Ghoſt, and yet he will be inducted into a living, and take Paſtoral Charge upon him, as if he were able to performe the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Miniſter, and take the Charge of Souls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. So <hi>Ananias</hi> will be a husband, and <hi>Saphira</hi> a wife, <hi>Athalia</hi> will be a Queen, and <hi>Nimrod</hi> a King, and <hi>Abimelech</hi> a Judge; they are alive to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge all theſe duties: thus men are alive, the Law of God hath not killed their hearts, &amp; pulled down their ſpirits; it hath not made it appear unto them, what wretched, curſed creatures they are. This is the ſecond thing, wherein this livelyneſſe conſiſts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This livelyneſſe conſiſts in a preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous hope; he conceives that he is juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and that God will not damn him, but forgive him his ſins. There is nothing can make a mans heart more full of life, then to think that he is righteous before God, and that God will not impute his ſins unto him: there is nothing can make a man more alive, then this. If they think they are juſtified before God, they have then a lively hope, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 3. bleſſed be God,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>even the Father of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which according to his abundant mercy, hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten us again, to a lively hope, by the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt from the dead.</hi> So theſe men have a hope, that makes them lively, and full of life; as a poor man that hath ſome grounded hope of an Earthly inheritance, it makes the heart lively: Poverty deads the heart; he that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to maintain himſelf, and thoſe that belongs
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93432:10"/>
unto him, it deads his heart; but if he hath ſome hopes of an hundred pound a year, and his hope is grounded, if he hath ſure hope of it, and he makes no doubt of it; it makes his heart full of life: ſo when a man doth believe that he is in a good caſe, that he is delivered from death, that he is in the eſtate of grace, when he hath ſome probability that God hath juſtified him from ſin; this breeds an hope in him of an eternal Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and this hope, the conſideration of it, makes the ſoul full of life; There is nothing can make a man more lively, then a hope that he is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified before God, and that God will not impute his ſins unto him. Now when a carnal man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives he is righteous before God, and that God will forgive him his iniquities, that God will not damn him, nor count him a dead &amp; a damned man; ſo long as a man doth imagin this, he muſt needs be a lively man; he is alive in his own apprehenſion; nay all the delights in the world, cannot make a man ſo ful of life, as this hope. It is not mens following their pleaſure, that makes their hearts ſo full of life; as to have hope that the Lord doth not account them dead men, that they are juſtified men, and righteous men, that they have ſalvation to ſhew for, heaven and Eternall happineſſe to ſhew for, that they ſhall go to heaven. But if now the Law were charged upon a man, if he knew that he were a dead man, a damned man, it would pluck down his ſpirits, and make his ſpirits dead, for all his pleaſures. It is the conceit that men are juſtified, that makes them ſo full of life; ſo long as the Law doth not come home to a man, and point him out in his colours, and make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93432:11"/>
to him, that he lyeth under the wrath of Almighty God, that the Lord doth account him an abominable, wretched creature, ſo long as he doth not apprehend this; eſpecially if he have any good gifts, and parts, and qualities, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral obedience to the Law; doing good duties, and a general laying hold upon the promiſes, and a hope they belong to him; this makes him alive, <hi>Phil. 3. 9. Paul</hi> when he was a Phariſee, and did Moral Duties, and performed Moral Obedience to the Law of God, he thought he had righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his own; he calls it there, <hi>his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> he ſo apprehended of himſelf; now this is that which makes men alive, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that they have ſome Religion, and ſome Grace. You ſhall have many men and women that hate the Servants of God, and yet think they are godly men, and have Grace and Life in them. We may ſee it <hi>Acts 13. 50.</hi> there it is ſaid that the <hi>Jews ſtirred up certain devout and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable women, and raiſed perſecution againſt Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their Coaſts:</hi> Though they hated <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> yet they are ſaid to be <hi>devout,</hi> and <hi>honourable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> They imagined they were very Devout, they conceived they were Religious; How many men and women are there, that think they are righteous, and they will do many duties, and take many good courſes; in ſo much, that it would pity a man to think they ſhould goe to hell? they will be very Zealous, they will be very Earneſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Drunkenneſſe, and cry out againſt the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the times; they are marvellous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and godly, and yet a man that is Devout and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93432:11"/>
godly in truth and in deed, they cannot abide him, but hate him. Now if the Law ſhould come home unto them, and diſcover how indeed it is with them; it would humble their ſouls, and pull down their ſpirits, and make them dead; ſo that this preſumptuous hope, that men are in good terms with God, and that God will be merciful to them, and forgive them their ſins; this makes them to be alive.</p>
               <p>2. We come now to the Second thing, and that is the <hi>Effect</hi> of this livelyneſſe, what Effects it works in the heart; and the Effects of this Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe are Four.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It makes them ſound and heart-whole, like a boyl unlaunched, it is yet ſound. The true ſight of ſin, and wrath of God in the ſoul, is able to break the heart of any man; it is able to dead his ſpirit, and kill all the livelyneſſe that is in him, and make him have little life to go on as he doth. But ſo long as the Law of God is not come home to a man, though he have no title to heaven, though hell be the portion of his cup, yet he is as ſound as can be, as heart-whole as may be: let carnal comfort come, he can take it; let pleaſures come, he is able to delight himſelf therewith, and go on in his courſe as if he ailed nothing, <hi>Prov. 18. 14.</hi> the Wiſe man ſaith, <hi>the ſpirit of a man will ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain his infirmities, but a wounded ſpirit, who can bear?</hi> When the Lord comes to wound a mans heart with the ſight of his ſins, and the fearful condition he is in, what a curſed creature he is, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no mercy, and being out of Chriſt; having no pardon, no grace, no holineſſe, but lyeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curſe of God: If the Law thus come
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93432:12"/>
home, and wounds his Conſcience, he is not able to bear it; this man, let carnal comforts come, he is not able to take them; it kills the heart. Look as it is with the Stomack, if it can take meat, and digeſt it, it muſt needs be alive; for if the Stomack be dead, it can digeſt nothing. So for the taſt, if a mans palat, and all the inſtruments of the taſt be dead, he takes no delight in any meats; ſo there is a kind of ſoundneſſe in the Soul, that is the reaſon why a man can delight in carnal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, in Drinking, and Sporting, and in Profit, and Gain. There is a kind of ſoundneſſe, and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe in the heart; the heart is not yet broken: If the Law come, and take the hearts life away, this wil pull down the heart, it will make a mans heart e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven break, it will pull down his ſpirit: But a man whom the Law hath not yet humbled, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him his damned eſtate, his heart is yet whole, and ſound. When the Law of God had but a little killed <hi>Ahabs</hi> heart, you might ſee it in his very gate; he went ſoftly, he could not tread ſo confidently upon the ground, as he was wont to do; it tamed his very ſteps, it is wonderful how his heart was broken; it appeared in his very go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down. When the Law comes home to a man, it is able to kill his heart, and makes him Soul-ſick, and makes him cry out, O the wretchedneſſe of my heart; it makes a man ſick at the heart, it lyes like a heavy Plague upon the heart and conſcience, it will make a man ſick of his ſins, it will make him even at deaths door with his ſins; it will make him ſay with <hi>Paul, when the Commandment came, ſin revived, and I dyed.</hi> But another man though he hath evident demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93432:12"/>
that he is a dead man, yet the Law of God hath not pulled down his heart; ſickneſſe will pull down a mans Stomack; ſo when the Law of God comes home to a mans Conſcience, and makes him ſick, it makes him yield, and pulls down his Stomack. Many men are crazy, and ſickly; and yet they lye not by it, but walk up and down, and go abroad; but if they were heart ſick, it would pull them down, and make them lye by it. So many a carnal man, may have ſome qualms of ſin, but yet their hearts can go abroad after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and pleaſures, after vanities, and delights; they can goe abroad for all this. But when the Law comes home, it will pull down a mans ſpirit, and make him heart-ſick. This is the meaning of that place, <hi>The whole need not a Phyſician, but the ſick, Mat. 9. 12.</hi> Every carnal man, ſo long as he is not humbled, and broken under the ſight of his ſins; his heart is yet whole, his ſpirit is yet ſound, he is not yet wounded; as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa. 1. 6. from the crown of the head, to the ſole of the foot, there is nothing but wounds, and ſwellings, and ſores full of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; there is no ſoundneſſe in him:</hi> He is indeed full of wounds, but the skin is yet ſound, it is not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he feels it not; the Law hath not yet diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his eſtate unto him. This is the firſt effect of this livelyneſſe, it makes men to be ſound, and heart-whole.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Second</hi> effect of this livelyneſſe, when a man is alive in the non-appearance of his dead and damned eſtate; alive in performance, alive in preſumption, and ſelf-juſtifying, and ſelf-hopes; The effect of it is, that he is fearleſs; the more
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93432:13"/>
lively, the more fearleſs. Firſt, the <hi>Object</hi> muſt dead the heart, before it can make the heart fear; ſo long as the heart is ſtout, the livelyneſſe that is in the heart, is able to keep out fear: So the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of a ſinner, makes the heart fearleſſe and ſecure. A man would wonder how any creature durſt provoke God; it is almoſt beyond the reach of true reaſon, how any creature ſhould dare to provoke God; to conſider what infinite danger he is in, to have the wrath of the God of heaven and earth to hang over his head, to be under the hand of revenging Juſtice, to pull down all the Woes, and Plagues, and Comminations of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soul; that a man ſhould do this, and yet be ſecure, it would make a man wonder at it. But a man that hath this livelyneſſe, he can provoke God, and yet be ſecure, as <hi>Job 12. 6. thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God are ſecure,</hi> the reaſon is, the Law of God hath not taken down their hearts, the Law of God hath not deaded their ſpirits; they are alive in preſumption, and imagination, and therefore though they provoke God, they are ſecure, and fear nothing. It is the diſquietneſſe of a mans heart, that makes him fear; therefore ſo long as a mans mind is quiet, and is not diſturbed, he is fearleſſe: So long as the Law hath not diſquieted a mans mind, nor broken the reſt of a mans Soul, nor diſturbed his conſcience, but tells him, go on in quiet; he ſpends his dayes in ſecurity, he fears no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; whereas, fearfulneſs, and trembling, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible dread, would overwhelm him, if the Law of God ſhould come and take away his life: it is fear that deads a mans heart, as we may ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 4. when the Angel of the Lord ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93432:13"/>
away the ſtone from Chriſts Sepulchre, it is ſaid, <hi>For fear of the Angel, the Keepers trembled, and became as dead men:</hi> There is the effect of fear; if the law did but open mens eyes, and paint out before them how it is with them; how they are liable to Gods wrath, and under the ſentence of condemnation: if they were once thus feared, it would make them ſeem as dead men: the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards would be ſo afraid, that they would become as dead men: All wretched men, all ungrounded Chriſtians, all that are not truly alive towards God, it would make them become as dead men; and it is the deadneſſe of the heart that makes men fear, and ſuch a man cannot be ſecure. Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe and fear, are two contraries, as <hi>Ezek. 30. 9. In that day ſhall Meſſengers go forth from me in Ships, to make the careleſſe Ethiopian afraid, and great pain ſhall come upon them:</hi> The Prophet there makes theſe two contraries; they ſhall be full of fear, to rouze them out of ſecurity: ſo the cauſe why men are carleſſe to get repentance, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to get deliverance from ſin, carleſſe of their walking with God; the reaſon is, becauſe of this damnable livelineſſe that is in their hearts, they are not yet deaded by the law.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another effect of this livelineſſe is this, it makes the heart ſtiffe; what a deal of ſtiffneſſe is in the hearts of carnal men; let God forbid ſin, they are ſtiffe, and will ſtill continue in their ſins, as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>the hearts of this people is waxed ſtiffe,</hi> their hearts are marvellous ſtiffe; the reaſon of it is, becauſe the law of God hath not taken away their livelineſſe, it hath nor humbled their hearts, and pull'd down their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93432:14"/>
whereas if the law had paſt upon them, and the conſideration of their eſtate were rooted in their minds, it would make their ſtoutneſs to yield, and their ſtiffeneſſe to come down; infinite is the ſtiffneſſe of a man for want of this work of the law: tell a vain gallant of his locks, how ſtiffly will he reaſon for it? Tell a prophane perſon of the lewdneſſe of his courſe, how ſtiffly will he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue for it? This is for want of this killing work of the law.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The laſt effect of this livelineſſe is this, it makes the heart peark, and brisk; what a deal of briskneſſe, and pearkneſſe do we ſee every day in the hearts of men, becauſe their hearts are not taken down? I will give you two or three Inſtances, If a man have a little knowledge more then others, he is proud, and brisk, and peark, and he will be ſome-body, he will be talking, and thinks he hath ſuch a deal of knowledge: what is the reaſon of this, that he is ſo peark? It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the law hath not made it known unto him, that he knows nothing as he ought to know, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 2. there ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>If a man thinks he knows any thing, he knowes nothing as he ought to know.</hi> If the law of God did ſhew him he were a beaſt, and a bruit for all his underſtanding; if it did diſcover unto him, his blockiſhneſſe, and blindneſſe, and ignorance, that he knows nothing of the myſteries of Grace and Salvation, this would pull down his pearkneſſe; take another man that hath more knowledge, and can ſpeak better a thouſand times, if the law hath ſhewed him his eſtate, and truly humbled him, all his briskneſſe is taken away, the law hath taught him ſuch a leſſon,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93432:14"/>
that he cannot be peark, Oh! ſaith he, I know nothing, there is no man more fooliſh then I, I have not the knowledge of the moſt high in me; though he have never ſo much knowledge, and gifts, and parts, yet the law hath diſcovered his eſtate unto him, and pulled down the pearkneſſe of his ſpirit. Again, another man is ready to carp at every word, every little occaſion will make him on the top of the houſe, his heart is ſo brisk, that it is up upon every little occaſion, but when the law comes home unto him, this will pull down all his pearkneſſe; alas, he angry at a word ſpeaking? The law hath told him how he hath offended God, and provoked his Spirit from time to time, he is now cooled, from being ſo peark, to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at every word. So take a man that is full of pleaſure and voluptuouſneſſe, and is ready to be vain and fooliſh, every pleaſure puts life into him, but now let the law come, and be charged upon his conſcience, and then all his pearkneſſe is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently down, he is not able to look up, he ſeeth ſo many ſins, diſcovered by the law, that he is not able to look up: <hi>Jam. 5. 1. Go to now ye rich men</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>weep and howle for the miſery that ſhall come upon you.</hi> If the law were charged upon rich men, it would make them weep and howle, rich men are fulleſt of pleaſure and delight, and fartheſt from weeping and howling, but if the law were charged upon their conſciences, it would make them weep and howle, and have little heart to be ſo pleaſant.</p>

The very <hi>letter</hi> of the law is able to kill as many of us as are in this eſtate and condition; therefore the cauſe of this livelineſſe, and ſecurity, is becauſe we are ſtrangers from the law of God, our eyes were never open to behold it, the law of God never came home unto our hearts.</p>

If the Lord would be pleaſed but to charge his law upon the heart, it would make the ſtouteſt ſpirit to yield.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This takes away the imputation that<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. 3.</note> is laid upon the Word of God; many think hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Word of God, it takes away the ſpirits of men: the preaching of the Law, it pulls down the ſpirits of men, and breaks mens hearts, it makes men have no ſpirits, as they ſaid of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> thou makeſt the knees feeble: ſo the law infeebles the knees, and takes away the ſpirits of a man; why here we ſee that the law of God will do ſo, it is the property of the law to do ſo, whereſoever it comes, it kills the heart, and pulls down all the pearkneſſe of it. The law, it will ever break a mans

bones, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Let me hear of joy and gladneſs, that the bones which thou haſt broken may rejoyce,</hi> Pſal. 51.

I the Lord dwell with him that is of an humble &amp; contrite ſpirit, to revive the ſpirit of the humble:</hi> when the law of God hath broken a mans heart, and made him contrite, he is a dead man, till the Lord comes to revive him, and raiſe up his ſpirit.</p>
               <p>I come now to the Second part of the Text,<note place="margin">The latter part of the Text ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> 
                  <hi>When the Commandment came, ſin revived, and I died.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here alſo, as in the former part are two things to be expounded:</p>
               <p>Firſt, What doth the Apoſtle here mean by <hi>reviving? When the Commandment came, ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, What doth he mean by <hi>dying; I died?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Law and Commandment came, and diſcovered me to my ſelf, and ſhewed me what a damnable thing ſin was, and what a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dead creature I was for committing the ſame, and how I lay under the guilt thereof, ſinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and I died. Therefore, what doth the Apoſtle mean by ſin <hi>revived?</hi> I Anſwer, The Apoſtle doth not mean here, as if ſin were indeed dead in him, before the commandment came: for ſin is alive in every carnal mans heart, before the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comes, and therefore he cannot mean thus, when the commandment came ſin <hi>revived,</hi> as if it were truly, and really dead before; for his ſins were not dead in him, when he was Phariſee, his
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93432:16"/>
ſins were not mortified, when he was in his unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated eſtate and condition ſin was not dead in him, that cannot be the meaning, as if ſin were dead before, and now revived: But he ſpeaks of the <hi>Appearance</hi> of the death of ſin, though it were not dead before, yet it did appear to be dead; as a Snake in cold weather, though it be alive, yet it appears to be dead, the life of it is in a ſwound; though it hath life, yet the cold benums it, and keeps it from appearing: So before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment came, ſin was in <hi>Paul,</hi> but it ſeemed to have no life but when the commandment came, and diſcovered plainly, what a dead creature he was, then the life of ſin came indeed to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted.</p>
               <p>Now the Law of God doth manifeſt the life of ſin Three wayes; it manifeſts three lifes of ſin: There are three lifes of ſin, that appear to the ſoul, when the law comes.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, There is the life of <hi>Aggravation;</hi> the Law of God doth aggravate and point out ſinne to the full life of it; it makes ſinne appear in the true nature of it: the true nature of every thing is the life of the thing: the nature of a man is the life of a man: Now the law did ſhew him the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his ſins, it painted them out to the very life, in their lively colours; this made him ſee how his ſins were aggravated: what a curſed and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thing ſin was, and what a perſon it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt, this made ſin appear unto him in the very life of it; therefore in the 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Sin, that it might appear ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, wrought death in me, that ſin might be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                        <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> meaſure ſinful by the commandment:</hi> that is,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93432:16"/>
when the commandment comes, and is manifeſted to the ſoul, it makes the life of ſin appear, the life of ſin is then manifeſted, the Law of God like a glaſſe, doth ſhew the life of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the very nature of all ſinning, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing. Now before the Law came thus home unto him, he could not thus ſee ſin; he could ſay, he was a ſinner, and had committed theſe, and theſe ſins: But what theſe ſins were, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſinfulneſſe of theſe ſins, he did not ſee that. He had a dead kind of picture of his ſins before, but the life thereof was not manifeſted; but the Law of God did make his ſin revive, and made him ſee his ſinnes in the life of them.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is the life of <hi>irritation,</hi> as I may ſo call it; or of itching, and egging a man. This is another life of ſin, whereby it is full of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and working in the Soul; the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a thing, is the life of a thing. Now before the Commandment came, ſin ſeemed dead, it wrought indeed many evils in him, but he did not think his heart had been ſo full of life, and ſo full of activity againſt Gods Law and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Sin ſeemed to lye dead before, but now when the Commandment came, and ſet upon his heart, and began to charge him with better obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; now his heart grew itching, and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous full of life unto luſt. Hereupon ſin egged him the more on to luſt: It is like water, when a man goes about to ſtop it, it runs the more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently. So it is with ſin in the heart, the more the Law of God goes about to ſtop it, and hinder it, the more eager it is, and the more full of life
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93432:17"/>
and working, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>ver. 8. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law, ſin was dead:</hi> there was no ſuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſin in my mortal body then: but when the Commandment came, when the Law was charged upon my heart, then ſin took occaſion hereby to be the more violent, and work in me all manner of Concupiſcence: before I committed ſin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any check, I had vain thoughts, and fooliſh courſes, and many a luſt in my ſoul, and I went to it as if it had been a good thing, not as if it had been evil: But when the Law of God came to ſhew me the ſlackneſſe of my obedience, and to controle me, and convince me, and to ſtop the courſe of ſin, it wrought all manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence in me; it wrought before in <hi>Paul,</hi> for it wrought all his ſecurity, and all his hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, and all his vain thoughts and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations: but this was but a dead kind of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in compariſon of that which it wrought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Commandment came. There are none that have ſuch active Rebellions againſt the Law and Commandment of God, as thoſe to whom the Law comes; it eggs a man forward, and maks him itch unto Rebellion. If a man had asked <hi>Paul</hi> before, whether he had ſuch a devilliſh heart againſt God; he ſaw no ſuch matter, he never meant God any hurt when he went on in his courſe, he thought not that he was ſo ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and rebellious, he did not feel this ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and rebellion; But when the Law came once, it ſhewed him the venome, and curſed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his ſins.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>Third</hi> life of ſin is the worſt of all; and that is, the life of <hi>Imputation;</hi> for here ſin is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93432:17"/>
ſo full of life, that it is not only able to diſcover unto him, that he is a ſinful wretch, and an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable creature; but to bind him over to wrath and ſend him to hell, and everlaſting deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now it is the Law of God that diſcovers this life of ſinne: before the Law comes, a man hath many vain hopes, that God is merciful, and Chriſt dyed for ſinners, and that God will forgive him his ſins; he doth not ſee the imputation of ſin: the imputation of ſin lying upon the Soul is not clearly diſcovered, before the Law come; for where there is no Law, there is no imputation of ſin, <hi>Rom. 5. 13.</hi> there ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>unto the time of the Law, was ſin in the world; but ſin is not imputed, while there is no Law.</hi> Before the Law is charged upon the heart, the heart never dreams of the imputation of ſin, as if he ſhould anſwer for ſin, and be damned for ſin for ever: He thought the contrary before, but now the Law diſcovers the life of ſin unto him, and ſin revives, and appears to have life to damn him for evermore. Sin now appears to have life to caſt him off from God, and to bind him over to Everlaſting vengeance. Thus it was with <hi>Paul, when the Commandment came, ſin revived;</hi> I ſaw ſin was alive indeed, and I ſaw the life of aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, I ſaw the helliſh nature of ſin, it was painted out to the full; I ſaw the life of irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſaw the infinite egging, and itching of ſin, how it did work in me; I ſaw the life of imputation, how all my ſins were imputed unto me, and did all lye upon my conſcience, and ſo ſin revived, that is the meaning.</p>
               <p>Now for the meaning of the <hi>Second</hi> word, <hi>I</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:93432:18"/>
                  <hi>dyed,</hi> that is, I ſaw I was a dead man; I ſaw plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and clearly, that I was but a dead man; I thought I was alive before, becauſe I did good duties, and walked in the Ordinances of God; and I thought that I might goe for a Chriſtian, and ſervant of God, as well as another. I did not think I was a dead man, I thought I had ſome goodneſſe in me, ſome hope of eternal life in me; I did not conclude that I was a dead man. But when the Law of God humbled me, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered my eſtate plainly unto me; then I ſaw I was a dead man indeed, my heart failed me, and the livelyneſſe that was in me before, departed from me. I ſaw I was a dead man, and had not the Spirit of Chriſt come and quickned me, I had been a dead man to all eternity; I now ſaw that ſin began to revive in me, and I began to be a dead man. Thus we ſee the meaning of the words.</p>
               <p>Now the Theame I propounded to you was this, namely, how the Lord converts the will; and the firſt work that prepares a man hereunto, is the work of pulling down the will, and the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down of a mans heart; for the will of man is full of obſtinacy, full of livelyneſſe againſt the truth, and Commandment of God; full of live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe in ſin, and conceives it ſelf to be in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſtate and condition, and ſo the will is obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſtill. Now when it pleaſeth God to convert a man, firſt he pulls down the will of a man, and pulls down his Spirit; now here is a Doctrine to make way for this.</p>
               <p>Namely, <hi>that when</hi> the Lord takes a man in<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> hand to pull him down, to pull down his will, he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93432:18"/>
doth ſhew him what a dead Creature he is. The Lord by pronouncing a man in his own Boſom, a dead man, a damned man, one that can no way help himſelf; he is dead, abſolutely dead in his own eſtate, and in Gods account, all his hopes are rotten; he is meerly, a dead, damned man: hereby the Lord pulls down his will. We may ſee this <hi>in Paul,</hi> before his Converſion; his will was full of obſtinacy and rebellion againſt God, he would go and make havock of the Church, he would not ſubmit to the will of God; but when the Lord came to work upon him, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks: What wilt thou that I ſhall do Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Act. 9. 6?</hi> Now his will is come down: but mark how the Lord puts him off; <hi>go to ſuch a place,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and there it ſhall be told thee what thou ſhalt do.</hi> The Lord puts him off, and would not give him an anſwer preſently, what he ſhould do; as who ſhould ſay, thou haſt as yet an obſtinate will, thou wilt not do as I command thee: I will not tell thee as yet, what I will have thee to do; but go to ſuch a place, and I will Arreſt thee there, and charge my Law upon thy Conſcience, and ſhew thee thy dead, and damned eſtate. And now his will is come down; he bids him be Baptized, and he was ſo; he bids him go and Preach the Goſpel, and he did ſo; now his will is come down. <hi>So the prodigal,</hi> his heart was marvellous obſtinate againſt his Fathers commandement; he would be gone from his father, he could not abide to ſtay in a houſe where there were ſuch ſtrict cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he would have his goods and patrimony in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93432:19"/>
his own hand, (as it is the property of every carnal man) he would have his Inheritance in his own hand; he would have power, and ſtrength, and ability, and theſe gifts and parts in his own hand. But when he is humbled by the Law, he is content to have all in Gods hand, he is content to have all his wiſdom there, that he may come thither for it; he is content to have all his righteouſneſſe there, and all his ability, ſtrength, and ſufficiency there, that he may come thither for it; all is there, and he ſees himſelf a beggar, if he comes not to God, and keeps cloſe to God, and keeps faſt to his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, he is a very beggar. But this man would have all in his own hands, and goe and ſquander away all upon his luſts and pleaſures, and he would not ſtay at home with his father. Now when the Law of God came home to him, to ſhew this man to himſelf, <hi>when he came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> as the Text ſaith (his father did eſteem him a dead man before,) But when he came to himſelf, and ſaw he was a dead man for going away from his father, the Father of life; Now his will is come down, <hi>I will go to my father, and ſay, Father I have ſinned againſt Heaven and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son, make me as one of thy hired ſervants.</hi> Luke 15. 17. Here his will is come down; he would be gone from his father before, he could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to be held in ſo ſtrictly, he would fain be gone, and be at liberty; he had no mind to ſtay in his fathers houſe: But when he came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when the Law ſhewed him, he was but a dead man, for going from his father; and going
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93432:19"/>
after his luſts and pleaſures; now his will is brought down, and it ſubmits, and yields; and now he will go to his father, and humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before his father, aud ſay, <hi>Father, I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt heaven, and againſt thee, &amp;c.</hi> Now I deſire here to ſhew you Three things, as I did in the former point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Wherein this deadneſſe conſiſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What be the effects of this deadneſs, and how it pulls down the heart. And</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Uſes we are to make of it.</p>
               <p>1. For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> Wherein this deadneſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts: and it conſiſts in Three things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> In deadneſſe in <hi>being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In deadneſſe in Gods <hi>account.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In deadneſs to all <hi>doing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>First, It conſiſts</hi> in deadneſſe in <hi>being.</hi> When the Law comes, it ſhews a man <hi>indeed</hi> to be a dead man, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 6. the letter killeth,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: the very letter of the Law; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit of life, which Chriſt doth inform it with, when he comes to work upon his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; The letter alone, without the Spirit of God, kills a man: now when a man is killed, he is a dead man; he is then fully dead, he hath the very being of a dead man, he is a dead man; that is his Eſtate and Condition. So when the Law of God comes home to a man, it ſhews him indeed that he is a dead man. The property of the Law, when it is let in to work upon the heart, is to ſlay a man, <hi>I have flain them by the words of my mouth, Hoſ. 6. 5.</hi> The Law which proceeds from Gods mouth, is able to ſlay a poor ſinner, and kill him at the heart, and lay him for dead before

Almighty God, that he can ſtrive no more; the reaſon is, becauſe the Law doth charge the <hi>truth of God</hi> upon a man. Now the Truth is, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſinner is a dead man, this is the very Truth of it, <hi>Rom. 8. 6. To be carnally-minded is death:</hi> That man is a dead man; there is the very death of ſin, and hell, and condemnation in that man, that is a Carnal-minded man. Now the Law of God when it comes, doth Charge this Truth upon the Soul, it diſcovers a man to be in this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and condition, wherein in truth he is.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It conſiſts in <hi>deadneſſe in Gods account.</hi> For all a mans preſumptions, for all a mans vain hopes that he is juſtified; for this is the nature of man, before he is convinced by the Law of God, to juſtifie himſelf, (<hi>you are</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>they that juſtifie your ſelves,</hi>) not that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed juſtified; but he falſly applies juſtification to himſelf, and he hopes he is juſtified before God, he is apt to pronounce this hope unto himſelf, let a Miniſter tell him of his ſins, here is his Salve, God is merciful, and Chriſt came to ſave ſinners. Let Sermons beat upon him from day to day, to humble him, he cannot imagine that he is in a damnable eſtate; Preachers are too harſh, and cenſorious, and the like. But when the Law comes, <hi>it ſhuts up a man</hi> that he cannot get out, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Gal. 3. 22. The Law hath concluded all under ſin:</hi> that is the nature of the word of God, to ſhut up a man, that a man is not able to get out: before the law is <hi>charged,</hi> the heart hath a thouſand ſtarting-holes. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce hell, and damnation againſt it, it hath this ſtarting-hole, that Chriſt dyed for ſinners:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93432:20"/>
diſcover plainly that he is a dead man, he hath theſe ſtarting-holes, he hopes he ſhall have peace, and he hopes he is not ſo vile before Almighty God, and he hopes he hath better righteouſneſſe then you would bear him down with; and ſo he hath an evaſion to get out: but when the Law comes, and ſhuts him up, this will tame him. As we uſe to tame Lions, and Bears, and ſuch like fierce and cruel creatures, by ſhutting of them up, ſo the Lord tames the heart of a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when he would pull him down, he ſhuts him up, and layes him in the priſon, and in the Gaole, and he hath no way to get out; he is a dead man, and there is no way to get out, no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion to eſcape; but ſtill he is a dead man, and a damned man, he cannot open his mouth any more, <hi>Ezek. 16. 63. That thou mayeſt remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, when I am pacified towards thee, for all that thou haſt done, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> The Law indeed works thus in the Regenerate, though the Lord be pacified towards them, yet they ſhall never open their mouths, never cavil againſt Gods precepts more, never be ſo brisk any more. But ſo long as a man is in his ſins, the Law doth not only convince him that he is dead in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but that he is alſo dead towards God; that God accounts him a dead man, that God is not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified towards him, but he lies under the wrath of God, and this pulls him down, and ſtops his mouth. A carnal mans mouth will not be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but he will have ſome thing to ſay, ſome vain hope, or confidence or other, ſome plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or excuſing or other. His mouth will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93432:21"/>
be ſtoped, till the Law of God comes; and when that comes, that <hi>will ſtop his mouth,</hi> and make it appear, that he is guilty before God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Now we know, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, that every mouth might be ſtopped, and all the world may be culpable before God.</hi> But before the Law comes, a mans mouth will not be ſtopped. <hi>Gen. 20. 3. God came to Abimilech by night, and ſaid, Thou art but a dead man, becauſe of the woman which thou haſt taken, for ſhe is a mans wife:</hi> He was a dead man, but he little thought it; he would not believe that he was a dead man; As the Text there ſpeaks of temporal death. So it is true of the other, carnal men are indeed dead men, but they will not believe that they are dead men, and damned men; they hope for mercy, and cry, peace, peace to their ſouls; but when the Law comes, that knocks off all mens hopes, and layes them for dead in Gods account.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This deadneſſe I here ſpeak of, it conſiſts in regard of <hi>all manner of doing;</hi> when the Law of God hath charged it ſelf upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and diſcovered to a man, that he is a dead, and a damned man. It makes it now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto him, that he is utterly unable to do any thing; he is in the depth of miſery, and he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to cry mercy aright, he is not able to make a prayer, no more then a dead man: he ſeeth he can no more keep a Sabboth as he ought, than a dead man. So for any duty of Religion, he ſeeth he hath no more life to do it, then a dead man hath to do the actions of the living: as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93432:21"/>
ſpeaks, <hi>Gal. 2. 19. I am dead to the Law, that I might live unto God.</hi> God made S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> alive unto him, but firſt he charged his Law upon his Conſcience, and made him ſeem to be a dead man to the Law: That he had no life or activity to do any thing pleaſing to God: but when the Lord made him alive to himſelf, then he could do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nay, <hi>he was able to do all things, through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that ſtrengthned him.</hi> But in himſelf, both ſtill, and before, he was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dead to the Law of God; ſo that when the Law comes, and ſhews a mans eſtate unto him, it ſhews him his utter inability to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of any good duty. The Phariſee will to the Temple as well as the Publican, <hi>Saul</hi> will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice as well as <hi>Samuel;</hi> Prophane people will take up the Ordinances of God, as if they had life to go through them, as well as the people of God. But when the Law comes, it plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth a man; it makes him feel and underſtand, that he hath no activity, or life to performe any thing pleaſing to Almighty God; a dead man can do nothing, he is cut off from all the actions of the living; dead men they cannot deviſe ought, they cannot purpoſe ought, they cannot work ought. So when the Law of God is charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man, and ſhews him that he is but a dead man, and a damned man, now he ſeeth, he can as well create a world, as make a prayer; he can as well remove a Mountain, as do any thing acceptable to God. Such a man will ſay, I am a dry tree, and cannot grow; I am loſt in the wilderneſſe of ſinne, and cannot get out again. Thus we ſee wherein this deadneſs conſiſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:93432:22"/>2. Now I come to ſhew you the <hi>Effects of this Deadneſſe,</hi> how it pulls down the heart: this will pull down the heart of a man marvellouſly, when the Law chargeth this upon him, that he is but a dead man; though the will of man be infinitely unruly, it is wild, it is like the <hi>mad man</hi> in the Goſpel, that the Divil was in, no man was able to bind him, no Chains were able to hold him, no Creature could tame him, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 34. So it is with the will of an unregenerate man, his will is marvellous wild, he breaks all bonds, and ſnaps all cords in pieces, and caſts off the yoak from him. Let God bid him do this, he will not do it; let him be in a good mood, he is preſently out of it again; let him be convinced of his vain hopes, and let him ſee what a wretched creature he is, he will have vain hopes again; his will is infinitely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly, and deſperately wild, the very Divel in hell hath the rule of it; it is full of life againſt God and his Commandments, and will never yield while the world ſtands, till now the Lord comes with his Law, and ſhews a man, that he is a dead man, and a damned man, and ſhews him that he is under the wrath of God: the Law is able to do this, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom. 4. 15. The Law cauſeth wrath,</hi> It makes a man appear to lie under the wrath of God, under Gods everlaſting diſpleaſure, and in the mouth of hell and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and if God be not merciful to him, and more merciful then to a world of men, he ſeeth he is a dead man, utterly loſt, and undone for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; now this will make his ſpirit yield, and make his heart begin to come in; as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks concerning <hi>Princes, He ſhall cut off the</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:93432:22"/>
                  <hi>ſpirit of Prince, he is terrible to the Kings of the earth, Pſal.</hi> 76. 12. Kings and Princes have <hi>ſtout</hi> Spirits; now when the Lord ſends but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle terrour into their hearts, he is able to ſnib their ſpirits, for all their ſecurity, and for all the height of their magnanimity; he is able to cut off all, by ſending his terrour into their hearts, ſo the Law ſends terrour into the heart. Can there be a greater terrour then to have the Law denounce a man to be a dead man? and that the wrath of God is gone out againſt him? and that he lyeth in the very mouth of all the Canons of the fury of the moſt High? This will break the heart of a man, if his heart were made of braſs, this would break it. Look as it was <hi>with the Moabites 2 Sam.</hi> 8. 2. They were ſtout againſt <hi>David,</hi> and would not yield and ſubmit unto him; but when <hi>David ſmote them, and meaſured them with a cord, and caſt them down to the ground; when he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them with two cords to put them to death, and with one full cord to keep them alive; then ſaith the Text, the Moabites became Davids ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and brought him gifts.</hi> So it is with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane creature, whileſt God lets him goe on, he is ſtout, and will not ſerve God, but his will is altogether croſſe, and contrary to Gods will and Commandements; he will not take up thoſe cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that God commands, he will not ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the preciſeneſſe of the Goſpel, his will is infinitely croſſe in this kind, and marvellous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate. But if the Lord takes him in hand, and charge his Law upon his conſcience, he puts ſuch terrours into his heart, that he is willing to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto God upon any tearms. I <hi>confeſſe the</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:93432:23"/>
                  <hi>Law cannot</hi> do this of it ſelf; it cannot thus bring down the will of a man, and mortifie a mans ſins: For if the damned in hell were let looſe again, to live here upon earth, they would forget all their former Plagues, and Torments, and ſin would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive again in them. The Law of it ſelf, can only lay ſome in a ſwound, it will up again if it be looſe: the law cannot do this of it ſelf; but I ſpeak now of the law, as it is <hi>Gods Inſtrument.</hi> Hereby he pulls down the heart of a man, and pulls down his Spirit; labour will pull down any mans ſpirit: when a man is in labour, and pain, and affliction, it will make a mans Stomack come down; as we may ſee, <hi>Pſal. 107. 11, 12. Becauſe they rebelled againſt the words of the Lord, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he humbled their heart with labour and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſſe; then they fell down, but there was no hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:</hi> Before they were ſtout againſt the Lord, and would not hearken unto him, and obey his Commandments; now the Lord brought down their heart. But how did he bring them down? he pulld them down by laying labours upon them; labour, and torment, and heavineſſe pulled down their hearts. So when the law makes the heart labour under the wrath of God, it lyes labouring, and quaking, and ſhaking, and weltring, and bleeding under the wrath of God; this pulls down the will. And now I come to ſpeak of the <hi>Effects</hi> it works, in doing of it.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Firſt Effect</hi> is this, it caſts the heart into thoſe <hi>woful privations</hi> we read of; there are abundance of comfortable things, which the man which is alive in his own conceit, thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93432:23"/>
to have. Now when the law comes to dead him, it knocks him off from all thoſe comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things he ſeemed to have; whereas he ſeemed to have ſome admittance to God in prayer, he could pray to him before, but now he ſees he is an out-caſt, and dares not lift up his eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Before he hoped that God would have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey on him, and that he had ſome intereſt in Chriſt, and hope of ſalvation; but now he ſeeth he is loſt: Before he ſeemed to have liberty, and freedom; he could do this, and that, and had a thouſand evaſions; but now he ſees himſelf a meer captive: before he thought he had ſome rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, ſome goodneſſe, but now he ſeeth he is but a poor begger; before he had ſome Fig-leaves to cover him, but now he ſeeth he is altogether na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; before he was heart-whole and ſound, he had peace, and comfort, and quietneſſe within him, but now he is altogether broken. This is the effect of this deadneſſe, it brings all theſe <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> into the ſoul; death is a privation it ſelf; and it brings a hundred privations with it; even a privation of all the priviledges of the living: this the Law doth when it comes. All this while the Soul is loſt, and captived, and poor, and blind, and miſerable, and naked, and an out-caſt; it is utterly undone, and altogether unable to help it ſelf; and this, as it doth make a man an object of the Goſpel, one for whom Chriſt dyed, as it points out ſuch a man; ſo there is a Finger of the Goſpel in it alſo, when the ſoul underſtands the goodneſſe of the Goſpel, and ſees it ſelf to be loſt for want thereof; yet notwithſtanding the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93432:24"/>
firſt ſtroke is given by the Law; the firſt ſtroke that caſts the ſoul into this privation is done by the Law, and if the Lord means to convert, there the Goſpel begins, <hi>Luke 4. 18. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath annointed me, that I ſhould preach the Goſpel to the poor; he hath ſent me to heal the broken hearted, to preach deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance to the Captives, and recovering of ſight to the blind, that I ſhould ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed.</hi> When the Law hath humbled a man, and thus brought down his will, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the work of the Goſpel. As we uſe to ſay of natural Philoſophy, where natural Philoſphy ends, there Phyſick begins; So where the Law ends, the Goſpel begins. Thus we ſee the firſt Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of this deadneſſe.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> When the Law hath done this, when the deadneſſe the Law hath wrought, hath produced this effect; then the next Effect is this, the <hi>Law holds the heart there:</hi> when a man is dead, the effect of death is to hold a man there. There is no redreſſe, no return, without the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power of God: there is no return to his former life. So when the Law hath deaded a man, it holds a man there, though a man would never ſo fain get out, he cannot; he will be ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a Chriſt, and looking at the promiſes, and be preſuming that there is mercy for him; he would fain be brisk again. But if the Law hath killed him, and made him a dead man, he cannot get out. <hi>Rom. 7. 6.</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are delivered from the Law, being dead unto that wherein we were holden.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> could not get out to his livelyneſſe again, but the Law held
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93432:24"/>
him. So it is with the Law, when the Law of God hath humbled a man, and made him a dead man, it holds him there; let the Divel come with all the comforts he can, there is no evaſion; let his vain neighbors bring what Scriptures they can to cheer him, there is nothing can lift that ſoul up: let all profits and pleaſures come, they cannot take off his heart, they cannot make him alive again, unleſſe it pleaſe the Lord to quicken and revive him.</p>
               <p>2. The next <hi>Effect</hi> of this deadneſſe is, that it makes the heart <hi>ſtiff:</hi> when the body is dead, all the members are ſtiff, the beatings of the pulſes ceaſe, and all are ſtiff. So when a man is killed by the Law, it makes his head ſtiff, it breaks off all his arguing, and reaſoning, and diſputing againſt the Law of God; That is againſt my profit, and that is againſt my pleaſure and that is againſt my credit; thus the heart is full of life &amp; activity before. But when the Law comes, and ſhews him he is a dead man: now he is not able to ſtir, now he can ſay, what if it be againſt my profit, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? what if it be againſt my credit? what if men make a mock at me? I am a <hi>dead man</hi> if I live not in this courſe, <hi>Pſal. 36. 12.</hi> there ſaith the Text, <hi>They are fallen that work iniquity, they are caſt down and ſhall not be able to riſe.</hi> So when the Law of God comes, and preacheth righteouſneſſe to a man, and ſhews him againſt whom he hath ſinned, it makes him a dead man, he cannot ſtir any more; if the Divel bids him reaſon for his luſts, he dares not do it; if his old company perſwade him to his former life and converſation, he dares not do it, <hi>Iſai. 41. 21.</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:93432:25"/>
                  <hi>Stand to your cauſe ſaith the Lord, bring forth your ſtrong reaſons, ſaith the God of Jacob.</hi> You could be reaſoning, and pleading for your luſts, let us now hear your ſtrong reaſons, and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Now this man is a dead man, and a damned man; he hath no reaſon, no plea to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to go on in his former courſe, this man is killed now.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Fourthly.</hi> This deadneſſe makes the <hi>heart yield;</hi> before the Law comes, the heart is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous obſtinate, but now when the ſtiffneſſe of it is gone, and the Law hath made him a dead man, now he will yield, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 8. As <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> ſpeaks; <hi>Be not now ſtiff-necked as your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but give the hand to the Lord, and come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Sanctuary.</hi> So when the Lord hath broken the neck of a mans ſtiffneſſe, and hath broken his back-bone, that he cannot ſtand ſtiffly out, and hath taken away his livelyneſſe, which was his whale-bone as it were, to uphold him in his ſtrength, and courage, and in his ſins. Now his heart is made to yield to God, he cannot now but yield to the Lord. Thus it is with a poor creature, when the law works upon him, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand out any longer: It is moſt true, before the Lord converts a man, he doth take away his ſtiffneſſe, and make a man a dead man. But you will ſay, <hi>when a man is dead, all his joynts are ſtiff,</hi> his body is cold, and grows ſtiff, but when a man is alive, his joynts are lithe and lively. I Anſwer, It is true, the law of God cannot take away a mans <hi>natural</hi> ſtiffneſſe, but his <hi>voluntary</hi> ſtiffneſs is taken away. The voluntary ſtiffneſſe is taken away when he is dead; when a man was alive, he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93432:25"/>
could ſhut his hand, and hold it ſo; he could ſtretch out his arm, and hold it ſo: but when a man is dead, he cannot do ſo. So it is in this caſe, although the ſtiffneſſe of nature remain ſtill, yet the voluntary ſtiffneſſe is taken away; the will and heart of a man is out of life; It cannot be ſtiff towards God. I confeſſe the Lord doth not take away all ſtiffneſſe, no not out of his Saints; but he takes ſo much ſtiffneſſe out of the heart, as to make it a <hi>prtient,</hi> he ſhall not be voluntarily ſtiff, he ſhall not be <hi>overcomingly</hi> reſiſting. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines uſe to ſay, That in the firſt converſion of a ſinner, he is meerly a Patient; firſt the Lord makes him a patient, and then converts him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 19. <hi>After I was converted, I repented, after I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon the thigh, &amp;c.</hi> firſt God made him a patient, and inſtructed him, and afterwards converted him.</p>
               <p>The Uſe of the Point is this, Is it ſo that the law of God doth make a man a dead man? Then here we may obſerve the <hi>wonderful power of the law;</hi> a man hath ſo much livlineſſe in him, ſo much life and activity, and ſo many ſtrong conceits, that it is wonderful hard to make him dead; therefore the <hi>word of God is mighty.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Apollo,</hi> that <hi>he did mightily convince the Jewes, Acts,</hi> 18. 28. for he was mighty in the Scriptures, there had need be might in the Scriptures to do this. What ſtrong reaſons had they in regard of fleſh and blood that Jeſus was not the Chriſt? What, he the Chriſt that was born in a manger, and hath none but a beggarly company to his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred? <hi>Are not his brethren and kinsfolk with us?</hi> None but the tag-rag and refuſe of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93432:26"/>
follow him. What, he that had no form or beauty in him, the Saviour of the world? The Word of God was marvellous powerful, that could convince them of this; <hi>ſo a man that goeth on</hi> in his ſinful eſtate and condition, it is a marvellous hard thing to convince him that he is a dead man: he hears the Word conſtantly, and goes on in his Calling diligently, and he hopes that Chriſt died for him; he is afraid of ſin, and his heart trembles to commit ſin, and he is ſorry for his ſins, he is thus, and thus: he that hath ſo many things to plead for himſelf, what, he a dead man? It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. Therefore if the law of God be able to convince a man, and make a man a <hi>dead</hi> man that is ſo full of <hi>life,</hi> the law muſt needs be mighty that can do this; to dead this man, and kill this man, is a mighty work. So that we may ſay, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith of the Sea and the Mountains, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 114. 5, 6. <hi>What ayled thee, O Sea, that thou fleddeſt? O Jordan, why wert thou turned back? Ye Mountains, why leaped ye as Rams, and ye Hills as Lambs?</hi> So I may ſay, What ayleth this poor man that he is now driven from his former courſes, and like the Sea, out of his own Channel? what ayls thoſe Mountains of luſts and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that were ſettled upon his ſoul, as a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain upon his Baſe, what ayle theſe to move, and ſtir, and fall away? What ayls the man that was ſo full of life before, that at one Sermon he is killed? What ayls the man? he came brisk and peark into the Church, and who but he? He was immoveable from his ſinful luſts, and corruptions, and he had this Plea, and that confidence, and was full of life, but by one hours diſcourſe (which it
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93432:26"/>
may be another heard as well as he, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as brisk as before, but this mans ſpirit is dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his heart taken down; what ayls the man now? why the law of God hath done it: See therefore the marvellous power of the law.</p>
               <p>I told you formerly, That when the Law comes home to a mans ſoul, and is charged upon his Conſcience, it caſts the heart into all thoſe woful privations we read of in Scripture; a man before he is thus deaded by the law, thinks himſelf to be poſſeſſed of abundance of comforts, but now he ſeeth himſelf to be an out-caſt, and utterly loſt, to be a captive, and poor, and miſerable, and blind, and naked; he lies under all theſe privations: And as the Philoſopher ſaith, That Privation is one of the Principles of Nature: Every body (ſaith he) hath Three Principles, Matter, Form, and Privation: No natural thing can have this or that Form put into it, but it muſt be deprived of all other Forms, as if fire be turned into air, firſt the form of fire muſt be taken away, before it can be turned into air, ſo it is in Grace, Privation is one of the Principles of Religion; before the life of Chriſt can be brought into a man, there muſt firſt be a Privation of all other contrary lifes: the life of the fleſh, that curſed livelineſſe of the fleſh, the life of ſin, and the life of the world, whereby a man lives unto the world, and the things of the world. A man muſt be deprived of all other lifes, of all other forms, he muſt have a Privation of all other forms, before the life of Chriſt can be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in him. As for example, Take a man that is wordly wiſe, put him upon civil Affairs, he is wiſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93432:27"/>
enough to order all his buſineſſe; in eating, and drinking, he is wiſe enough not to diſtemper him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, wiſe enough to keep a good diet: Put him upon matters of Religion, he is wiſe there too, he will not be ſo preciſe as ſome are, that are more nice then wiſe; he will be moderate, and wiſe in the Service of God: Tell him, that he is one that doth not pleaſe God, that he walks to hell-ward, that he hath no care of his Salvation; he thinks that he is wiſer then ſo. Would you make this man a wiſe man indeed? you can never make him truly a wiſe man, till you bring a Privation upon him, till he be firſt deprived of all that wordly wiſdom that is in him; <hi>If any man among you ſeem to be wiſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>let him become a fool that he may be wiſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 18. Let him have firſt a Privation of all the ſeeming wiſdom he hath, of all the wiſdom of the fleſh and carnal reaſon, he muſt firſt be a fool, or elſe true wiſdome is not able to enter into him: So if a man would be high, he muſt be firſt humbled, and brought low; before he can be truly high; a man muſt be naked; before he can be cloathed; a man muſt be loſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can be found; there are none of you that live in your ſins, but you muſt be ſtripped of all the forms that are in you; there muſt be a Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion come into you, before true Grace can be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in you. Privation is one of the Principles of Religion, and unleſſe you be deprived of all other forms, you cannot have the eſſential form of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion come into you; it is <hi>the poor that receive the Goſpel:</hi> when a man is deprived of all other forms, then is he fit to receive the form of the Goſpel. When a man is deprived of his own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93432:27"/>
he may then receive the wiſdom of the Goſpel; when a man is deprived of his own ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confidence, of his own ſtrength, and ſufficiency, then he may receive the ſtrength of the Goſpel; when a man is deprived of all other contrary live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and contrary forms that are oppoſite to all theſe, when a man is deprived of all theſe, he is capable of the true life of Chriſt, and the Goſpel. I will Inſtance only in one thing which I named before, and that is poverty: a man can never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt, or any impreſſion of the true form of Chriſtianity, till firſt his Heart be emptied, and his Will and his Mind be emptied, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be emptied, till all other forms be voyded out, and he begins to be made poor and nothing in himſelf, till every room in the ſoul be naked, and empty, there is never a room for the kingdom of God to come into the ſoul; the kingdom of God is a great thing, and will take up a great deal of room where it comes, therefore the Heart, and the Mind, and the Will, and the Affections muſt be emptied: the ſoul muſt be rid and void of all other things, or elſe there is no room for the Kingdom of God. As our Saviour ſaith <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for they ſhall receive the Kingdom of God:</hi> Then there is room for the Kingdom of God, when the heart is made poor, and all is voided out, the world, and the fleſh, and all carnal delights, and pleaſures, and all ſelf-conceitedneſſe, which the heart was full of. When it was full of the world, there was no room for Gods Kingdom; but when a man is made poor in Spirit, when he hath a Privation of theſe things, wherewith his ſoul was filled; now
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93432:28"/>
there is room for the Kingdom of God; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe a man can never be brought to Chriſt, till he is pinched with theſe Privations; before he can never come to Chriſt, his heart can never be brought to bid ſo much and ſtake down ſo much for Chriſt, as he muſt do, if ever he come to attain him: unleſſe his heart be pinched with poverty, unleſſe his heart be void of all theſe high imaginations he had of himſelf, he will never come to Chriſt. It is plenty that brings down the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and ſcarcity that makes it riſe: plentiful years, will make Corn of no price almoſt, but if there be famine, and ſcarcity, and no bread al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to be had, but men are ready to dye for hunger, then they wil give any thing, they will give ten ſhillings a buſhel, twenty, nay fourty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings hath been given for a buſhel of Corn, as I have read in Chronicles; it is poverty that makes men come to a price. So muſt the heart be pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Spiritual poverty, elſe it will not come to Chriſt; men will give nothing for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, they will not part with a ſingle groat for Chriſt; the prophane Gallant will not part with a lock for Chriſt; the proud vain fool, will not part with a fooliſh lace, a fooliſh faſhion for Chriſt; the drunkard will not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe a pot for Chriſt, men will not part with any thing for Chriſt; they will not part with a paul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try luſt, or baſe affection for Chriſt: People will not ſtir, they will not open their purſes, they will not open their hearts to give any thing for Chriſt; the reaſon is, their hearts are full al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. People count their profits, and pleaſures, and luſts, and vanities, and delights, their Jewels;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93432:28"/>
a man muſt be poor, before he will part with his Jewels; but if a man be throughly pinched with poverty he will part with his old Gold, and Rings, and Jewels, and all; but he will never part with his Jewels, till he be forced to it by extremity. So all the luſts of the heart, all the things of the world, that the mind and affections run upon, men account them their Jewels, and they will not part with them, till they be pinched with poverty. Thus it was with the Jaylor, <hi>Acts 16. 30</hi> when he was pinched with this poverty, he cryes out, <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> When his heart was pinched with this poverty, he was content to part with any thing, he was willing to do any thing, to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to any terms that he might have mercy: So that it is neceſſary for a man to have all theſe Privations wrought in his heart, and be made poor, elſe he will never take Chriſt upon thoſe terms whereupon he is offered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppoſe a man ſhould conceive worth to be in Chriſt; ſuppoſe he ſhould put a great price upon him, yet if a man be not under theſe Privations, if he be not pinched with poverty, with Spiritual need and want; he will never uſe all means for the attaining of the Kingdome of God. He will never take himſelf to all thoſe courſes that God hath commanded himſelf to be ſought in. It was need that made <hi>Ahab</hi> ſend up and down all Countries, and Soiles for water; it was need that made the rich Woman of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> to hazard her ſelf, and her family, and houſhold in a forraign Country; ſhe would not have gone a mile of that Journey, but for her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93432:29"/>
as Divines uſe to ſpeak. Let two men go to the Market, the one hath need, the other hath not; he that hath need, will go whatſoever the weather be, though the weather be never ſo foul, he will go; bread he wants, and bread he muſt have, and bread he will have; and if he cannot have it at an eaſie rate, he will part with any thing; he will pawn his very cloaths from his back for it. Why? becauſe he, and his wife, and his children want it. But the other, he will go ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he likes the weather; if the weather be anſwerable to his mind, it may be he will go, it may be not; and when he is there, it may be he will buy, and it may be not; according as the price goeth, becauſe he hath no need of it. So it is in Grace, let two men be called upon to ſeek out for Grace; one doth not feel any great need, he is not pinched with the want of Faith and Repentance, and Pardon, and Peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: though he want theſe, yet he is not pinched with the want, his heart is yet full, he is not yet come to this Spiritual poverty. It may be he will come to a Sermon, it may be not; it may be he will part with a Luſt, and it may be not; it is according as the bargain pleaſeth him; he will never uſe all means, nor take up all cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that are preſcribed: But a man that is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſtarve for want of Chriſt; as <hi>Siſera</hi> ſaid, Give me drink or elſe I periſh: ſo, give me Chriſt or elſe I periſh: This man will take any courſe, uſe any means, he muſt have Chriſt, and will have him; when he comes to the Word, Chriſt he wants, and Chriſt he will have, and muſt have; all Sermons, and all hearing, are but as Oile to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93432:29"/>
the fire, they do but pinch his Soul ſo much the more, till Chriſt comes; he muſt have Chriſt in his Ordinances, becauſe he is ſenſible of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual poverty. So that it is he which is loſt that will be found, it is he which is a captive that will be freed, it is he that is blind that muſt have his ſight, and it is he that is naked that muſt be cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed; he that lies under theſe woful Privations, he muſt have the form, he looks after it, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without it. Thus we ſee that Privation is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Religion, the true life of Religion can never come into a man, till he be layed under all theſe woful Privations we read of in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>But now here is a queſtion which will ariſe,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> which thoſe that are godly would be glad to have reſolved, and that is this: Whether theſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations that the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of, makes a man the formal Object of mercy? St. <hi>Paul</hi> was alive once before the Law came, but when the law came, and was charged upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, it deprived him of his livelyneſſe, and made him a dead man; I <hi>dyed</hi> ſaith he. Now the Queſtion is this, Whether is ſuch a man the formal Object of mercy? When the Law hath deprived a man of his conceited riches, and made him a poor man, and hath proclaimed him a bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and a begger, and made him a captive, that he is not able to ſtir one foot, he is not able ſo much as to think a good thought; but he ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth under wrath, and is not able to get out: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſuch a man the formal Object of mercy? I mean, whether is he ſuch a one, as the Goſpel hath promiſed deliverance unto? When a man
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93432:30"/>
by the law is made a dead Creature, and is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deprived of life and health; he hath no life actually, and there is no life actually to be had for him, (for ſo the law leaves him without any hope of getting any life.) Whether is this man the formal Object of mercy? whether is he ſuch a one as the Goſpel doth make promiſe to of quickning, and enriching, and gathering, and finding, and ſaving, and comforting, and the like? whether is this man the formal Object of mercy? Every man is the Object of mercy, but whether hath this man got thoſe properties that belong to the actual Object of mercy? The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why I propound this Queſtion, is this, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture ſeems to make ſuch a one the formal Object of mercy, ſuch a one as mercy is promiſed to, ſuch a one as the Goſpel looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the proper and actual Object of mercy; for the Goſpel is ſaid to quicken the dead, and to give them life, it is the <hi>Letter that killeth, and the Spirit that giveth life, 2 Cor. 3. 6.</hi> It giveth life to him that was before a dead man, to him that was killed by the letter. So for poverty, <hi>Luke 4. 18. To the poor the Goſpel is preached, the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath annointed me to preach the Goſpel to the poor, he hath ſent me that I ſhould heal the broken hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of ſight to the blind:</hi> So that when the law hath made a man a poor man, &amp; hath ſtripped him of all his conceited riches, and hath made him a begger, it ſeems that Chriſt is anointed to preach mercy to ſuch a one; it ſeems that ſuch a one is the formal Object of the Goſpel. See
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93432:30"/>
                  <hi>Pſalm 147. 2. He gathers the out-caſts of Iſrael:</hi> when the Law hath made a man an out-caſt, it ſeems he is the formal Object of mercy: The Goſpel undertakes to gather ſuch people ſo far loſt. <hi>The Son of man is come to ſave that which is loſt, Matth. 18. 11.</hi> he is come for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it is his Commiſſion, he is ſent to ſave that which is loſt; when the law hath made a man to be a loſt man, that he ſeeth he is utterly undone without mercy, Chriſt is come to ſave ſuch peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to look upon them as the formal Object of mercy.</p>
               <p>So for death it ſelf, when a man is made dead by the Law; <hi>The hour ſhall come</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>and now is, that the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that do hear it ſhall live, John 5. 25.</hi> It ſeems that the Scripture makes ſuch as are made dead by the law, and poor, and blind, and naked, and wretched, and miſerable, by reaſon of the Law being preſſed upon them, and pulling them down with terrours and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; it ſeems ſuch a one is the formal Object of mercy, ſuch a one to whom mercy is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. I do not mean that he is the formal Object of the invitations of the Goſpel, that is moſt certain, there is no queſtion of that, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and you ſhall find reſt to your ſouls.</hi> Come unto me, all you that are poor, and blind, and naked, and dead, and I will give you life; have you a hard heart, that you cannot free your ſelves from, come unto me, and I will free you from it; have you no power to repent and believe, come unto me, and take mercy upon my terms, and believe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93432:31"/>
in me, whatſoever weakneſſe is in you, I will ſtrengthen you; whatever diſcomforts and wants lye upon you, I will relieve and chear you. This is certain, the more a man ſeeth himſelf a dead man, the more he is the formal Object of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of the Goſpel. But the Queſtion is, Whether he is the formal Object of the promiſes of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer No; There is a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> between legal Privations, and theſe Privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as they are evangelical, as the Goſpel makes them before it quickens a man: there is a great deal of difference between a man that is dead, and poor, and blind, and naked, and miſerable by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the law; and a man that hath theſe priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wrought in him by the power of the Goſpel: when a man is made dead by the law, and ſees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a loſt creature by reaſon that the law plainly ſhews him his eſtate and condition, this man may be a reprobate for all this, and go to hell; there is no promiſe in the Word that God will quicken him, and raiſe him up; Chriſt is free from any promiſe in this kind, he may quicken him if he will, and not quicken him if he pleaſe. I may ſay in this ſenſe, as Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>Joh. 5. The Son of man quickens whom he will;</hi> He is free to quicken whom he will, though a man be made a dead man by the law, and cry out he is a dead man, and a damned man, though he hath the works of the law, and be terrified, and gaſtered, and humbled by the law, yet Chriſt is free from any promiſe he hath made to theſe people; there is never a promiſe in all the Word, that Chriſt hath bound himſelf by to theſe people to quicken
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93432:31"/>
them: they cannot ſay there is ſuch a promiſe in the Word, that Chriſt will quicken them. There are plain places in the Scripture, wherein the Lord invites ſuch people, upon condition they will come and believe, and ſubmit to the Goſpel; there is a conditional invitation upon theſe terms: But that theſe people ſhall be quickned, and ſhall have eternal life given them, there is no ſuch promiſe; the Lord is free, the Lord hath not bound himſelf to it; but when a man is dead according as the Goſpel makes a man dead before it quickens him, and when a man is poor according as the Goſpel makes him poor, and when a man is blind accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Goſpel makes him blind, now a man is within the compaſs of Gods promiſes, he is one that is the formal object of Mercy, he is one that ſhall have Mercy, and ſhall have Salvation, and Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt; theſe dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and ſhall live; the tongue of theſe ſtammerers ſhall ſpeak plain, the eyes of theſe blind ſhall ſee, theſe out-caſts ſhall be gathered, theſe naked ſhall be cloathed, theſe loſt ſhall be found, theſe poor ſhall be enriched; when a man is dead, ſo as the Goſpel deads a man, before it quickens a man (for the Lord damns a man before he ſaves a man, and kills a man before he quickens him) like a good Surgeon, that cuts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cures; or like a good Physician, that kills a man almoſt with Phyſick, ſo the Lord doth bring a man to deaths door before he quickens him; it is the Goſpel that truly humbles him, and works theſe privations; and now he is within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the promiſe: now he hath a promiſe that he ſhall be quickned, and have ſupply in regard of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93432:32"/>
all theſe Privations, but ſo long as theſe Privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are only legal, he hath no promiſe that he ſhall be quickned, for many are humbled and made dead as it were by the law, and yet ſhake it off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and go to their pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ts, and pleaſures, and delights, and hardneſſe of heart again; many a man hath been gaſtered by the law, and cryed out of his damned eſtate and condition, and yet hath got up again, and recovered himſelf by the world and the things of the world; and it was ever ſo of old, as we may ſee in <hi>Cain,</hi> the law had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered him to himſelf to be a dead man, and a damned man: <hi>I ſee my ſins are greater then can be forgiven,</hi> or are forgiven, or ſhall be forgiven: he ſaw his puniſhment was intolerable, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation was more then he was able to bear; <hi>From thy preſence am I caſt out, and a Vagabond ſhall I be upon the face of the earth,</hi> Gen. 4. 14. Yet he was not the formal Object of mercy; the Goſpel did not quicken him, nor convert him: he was not the formal Object of mercy, for he ſhook off theſe terrours again, as we may ſee in the very ſame Chapter, and went to building of Cities, and inventing of muſick, and other arts and ſciences; and this quickned, and revived him again: but he never came to true life. So it is with many men, though they be terrified, and gaſtered, and humbled, and caſt down by the law, yet they get up again, and run after the world, and after ſecurity, and hardneſſe of heart again; ſo that ſuch a man is not the formal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of mercy.</p>
               <p>2. Again, we ſee that many, though they be wrought upon thus by the law, and their eyes be
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93432:32"/>
enlightned, and their Conſciences awaked, and they ſee that they are in a wretched and damned eſtate; yet they ſcrape together a company of vain hopes, and ſo heal themſelves again. When they have been terrified by the law, they ſeek pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently for promiſes, and how they may get up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and they would fain get up; and they lye at catch at every Sermon, and at every Chapter, and at every Word which a good man ſpeaks; and if they can get any hold they catch at it, and ſo get up a gain and go on: And when they have got a little comfort, and think they ſhall do well, they are as careleſſe, and as ſtubborn, and as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure as ever they were; they may go on in the profeſſion of Religion, but yet their latter end is worſe then their beginning: The unclean Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel may be caſt out, but the Divel transforms himſelf into an angel of light, and enters into them, and they go on in doing good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but they never have the power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>Again <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Many that are humbled by the law, they run away, and never come to Chriſt, as <hi>Judas</hi> when he ſaw he was condemned, he went and hanged himſelf, <hi>Matth. 27. 3, 5.</hi> Some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it of Chriſt, when he ſaw Chriſt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; but others expound it of himſelf, when <hi>Judas</hi> ſaw himſelf was condemned, and that ſeems to be the meaning of the place; for Chriſt was not condemned, nor ſo much as accuſed; there came not any witneſſe againſt him, till <hi>Judas</hi> had hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, as we may ſee if we read that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But whether that be the meaning or no, this is true and certain, he ſaw he was a dead
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93432:33"/>
man, he ſaw he lay under the guilt of his ſins, and he deſpaired of mercy, and went and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf.</p>
               <p>Again <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If ſuch a man were the Object of mercy, then all the damned in hell were the formal Objects of mercy; for there is never a man in hell, but the law hath its work to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt upon him; it can work a man no lower, it can ſink a man no deeper, it can make a man no more miſerable, then thoſe that are in hell. Now if a dead man by the law ſhould be the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Object of mercy, then the damned in hell ſhould be the formal Object of mercy, which cannot be; for from thence there is no Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, <hi>Go ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>for the Divel and his angels;</hi> there is no quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that fire. So that we ſee, the legal killing of the law, doth not make a man the formal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of mercy. But yet ſuch a man hath a great deal of advantage, he is before a world of other men, that live ſecure; if men were in this eſtate, they were in a thouſand times more likelyhood to be ſaved. If I could hear of people that were gaſtered, and caſt down by the law; that ſaw themſelves without Chriſt, and without mercy, in the power of Satan, and in the bond of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; if they cryed out, I am a dead man, and a damned man, if I dye now at this preſent, I ſhall go to hell; if people were in this eſtate and condition, there were more hopes of them a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times: there is no hope of people that doe live ſecure in their ſins; ſo long as the Trumpet of the Law hath not ſounded in their ears, ſo long as the Hammer of the Law hath not ſounded
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93432:33"/>
upon their hearts, there is no hope of mercy for them. Therefore now for the clearing of this a little more, let me ſhew you</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> What it is to be dead, according as the Goſpell makes a man to be a dead man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is the difference between Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Privation, and Evangelical; and when theſe Privations are Evangelical, and put a man under the actual Title to mercy, under an actual intereſt in the promiſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What Uſe we are to make of it.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> What it is to be Evangelically dead: To be legally dead, is not to be half a quarter ſo much dead, as to be Evangelically dead, ſo as the Goſpel makes a man dead before it quickens him. When a man is Evangelically dead, it makes him more dead by a thouſand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, then all the law in the world can make him, it makes him more dead by odds; when a man is Legally dead, and ſees himſelf to be a damned creature, and whereas he hoped to have mercy, he ſeeth now he hath none, and whereas he hoped to go to heaven, he now ſeeth the gates are ſhut againſt him; and whereas he hoped he had ſome good in him, now he ſees he hath nothing in him: a man would think this were a dead man, but his livelyneſſe is only in a ſwound, the law ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him, will not let his livelyneſſe appear, and if the law ſhould lie upon him for ever, it would never let his livelyneſſe actually appear; but yet he is not throughly dead all this while: as for example.</p>
               <p>1. Self-conceitedneſſe, it is not deaded
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93432:34"/>
when a man is killed by the law, you would think his conceitedneſſe were gone: he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited he was a good Chriſtian; but now he ſees no ſuch matter: he was conceited before, that he would repent, and God would be merciful to him, but now he ſeeth, he is utterly deprived of mercy, and lies under the wrath of God; you would think now that all his conceitedneſſe was gone; but it is but only in a ſwound all this while, he lies for dead as it were, but he is not dead. So take a man that is in hell, all his good conceits of mercy, and of himſelf and his profits, and pleaſures, and vanities, and delights, they are all gone now. What doth pride profit me? what good do riches do me? what have all my pleaſures, and delights, done me good? all my labour is vanity, and all my delights folly; one would think all his conceits were clean gone; but they are only in a ſwound. If a damned man were out of hell, if the Lord ſhould take off the laſh of his law from him, he would have as good a conceit of his profits, and pleaſures, and riches again, as ever he had; and he would have his carnal reaſons againſt the ſtrictneſſe of Religion again, as rief as ever he had; they are only laid in a ſwound, indeed there they ſhall lie: a man can never get up again, becauſe the law lies continually upon him, he is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually under the laſh of the law; and the law holds this picture before his eyes, and ſhews him his damned eſtate and condition: but upon ſuch a ſuppoſition, that he might come out of hell, his conceits would riſe up again. <hi>Prov. 5. 12, 13. Solomon</hi> there brings in a man wrought
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93432:34"/>
upon by the law, the law diſcovered him to be a dead man. <hi>How have I hated inſtruction, and deſpiſed correction, and have not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined my eare to them that inſtructed me?</hi> His carnal reaſons are now all gone, they are in a ſwound; they were true inſtructions that I have hated, they were true reports that I have deſpiſed, and they were baſe and damned courſes which I have followed. How have I lived? one would think all his fooliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits now were gone, they are in a ſwound indeed, and cannot get up. But the Goſpel will give a man his deaths wound; a man can never have that good conceit of himſelf he had before; nor of his luſts, and vanities, and profits, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; his ſelf-conceitedneſs hath now got his deaths wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> For ſelf-confidence, when the law hath humbled a man, his ſelf-confidence is only in a ſwound; when he lyeth in hell under the laſh of the law, he ſeemeth to have no power in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, no life, or activity to any duty. He ſees that he is poor, and weak, and rotten, and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A poor creature he is, he ſeeth it plainly, and all his ſelf-confidence ſeems to be gone, but yet there is a great deal of ſelf-confidence actually in hell, for though they are in hell, yet they think if they were alive again, what they would do; I would hear the Word, and call upon God; I would repent and not live inſin, and not do as I have done; they think they would do thus, and thus, as it was with <hi>Dives, Luke 16. 30. I have five brethren</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if one ſhould come to them from the dead, they would repent, and not come</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:93432:35"/>
                  <hi>where I am.</hi> If they knew but as much as I know, they would repent; I am ſure if they were in my caſe, they would, if they were in hell where I am, if they knew how certain it is, that they ſhall come to hell where I am when they dye, unleſs they doe repent at the preaching of the Prophets, and hearken to the voice of Gods Miniſters, and yield and ſubmit to God; they would do it: I would, if it were my caſe. This is ſelf-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for ſelf-confidence is only laid aſleep in hell, and it cannot riſe again. It is true, the law may dead a man, and give him three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deaths wounds. There are three wounds that the law gives a man.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It makes it appear that a man is worthy of death, and guilty of death; the law makes him ſee his guiltineſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The law pronounceth upon a ſinner the ſentence of death, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of natural death, <hi>I received the ſentence of death, 2 Cor. 1. 9.</hi> that is, I was a dead man, I took my ſelf to be a dead man. So the law doth make a man to be a dead man, it pronounceth the ſentence of death upon him; it doth not only make it appear that he is worthy of death, (for ſo it may do, and yet he may have hope of mercy) but it makes a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſentence of death, and to be a dead man: if a man be once condemned, if the ſentence of death be paſſed upon him, then he is without hope that the Judg will ſave him, becauſe the ſentence of condemnation is paſſed upon him. A man may ſee himſelf worthy of death, and yet hope for mercy, <hi>Rom. 1. 31.</hi> Therefore the law doth pronounce the ſentence of death upon him, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93432:35"/>
makes a man in a ſecond degree dead.</p>
               <p>Nay, Thirdly, The law makes a man ſee there is no hope of return; as it is with a dead man, when a man is truly dead, there is no return from death, there is no riſing again: as the Wiſe-man ſpeaks of the ſtrange women, <hi>Prov. 2. 18, 19. Surely her houſe tendeth to death, and her paths unto the dead, they that go unto her return not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, neither take they hold of the wayes of life.</hi> Here the Wiſe-man ſets forth the infinite miſery, and damnable eſtate of ſuch a creature, and the irrecoverableneſs of ſuch a perſon, without the extraordinary mercy of God. Ordinarily, ſuch perſons are ſeldom, or never brought to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: ordinarily they are irrecoverable. So the Law makes a man ſee he is guilty of death, and it paſſeth the ſentence of condemnation upon him, and it makes him ſee there is no repeal of that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: thus the law leaves him. Now a man would think, Can a man be more dead then thus? How can a man be more dead? Yet he may be a thouſand times more dead; for the livelyneſſe of a man is but in a ſwound all this while: a man cannot be brisk, and peark, and ſelf-conceited, he is now laid in a ſwound, but is not ſtark dead. But when a man comes to be Evangelically dead, he is more dead a great deale. And I will ſhew you it in theſe three things.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, He is moſt dead that is hardeſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover: Now when a man is legally dead, it is eaſie to recover that man; let but the laſh of the law be taken off, let but God let him alone; and the profits and pleaſures of the world, will make him alive again; his friends, and vanities,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93432:36"/>
and delights, will put life into him again, it is an eaſie matter to recover this man; but let a man be evangellically dead, when the Goſpel hath deaded a man, he is a thouſand times more dead and a great deal harder to recover, nothing can recover that man but Chriſt; let all the profits in the world come, they cannot chear him without Chriſt; if the devil ſhould come and put into his minde all good conceits, and the good opinion of the world: If the Miniſters ſhould tell him he is in a good eſtate, they cannot quicken his heart, he is dead ſtill, he is harder a thouſand times to be revived then the other, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Col. 3. 2. 3. Set your affections on things that be above, not on things that are on earth; for ye are dead, and your life is hid in Chriſt.</hi> The Goſpel hath made you dead, and you cannot be revived by any thing but Chriſt, your life is hid with Chriſt; do not you ſet your affections on things that are below, they can never put life into you, therefore let not them take up your minds and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections any more, for your life is in Chriſt alone.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, He is moſt dead that life it ſelf, cannot make alive: When a man is but legally dead, the law hath made him a dead man, and killed him, and ſhewed him he is a damned crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; this man, let him have but a little life, or any thought of life come into him, let him have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny affections towards God, any ſeeming deſires, it will make him think I am alive: But if the Goſpel once have made a man a dead man, life it ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not quicken him, Chriſt himſelf cannot make this man a live man in himſelf, though life come into
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93432:36"/>
him, and though he hath life from God, yet he himſelf is dead. <hi>I am dead through the law,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that I might live unto God;</hi> thus <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and that life I now live in the fleſh, I live by Faith in the Son of God,</hi> Gal. 2. 19, 20. When the Goſpel had made him dead (for that is the meaning of the words) he was not only dead by the law, but by the power of the Goſpel working by the law: Now, ſaith he, though I have life, and Chriſt be come into me, and lives in me, yet I do not live: I live, but not I, but it is Chriſt that liveth in me: I live, yet do not miſtake me, I am a dead man, I have no life, it is Chriſt that liveth in me: when a man is evangelically dead, it makes a man content, that God ſhould keep life in his hand, and keep the purſe in his hand, and all in his hand, it makes him content to be without ſtrength and ability, and to have nothing in his own hand, but to have all from the Lord; and he ſaith, I am a dead man, and if I ever have comfort, I have none in my ſelf, I muſt go to Chriſt for comfort, and life, and ſtrength, and ability: and ſo for power and activity, and riches, and means, &amp; maintenance, and every thing; it is not my parts and gifts that can help me to them, but I muſt go to Chriſt to fetch them; now it is the deſire of mans heart to have life at home, he cannot abide to have life in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hands: and though the law, and hell it ſelf proclaim a man a dead man, and make a man ſee himſelf a dead man, yet it cannot kill this Principle, a man would have life and ſtrength in his own hand, and ability, and ſufficiency in his own cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody; we may ſee this Principle in Gods own
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93432:37"/>
Children, though this Principle be begun to be killed, yet it reſts partly in Gods children, there is ſtill a ſecret luſt in their hearts, to have life, and grace, and ſtrength in their own keeping; and if any child of God be negligent in coming to God, it is becauſe of this Principle that remains in him.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, He is moſt dead that death hath moſt power over: Now when a man is legally dead, and the law hath made him a dead man, though he be a dead man, yet death hath no power over him, his heart is ſtubborn ſtill, and will not look toward Chriſt and the Goſpel, he is ſtill as ſtubborn as ever he was; he will roar and howl, and hear every Sermon, but ſtill he hath a hard heart, the law hath not power to break his heart to powder, and to ſoften his heart: but when a man is evangelically dead, when the Goſpel hath made him dead, as it doth before it quickens a man, it breaks the ſturdineſſe of a mans heart, and ſhatters a man all to pieces; that is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that place, <hi>Pſal. 147. 3. He healeth thoſe that are broken in heart, and bindeth up their ſores:</hi> Now he is thus made a dead man, it makes his heart to burſt under the weight of his ſins, and it beats him to powder: but a man that is onely legally dead, he is heart-whole ſtill, and his ſpirit is as ſtout againſt the kind working of the Goſpel as ever it was, nay, worſe a great deal; there are none more hardened then thoſe that ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves dead, damned creatures, by the power of the law, without the power of the Goſpel. But when the Goſpel comes, it breaks the heart to powder, <hi>Iſa. 57. 15. Thus ſaith the high and lofty one, He</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:93432:37"/>
                  <hi>that inhabiteth Eternity, whoſe name is Holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, and with him who is of an humble and contrite ſpirit, to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to give life to them that are of a contrite heart.</hi> This man is the object of Mercy that is evangelically dead, he is the formal object of mercy: why? becauſe he is dead with ſuch a kind of death as hath gotten power over him, power to break his heart, to make it an humble and contrite heart: now ſaith the Lord, I will revive ſuch a man. This man is the formal object of mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and into him eternal life will come.</p>
               <p>2. The Second thing I promiſed to ſhew you, is the difference between theſe two, between le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and evangelical Privation. Between one that is legally dead, and one that is dead as the Goſpel deads a man before it quickens him.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, He that is legally dead lies all along in his death: but when the Goſpel makes a man a dead man, it makes him ſtand up that he might have life, <hi>Epheſ. 5. 14. Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ſtand up from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee life:</hi> He doth not mean, ſtand up from being dead, but ſtand up from the dead, and then Chriſt ſhall give thee life; he means ſuch a ſtanding up from the dead, as before Chriſt gives him life: the Goſpel doth thus far awaken a man, though he be more dead a thouſand times, then he that is dead by the law, yet thus far it quickens him, that he ſtands up from his ſecure eſtate: when the law comes and ſhews a man that he is a dead man, he ſtill lies under his ſins, he is a dead man, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93432:38"/>
ſtand up that Chriſt may give him life. That is the Firſt thing.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, He that is legally dead, made dead only by the law, he is deaf to the Goſpel: but when a man is evangelically dead, it boors his ears and makes him hear the voice of the Word, and not only ſo, but the voice of Chriſt in the Word, <hi>Iſa. 55. 3. Incline your ears and come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, hear and your ſoul ſhall live:</hi> He calls thoſe that were evangelically dead, hear, and your ſoul ſhall live; they are made able to hear: Let their profits, and old courſes, and old companions come and tempt them to walk as they have done, they are deaf of that ear, they cannot go that way to work, no, now their ears are open heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>ſeek the Lord, and you ſhall live,</hi> Amos 5. 6. They are made to ſeek the Lord, thus much life they have: though they are more dead in regard of their own miſery, then one that is dead by the law; yet thus much life they have put into them, that they will go and ſeek unto God in the uſe of the means, and follow him up and down, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will ſatisfy the heart but Chriſt, they leave no ſtone unroled, they ſeek up and down everywhere.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, He that is legally dead, it is a kind of death to love; but he that is evangelically dead, it is a death of love; when the Church in the Canticles was but ſenſible of the countenance of Chriſt, ſhe was preſently ſick of love, <hi>I charge you, O ye daughters of Jeruſalem, if ye find my wel beloved, tell him that I am ſick of love,</hi> Cant. 5. There is a great deal of difference between ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and death, death is a total privation of life; ſickneſſe is but a partial privation: now when the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93432:38"/>
Goſpel hath wrought upon a man that he hath ſome of Chriſt, and is not deprived of all, that privation makes him ſick of love; but when the Goſpel makes a man ſee he is dead, and altogether deprived of Chriſt, now he is dead of love: when a man is legally dead, this is his death that he is damned, and muſt go to hell; this is his death that he hath no mercy, not that he hath not grace, and holineſs, and Chriſt; but if a man be evangelically dead, this is his death, that he hath not Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Uſe is this, If there be any that the law<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> hath made dead, reſt not there but labour that the Goſpel may make you dead alſo; when thou art humbled by the law, thou mayeſt think that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is prepared for thee, but thy luſts may recover again, and that damned life that is in thee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover again; therefore labour to be more deaded by the Goſpel, that thou mayeſt have a total death begun in thee, that thou mayeſt have thy deaths wound given thee deep, not only to be in a ſwoond, but to be dead indeed. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. Chriſt ſtaid four dayes after <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would raiſe him, becauſe he would have him irrecoverably dead before he would raiſe him: <hi>Lord,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Martha</hi>) <hi>he ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinketh, for he hath been dead four dayes,</hi> verſ. 39. If he had raiſed him ſooner, his glory had not been ſo great, ſo thou muſt labour to be dead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and to be buried, and to be loathſome and abominable, and then Chriſt will quicken thee: It is certain that Gods Children have ſome of this death wrought in them, before they are quickned at all; for death is before quickning in order of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93432:39"/>
nature: there muſt be a corruption of one thing before there can be a generation of another; there muſt be a privation of one form, before there can be an introduction of another: A child of God muſt be dead before he can be quickned. Now then, if he will have more life, he muſt labour to be dead more and more: now thou muſt labour to have this death truly begun to be wrought in thee, thou muſt labour to have the love of this world and ſelf-conceitedneſſe altogether dead in thee. <hi>Hoſ. 6. 2. After two dayes will he revive us, and the third day will he raiſe us up, and we ſhall live in his ſight:</hi> A man may be alive, though he have been ſeemingly dead twenty four hours; therefore it is a good cuſtom among us to keep men near two dayes before we bury them, that we may be ſure they are throughly dead; for there are many have been buried alive: ſo after two dayes he will revive us, and the third day he will raiſe us up: when a man is dead indeed, and hath his livelineſs throughly killed in him, then God will revive him; if he ſhould revive him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, his glory would not be ſo great, if he ſhould revive him before he were quite dead; when <hi>Ahab</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 21</note> humbled himſelf, and put on ſackcloth, and went ſoftly, a man would have thought he had been dead; but in the next Chapter we may ſee he is alive again. So <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> one would<note place="margin">Acts 5.</note> have thought their covetouſneſſe had been dead, (whether they were any of the three thouſand that were pricked at <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, I diſpute not) but they were pricked and made ſenſible of their damned eſtate, and pretended to lay down all at the Apoſtles feet, one would have thought their
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93432:39"/>
covetouſneſs had been dead, but yet it was alive: therefore labour that the Goſpel may make thee throughly dead.</p>

               <p>3. Here is the reaſon why he gives him this charge, and that is in the third and fourth verſes, <hi>For the time will come, when they will not endure ſound Doctrine, &amp;c.</hi> The more danger there is among people, the more inſtant ſhould Miniſters

Every Chriſtian is to watch over his own wayes, and thoſe that are committed to his charge: but Miniſters are watchmen over their people, therefore here is a double reaſon to move him to watchfulneſs; both in regard of his own ſoul, and the people he was ſet over, <hi>Mark.</hi> 13. 37. our Saviour ſaith, <hi>What I ſay to you, I ſay to all, Watch.</hi> And what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith here to <hi>Timothy,</hi> I may ſay to all Chriſtians, Watch in all things.</p>
               <p>For the better handling of this point, I will ſhew you,</p>
               <p>Firſt, What it is to watch.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The things we muſt watch.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The reaſons of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> What it is to watch. And to watch in<note place="margin">What it is to watch, Literally.</note> Scripture is taken two wayes, <hi>Literally,</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Watching ſometimes is taken Literally, and then it ſignifies a waking, when the time, or nature calls not for ſleep; for there is a difference between watching, and waking: we are all awake at this time, or elſe ought to be, but yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to watch; but this is to watch, when time or nature calls for ſleep. When a man awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all night, or the greateſt part of the night, as <hi>Luke 2. 8. The Shepherds were watching their flocks by night:</hi> And this is two fold, either <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi> or <hi>Extraordinary,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:93432:40"/>Ordinary watching is contrary to immoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe<note place="margin">Ordinary.</note> in ſleeping. As when a man is ſober in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and drinking, and other lawful things; ſo we ought to be ſober in our ſleep, for it is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing, if we ſuffer immoderate ſleep to fall upon us.</p>
               <p>Now Extraordinary watching is contrary to<note place="margin">Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</note> ſleep it ſelf, as ordinary watching is contrary to ſleepineſſe; for it takes away our natural ſleep, which otherwiſe we are to have. And this is for two reaſons:</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is for a <hi>Civil end,</hi> when we watch with<note place="margin">For a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil end.</note> thoſe that are ſick, as a duty of Charity; it is fit that thoſe that are well, ſhould break their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſleep and reſt, to be helpful to thoſe that are ſick; this is a Civil end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is a <hi>Spiritual end</hi> of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary<note place="margin">For a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual end.</note> watching, and that is, when a man is not only moderate in ſleeping, but abates himſelf of that reſt he may lawfully take, for a Spiritual end. As Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Watch unto prayer,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 7. and the Church, <hi>Lament.</hi> 2. 19. watched to humble their ſouls under Gods hand. For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we have need to break our very natural reſt, for the good of our ſouls. Though we be never ſo careful, and conſcionable in the day time, yet it may ſo fall out, that the day will not be enough, but we muſt entrench upon the night alſo, to ſeek the Lord extraordinarily; but this watching is not here meant, though it be ſometimes required. But a <hi>Spiritual</hi> watching is ſpecially meant, which<note place="margin">Spiritually.</note> includes three things in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It doth note a readineſſe of minde to be<note place="margin">It implies proneneſs to be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy.</note> drowzy; for as in natural and literal watching,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93432:41"/>
it doth note a natural proneneſs to be drowzy, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through the darkneſſe of the night, or the heat of the weather, or the like; ſo this ſpiritual watching ſignifieth unto us, that we are naturally ſubject to be ſecure ſpiritually, and vain, and idle, and negligent, and have need to be rouzed up: for indeed all Commandments ſince the Fall, are ſuch as do not agree with our nature: as when he commands us to ſeek the Lord while he may be found, that intimates, that we are by nature apt to put it off, and to be careleſs of making our peace with God; and when the Lord ſaith, <hi>pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,</hi> it doth imply, how backward we are to that duty, how apt to neglect it, or to ſhuffle it over, and to be luke-warm in it: before the Fall when God did bid man do any thing, the bidding of him did imply, that if he were not careful, he was in a poſſibility of breaking the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; it did not argue a proneneſs to break them: but ſince the Fall, the commandements of God, whatſoever God hath commanded us to do, either for matter or manner of it, it implyeth, how backward to, and untoward we are in doing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Watchfulneſſe doth imply a labour<note place="margin">Endeavour to ſtir up our ſelves.</note> and endeavour in our ſelves, to take off this ſinful proneneſſe to evil that is in us, and to be ſeriouſly ſtirred up, to look after our duty whatſoever it is, both towards God, and towards man, we ought to ſhake off all untowardneſſe of ſpirit, whereby we are unfit to watch; watchfulneſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth this alſo, <hi>Epheſ. 5. 14.

               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> and main thing: This watchfulneſs<note place="margin">It is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in all Caſes.</note> doth include ſome further buſineſſe or duty to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done that is not yet performed; for watchfulneſſe is an act to help forward ſome further act: As for example, We are bound to remember God in all our wayes; the want of this, is the reaſon we ſo often ſin againſt God; now if we did remember God, if we did remember his Holineſſe, if we did remember the greatneſſe of his Power, and the ſtrictneſſe of his Juſtice againſt Sin, if we did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our Death, and what account we are to make before him, this would be a great help to keep us from ſin; now if we would remember this, a ſpecial way to help us, is to watch, as <hi>Acts 20. 31. Watch and remember,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; he being deſirous that they ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the admonitions and exhortations which he had propounded, he layes down this as a ſpecial means to help them hereunto, <hi>to watch:</hi> So we are to be watchful, that we may be ſober in eating and drinking, and all lawful things; for how ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly do diſtempers break in upon us, unleſſe a man look to himſelf? now watchfulneſſe is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent help to Sobriety, 1 <hi>Theſſ. 5. 6. Let us watch and be ſober:</hi> We had need to watch what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we go about, that we may be ſober in it; whatſoever wordly buſineſſe we go about in our Callings, we had need to have this watchfulneſſe, that we be not over-whelmed, and over head and ears in the world, that we may not be intemperate in our eating and drinking, that we may not give
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93432:42"/>
our ſelves too much liberty and freedom in talking and diſcourſing of the things here below; ſo we are bound to keep our garments, that our naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe may not be ſeen, that the ſins that are up and down in the world do not defile them, that the temptations, and alurements, and occaſions we meet withal, and the examples of the times, and ſuch like, do not take away our righteouſneſſe from us: now watchfulneſſe is an help hereunto, as we may ſee, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 15. the text ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments:</hi> So that watchfulneſſe is an excellent help for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther act to be done: when a man hath ſome duty or other to be done, which the Lord requires ſhould be done with care and diligence, watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is a help thereunto, as <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 1. the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet knowing there was ſome Prophecy to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them, the Prophet laboured to be in a fit caſe to receive it; and that he might ſo be, <hi>I will watch</hi> ſaith he: in a word, watchfulneſſe, is an intentive conſiderateneſſe of the heart, when a man doth conſider how he is to do every thing, leſt he be ſurpriſed either by Satan, or the world, or by his own ſubtil fleſh; when a man is conſiderative, and takes heed to himſelf, to his thoughts, and his words, and all his actions, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Take heed, Watch, and Pray,</hi> Mark. 13. 33. When he would deſcribe watchfulneſſe, what it is, he ſets another phraſe by it to open it to us, <hi>take heed, watch, and pray.</hi> There is a kind of heedleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that is apt to cleave to the heart, whereby the heart is careleſſe what ſnares are before it: now watchfulneſſe doth take off this, and maketh a man to take more heed in whatſoever he doth, ſo
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93432:42"/>
that there can be no opportunity of doing good, but he takes it; no good motion is ſuggeſted, but he lyeth at catch to receive it, for this is watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. <hi>Prov. 8. 33. Bleſſed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates:</hi> here you may ſee watchfulneſs is expreſſed, when a man comes into the preſence of Chriſt, waiting to hear whatſoever ſhall come from Chriſt, and there is nothing that drops from the Miniſter that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns him, but he is ready to receive it; when a man waits to be ready to obey whatſoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment the Lord delivers, and to take heed to avoid whatſoever the Lord forbids. This is watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>ſecond thing</hi> is, <hi>what we muſt watch?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What we muſt watch</note> I Anſwer, We muſt watch our ſelves, and all the duties of Religion, and time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt we muſt watch over our ſelves. Ponder</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Our Selves</note> 
                  <hi>thy pathes,</hi> ſaith the Wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 26. as who ſhould ſay, Look to thy ſelf; take heed to every ſtep that it be ordered aright: How ſoon may a man be turned out of the way? How ſoon was <hi>David carried</hi> away into thoſe two great ſins of Murther and Adultery? How ſoon was <hi>Peter</hi> put beſids his Reſolution in the high Prieſts Hall, for want of watchfulneſs? If he had watched and remembred our Saviours <hi>item,</hi> he had never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied his Maſter: A man is marvellous ready to be carried away, therefore we muſt watch our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Firſt, And in particular we muſt watch our <hi>own</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Our Thoughts.</note> 
                  <hi>thoughts:</hi> naturally all our thoughts are idle and unprofitable, our minds are apt to ſpend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon that which will do us no good: we
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93432:43"/>
had need therefore to watch over our thoughts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>Beware</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>that there be not an evil thought in thy heart:</hi> Take heed that vain thoughts come not into thy mind, idle thoughts, or wordly thoughts will dead us, and dull us to the ſervice of God, and poyſon the heart, and no good thing can dwell in us; if we do not look unto our thoughts, the eyes of the Lord are upon our thoughts, therefore watch over thy thoughts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>We ſhould watch over the Heart it</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heart.</note> 
                  <hi>ſelf:</hi> The <hi>heart</hi> is the very ſpring, there be the very iſſues of Life and Death, the actions flow from thence; therefore, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 23. the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſaith, <hi>Keep thy heart with all keeping:</hi> as who ſhould ſay, Thy heart is deceitful and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, it will make thee believe thou art going to heaven, when it leads thee to hell; if thou be never ſo well affected for a time, this heart will fly off, it is naturally ſo naught and reprobate to what is good; <hi>Therefore keep thy heart with all diligence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Watch over thy Words:</hi> Pſal. 141. 3.<note place="margin">Words.</note> 
                  <hi>Set a watch, O Lord, before the door of my lips.</hi> We muſt watch our lips, and have a care that our words be agreeable to Gods Word, and ſeaſoned with ſalt, and that we ſhun all manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, that doth not miniſter grace to the hearers; we muſt take heed leſt idle words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of our mouths, for which we muſt give an account at the day of Judgement; how many times do ſuch words proceed out of our mouths that we would give a world to recal again? only becauſe we do not watch over our words, that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93432:43"/>
they may be ſuch as may tend to edifying, and expreſſe the grace that is within?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Again, we ſhould watch over our <hi>Senſes,</hi> we ſhould make a covenant with our <hi>eyes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Senſes. Eyes.</note> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks chap. 31. 1. <hi>not to look upon a maid;</hi> when our eyes are looking up and down, though they be not caught with adultery, or ſuch groſsſins, yet there is danger to be caught one vvay or other; for when a man looks upon the objects of the world, as good, and the like, how ready is his mind to be carryed after it? men are led by their eyes, they carry the mind and heart with them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould have a care, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver comes to our eyes, we make a good uſe of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly,</hi> Again, we ſhould ſet a watch before our<note place="margin">Ears.</note> 
                  <hi>Ears,</hi> we ſhould take heed what we hear, when we come in company, left we be infected by what is ſpoken; we ſhould have an hedge about our ears, to ſtop them from unſavoury things. <hi>Doth not the ear taſte words,</hi> ſaith Job? we ſhould have taſting ears, that ſhould be able to taſt and reliſh the good words that are ſpoken, and hate the contrary, and diſtaſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We ſhould watch <hi>our ſelves, over the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Whole ſelves.</note> 
                  <hi>whole man:</hi> Only <hi>take heed to thy ſelfe,</hi> Deut. 4. 9. As who ſhould ſay, This is the only thing; have a care of, watch over thy ſelf, leſt thy ſelf undoe thy ſelf; there is no enemie ſo dangerous unto us as our ſelves: the Divel in hell cannot do us ſo much miſchief. How many corruptions are there in us, to draw us from God, and incite us unto ſin? There are abundance of corruptions lying in the heart of man, to make a man unfit for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93432:44"/>
thing that is good; that is, idleneſſe in the underſtanding, it cannot abide to take pains, and exerciſe it ſelf in Divine matters. There is in the will and affections, covetouſneſs, and abundance of corrupt inclinations, that if a man look not to, it will break forth: So that this is the thing we muſt watch over, our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>We are to watch over the duties of Religion;</hi> as for example, we are to <hi>watch unto</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Duties of Religion.</note> 
                  <hi>prayer,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 7. we are to watch to meditating, and reading, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Word of God. Otherwiſe though we do them for the matter of them, yet we cannot for the right form, and manner of them: though our hearts be in a pretty good tune for the preſent, yet we cannot hold this frame, if we watch not thereunto. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 3. is an excellent place, <hi>If you will not watch,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>and hold faſt, I will come againſt thee as a thief in the night:</hi> As who ſhould ſay, Stir up thy ſelf and watch, that thou maiſt hold faſt; if thou haſt got any hatred of ſin in thy heart, hold it faſt; if ſtrength againſt corruption, hold it faſt. How ſhall I do that? why watch ſaith he, or elſe Chriſt wil come againſt thee as a thief. If a book be in a mans hand when he is drowzy, it will fall out, he cannot hold it faſt; So when a mans heart is drowzy, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it will let go comfort, and any thing that God hath beſtowed for the good of the ſoul; therefore we ought to watch: if we have any ſweet diſpoſition of heart, to go on in the Service of God, and in the duties of Religion, we may go on if we be watchful. And now to branch this into particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:93432:44"/>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> We muſt watch <hi>before the Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We muſt watch <hi>in the Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We muſt watch <hi>after the Duty.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Before Duty.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>We muſt watch before the Duty. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,</hi> Exod. 20. 8 So I may ſay, remember Prayer, to keep it holy; remember Meditation, to keep it holy; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber all the duties of Religion, to keep them holy, and perform them in an holy manner: think of them before you go about the performance of them; we cannot pray unleſs we watch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prayer, unleſs we be careful, and have our eyes in our heads, before we go about the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>In the morning as ſoon as we awake, we ſhould think of prayer; and when tempted to ſin, we ſhould think of prayer. If I ſin, how can I pray unto God? I have ever and anon need to poure out my prayers before God; now if I commit theſe and theſe ſins, how can I look up to heaven, when my conſcience doth reproach me for ſin? So when we hear the word of God, <hi>look to thy foot when thou comeſt into the houſe of God,</hi> Eccleſ. 5. 1. that is, Before thou goeſt into the Houſe of God to hear the Word of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſee into thine own heart, think whoſe word it is thou heareſt; and that thou goeſt to hear the Word, that ſhall judge thee at the laſt day. When thou comeſt into the preſence of God, take heed leſt thou heareſt as fools hear; and take heed leſt thou prayeſt as fools pray; and comeſt to the Sacrament, as fools uſe to come; we ſhould watch before the duty, that all things may be in a readineſſe, before we come to the performance
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93432:45"/>
of it, that we may prevent all things that may hinder us, &amp; be fitted with all things that may help forward the duty; that time, place and all advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges may meet together for the better doing of it.</p>
               <p>Then ſecondly, <hi>We muſt watch in the duty,</hi> as<note place="margin">In Duty.</note> well as before the duty. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks concerning prayer, ſo I may ſay concerning all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duties, <hi>Continue in prayer, and watch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with thanksgiving, Col. 4. 2.</hi> As we are to watch before, that we may have preparation, ſo we muſt watch in the duty, that we may rightly diſcharge it; for though a man hath been watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful before the duty, and hath been prepared in ſome meaſure, and fitted, yet you are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger. But when you are in prayer, and when you are at the Lords Table, or any other duty; for all your former preparation, if you be not watchful now, you may fail in ſome kind or other, and ſo mar the duty; therefore we ſhould watch <hi>in the duty,</hi> that our hearts may be waking in it, and our mind attentive upon it, that our hearts may be fixed upon that we are about; <hi>my heart is fixed, my heart is fixed,</hi> ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David;</hi> he was a joyful man, he repeats it again and again; as if a man ſhould be jocund, and ſay, I have got it, I have got it. We ſhould get hearts fixed upon the duty, that ſo we may not have wavering hearts, half off, and half on the duty; but that the whole man may be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We ſhould be watchful <hi>after the duty,</hi> that we may not loſe the benefit, and reward <hi>of the duty,</hi> leſt the ſubtilties of Satan, and the wiles
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93432:45"/>
of our own hearts, do rob us of the fruits of it; though a man hears very attentively, and pray, and perform all other duties very enlargedly, yet when he hath done all, he may loſe the comfort and reward of the duty. Therefore when we hear the word, we ſhould watch over our hearts, that the ſouls of the ayre may not pluck it out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that if we have any quickning, we may not loſe it again; if we have heard any thing that hath helpeld us forward in Grace, we ſhould take heed that we loſe not the ground again; As the Publican, as ſoone as he had prayed to God, and performed an Ordinance aright, how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful was he not to loſe the benefit thereof? He went to the Temple to pray, and he was watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful before the duty; thinking, I am now going to pray, and power out my ſoul before God. He was watchful in the duty, for you may ſee how humbly, and feelingly, and penitently he did pray; ſtanding a far off, and ſmiting upon his breſt, and not lifting up his eyes to heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing the hardneſs of his own heart, and row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing it up, <hi>Lord be merciful to me a ſinner:</hi> and when he had done this, he was careful afterwards, for the Text ſaith, <hi>Luk. 18. 14.</hi> As he had prayed for mercy, ſo he was careful to carry it along with him. He prayed that he might be juſtified, and as he prayed for it, ſo he was careful to carry home juſtification in his boſome. So when we are at a Sermon, we ſhould watch, that we may go home quickned, and bettered: and when we are at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, we ſhould watch that we may return home with the firuit, and benefit of the duty; So for all other Ordinances, we ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93432:46"/>
and watchful, that we may not loſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for the Divel is crafty, and our own hearts are ready to betray us, therefore we had need be watchful; and that is the ſecond thing, we ſhould watch, <hi>the duties of Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We ſhould watch <hi>times and ſeaſons;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Time. Preſent time.</note> God knows what miſerable things are a coming, therefore what time the Lord allots us, we had need improve it to the beſt advantage, that we may redeem the time. How many hours do run from us, before we are aware? How many dayes, and months, and years, have we let ſlip away, and we are little the better? Our time is a ſpecial thing, and therefore we had need to watch it, that we may improve it to the beſt advantage, that we may be no longer fools, but wiſe in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We ſhould watch all the <hi>times of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Time of Gods wrath.</note> 
                  <hi>Gods anger and diſpleaſure;</hi> it is a miſerable thing when a man paſſeth on like a fool, and Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger come forth, and a man is not provided, hath not a defence for it. There be dayes of anger, and viſitation, when God comes to viſit people for their ſins; to viſit a pariſh, to viſit a family, to viſit a perſon; and what a woful thing is it, for a man to be drowzy and negligent, when Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger burſts forth, and ſo he hath no evidence of comfort to his ſoul; he knows not how to meet God in the field? But when the wrath of God breaks out in any kind upon his Goods, or Wife, or Children, or Body, or Friends, or any thing, he is at a loſſe, and knows not what to do; he is fain to ſink under the hand of God, and hath no refuge to flie unto; therefore we ſhould
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93432:46"/>
watch againſt the day of Gods anger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We ſhould watch over <hi>the times of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Time of Grace.</note> 
                  <hi>Grace,</hi> for there be gracious and acceptable times, as the Apoſtle calls them, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 21.</hi> Many times good motions come in: Now if we do not watch, to keep them, and nouriſh them in our hearts, the Lord will paſſe us by at another time, and we ſhall not be moved. Sometimes God affects thy heart at a Sermon, and puts in a good reſolution to forſake ſin, and lead a new life; now have a care to keep theſe reſolutions, and let them not periſh in thee, and go out like lightning. The Lord hath given many a bleſſed ſeaſon, and oportunity of mercy, the water was moved, if he would have but ſtepped in, if he would but have taken hold of the mercy, he might have had it; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he may go mourning, and thirſting, and longing, and never have the mercy offered more; and it is well if he can be humbled for miſſing of that mercy, by his neglect, and watch for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the <hi>times of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again we ſhould watch the <hi>times of Death;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Death.</note> we are all mortal men, muſt die, and <hi>Bleſſed is that ſervant, whom his Lord when he cometh ſhall find him ſo doing,</hi> Mat. 24. 5. If any of us ſhould dye, before we are converted, and brought home to God, we periſh for ever: Whoſoever thou art, if thou die in thy ſins with thy dead, hard, unſanctified, unregenerate heart, thou art dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, thou goeſt to Hell. Therefore watch for the coming of death, that ſo when it comes, it may not be the King of Terrours, and an amazement to thy heart.</p>
               <p>Againe, We muſt watch for <hi>the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Judgment.</note>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:93432:47"/>
as Death leaves us, ſo Judgment will find us: Therefore we ſhould conſider with our ſelves ſeriouſly, the ſtrictneſſe of the account we are to give at the dreadful day of the Son of man, when all works ſhall be brought to a Touch-ſtone, and all ſecrets ſhall be Preached on the Houſe top. It is an excellent thing, when a man doth conſider theſe things before hand; when a man hath look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his thoughts, for they ſhall be Judged; and upon his ſpeeches, and upon all his wayes, for they ſhall all be brought before the Judgment Seat of God; and according as a man hath done, ſuch reward he ſhall receive for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
               <p>The next thing, is, the <hi>Reaſons why we are to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons.</note> 
                  <hi>Watch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the <hi>Firſt</hi> Reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe we are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Our prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be drowzy.</note> 
                  <hi>prone to be Drowzy in Spiritual things.</hi> In temporal things we are watchful enough; for Covetouſneſſe, and Pride, and the like, we are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry watchful, but in Spiritual things, how ſubject are we to Drowzyneſs? <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf was fain to complain, <hi>I know that in me, that is, in my fleſh, dwelleth no good thing, Rom.</hi> 7. 18. Is thy heart better then Saint <hi>Pauls?</hi> If he were left to himſelf, he ſhould be as miſerable, and proud, and untoward as another; and have as vile an heart as another: and therefore that made him watch. Therefore we had need to watch, for how loath are we to be brought to watch? and how unwilling to take ſuch an hard piece of ſervice to do? we are marvellous apt to be ſecure. If <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> had watched, if he had had a watch over his heart, he would have gone to <hi>Nineveh;</hi> but for

want of watchfulneſſe, he ran away. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>I ſleep,</hi> ſaith the Church, it was not like the ſleep of the wicked, and ungodly, for her heart waked, but ſhe was aſleep, ſhe was proud, and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſecure; there was a great deal of untoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit grew upon her: And as we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward to that which is good, ſo we are prone to that which is evil; we are glued naturally to the world, and the things of this life, it is an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie thing to draw us away into evill, therefore we had need to watch. As it is ſaid of the Diſciples of Chriſt in regard of temporal drowzineſs, ſo it is with us, in regard of Spiritual drowzineſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 43. <hi>He came and found them aſleep again, for their eyes were heavy:</hi> Though Chriſt had awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, and jogged them, yet they were aſleep again, for their eyes were heavy; So though the Lord hath awakened us, even now we were awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a Croſſe, by Sickneſſe, by a Sermon, by a Reproof, ſomething or other God hath been pleaſed to waken us by; but all on the ſuddain we fall aſleep again, for our hearts are very heavy: as it is with an heavy brain, what a doe he hath to keep himſelf awake? though he pinch himſelf, and rowze up himſelf, yet he hath much adoe to keep his eyes open; ſo the heart of man is ſo drowzy, that he hath much adoe to keep any Grace alive in himſelf; we are ſo apt to be ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, that we had need to watch. <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 1. the Prophet complains of the drowzineſs of his heart, <hi>The Angel that talked with me, came again and waked me, as a man is wakened out of his ſleep:</hi> when God was talking with him, he fell into a ſleep. So when we are in Prayer, we have much
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93432:48"/>
adoe to hold out in the duty, we have ſuch vile natures, and curſed diſpoſitions. How ought we then to watch over our ſelves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another reaſon why we ſhould be watchful, is, <hi>becauſe our life is a Warfare,</hi> and<note place="margin">Chriſtians life is a Warfare.</note> we do not lie like two Armies in a field, removed one from the other; but we lie in the midſt of our enemies round about us, and ſo they are ready to ſurpriſe us. The greateſt means of doing us miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,<note place="margin">The world an enemy.</note> are moſt commonly thoſe things we have need of; as our meat, and drink, and affaires, and callings; we cannot go to prayer, but world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughts are ready to intangle us; we cannot go to the Houſe of God, but a man is in danger to be intrapped. There is danger in every thing we go about, by reaſon of the worlds powerful enticements, therefore we had need to ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Guard, and be careful, for elſe how can we avoid to be ſuprized, and led away? this is the reaſon, why ſo many ſink into Perdition: Many that have given good hopes, many that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed excellent things, have come to nothing, but have fallen away as the fall of a leafe. Whence comes this, but becauſe they have not been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and watchful?</p>
               <p>The Divel is watchful, to inſnare and intrap us,<note place="margin">The Divel</note> therefore we ſhould watch to avoid his ſnares; As the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Be ſober and watchful, for your Adverſary, the Divel, goeth about like a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour:</hi> The Divel is alwayes buſie, and therefore we had need watch and buſie our ſelves, and be careful at all times: when we are ſecure, and conſider not God, and conſider not the good of our Souls, and the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93432:48"/>
peace of our Conſciences; Satan preſently hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt us: If the Divel had any thing elſe to do, it were ſomething, but the Divel hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, but to hurt us, and lay Siege againſt us; All his practice, from the beginning of the world to this day, is to go roaming and ranging up and down to do miſchief, it is all his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from the beginning of the day to the end thereof; If he get us alone, he will enſnare us there; if not there, he will enſnare us in company; if he cannot get us there, he will get us in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and if any thing falls againſt our luſts, he will cauſe our hearts to riſe againſt it. Now when we do not watch over our ſelves, we are led away by Satan, therefore we had need be careful, for the Divel is alwayes watchful, therefore we ſhould labour to be alwayes provided to reſiſt him.</p>
               <p>Again, we have <hi>the fleſh</hi> that is continually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, it is an enemy within us, it is that which doth betray us to the World, and the Divel, even our own hearts do betray us, and therefore we had need be careful; we have enemies from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and our own hearts within, and all to undo us. Take a man that is in a good way, and hath all means, and helps to make him Godly, though there be no temptation from without, yet he may de damned from his own heart, if he be not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from it. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>Every man is tempted by his own luſts,</hi> and Jam. 4. 5. <hi>The Spirit that is within us luſteth to envy,</hi> and covetouſneſs, and ſecurity, and vanity, and carnal eaſe, it luſts after theſe things, and therefore we had need to watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:93432:49"/>A <hi>Third</hi> reaſon is, Becauſe it <hi>will do us a great</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> 
                  <hi>deal of good:</hi> for as if we do not watch we are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſurprized, ſo if we do watch it is an eaſie thing to ſtand: all our miſcarriages in the duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, lye in ſecurity; whereas if we were watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and would walk with eyes in our heads, and would conſider the ſnares that be laid for us, and conſider Gods threatnings, and Commandments, the duties of Religion would be eaſie: For if we do not watch the Divel, and the World, and the Fleſh have advantage againſt us; but if we do watch, this is as it were a fence to the heart, to hedge a man in to keep him ſafe. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 2. there is an excellent place, <hi>Be watchful, and ſtrengthen the things that remain;</hi> it is the ſtrength of the ſoul. When a man watcheth, let a man have but a little grace, ſuppoſe a man be marvellouſly fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len off, and hath but a little good remaining, a few graces in him; a little faith, a little hope, a little ſanctified deſire; he hath but a little ſtrength to go on againſt ſin, if a man doth but now watch, if a man do but husband this little, how ſtrong will he be? A little Faith is able to overcome all the Divels in Hell, well managed: a little hope is able to keep a man above water from ſinking: a little ſtrength is able to maintain the Combate: a little affection to goodneſs, if a man have a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart to improve it to the uttermoſt, will go a great way; if a man did but watch, it would ſtrengthen the things that remaine. Though a man were never ſo infeebled, and come to never ſo low an ebb, watchfulneſſe is a ſtay and ſtrength to the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Again if we do not watch, <hi>we cannot</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:93432:49"/>
                  <hi>ſo much as pray to God to forgive us,</hi> our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences<note place="margin">We cannot elſe expect help or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</note> tell us, unleſſe the Lord ſave us, we cannot be ſaved; now how can we expect that God ſhould ſave us, if we do not pray unto him? and we cannot pray to him to ſave us, unleſſe we watch: it is to tempt God, to pray to him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us from evil, when we do not watch over our ſelves; it is to tempt God, to pray to him to quicken us, when vve deaden our ſelves; to intreat God to give us an holy mind, vvhen vve our ſelves let in vain thoughts. Therefore ſee vvhat Chriſt ſpeaks <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. 38. <hi>Watch &amp; pray, that ye fall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to temptation:</hi> as vvho ſhould ſay, You cannot pray that you may not enter into temptation, you tempt God if you intreat him to do any thing, if you do not vvatch over your ovvn ſouls. Though a man hath no Activity to do any good, yet God vvill have him be vvatchful; if he mean to purifie a man, he vvill make him purifie himſelf; if he mean to keep him from pride, he vvill make his ovvn heart reſiſt pride: therefore <hi>watch, that thou enter not into temptation,</hi> if thou mean to pray to God, not to lead thee into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, <hi>All a mans watching will</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, 'Tis true indeed, unleſſe the Lord<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> keeps a mans ſoul, all a mans watching is nothing. But I tell thee, If thou watcheſt, thou haſt two watchers, thou haſt God to watch over thee, and thy ſelf to watch over thee; thou haſt God to watch over thee, and keep thee in all thy wayes,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93432:50"/>
and then thou watcheſt over thy ſelf, and art ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by God, ſo that thou haſt two watchers, God above, and thy own ſoul within thee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about this work.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Fourth</hi> reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe this is the very</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment</note> 
                  <hi>means preſcribed by God to do us good:</hi> It is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remedy that the Lord of heaven hath appointed unto us to ſave us from danger, and keep us from falling; the Lord hath ſanctified this means to this very end and purpoſe: therefore when our Saviour Chriſt would diſſwade his people from carking and caring for the things of this life, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 36. ſee what means he preſcribeth and layeth down to do it, <hi>Be watchful</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and pray:</hi> the world is ready to get in, <hi>therefore watch</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and pray alwayes, that you may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy to eſcape theſe things:</hi> So that we ſee this the means preſcribed by God himſelf, to eſcape the falling into ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Again, We ſhould be ſo much the<note place="margin">None can Watch for us.</note> more careful in this watch, <hi>becauſe no other can watch for us:</hi> in outward things one man may watch, while another ſleepeth; as in ſailing, when all the reſt are aſleep, there is one watcheth; ſo in war, when all the Souldiers lye in their tents aſleep, it may be ſome few are watching, that the reſt may take their reſt: but it is not ſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our ſouls, one man cannot watch while another man ſleeps, but every man muſt watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his own heart: If we do not watch our own ſouls, we ſhall periſh; and if we do not periſh everlaſtingly, we ſhall have miſerable temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and evils, and many inconveniences we ſhall be expoſed unto.</p>

                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:93432:50"/>But ſome may ſay, <hi>Are not Miniſters to watch</hi>

Thus people would have the Divel put more corn into the hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: they are ſo far from watching for good, that they watch for evil, they deviſe evil upon their beds, as the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> ſpeaks, they are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with the ſpirit of ſlumber, they have eyes and ſee not, they have eares and hear not, hearts and underſtand not; they do not know what

watchfulneſſe is, if they do, they are the leſſe excuſable, becauſe they practice it not, they do not watch and wake unto Prayer, that they may not enter into temptation, but are carried away with the world and ſin.</p>

                  <hi>ſome meaſure;</hi> that we cannot ſay they altogether do not watch, yet <hi>how negligent are they in this duty?</hi> Many Chriſtians are there among us that have ſome goodneſſe in them, yet how doth this duty lye unpractiſed? whence come all the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in our minds, and untowardneſſe in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God? whence comes all unfruitfulneſs in our meetings, and unſettledneſſe in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences? it is becauſe we do not watch: Whence comes it that we are no more ready to good duties? When we are called forth on the ſudden to pray or do any thing for the good of Gods Church and People, that we are ſo unfit to do it, and ſo backward; it is for want of watchfulneſs. Nay, what is the reaſon that we perform not the Worſhip of God in our Families better, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do not watch, the very regenerate themſelves, what a world of miſchief do they do to their own ſouls, for want of this duty of watchfulneſs?

               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:93432:52"/>Firſt, <hi>Count watchfulneſſe your very life,</hi> and<note place="margin">Account watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs our life.</note> think if you let watchfulneſſe go, you let your life go; for if once watchfulneſs go, hovv dead are you in Prayer, and hearing the Word of God? So that the ſecurity of the heart, vvill be the death of the heart; vvherefore if vve vvould go on in vvatching, let us labour to keep this Holy diſpoſition; count it your very lives, and think vvith your ſelves, I let Life go, if I let Watchfulneſſe go. We uſe to ſay of Sleep, that it is the brother of Death, and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 6. vve may ſee the Phraſe uſed by the Apoſtle; vvhere vvaking is put for living, and ſleeping, for dying, that is the meaning of the vvords. So that as ſleep, natural ſleep, doth lively repreſent death; ſo it is vvith Spiritual ſleep, vvhich is the death of the ſoul. Therefore doſt thou find thy ſelf to be out of frame, and not vvatch over thy vvayes? then think vvith thy ſelf that thou art a dead man, and take up thy vvatch as faſt as thou canſt again.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Thou muſt let thy watch ſtand Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholically,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Watching in al things</note> 
                  <hi>univerſally in all duties,</hi> and all times; vvatch thereunto, and perſevere therein; vve muſt not only watch, but Perſevere.

So vve muſt vvatch in all duties; vvhen vve go to Prayer, vve muſt vvatch in prayer; vvhen you go about your Callings, vvatch about them; vvhen vve are alone, vve ſhould be vvatchful; and vvhen vve are in Company, vve ſhould be vvatchful, for the Divel, and our ovvn ſouls, plot a great deal of miſchief againſt us, vve

                  <hi>as the duty is we take in hand,</hi> ſo our vvatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may bee; there is one kind of vvatching for one kind of duty, another for another. If vve be to go about our callings, then our vvatching muſt be againſt diſtruſtfulneſſe, and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and diſtracting cares; that ſo vve may not be over head and ears in the vvorld. If our duty be prayer, vve muſt have an eye to the promiſes, and take hold on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and come in his mediation and his onely. So vvhatſoever duty it be, if it be hearing of the Word of God, there is a vvatchfulneſs to be proportionable to it. A man ſhould think, the vvord vvill do me no good, unleſſe the Lord meet vvith my luſts: I have an unmortified heart, and unleſſe the Lord vvork upon me, I ſhall never lie dovvn under him. Therefore vve ſhould be vvatchful, that vve may practice, and be able to apply vvhatſoever is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to us; vve are to keep a due vvatchfulneſs, for that vvhich is due to one thing is not due to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that vvhich is ſufficient for one, is not for another.<note place="margin">Avoiding hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.</note>

                  <hi>time?</hi> VVhat is the reaſon that many are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comfort, not like the Servants of God, full of horrour, and fear, and quaking? it is becauſe they do not <hi>watch,</hi> as it was with the Five wiſe Virgins, they were ſomething wiſe, not like the fooliſh, but they ſlumbred too; Now when the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom came, there was a cry; they made an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry, and a skrieking, and an howling, they were undone, the bridegroom was come: one would have thought, they ſhould have rejoyced that the bridegroom was come. What godly Chriſtians, and Religious People, when the bridegroom comes to fall a howling and a crying? This was becauſe they ſlumbred, whereas if a man be watchful over his life, and careful to keep an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart, and to honour God, and ſtudy how to die comfortably at laſt, he may rejoyce at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the bridegroom; but becauſe they were in a ſlumber, there was a cry, therefore as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>The end of all things is at hand, therefore be ſober, and watch unto prayer;</hi> the Apoſtle brings this as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo I may ſay, <hi>the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

be at firſt he is ſomething careleſſe, and writes his lines ſomething broad, but when he comes near to the end, and hath a great dea! to write, he writes his lines cloſe, and crowds them together: So now when we are coming towards an end, we cannot look that God ſhould alvvayes ſtrive with us, we ſhould now therefore labour to write cloſe, and to make our Duties thick, and to be enquiring after Grace, whereſoever we come, we think the time is long, but we may juſtly fear it is ſhorter then we imagine; as when an hour-glaſs is almoſt out, a man that ſits below, will think there is a great deal to run, but the ſand is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and is run out before a man is aware; ſo the Lord ſo carries himſelf towards people, that they may think there is a great deal of Patience more, and a great deal of Mercy more to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended towards them, but when all comes to all, they ſhall find it lyes hollow, and will be out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are aware.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer: It is given to the Spirit for Three<note place="margin">Becauſe Chriſt doth it by the ſpirit.</note> Reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe Chriſt doth it by the Spirit:</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:93432:56"/>
Whatſoever Chriſt doth without, he doth it by the Spirit: when he caſt out Divels here upon Earth, he did it by his Spirit; all the outward VVorks that he wrought, he wrought them by his Spirit; and therefore the Spirit is called, <hi>the Finger of God,</hi> Luk. 11. 20. Now if Chriſt do this VVork by his Spirit, if he do Regenerate all his people by his own Spirit, there is reaſon why they ſhould be ſaid to be <hi>born of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Another Reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe though</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Spirit is the bond of union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and Chriſt</note>

               <p>Thirdly, Another Reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Becauſ the ſpirit quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the word wherby we are born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</note>

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93432:56"/>
comes, that makes it fruitful, and that makes it to quicken the heart; and thus you ſee the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words, <hi>That which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here are Two Points:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Spirit of God, or the Holy Ghoſt, Regenerates all the people of God;</hi> whoſoever is born again, is born of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>The Second Point is this, <hi>That all that are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, all that are born of the Spirit, they are Spirit;</hi> that is, they are ſpiritual, they are like the Spirit.</p>
               <p>The Firſt is, <hi>That it is the Spirit of God, the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">That the ſpirit of God doth regenerate all the Saints.</note> 
                  <hi>Holy Ghoſt, that doth Regenerate all the people of God;</hi> this is that which makes them to be new Creatures, to be new men, to be altogether dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that they were before; this is that which doth diſtinguiſh them from themſelves, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as much as white from black; this is that which doth alienate them from the courſes of the world; this is that which doth make them to be ſingular and odde fellows, as if they were of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mould; this makes them lead a different kind of life, and follow a different kind of way from all their neighbors, becauſe the Spirit of God works in them; as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> though <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was born after the fleſh, yet <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born after the Spirit, as the Apoſtle alludes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 23. that is, one took one kind of courſe, the other another; one was born one way, the other another way; the Spirit begat one, the Fleſh the other; and this made <hi>Iſhmael</hi> to perſecute <hi>Iſaac,</hi> becauſe <hi>Iſaac</hi> could not abide his courſes; they were of different Natures and Diſpoſitions,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93432:57"/>
one was born after the Spirit, the other after the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>Now here be <hi>Six Things</hi> I would ſhew unto you:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>What Regeneration is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Why it is ſo called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Wherein it conſiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Reaſons why the Spirit of God only works this work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>How he works it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Laſtly, <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, What Regeneration is:</hi> And it is thus<note place="margin">What Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is.</note> much, namely, <hi>The renewing of the whole man, and by degrees completed after the Image of God in Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> This is Regeneration; and there be Five Things to be opened in it:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That it is the renewing of a man;</hi> It is<note place="margin">A Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> not every change, there may be abundance of changes and alterations, and yet a man for the main may be the ſame man he is; a man may be changed from a Drunkard to be ſober; from an Adulterer to be chaſte; yet ſtill he is the ſame man he was before, though there be changes wrought in him: but Regeneration is the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a man, the making of a man another man, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Old things are paſſed away, and all things are become new:</hi> The Lord doth take away the old frame, and the old affections, and the old inclinations, the old acquaintance, the old courſe and converſation; all theſe things paſſe away, and the Lord puts in new things in the room thereof, till all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new; thus it is in this work, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>According to his mercy he ſaved</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:93432:57"/>
                  <hi>us by the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> the Lord removeth the old rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh, and puts a new fabrick in the room; as a Goldſmith, he takes a veſſel of diſhonour and melts it, and makes it a veſſel of honour; God doth undo the old workmanſhip, and makes a new: as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Create in me, O Lord, a clean heart, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 51. 10. <hi>David</hi> thought he had loſt all, therefore he prayeth to God that he may be new caſt, that he may be taken all to pieces, as a VVatch-maker takes a VVatch that is out of order, he takes it all to pieces, and ſets it together anew again; ſo he prayes God to deal with him, he had loſt all in ſenſe and feeling, and would have God make him a new workmanſhip, it is called the renewing of a man, <hi>Ezek</hi> 11. 19. there is an excellent place, <hi>I will give them a new heart, &amp;c.</hi> The Lord puts out, and he puts in, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven juſt as a Suiſter doth when ſhe works cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, ſhe puts out the cloths own threds, and puts in needle-work; ſo the Lord puts out the old heart, and puts in a new heart; he takes out that which was ſtark naught, and puts in that which is good and agreeable to his mind: the old heart is corrupt, and the old man is ſtark naught, there is nothing good in it; theſe the Lord takes out, and puts in all new: A man is altogether naught and reprobate before; what poor creatures are all people that are not Regenerate, they are all proud, and vain, and fooliſh, and wordly, and earthly, and harden their hearts, and are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of Gods wayes, they have no fear of God before their eyes, they are altogether rotten, how ill-favouredly do they pray? how worldly do they
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93432:58"/>
go on in their callings? how unfruitfully do they come to Church? they are all rotten and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory, they do nothing that right is; now when the Spirit of God doth make them up, he puts out all old things, and makes them new. This is the Firſt thing, <hi>Regeneration, is the renewing of a man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>As it is the renewing of a man,</hi> ſo <hi>it</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the whole man</note> 
                  <hi>is the renewing of the whole man:</hi> It is not only in ſome things, for <hi>Saul</hi> was another man in ſome ſenſe; but Regeneration is <hi>the renewing of the whole man,</hi> as the Appoſtle ſaith, <hi>The God of peace ſanctifie you throughout, in body, ſoul, and Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 23. it is a work upon the whole man; our Saviour Chriſt compares it to leaven, which a woman took and leavened the whole Lump: It is like unto Original ſin, as Original ſin infects the whole man; ſo Regeneration doth repair and renew the whole man; it is as general and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, as original ſin: the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodneſſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>It is in all goodneſſe;</hi> in the goodneſſe of a mans mind, and in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a mans affections, in the goodneſſe of the inclination and diſpoſition, in the goodneſſe of the whole man; <hi>the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodneſs;</hi> indeed it begins in the goodneſſe of the mind, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 23. <hi>Be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the Spirit of your minds:</hi> Where he calls upon them for this new work; <hi>Put off the old man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and be renewed in the Spirit of your minds;</hi> that is the Firſt thing, when a man hath a new mind given unto him, a new know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge put into his underſtanding, a man is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in knowledge, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. This is the firſt
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93432:58"/>
thing, when God reneweth a mans knowledge and apprehenſion of things, when a man begins to know the plagues of his own heart, and the evils of all his own wayes, now a man begins to ſee through theſe things, and now he begins to ſee the wayes of God; and to dive deep beneath the irkſomneſſe of them, to know the amiableneſſe of them, the ſweetneſſe of them: the delights of them are hidden from a man, ſo long as he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate; but when God doth begin to rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate a man, now he begins to diſcover them to him, that a man ſeeth what they are: he could ſay before that the wayes of God were good, but he could never taſte and find them ſo; but when a man is renewed, now he ſeeth the luſtre and amiableneſſe of them: ſo alſo, he ſeeth the uglineſſe of ſin, this was covered before, ſin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the heart, and carried him after it; but now ſin begins to be laid ſtark naked, and a man ſeeth the deformity of it, here begins Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the mind; for the underſtanding is the key of the Soul, the key of all the Faculties of the Soul, it is like a ſluce or flood-gate, pull up that, and the water goes out and runs all abroad; ſo when the Lord doth pluck up this ſluce, and lift up a mans heart, and mind, and underſtanding: now the waters of life flow into the ſoul: this is againſt them now, that have plenty of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and yet notwithſtanding go no further, that have new minds, and old wills and affections, there is a new brain, but an old heart; this is not regeneration, regeneration (it is true) begins in the underſtanding, but it runs along in all the ſoul, it deſcends into heart and mind, and all the whole
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93432:59"/>
man; and therefore it is called a new creature; whoſoever is in Chriſt is a new creature; <hi>Behold, I make all things new,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 5. As <hi>Regeneration is the renewing of a man,</hi> ſo <hi>it is the renewing of the whole man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is done by degrees:</hi> Though Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation<note place="margin">By degrees perfected.</note> be in all parts, yet it is not in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees at once; the ſpirit of God doth renew more and more, and beget a man more and more; there is of the old birth a great while, but he doth eat it out more and more, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>And we all with open face, &amp;c.</hi> Mark here, he calls this change glory, becauſe it is a glorious creature; as long as a man is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, he is a baſe creature; but when he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, he is a glorious creature: Now ſaith he, when the Lord doth this, he doth it from glory to glory, from one degree to another; as this is done by the ſpirit of God, ſo he doth it more; he proceeds from little beginnings to greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; it was not ſo with <hi>Adam,</hi> God made him in his full ſtature at the firſt, he was a man at the firſt daſh; but this new creature, is as a Babe conceived in the VVomb, it begins there, and ſo grows up; <hi>As new born babes deſire the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere milk of the Word.</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 2. He is a babe firſt, and ſo growes, though it be not a ſtarve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling but grovvs, yet it is but a vveak one at firſt, and muſt grovv and come to its ſtrength more and more: it is like a good husband that begins vvith a little, and ariſeth up to a great eſtate in the end; ſo Regeneration, makes a man a good husband; puts a little ſtock into his hands, and makes him riſe to a great matter.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>God:</hi> It is not all kind of Renewing: A man may have a new work that he had not before; but the work of regeneration, as it is a renewing, ſo it is a <hi>renewing after the image of God;</hi> man had quite and clean loſt the Image of God, which conſiſted in Righteouſneſs and Holineſs; Now when Gods Spirit comes to regenerate a man, that reneweth him according to this Image: As the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>That ye put on the new man which is created after his image:</hi> and how is that? In <hi>Righteouſneſs and Holineſs.</hi> As it is in Nature, though a man be never ſo godly when he begets a man, he begets him after his image, as he is by nature polluted and unclean: <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 3.

When a man is regenerate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation puts a frame into a mans heart to be like unto Chriſt, and to follow his ſteps, and his example, that as he hath done, ſo he may do more and more: this is the work of regeneration, <hi>That the Spirit of God works in Gods people, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them to the Image of Chriſt:</hi> Yea, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation doth more than repair a man, more than reduce a man to that eſtate wherein he was in <hi>Adam</hi>'s loins before the Fall; it is the ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a man into Chriſt, and the eſtating a man into the Merits and Priviledges of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it is a greater matter, then the bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of a man to that which he loſt, it is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of a man to a better eſtate; this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences it from Sanctification. Thus we ſee what Regeneration is.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Why called Regeneration.</note> Why this ſame bleſſed work of the renewing of the whole man after the Image of God in Chriſt Jeſus is called Regeneration. There be Two Reaſons of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:93432:60"/>Firſt, <hi>To ſhew us how marvellouſly we are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">To ſhew the great Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nature.</note> 
                  <hi>by Nature:</hi> Until the Spirit of God take us in hand, a man is quite rotten, there is no ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe left, there is nothing in him will ſerve, it is not a little melting will ſerve the turn, it is not a little plaiſtering, or patching, or piecing will do the deed: though there be a thouſand changes in a man, yet if a man be not another man, if he be not a new creature, it is to no effect, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bring a man into the kingdom of God; what ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God:</hi> As who ſhould ſay, Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, a man is all to ſhatters, all to pieces, all rotten, and unleſſe he be born again, and made a new creature, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible he ſhould enter into the kingdom of God; though a man be never ſo much altered, he is not in the eſtate of Grace till he be a new man, till the Lord hath given him a new frame, and a new inclination: except a man be born again, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the kingdom of God, he cannot ſee the kingdom of Grace: that is the firſt dowry of the kingdom of Grace, to give a man a new Being that he never had before: a natural man is juſt like an old rotten houſe, that hath not one piece that will ſerve the turn; but a man that will make it an habitable houſe, muſt take it all down to the ground, and build it up from the ground: ſo it is here, there is not one piece will ſerve the turn; though ye ſee admirable things in men, though they ſeem excellent in the eyes of men, yet they will not ſerve the turn, they are rotten and ſtark naught; there is <hi>an abſence of all Good,</hi> Rom. 7. 18.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93432:61"/>
Nay beſides, there is an univerſal indiſpoſition in a man, like to a thing that is all rotten and marred, and can never be made up again, except it be made ſpick and ſpan new; and ſo it is with a man, he is altogether corrupt, as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa. 1. from the ſole of the foot, to the crown of the head, nothing but bruiſes and putrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoars;</hi> take a man that is never ſo civil, and of fair carriage, ſo long as he is not a new creature, this is nothing for the entring into the kingdom of God, and being amiable in his ſight: Nay, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. the Text ſaith, <hi>The thoughts of the heart of man are only evil continually,</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſound in a man, though he daily think of Grace, and think of God, his thoughts cannot be ſaid to be good, for the mind whereby he thinks of theſe things is rotten, and unſavory; though he ſpeaks of never ſo good things, the ſame things the Saints of God ſpeak of; though he doth the ſame actions the people of God do; though he hears the ſame VVord, and receive the ſame Sacraments, he cannot do them aright, they are abomination in Gods ſight, therefore when God regenerates a man, he muſt make him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man then he was before. This ſpeaks natures corruption.<note place="margin">The work well expreſſed by the Name</note>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe the things of Regeneration are admirably ſet out by way of this ſimilitude:</hi> Natural Generation is generally, ſweetly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in this VVork of Regeneration.</p>

               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Again,</hi> As it is in the firſt Birth, <hi>A</hi>
                  <note place="margin">New Kindred follows both.</note>

Indeed here is the difference, that the Children of the firſt Birth they are viſible, and their lives and courſes are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and their alliance and kindred is viſible, and all that they are and do is viſible; but the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the ſecond Birth are not viſible: indeed their perſons are viſible as well as others, but their life is an inviſible thing; their excellency, their glory, this new creature in them, this is inviſible, it is like that River in Spain, which runs

               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Third Thing</hi> is, <hi>Wherein this bleſſed</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wherein Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth.</note> 
                  <hi>Work doth conſiſt:</hi> and it conſiſts in Two Things, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. The Evangeliſt ſaith, <hi>To as many as received him, he gave power to become the Sons of God.</hi> Here be Two Things, and both theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation conſiſts of:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> A Paſſive receiving of Chriſt, <hi>Whoſoever receives him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> An Active Title to God, as to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>They have power to become the Sons of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>A Paſſive receiving of Chriſt;</hi> To as<note place="margin">Paſſive recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt.</note> many as <hi>received him:</hi> for he came to his own and they received him not; his own, even his own Elect, would not receive him, till he made them receive him; but <hi>as many as received him,</hi> as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as were made paſſively to receive him, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him alſo actively: ſo that this word implyes
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93432:63"/>
the Paſſive receiving of Chriſt; for there is none can receive any thing, except it be given him from above, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 27. That is, except there be firſt a paſſive reception of it: It is a ſtrange phraſe, <hi>No man can receive Chriſt, till Chriſt is firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him;</hi> he can never take Chriſt, till Chriſt come into him, till Chriſt ingraft himſelf into him, and him into Chriſt; this is an act of God, it is a paſſive receiving of Chriſt: the reaſon is, becauſe all the Graces, and all the Activity of Gods people flowes from this, their Faith, and all; for Faith is an act, which receives from the paſſive receiving of Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to the <hi>Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, As you have received Chriſt, ſo walk in him;</hi> Faith receives Chriſt, that is an active receiving of Chriſt, but there was a paſſive receiving of Chriſt firſt; for a man is in Chriſt firſt in a paſſive manner, before he is in him in an active manner, Chriſt hath taken him already, before he can take Chriſt actually: This is the firſt Thing wherein this work of Regeneration conſiſts, <hi>The Paſſive receiving of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It conſiſts in having an active power</hi>

                     </gap>itle to become a Son of God;</hi> together with Jeſus Chriſt; Theſe are the Two Things wherein Regeneration conſiſts. I know many Divines branch it otherwiſe, and make Regeneration to conſiſt otherwiſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Of Mortification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of Vivification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Of Mortification: Whereby the Spirit kills the Luſts of the Fleſh more, as <hi>Rom. 8. 13. If ye live after the Fleſh ye ſhall die, but if ye through the Spirit mortifie the deeds of the Fleſh,</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:93432:63"/>
                  <hi>ye ſhall live:</hi> Mark; here is Mortification, and it is done by the Spirit; if you through the ſpirit mortifie the deeds of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is Vivification; that is, when a man doth not only die unto ſin, but riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to a new life, <hi>Rom. 6. 11. Likewiſe reckon ye your ſelves to be dead unto ſin, but alive unto God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> This is the other work of Vivification, when a man is made alive unto God, and is made able by the ſpirit of God to be alive unto God, and to wind himſelf out of death into life, by the ſpirit of the holy One. Theſe be the Two Parts whereof many Divines make Regeneration to conſiſt of; but though they beat at the ſame thing, yet I rather make them the Effects and Conſequents of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as flowing from Regeneration; this paſſive work goeth before, a man never goeth on in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the works of the Fleſh, and never raiſeth himſelf up to this heavenly life till he be Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; ſo that regeneration is the firſt ingrafting of a man into Chriſt, whereby he is alive, that he may do all theſe things; it is a power put into him wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may believe &amp; repent, ſo that Believing, and Repentance, and Mortification, and Vivification are acts of the new creature; a man muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be a new creature firſt, now this is by Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, ſo that Regeneration conſiſts only of theſe Two Things: Firſt, <hi>Of a paſſive receiving of Chriſt the Son of God.</hi> Secondly, <hi>In having a title to be the Son of God;</hi> and Regeneration doth not only bring <hi>a relative change,</hi> but <hi>a real change</hi> to a man: If you would know the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the phraſe, A <hi>relative change</hi> is this, when
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93432:64"/>
there is a change in a man, from that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but the change doth not lye in a man, as the change of Juſtification: before he was not Juſtified, now he is Juſtified, the man is changed, but he is not changed in himſelf, but it ſtands on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Gods imputation; he is not juſt in himſelf, but by imputation juſt. Now the <hi>real change</hi> is, when God doth purifie and make up the defects in a man more and more, that is a <hi>real change;</hi> ſo that I ſay, Regeneration is not only a <hi>relative change,</hi> whereby God accounts a man as a child; but it breeds a <hi>real change</hi> in a man, it gives a man a ſpiritual Being; for the Spirit of God when it comes to work this work, is a fruitful principle of all good in that man more and more: Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The fruits of the Spirit, are joy, peace, long-ſuffering, &amp;c.</hi> Gal. 5. 22. 'Tis true, the Spirit doth not bring forth theſe Graces till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a man is regenerate, but by working that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, which makes the ſoul to bring forth theſe fruits, and making the heart an honeſt heart, and ſo a good ground to bring forth theſe ſeeds; the Spirit is a fruitful principle of all good in that man. Thus you ſee the Third Thing, <hi>viz. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Regeneration conſiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Fourth Thing</hi> is the Reaſons of this<note place="margin">Reaſons why the Spirit work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Point, <hi>Why the Spirit of God doth work this work of Regeneration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt Reaſon</hi> is, <hi>Becauſe it is meerly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It is the good pleaſure of God</note> 
                  <hi>to the Will of God:</hi> Man hath no power at all, man hath no activity, it is meerly at the pleaſure of God, whether he will do it or no; <hi>Jam. 1. 18. Of his own Will begat he us;</hi> he only had an hand in it, he only did it, and it was meerly at his good
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93432:64"/>
Will and Pleaſure, he might have choſen whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would have done it or no; it is no fruit of our liberty, it is no brood of our breeding, it is meerly the free act of God in a man, <hi>Joh. 6. 44. No man cometh to me except the Father draweth him;</hi> There Chriſt ſheweth it, this bringing of a man to be in Chriſt, it cannot be from any man, <hi>except the Father draw him;</hi> except he ſend forth his heavenly Spirit, he can never come to Chriſt; all our ſufficiency is from God, we cannot ſo much as think a good thought, we cannot renew our thoughts, we cannot renew our inclinations, or our wills, or our affections; we can do nothing of our ſelves, it is only his work; therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is ſuch a ſpecial work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it muſt be only the Spirit of God that muſt work it; it is a glorious work, a ſupernatural work; this new Birth, is ſuch a Birth as comes from above, <hi>Pſal. 110. 3. Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith the text, that is, all that are born of God, they are brought forth in the day of Gods power, in the day wherein God is pleaſed to put forth his power in them; therefore they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>ſeed of Chriſt,</hi> Iſa. 53. 10. They are <hi>his ſeed,</hi> but unleſs he begets them by his Spirit, they can never be ſo; Therefore if we conſider the greatneſs of the work, it ſheweth plainly, it muſt needs be the effect of the Will of God, and his good Pleaſure towards man, and therefore muſt be wrought by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another <hi>Reaſon</hi> is, <hi>Becauſe it is not</hi>
                  <note place="margin">No other agent can do it.</note> 
                  <hi>a work of this world:</hi> It is a work of another world, it is none of the creatures of this life, it is beyond the ſphere of the activity of any natural

agent, they cannot reach it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Which were born not of the will of the fleſh, nor of bloud, &amp;c.</hi> It is not of mans Will, he cannot ſo much as Will it, or Deſire it effectually, he cannot wiſh it truly, nay, his heart had rather have the world; nay, ſaith he, It is not of the Will of the Fleſh, that is, a man may go and beget another Child in the world, becauſe it is of the Will of the Fleſh, it is in the power of the Will of the Fleſh, Gods power going along with him, but this is not ſo, whatſoever a man be, though he hath never ſo many excellent parts, it is not in the Will of the Fleſh to do it: Then again, it is not of Bloud, it is no terrene or earthly thing, this new creature is otherwiſe made, than any new creature in the world beſides, therefore he concludes, it is only born of God, it is God only that is the great Author of this great work, it deſcends down meerly from above.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Becauſe</hi> it is ſo far from being<note place="margin">Man is totally againſt it of himſelf.</note> wrought by any power in man, or any counſel in man, or any endeavours in man, it is ſo far from that, as <hi>that a man is totally againſt it;</hi> A man is an enemy unto it, a man hath reluctancy and repugnancy againſt it, he would not be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; when a man doth think he deſires heaven, and to be regenerated of God, he doth apprehend Regeneration in a wrong way, and heaven in a wrong way, ſo as he apprehends it, he doth Will it; he thinks of heaven as of a fine place, and a place full of pleaſure, and therefore deſires it, but that he ſhould alwayes be with God, that he ſhould alwayes be prayſing and thinking of God, and minding of God, and have his heart weaned
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93432:65"/>
from all other things, and ſet it on God, this is heaven, but he hates theſe things, and ſo hates heaven, ſo he Wills that which he apprehends to be Regeneration; but Regeneration, is when a man hath a new heart, and when he is a new man: he was wordly before, but he is now brought to be ſpiritual, he was proud before, but he is now come to be humble, but the heart cannot abide this, therefore let the Lord fling in abundance of throws into a natural mans heart, to begin ſome preparatory work this way, to make a man begin to look out towards heaven, he flings all away, he is weary of them quickly; as a man at a Sermon, perhaps may have throws concerning the new Birth, but the corruption of his heart will throw all way, he cannot endure them, they are contrary to the corruption of a mans nature; nay, when God comes to work upon his own people, what a deal of pleading is there with the world, the fleſh, and the Divel, that they may not be caſt out: Therefore when <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw that through the grace and power of God, this work was wrought in thoſe he wrote unto, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. Mark how he ſpeaks, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again to a lively hope, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead:</hi> He lifts up his hands to heaven, and bleſſeth God that ever this work was wrought; he ſaw ſo much adoe, and ſuch a ſtir, and ſuch a deal of oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; this is a plain ſign that it is not of man, it is <hi>not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God which ſheweth mercy,</hi> Rom. 9. 16. Neither can man Will, neither can he run, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93432:66"/>
go, nor ſtir towards it; nay, though God make him go, how apt is he to laggar in the way, and draw back again? So you ſee the Fourth Thing, <hi>Why it muſt needs be the Spirits Work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Fifth Thing</hi> is, <hi>How the Spirit of God</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How the Spirit worketh Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</note> 
                  <hi>works this Work.</hi> It is after an unſpeakable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Who can declare the noble acts of the Lord? The works of God in Nature are marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. <hi>David</hi> himſelf, when he looked upon his natural Birth, the Conception of him in the Womb of his Mother, he wondered at it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 14. That was a wonderful work, how much more is this unſpeakable, and unutterable? as it is ſaid of our Saviour Chriſt, Who can declare his generations? So may I ſay in a lower ſenſe, of this Work, Who can declare this Regeneration of his people? But yet thus far the Scripture doth au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize, and warrant us to go.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That he doth it by the word of Life;</hi> By<note place="margin">By the Word of Life.</note> the Goſpel of Salvation, by the Preaching of it, or otherwiſe according as he pleaſeth, that is the immortal ſeed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>Being born again, not of corruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, &amp;c.</hi> And as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, Though you have ten thouſand inſtructers, yet you have not many Fathers, for in Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you through the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 15. As who ſhould ſay, You are begotten and born again, and you are born again by the Word, and I was an inſtrument under God of your new Birth, by the Word which I have Preached among you; and therefore, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 2. he calls <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, His own Son;</hi> So <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 4. he calls him,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93432:66"/>
                  <hi>His Son in the Faith:</hi> that is, he was an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Father under God, by the Doctrine of Faith, to bring him to be a Child of God: ſo that I ſay it is done by the Word, <hi>Of his own Will hath he begotten us by the Word of truth,</hi> Jam. 1. 18. The Spirit of the Lord ſanctifies the Word when he is pleaſed to convert a man, the Word ſhall ſhew him what a miſerable creature he is by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it ſheweth him that fleſh and bloud cannot enter into the kingdom of God; it ſheweth him that he is utterly forlorn in himſelf, and paſt all recovery, and ſhews him where life is to be had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely, in Jeſus Chriſt, diſcovering his worth, and excellency, and neceſſity, and that all Grace and good is in him, and ſhews him the freedom of this gracious offer: Thus the Spirit of God, when he propounds the Word to the ſoul, holds it before the eyes and conſcience, and ſanctifies it, and puts a power into it, to enter deep into the ſoul, that it may Conceive in the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Lord doth it by an unſpeakable</hi>
                  <note place="margin">By a ſecret and ſupernatural power.</note> 
                  <hi>working:</hi> There is a Divine work which the Lord worketh; The ſpirit comes into the ſoul after the manner of water; as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>Except a man be born again of water and the holy Ghoſt, &amp;c.</hi> that is, unleſs he be born of the ſpirit, which worketh in the ſpirit of a man, as water doth in working upon a foul thing. Now what this work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is we cannot tell; but we can tell you the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it: whereas the ſoul was rotten and naught before, and impotent to all good; now it begins to have a better diſpoſition and a new power: and whereas it did ſavour of the things of this life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, now it ſavours of the things that are above:
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93432:67"/>
but this is a ſecret kind of working in the ſoul, therefore it is called the waſhing, and the laver of it: And the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> what miſerable creatures they were before Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, he named Drunkards, Idolaters, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, &amp;c. and all manner of filthy perſons, <hi>Such were ſome of you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>before your Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but now you are waſhed, and juſtified, and ſanctified in the Name of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11. That ſame waſhing there, he means by that you are Regenerated; ſo that Regeneration, it is a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, an unſpeakable kind of waſhing of the ſoul by the holy Ghoſt, whereby the ſoul hath its Corruption waſhed from it in part, and made clean in part, and way made for all the Graces of Gods ſpirit to come in now, and all the fruits of the ſpirit to be brought forth: Thus the Spirit of God works this work, he works it in an ineffable manner by the word of Life and by a ſecret kind of waſhing.</p>
               <p>I come now to the <hi>Application</hi> of this Point:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. Of Confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, &amp;c.</note> And firſt of all, If the Spirit of God be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generater of Gods people, <hi>then we may here ſee the errour of the Papiſts, Pelagians, and others;</hi> That ſet up the Will of man, and put any activity in the Reaſon, and Judgement, and Wiſdom, and Election of man; This Doctrine of theirs is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, and contrary to the working of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit: If it be ſuch a work as God ſends his own Spirit to do it; What man can do it? It is called Regeneration, and this ſhews it is not of man: who is able to beget himſelf, and ſhape himſelf in the womb, and diſpoſe of his own body in the belly? Nay more, Can any man beget
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93432:67"/>
himſelf again? The very name of <hi>again,</hi> ſhews that it is a work only of God, none but he can do it; and we ſee it plainly, it is wrought no where, but where God himſelf doth it, and they that have it are able to ſpeak it, that they did not chuſe God, but God choſe them; <hi>I was found of them that ſought me not;</hi> all the ſouls of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will ſubſcribe, That <hi>it was not in them that willed, or in them that ran, but in God that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mercy:</hi> It is God only that is the Author of this thing, and none but he.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Again, This ſhould teach us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Information.</hi> Of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual need of the Spirit.</note> that we have alwayes need of the Spirit of God: If the Spirit of God hath begotten us again, then we have alwayes need of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is not in this as in the firſt Birth; when the Child is born, though the Father be gone, the Child may ſubſiſt; but it is not ſo here: but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God as he begets a man, ſo he is fain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to ſtand by him and bear him up, and give him ſupplies of Grace from day to day: as it is with the Air, the Sun doth not only enlighten it, but it doth every moment give light to it: for ſuppoſe the Sun ſhould ſhine four or five hours in the day, yet if the Sun ſhould with-hold its light, the Air would be dark preſently; it is not as it is with Fire, let a man heat the water, though he take away the Fire, the water will keep its heat a while after; but do but with-hold the light of the Sun, and all is gone in the ſame moment; ſo it is with this new Creature and the Spirit of God, he doth dwell in the ſoul, as the Sun in the Air; his preſence warms the ſoul, and quickens the ſoul, and inables a man to good, and gives a principle
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93432:68"/>
of life, and enables to all actions that are good; therefore how ſhould all Gods people carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves towards this Spirit? They ſhould have a care that they quench him not, nor go againſt him in any particular.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is for all Gods people, in whom<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exhortation</hi> 1. Not to grieve the Spirit.</note> God hath wrought this bleſſed work; the Spirit of God hath regenerated and begotten them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. I ſay to all ſuch perſons, <hi>Let them endear this Spirit of God, let them not grieve, or offend, or diſpleaſe him,</hi> ſeeing he is ſuch a gracious worker in them: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13. The Apoſtle makes this very Inference, <hi>in whom after ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved ye were ſealed by the holy Spirit of Promiſe:</hi> that is, whereby you were Regenerated; Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is the firſt ſeal of the Spirit, whereby he ſeals Gods good will to a man. Now, hath the Spirit of God ſealed you? Then do not grieve him, nor cauſe him to take any indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you; for though he will never depart from them, whom he hath made new Creatures, yet notwithſtanding he may hide his face for a time if we diſpleaſe him. Yea, Conſider, Will any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Child willingly diſpleaſe his loving Father? The Spirit of God is thy Father, therefore we ſhould have reſpect to him.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>This ſhould be a Motive to Gods people,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. To do any thing for God.</note> 
                  <hi>to be willing to do any thing for God;</hi> becauſe <hi>he hath made them,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100. 3. This very Conſideration, That <hi>God hath made us,</hi> and re-made us, he hath done that for us that all our own wits could never have done, that the whole world hath not the like (the Lord gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally lets the whole World ſink in ruine
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93432:68"/>
and damnation) ſhould be a Motive to you, to be willing to ſerve him gladly, and to call upon his Name, to be ready preſt to execute any of his Commands, to enter into his preſence upon all occaſions, ſeeing it is he that hath made us, and not we our ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To them that are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregenerated:</hi> Here we ſee<note place="margin">3. To the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate to pray for the Spirit.</note> where to have Regeneration; it is only in God, and in the Spirit of God, to renew a man, and make a man up again: as <hi>David</hi> prayed when he had the Spirit, <hi>Lord, take not thy holy Spirit from me,</hi> Pſal. 51. 11. So when a man hath not the Spirit of God, he ſhould pray to God, <hi>Lord, Give thy holy Spirit to me, and ſend down thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit into my heart, that may work this work in me.</hi> But it may be many of you will think that you expect this, and deſire it, and wiſh it, and uſe ſome means. I Anſwer, Then ſhew it by thy coming unto God for it, from day to day; will any man ſay, That <hi>Noah</hi> did expect that God ſhould deliver him from the Deluge, if he had not took that courſe which God appointed? If he had not built an Ark, certainly we may juſtly ſay, That he did not look that God would deliver him. Therefore it is ſaid of <hi>Noah,</hi> That as he did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that God ſhould keep him; <hi>ſo being warned of God, he built an Ark, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 11. 7. So when a man ſhall ſay, That he looks that God ſhould deliver him from his natural eſtate and condition, that God ſhould renew him, by his Grace and goodneſs, yet if a man will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare an Ark: if when a man is Commanded and directed by God what to do, yet he will not come to God, to do that which ſhould be done for him,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93432:69"/>
theſe men do but deceive their own ſouls, and treaſure up indignation againſt themſelves. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the ſtory of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 14. when the Children of Iſrael were in <hi>Pi-hahiroth,</hi> and the Egyptians were behind them, and the Mountains were on the ſide that they could not paſs, and the Sea was before them, and there was notable crying out, Oh! that God would deliver them, now they were dead men, the Egyptians were come out to deſtroy them, the Mountains were on the ſide, and the Sea before them: Now mark what an Anſwer God gives to their cry; cauſe the people to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, you keep a crying to me, I pray go forward, you are not yet at the red ſea, but go to the red ſea, and when you are there, then cry to me; you are idleing, and lazing, and miſtruſting me; though the red Sea be before them, yet cauſe them to come thither, and when they are there, then cry for help to me: So thou ſayeſt thou deſireſt that God would Regenerate thee, and quicken thee, and turn thy heart, &amp; vouchſafe thee his holy Spirit, do you ſo? I ſay it is very well, the thing is very good, but if the deſire be ſincere, you will take that courſe God bids you, art thou come to the utmoſt difficulty? Are not many things to be done which thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeſt to do? Muſt thou not ſeek God, more and more carefully? Go forward, go forward, if thou meaneſt to have help and aid from God, otherwiſe it is in vain: if thou wouldſt go on in the wayes of God, and do what God Commands thee, thou ſhouldſt be quickened and renewed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Another <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is for Examination:<note place="margin">Of <hi>Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, or no.</note> 
                  <hi>To examine our ſelves whether the Word of God hath wrought this for us, yea or no.</hi> And the firſt
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93432:69"/>
ſign is this, If thou beeſt born again, if thou haſt<note place="margin">Firſt <hi>Signe,</hi> When doing good is natural<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> this new Nature, then it is natural to thee to do good duties, to follow good courſes, and to yield obedience to the commandements of God; it is not enough for a man to do good duties: a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man, an unregenerate man may do them, but whether is it natural to thee? A proud man may do the actions of humility, a proud man may pull off his Hat, and give the time of the day, and ſpeak meanly of himſelf; a proud man may ſuffer another to do him wrong, and put up baſe language, he may do theſe things, but the man is a proud man ſtill, he hath no humble nature; but the queſtion is, whether it be thy nature to do this? May be thou doſt theſe things for fear, or ſome by-reſpects: A worldly man may ſpeak of heavenly things, but is thy nature heavenly? A man may think of God, but is thy nature godly? Here is the thing, If a man be regenerate, there is Grace got into a mans nature, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. when God regenerates his people, he ſaith, <hi>He will write his laws in their inward parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> he doth not only ſay they ſhall do theſe duties, but their very hearts ſhall carry them, their very hearts ſhall go to a Sermon, their very ſouls ſhall go about the duties of God; as it is with the fire, water may heat, but not by nature; but it is the nature of fire to heat: So if a man be Regenerate, it is natural to him to do good duties, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>A man by nature may do the things commanded in the Law:</hi> but here is the queſtion, Whether he doth them with this new nature, this heavenly nature? The old creature may hear, and pray, and be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and moral, for by nature the Heathen did
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93432:70"/>
the things contained in the Law: But if a man be Regenerated, as he doth the things contained in the Law and Goſpel, ſo he doth them with a new nature; as <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 29. when the Children of Iſrael had ſpoken admirable ſpeeches; <hi>All that the Lord ſaith to us we will do;</hi> they made good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſions: now mark what God ſaith, <hi>Oh that there were an heart in this people to keep my commandments!</hi> As who ſhould ſay, Theſe are very good words, and I know that you think what you ſpeak; but Oh that this were written in your hearts, that this were natural to you; this will not hold, your hearts are not carried this way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the Spirit of God hath Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">The heart's a good ſoil for Grace.</note> a man, then <hi>the heart begins to be a good ſoyl for Grace,</hi> and the heart begins to be ſutable, ſo that the heart is fit for Grace; A natural heart is not a proper ſoyl for Grace: As if a man ſhould bring a Plant from <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſet it here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it cannot thrive, unleſſe a man meet with a ſoyl that is fit for it: So Grace, if it come into the heart, and the heart is not a ſoyl for it, it can never thrive there, unleſſe the heart be Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and unleſſe there be a new nature: there may be admirable things in a natural man, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent good purpoſes, and reſolutions; God may come to him, as a Paſſenger that lodgeth for a night, but he is gone the next morning; he may come as a ſojourner, to endure for a while, but here is no dwelling for him, theſe reſolutions, and purpoſes, and deſires cannot laſt long, that heart will ſquander them away; it is like the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a new piece into an old garment, <hi>Matth.</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:93432:70"/>
9. 16. When a man puts a new piece into an old garment, a fine new purpoſe into an old heart, a new good deſire into an old mind, the rent will be worſe, for that man will return back again, and will have his luſts, and will be worſe then he was before, for the heart is not able to hold theſe: 'tis true, in the beſt hearts of Gods people, is a great deal of unnatural ſoyl for Grace; but there is ſome of this good new ſoyl, that Grace now can hold, and ſhall hold, ſo that the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail; it is not for any goodneſſe of the heart, but for the goodneſſe of Grace in the heart: there may be tranſient acts of goodneſſe in a wicked man, as Prayer, and ſuch-like tranſient acts; but when the tranſient act is done, there is a concluſion: but nature is permanent and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during thing, it is not only to come to Prayer, and then be dead; to come to a Sermon, and then be dead; but it is a permanent thing, a man is godly between Prayer and Prayer, and religious between Sermon and Sermon, and in all his wayes he ſets himſelf to be good, and well diſpoſed all his dayes. God complains againſt thoſe that give him tranſient acts of goodneſſe, <hi>Oh Ephraim! what ſhall I do to thee, that art as a morning cloud, &amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the Spirit of God hath made a<note place="margin">He cannot live in Sin.</note> man a new nature, <hi>then he cannot live in ſin,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>He that is born of God, ſinneth not, &amp;c.</hi> he is born of God, and it is againſt his nature to go on in ſin; a man cannot go againſt his nature; 'tis true, a man for a little time may go againſt his nature, as <hi>Moſes</hi> though his nature was mild and meek, yet he was tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93432:71"/>
very much, Hear ye rebels, and ſhall I bring water out of this rock? he was carried away in his paſſion, but he could not hold on in that ſtrain, for it was againſt his nature; ſo if a man be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome with any other ſin, yet when a man is renewed, as a Spring clears it ſelf of the mud, ſo this new nature is ſo oppoſite and contrary to ſin, that he cannot go on in ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If the Spirit of God hath wrought<note place="margin">It is pleaſant to do the will of God.</note> this work in thee, <hi>then it is pleaſant to thee to do the will of God;</hi> Look what a man is naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to, it is marvellous pleaſant to him to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it: As for example, If a mans nature be gluttonous, how pleaſing is it for him to ſatisfie his Appetite? And if a mans nature be given to Intemperance, how pleaſing is Exceſs unto him? And if a mans nature be proud, how pleaſing is it to be flattered, and ſpoken fair, to be reverenced and reſpected at every word? A man loves theſe things a-life, becauſe they ſuit with his nature: So if a man have a new nature, and partakes of the divine nature, how pleaſing will Prayer be? And how pleaſing will the Word be? how pleaſing will Counſels and Exhortations be? how pleaſing to be corrected and reproved for ſin? <hi>How ſweet are thy words unto my mouth,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. 103. As our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Joh. 4. 34. It is my meat and drink to do his Will that ſent me:</hi> So <hi>I have longed for thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>I have loved to know where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I might glorifie thee, and be ſerviceable to thee:</hi> Now when it is irkſom for a man to obey, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide ſtrictneſs and preciſeneſs, and he counts it a diſgrace to him to deny himſelf in ſuch a thing,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93432:71"/>
and he goeth to duty like a Bear to the Stake, and he hath no forwardneſſe, it is a ſign he hath no new nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If a man be born again, Grace will<note place="margin">Grace gets the upper hand.</note> get the upper hand; when a man meets with luſts, and concupiſcence of Soul, though they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly bear a man down for a time, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a man beyond himſelf, yet in the end Grace will have the victory and prevail, 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 4. He that is born of God, overcomes the world,</hi> all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the world, all pul-backs and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backs, he that is born of God, he will have the myſtery; ſo 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 18. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The wicked one cannot touch a man that is born of God,</hi> that is, with a deadly touch, as he toucheth wicked men; he toucheth wicked men ſo, as he infects them, and poyſons them, and carries them away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> He that is born of God, <hi>he is one that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He loves the people of God.</note> 
                  <hi>loves the Children of God:</hi> If there be any Saint in the pariſh, any Child of God, there is his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and bowels moſt; I ſpeak of ſpiritual af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, for otherwiſe Grace doth not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way nature, but ſet it up, having refin'd it. But I ſpeak of ſpiritual love, if a man be born of God himſelf, he loves all others that are born of God, 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 1. Whoſoever believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God; and he that loveth him that begat, loveth him alſo that is begotten.</hi> If a man loves God that begets, he muſt needs love them that are begotten of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If a man be born again, <hi>then a man</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He loves Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to profit others.</note> 
                  <hi>labours to do good, and to spread the Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, to the glory of God:</hi> He loves to be communicating that he hath; he that hath this
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93432:72"/>
Spirit, loves to be breathing upon others, and would fain ſeatter his ſweet things up and down where he goeth, and would fain leave a ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of himſelf whereſoever he comes; this is the nature of him that is born again and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, to beget others: That man is unworthy to be born, by whom another is not born, as we ſay; when a man is born again, he labours to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get others to God, to be generative, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and abundant in doing good up and down, he labours to beget his Children, and Family, to God; and to draw his neighbours and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto God: he would fain have people know Chriſt, and obey him, and ſubmit unto him. Thus you ſee the ſigns whereby we may know, <hi>Whether we be born again, or no?</hi>

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93432:73"/>
and this is done all under one; for being once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted in Chriſt, we come to be fellow-Members with all thoſe that are Chriſts; and this we have here in the Text, <hi>By one Spirit we are all Baptized into one Body, &amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtles meaning is this, All we that are the people of God, we are all one Body; and the efficient cauſe of this, is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, it is by the Spirit that we are made thus, and the inſtrumental cauſe, though it be not here expreſſed, yet it is implyed, and that is Faith; and the means of confirming this Faith are the Two Sacraments: Firſt, The Sacrament of Baptiſme, <hi>we are baptized into the ſame Body.</hi> Secondly, The Sacrament of the Lords Supper, intimated in one part of it, namely, <hi>the Cup,</hi> which is put for the whole, and are made all to drink of the ſame Cup, <hi>we are all of one and the ſelf ſame Body;</hi> as many as are in Chriſt, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the ſame Spirit; not one endued with one Spirit, and another endued with another Spirit, but <hi>by one Spirit we are Baptized into one Body;</hi> our Baptiſme is one, and our Food one; it is altogether one, though our condition in the world be never ſo different, <hi>bond, or free,</hi> though our Countrey, and Nation, and Pariſh be never ſo various one to another, one of one, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of another, Jews and Gentiles, we are all baptized into one Body, and this is done by one and the ſelf-ſame Spirit.</p>

               </p>

                  <note place="margin">VVhat this Body is.</note> which the Spirit of God doth ingraft his people into?

                  </hi> Heb. 12. 23.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It's <hi>ſuch a company as is gathered out</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gathered out of all Nations.</note> 
                  <hi>of all Nations under heaven;</hi> As Saint <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>After this, behold and loe, I ſaw a great multitude of all Nations, &amp; Countryes, and Tongues, &amp;c.</hi> Though it be a little Flock in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Reprobate; yet it is a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude conſidered in it ſelf: <hi>and they ſtood before the throne, &amp; before the Lambe, with long white Robes, and with Palms in their hands:</hi> This white Robe is the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt Jeſus imputed, which begets another Righteouſneſſe which is inherent in ſome meaſure; and the Palms in their hands, is the ſign of Victory over Sin, Death, and Hell; and this is a great multitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it was out of all Cities, &amp; Nations, and Kindreds of the world; and therefore our Saviour Chriſt, ſpeaking of his own taking of this company home unto himſelf at the laſt day, ſee what he ſpeaks, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 31. <hi>He ſhall ſend his Angels with a great ſound of a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and they ſhall gather his Elect from the four Winds, from the one end of the Earth to the other:</hi> The Lord gathers here one, and there another, as a man would gather a Poſie in a Garden, here a flower, and there a flower. This is Another Thing in the Body of Chriſt: <hi>it is a Company ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of all Nations, and People, and Places, at one time, or other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This ſame godly Company, are a<note place="margin">Predeſtinated unto life.</note> Company of <hi>Predeſtinated men unto Eternal life.</hi> For there are none but the choſen of God that

are the true Body of Chriſt; this is a company only of Elect men, and women, and babes; therefore they are called Elect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. They are ſuch a company as are written in the Lamb's Book of life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. Therefore all thoſe that ſeem to be of God, and go a great way with the people of God, and yet turn back, as <hi>Orphah</hi> from <hi>Naomi, Ruth</hi> 1. They were never of this number, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>They were not of us, they went out from us; if they had been of us, they would have continued with us:</hi> So that it is only the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of God that are of this Company, <hi>that are the Members of this Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is ſuch a godly Company as is <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Begotten again by the VVord.</note> 
                  <hi>by the Word of God:</hi> The Word of God gathers them together; they, as well as other people by nature, are of another Body, of another Corporation, as vile, and as wretched, and as miſerable in themſelves, if left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but God found them when he paſſed by them, and ſaid to them, <hi>Live;</hi> they were defiled as well as others in their bloud, but the Lord tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their hearts by the Word, &amp; doth beget them again thereby: This is that immortal ſeed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God doth beget them again unto eternal life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> They are ſuch a company as are made one, knit and combined together in Chriſt; though themſelves are never ſo many, and never ſo remote and diſtant from one another, may be they never ſaw one another, nor ever heard of one another, one lives in one Country, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one in one pariſh, another in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and have little bodily communion, and are not known one to another; may be ſome of this
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93432:75"/>
company are in heaven already, and ſome upon earth; yet they are all one in Chriſt, they all meet together in one heart and ſoul in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, they are all of one minde in him, as being all one body, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. <hi>and they are all one ſeed,</hi> Gal. 3. 16. <hi>Now to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham and his ſeed were the Promiſes made. He ſaith not, To ſeeds, as if they were many; but, To thy ſeed, as of one, that is Chriſt:</hi> that is, which is Chriſt, and all that are Chriſts; they are one ſeed, the ſeed of the woman; indeed all men come forth of the womans loins, the wicked as well as the godly, only here is the difference, The one is the ſeed of God, the other of the Serpent: Now Chriſt, and all that are Chriſts, are one and the ſelf-ſame ſeed; though they are different in Place, different in Countrey, different in eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; ſome Jews, ſome Gentiles, ſome Bond, ſome Free, ſome Noble, ſome Mean; yet they are all one in Chriſt Jeſus, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 28. <hi>There is neither Jew nor Grecian, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> 'Tis true, you are different among your ſelves, one is a maſter, another a ſervant, one is a rich man, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother a poor man, ſo there is a difference; but they are all one in Chriſt Jeſus, they have all one and the ſelf-ſame Faith, they have all one and the ſelf-ſame Father, there is but one Lord, and one Spirit to quicken and unite them all: Thus we ſee <hi>what this Body of Chriſt is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in the <hi>Second place, What it is to be put</hi>
                  <note place="margin">VVhat putting into this Body is.</note> 
                  <hi>into this Body;</hi> to be implanted into it, to be knit into this Body: I Anſwer, in a few words it is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:93432:75"/>
                  <hi>It is a part of a mans Ingrafting into Chriſt by Faith, whereby a man is ingrafted into the Body of Chriſt, having one common life with all the reſt of the Members for mutual conſent, and profit, and care, and help, and ſympathy, or fellow-feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>It is a part of a mans ingrafting into</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>A</hi> part of our ingrafting into Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt;</hi> For the ingrafting of a man into Chriſt, and into the body of Chriſt, are not Two things, but God doth them by one and the ſelf-ſame act, as you may ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 5. <hi>We being many are one body in Chriſt, and every one Members one of another:</hi> that is, by being Members of Chriſt, and by being ingrafted into Chriſt, we come to have fellowſhip, and conjunction, and joyning one with another: it muſt needs be the ſame work, for the putting a man into Chriſt in whom are the other Members, that very act makes a man to have fellowſhip with Chriſt, together with all the other Members, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. <hi>Though ſome of the branches be broken off, and thou being a wilde olive tree, waſt grafted in for them, and made partaker of the root:</hi> When a man is ingrafted into this Olive tree, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted with the reſt of Chriſts Members, and he doth partake together with the other Members of the ſame root, and of the ſame Gifts, and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, God doth both under one: Therefore though I handle this after the other, it is becauſe I cannot handle them both at once. Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with another;</hi> So that if a man be in Chriſt, he hath communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Body of Chriſt; if he hath fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93432:76"/>
with Chriſt, he hath fellowſhip with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt; ſo that you ſee the Spirit doth both by one and the ſelf-ſame act, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Ye were at that time without Chriſt, and aliants from the common-wealth of Iſrael:</hi> It is all one thing to ſay that a man is out of Chriſt, and an aliant from the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Iſrael, without that corporation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that Body, he is no Member of that Body; therefore it follows on the other ſide, If a man be in Chriſt, and ingrafted into Chriſt, then he is of this ſociety, he is of the common-wealth of the Iſrael of God: So that this is the Firſt Thing, <hi>It is a part of a mans ingrafting into Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This likewiſe is done by Faith:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">VVrought by Faith.</note> When a man is ingrafted into Chriſt, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into him by Faith: As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 23. <hi>And they alſo, if they abide not in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, ſhall be grafted in, for God is able to graft them:</hi> As who ſhould ſay, If ever they have Faith, they are ingrafted into Chriſt; it is Faith that ingrafts a man into Chriſt, and the ſame Faith that makes a man to be of the Body of Chriſt, that puts a man into the number of the Members of Chriſt; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>To Titus my Son in the common Faith,</hi> Tit. 1. 4. that is, it is ſuch a Faith as doth not only ingraft this man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, but the very ſelf-ſame Faith, another man having it, it doth ingraft him into the Body of Chriſt too: So that it is a common Faith, whereby one is ingrafted into the Body of Chriſt as well as another, as <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 44. They were all of one minde, and one heart, they all hung toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as one body, they imparted their gifts, and the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93432:76"/>
things they had, even to their very Lands and Goods, one to another; here was a ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: but then, what was the reaſon of this? What was the Inſtrument that wrought this? It was Faith; for the text ſaith, <hi>they were believers,</hi> or elſe they could not have done it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we are ſaid to come to Chriſt, ſo to the Body of Chriſt, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22. <hi>But ye are come to Mount Zion, to the City of the living God, the celeſtial Jeruſalem, and to the company of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Angels; and to the congregation of the firſt born, which are written in heaven. You are come,</hi> he ſpeaks of a ſpiritual coming by Faith: So that <hi>this putting into the Body of Chriſt, is by Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then in the Third place, <hi>It makes a man have</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Making us have common life with other Members.</note> 
                  <hi>a common life with all the reſt of the Members of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> As you may ſee, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>When Chriſt which is our life ſhall appear, ye alſo ſhall appear with him in glory. Chriſt who is our life;</hi> We that are the people of God, <hi>Chriſt is our life,</hi> we have one and the ſelf-ſame life, all one and the ſelf-ſame minde in the wayes of God; As it is ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 32. <hi>The multitude of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved were of one heart and one ſoul;</hi> all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in the whole world would quickly be acquainted if they were brought together, for they are all of one and the ſelf-ſame diſpoſition and mind; As our Saviour ſpeaks to his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 21. <hi>That they all may be one, as thou art in me, and I in thee, ſo that all they may be one in us:</hi> As the Three Perſons in the bleſſed Trinity are three diſtinct Perſons, and yet are all one; ſo in ſome ſenſe, the Members of the Body of Chriſt,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93432:77"/>
though they be of ſeveral callings and conditions in the world, yet they are all one, <hi>that they may be all one as we are one,</hi> verſ. 21. They all live by the ſame rule, and walk by the ſame rule, they are all guided by the ſame Word, and ſwayed by the ſame Commandment, they all walk in one Way, they all Pray by one and the ſelf-ſame Spirit, they have <hi>a life that is common:</hi> look as one lives ſo lives another; look as one repents, ſo another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents; look as one believes, ſo another believes; and look as one apprehends of God, and comes before him with affection, and fear, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, ſo doth another; though they never ſaw one another, yet they all meet in the ſame life, for <hi>they have the ſame root of life, the ſame cauſe of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Fourth place, <hi>It makes a man to be of one</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It makes of one conſent with all the people of God.</note> 
                  <hi>conſent with all the people of God every where;</hi> As you may ſee, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the Name of the Lord, to ſerve him with one conſent.</hi> The Lord helps them all to Pray after one pure language, and gives them all one pure conſent in the Service of God (though it is in different degrees indeed, one ariſeth to an higher pitch than another) therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Now I beſeech you brethren, by the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye ſpeak all the ſame things, that there be no diviſions among you:</hi> As who ſhould ſay, All the Members of Chriſt are ſo, I beſeech you endeavour to have this ſign of being Members of Chriſt, be all joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in the ſame mind; it is true, that this union, and conſent, and agreement, and oneneſs
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93432:77"/>
of heart and mind (as I may call it) is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, but in ſome it is more imperfect then it is in other; ſome have attained to a further degree, there is a great deal of unlikeneſs of affections, a great deal of unlikeneſs in Prayer, a great deal of unlikeneſs in Obedience, there is a great deal of jarrings now and then through weakneſs; but as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>As far as we have attained, let us be thus minded,</hi> Phil. 3. 15, 16. Let us walk by the ſame rule, &amp; mind the ſame things; the Children of God throughout the whole world, they are of one mind, as far as they have attained, though in Faith, in Repentance, in new Obedience they differ gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually in their attainments, yet they all agree in this conſent of judgment, That ſin muſt be hated, that a man muſt live in no ſin, that a man muſt yield Obedience to all Gods commandments, that a man muſt deny himſelf in all things, that in all things God muſt be glorified; they all agree that we are Members one of another, and that we muſt love one another, and forgive one another, as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven us; they all agree in this, They are all of one mind: and as one is mortified, ſo is the other; and as one is meek and gentle, ſo is the other: It is truè indeed, one hath attained further then another; but whereunto they have attained, they are all alike minded: Now whereunto we have not attained, God will reveal it in his good time unto us, ſaith the Apoſtle: May be one ſeeth ſuch a thing is a duty, which another doth not, yet all ſee that it is their duty to fear God, and obey him in all their wayes, and they all ſet themſelves to hate and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all manner of known ſins: <hi>As far as</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:93432:78"/>
                  <hi>they have attained, they are all of one minde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>All this is for mutual profit, and help,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">For mutual care and help.</note> 
                  <hi>and care, and ſympathy,</hi> as you may ſee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>That it muſt be for mutual profit,</hi> ſee the ſeventh <hi>verſ.</hi> The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal: that is, when the Spirit of God doth manifeſt himſelf in one man one way, and in another man another way; he gives one man (may be) the gift of Teaching, to another man the gift of knowledge; ſome have excellent gifts in one kind, ſome in another (but all have the gifts of new Obedience.) Now look whatſoever gifts they are, whenſoever the Spirit doth manifeſt it ſelf to any Member of the Body of Chriſt, it is to be helpful and uſeful to others, ſo that the Members of Chriſt need one another, that you may ſee, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21, 22. <hi>The eye cannot ſay to the hand, I have no need of thee: nor the head to the foot, I have no need of thee, &amp;c.</hi> We cannot be without the pooreſt, and vileſt, and contemptibleſt Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the Body; nay, the very life of the Body may depend upon the vileſt Members.</p>
               <p>So again, <hi>That they are to care for one another;</hi> That you may ſee in the 25. <hi>verſe, Leſt there ſhould be any diviſion in the Body, but that the Members ſhould have the ſame care one for another.</hi> You ſee how it is in the Body of a man, the head hath care of the feet, it guides the feet, and the foot hath care of the head, to hold it up, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it up and down, and the hand is uſeful for the relieving of any part, they have all the ſame care one of another, ſo it is in the Body of Chriſt. And for <hi>a Sympathy,</hi> ſee it in the 26. <hi>verſe, Wherefore</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:93432:78"/>
                  <hi>if one Member ſuffer, all ſuffer with it; and if one Member rejoyce, all rejoyce with it;</hi> all have a fellow-feeling of one anothers neceſſities and comforts. Therefore when the Spirit of God doth implant a man into the Body of Chriſt, it is all one with the implanting a man into Chriſt, he doth give him a common life, one minde and heart, he doth give them all natural help, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural care one of another, for they have need one of another.</p>
               <p>In the Third place we muſt ſhew, <hi>That the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
                  <note place="margin">That this is the Spirits work.</note> 
                  <hi>doth this,</hi> And <hi>why he doth it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That it is the Spirit that unites and tyeth all theſe Members together;</hi> This makes them hang together; therefore it is called, <hi>the unity of the Spirit,</hi> Eph. 4. 3. He exhorts the <hi>Epheſians</hi> that were the Members of Chriſt <hi>to keep the unity of the Spirit;</hi> becauſe as the Members of Chriſt are united to Chriſt, ſo they are united mutually by the Spirit; <hi>Therefore take heed</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>to keep the unity of the Spirit, that you may be of one mind, and one heart:</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Body of Chriſt, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares it to a building; A building conſiſts of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers bricks, and ſtones, and timber, which being joyned together, make up an houſe: So the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt being joyned together, make up an houſe for God to dwell in: But who makes this? The text ſaith, <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> Eph. 2. 22. The Spirit of God makes up this bleſſed building, all the elect of God, all the faithful, all the heirs of Grace in the world, are as an houſe or body. though there be never ſo many parts in it, yet they make all but one body or houſe, ſo it is here;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93432:79"/>
Now the Spirit unites theſe, and layes them arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially together, ſo that they may prop one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 19. The Lord there ſpeaking of his Elect, <hi>I will give them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>one heart, and make them of one mind;</hi> How will he do it? <hi>I will put a new Spirit within them;</hi> And ſo he makes them <hi>to be of one and the ſelf-ſame mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Reaſon, <hi>Why the Spirit of God doth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons why the Spirit of God doth thus unite to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt. None but the Spirit is able.</note> 
                  <hi>do this,</hi> is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe none elſe beſides the Spirit is able to do it:</hi> For by nature we are wofully and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully different from the Body of Chriſt, we are of another nature, of another kind, of another life; nay, we are contrary to it: all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt they are as young ſucking chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; but wicked men, and all men by nature are Lions, and Leopards, and Bears, and Tigers, as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. Now the Prophet there ſpeaking how Chriſt means to effect it, is to unite theſe together, to make the Lion and the Lamb to have communion together, to make the Bear and the Kid to lye down together: Mark how he ſheweth how Chriſt will do it, in the ſecond <hi>verſe</hi> of the ſame <hi>Chapter,</hi> the text ſaith, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him;</hi> he ſpeaks of Chriſt; that is, whereas this requires a great deal of power to do this, to make a man to be clean contrary to his nature; whenas a mans nature is carnal, and wicked, and earthly, to make him of the Body of Chriſt; therefore ſaith the text, <hi>The Spirit of Might ſhall be upon him, &amp;c.</hi> There is a great deal of Might required to turn their diſpoſitions: it is a mighty thing to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93432:79"/>
change a man that is a drunkard, a proud perſon, a wicked wretch; to turn this man topſie-turvy, to make him mind other things, to make him clean another man; this requires infinite wiſdom: Therefore <hi>the Spirit of Wiſdom ſhall reſt upon him</hi> to do it; and <hi>the Spirit of Knowledge, and the Spirit of the Fear of the Lord;</hi> that is, the Lord Jeſus ſhall put in the Spirit of Fear into mens hearts, and this will turn them, this will alter mens minds, and converſations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>There is none ſo fit as the Spirit of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">None but the Spirit is fit to do it.</note> 
                  <hi>God to do it:</hi> For this Body of Chriſt, it is a company of Sons and Daughters that God hath up and down in the world, that are able to cry, Abba Father: now who is ſo fit to do this as the Spirit of the Son? As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That he might redeem them that were under the Law, that they might receive the Adoption of Sons,</hi> Gal. 4. 5.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>How the Spirit of God doth this;</hi> and<note place="margin">How the Spirit doth Unite to Chriſt's Body.</note> that is <hi>Two wayes,</hi> as the Scripture reveals to us.</p>
               <p>The <hi>One</hi> is, <hi>By being one and the ſame Spirit in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">By being one and the ſame ſpirit in all Members.</note> 
                  <hi>all the Members of Chriſt:</hi> He comes into them, and dwells in them as one and the ſelf-ſame Spirit, and ſo makes up this union: The ſame Spirit that was in <hi>Paul,</hi> was in <hi>Peter;</hi> and ſo all the reſt of the Members of Chriſt one and the ſelf-ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit dwelleth in you?</hi> Therefore look what Spirit of Faith one man hath, another comes to have the ſame Spirit of Faith; as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>We having the ſame Spirit of Faith with them, as</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:93432:80"/>
                  <hi>it is written, I believe, and therefore I ſpeak; ſo we believe, and therefore we ſpeak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Spirit doth this by uniting and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">By tying a knot between all the Members.</note> 
                  <hi>tying a knot between theſe Members:</hi> He doth unite them, and make them hang together in one; he makes them to be of one heart, and of one ſoul by knitting and combining of their hearts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together: Therefore this fellowſhip is called the <hi>fellowſhip of the Spirit,</hi> Phil. 2. 1. Though <hi>Paul</hi> were far off from <hi>Phillippi,</hi> yet he could adjure the <hi>Phillippians</hi> by <hi>the fellowſhip of the Spirit.</hi> But you will ſay, How can this be? Can the people of God have communion and fellowſhip one with another when they are ſo far aſunder one from another, and may be never ſaw one another, may be never heard one of another? how can this be? I ſay, Very well: for the Spirit of God hath a long arm, and is able to make the people of God ſhake hands, though they be a thouſand miles ſunder; it is the Spirit that tyeth this knot, and unites them together: As <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Though I be abſent in the Fleſh, yet I am preſent with you in the Spirit;</hi> and methinks I am in your company and meetings; when you meet together; I ſee you in my mind methinks, and <hi>I joy in your order:</hi> The Spirit makes the communion between the people of God; and hence it is that they can love one another, becauſe all the Members are ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together by one knot; and they come to help one another, and do any thing one for another; even by the very love of the Spirit which they have one towards another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 30. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had ſome need of the good <hi>Romans</hi> to help him: Now ſee how he doth intreat help from
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93432:80"/>
them: he deſires them by <hi>the love of the Spirit, to pray heartily for him:</hi> he knew that the <hi>love of the Spirit</hi> would be a great motive to them: you know you and I are joyned together by the ſame Spirit, <hi>for the love of the Spirit pray for me.</hi> Thus we ſee,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>What this Body of Chriſt is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>What the putting a man into this Body is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Reaſons why.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>How the Spirit doth it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</hi> The want of the Spirit is the cauſe of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now I come to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> Is it ſo that the Spirit of God doth unite all the Saints of God together in one Body? <hi>Then here we may ſee the reaſon of the difference of men in the world:</hi> The difference of our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations; ſome companies that hang together are of one mind, another of another mind; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, they have a different Spirit; but all the Saints of God have the Spirit of God which makes them hang together; and the wicked, they have another Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Doth the Spirit of God joyn all the<note place="margin">Let none put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder what the Spirit joyns.</note> Saints of God together in one Body? <hi>Then that which God hath joyned together, let no man put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder.</hi> It is ſpoken in regard of man and wife; if it be ſuch a horrible thing to part man and wife, then what a horrible thing is it to part Saint and Saint that are joyned together by the Spirit of God; this bleſſed communion of the Spirit, what a fearful thing is it for a man to root it out? When there ſhall be heart-burnings and ſtrivings between thoſe that are the children of God, what a fearful thing is this? Is the number of thoſe
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:93432:81"/>
that fear God ſo great, that we can ſpare any? Or are the Graces of Gods Spirit Wilderneſs Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that can walk alone and need no help from, or can do no good to others? Therefore the Apoſtle prayeth God in the behalf of the <hi>Corinthians, That the Members of Chriſt may be of one minde, and live in peace,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Here <hi>we may ſee how to try our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">To try our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance hereby.</note> 
                  <hi>and whether the company we joyn our ſelves unto, be good or no:</hi> If our company be right, the Spirit of God tyeth the knot; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle will tell you, whether you have the right communion and fellowſhip, or no; try the ſpirits, whether they be of God or no, ſaith he, <hi>If the fellowſhip we have one with another be not of God, if the Spirit of God do not knit us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, our fellowſhip is not right.</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 3. there is an excellent place, <hi>That they may have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with us</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and truly our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> As who ſhould ſay, We would fain have you have fellowſhip with us; and I tell you what kind of fellowſhip you muſt have, if you be acquainted with us, you muſt have fellowſhip with the father, and with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is with the Father and his Son Jeſus Chriſt: ſo that we may ſee, <hi>whether our Company be right or no, by this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Laſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is this, Is it ſo that the Spirit of<note place="margin">To ſtir up a ſympathy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Saints.</note> God joyns all the Saints of God together in one Body? <hi>Then we ſhould have a fellow-feeling with all the Members of Chriſt:</hi> Do not ſay thou art a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and not of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Germany;</hi> do not ſay thou art a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93432:81"/>
of this Pariſh, but not of another; do not ſay ſo, for if thou art a Member of Chriſt, there <hi>is one Body, and one Spirit,</hi> Eph. 4. 4. If there be <hi>one Body,</hi> there muſt be <hi>one Spirit;</hi> and therefore we <hi>ſhould have a fellow-feeling.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How to work, maintain, and expreſs this ſympathy. By informing our ſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But how ſhall we have a fellow-feeling with the Members of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, Firſt, <hi>We muſt inform our ſelves as much as we can concerning one another;</hi> As when the Ark of God was among the Philiſtims, old <hi>Eli,</hi> though he gave way too far to his Sons wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet was he very careful of the Ark and people of God; and therefore (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 13, 14.) he went out and ſate in the high-way, that ſo he might hear, in the firſt place, what was the news; and you know how his heart trembled when he heard that the Ark of God was taken: So it was with <hi>David,</hi> when any came out of the Camp of Iſrael, he ſaith to them, <hi>What is done I pray thee?</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 4. So we ſhould enquire concerning one another.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>We ſhould viſit our fellow-members:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">By viſiting our fellow-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</note> As it is ſaid of <hi>Moſes.</hi> though he were a great Courtier in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, yet he went out to look upon his Brethrens burthens, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 11. he would be ever and anon ſteping out to ſee how his brethren fared, and how did this affect his heart with their trouble?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>We ſhould lay to heart their Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">By laying to heart their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</note> It is a ſtrange thing how the people of God in all ages, have been affected with the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church; nay, though they have not ſeen it, but only fore-ſaw what would be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; as <hi>Eliſha</hi> wept when he fore-ſaw what

                  </hi> ſo there muſt be ſome ſet time every day, all the dayes of our lives; there muſt be ſome defined and determinate time for Worſhip of God every day, at the leaſt morning and evening. <hi>David,</hi> though he were employed in great affairs, yet he had three times a day to glorifie God in, in his holy Ordinances; <hi>Three times in the day will I praiſe thee,</hi> Pſal. 55. 17.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon of this is, Becauſe men live like<note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> Beaſts without daily invocation upon God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. 10, 11. <hi>Abijah</hi> there ſpeaking againſt <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the King of Iſrael, though himſelf had no great goodneſs in him, he ſaith, <hi>The Lord is our God, and we offer ſacrifices, and burn ſweet incenſe every day;</hi> Every day they did it; as who ſhould ſay, it were a ſign that God were not amongſt us, if we did not this: he takes it as a principle written in the conſcience, though he were a natural man, yet he doth reaſon thus, that where there is not every day ſome time for Gods Worſhip, God is not amongſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:93432:87"/>Another Reaſon is, Becauſe every morning<note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note> God reneweth his Mercies, and every evening they are continued to us, as the Church ſaith in the <hi>Lamentations</hi> ch. 3. 23. <hi>Every morning his mercies are renewed to us, and in the evening his compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions fail not;</hi> therefore every morning we are to ſet our ſelves before God, to ask of him the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of our ſins; every morning and evening we are to do this. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 1, 2. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, to ſing praiſes to thy Name, O thou moſt High; To ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And then again God is the Alpha, and Omega,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 3.</note> he is the beginning, and the ending of all things, and of all actions we do; God ſhould therefore have the beginning and ending of every day, that the Worſhip of God may have the ſtart of all other actions; it is neceſſary it ſhould be ſo, when a man firſt awakes in the morning, God ſhould be the firſt thought that ſhould come into his mind; As <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>My voice will I lift up unto thee in the morning;</hi> as ſoon as ever he awakes in the morning his heart is lifted up to God: ſo it is good for a man to make the firſt part of the day holy, that the reſt of the day may be thereafter: and ſo as we are to begin the day with the ſolemn Worſhip of God, ſo we are to end it in the evening, that we may reckon up all our accounts, and make even with God; as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Epheſ</hi> 4. 26. <hi>Let not the Sun go down upon your wrath:</hi> ſo let not the Sun go down upon a dead heart, upon a carnal heart, upon a worldly heart; but as the Sun goeth down upon

               <p>The Firſt Reaſon is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Covenant which God<note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> hath made with us doth require it: that is the end why God ſaves a man from his ſins, and brings him into the kingom of Chriſt, he takes a ſolemn Oath from him, <hi>That being delivered from the hands of his enemies, he ſhall ſerve him without</hi>

                  <hi>fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs all the dayes of his life:</hi> Every day muſt be a Sabbath day, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a man gives himſelf up to God, there is an Oath hangs upon him, and he breaks this Oath, if he ſet not upon it with all his might, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day may be a Sabbath day; he is to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to live godly, and religiouſly in all places, and at all times, and in every action he puts his hand unto; a man is not only to make conſcience on the ſeventh day, but every day of his life.</p>
               <p>The Second Reaſon is, Becauſe not to make<note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note> every day an holy day, is the brand of an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93432:88"/>
it is hypocriſie, <hi>Job.</hi> 27. 10. <hi>Will he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes call upon God?</hi> To be holy ſometimes, and not at another time, is the trick of an hypocrite; will he alwayes call upon God, will that man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes obey God and worſhip him, will he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſet himſelf to keep cloſe with God? No, an hypocrite will not do ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You may know an hypocrite, he hath his fits, and his pangs, and his moods; but a godly man, a ſincere hearted man, is one that doth compoſe himſelf to keep a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant courſe in Gods worſhip; <hi>as Act.</hi> 24. 16. There ſaith <hi>Paul, Herein do I exerciſe my ſelf to keep a good conſcience alwayes, both towards God and towards man:</hi> And as it was the practiſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo of all the Elect people of God, of all ſincere Chriſtians in the world, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 7. all the Elect of God, all the beloved of God, <hi>they did inſtantly ſerve God day and night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe bleſſedneſſe doth conſiſt in<note place="margin">Reaſ. 3.</note> this, In keeping every day in ſome kind as a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, as the Holy Ghoſt doth pronounce him bleſſed, <hi>that feareth the Lord alwayes,</hi> Prov. 28. 14. and <hi>that doth righteouſneſs at all times,</hi> Pſa. 106. 3. It is true, the Servants of God are ſometimes out of the way, they have their ſwervings and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but their reſolution is to keep a conſtant courſe in Gods Worſhip, and they do ſtrive to humble themſelves under the hand of God for their failings, and to be the more wary becauſe of them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, This is the Sum and Scope of all the<note place="margin">Reaſ. 4.</note> Law of Righteouſneſs; it is the very drift and end of all the Ten Commandements, the Lord hath ſet down in the Decalogue his whole Will and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93432:89"/>
Pleaſure, what we are to do all the dayes of our lives, this day, and that day, as long as we live; and there is no ſet time, but that we ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes obey it; and this is the practiſe of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, alwayes to keep his Commandments, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 16. 8. <hi>He ſet the Lord alwayes before him;</hi> that is, every day he did make it an holy day, that he might walk as in Gods preſence, and live as in Gods Courts, that he might do all his worldly buſineſſe as in the preſence of God.</p>
               <p>The Fourth Propoſition is this, As there muſt<note place="margin">

                     </gap>pecial day for Gods worſhip.</note> be a ſet time every day, and we are to keep every day as a Sabbath day in ſome ſenſe, ſo there muſt be a particular ſpecial day, ſet apart for Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Worſhip and Service: This is the next Propoſition I will prove unto you; for though e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day is to be a Sabbath day, yet we have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular callings, and we have buſineſſe in the world to employ our ſelves about, ſo that we cannot be every day hearing of the Word, and employing our ſelves in Prayer and ſpiritual exerciſes, though every day we are to keep it holy, yet we cannot be vacant wholly and totally every day; Now therefore I ſay, That there is a ſet day that the Lord hath called for to be devoted unto him; the very School-men themſelves do acknowledge this, and the very Heathen have found it out, They have ſet a day apart for the Service of their Gods, which they call their holy day, wherein they lay aſide all other buſineſſe, and ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a part to honor and worſhip their Images and Idols, according to their manner. Now I will make this good by many Arguments, that God
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93432:89"/>
will have a ſet day, beſides the every day Sabbath, he will have a ſet particular Sabbath for his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Service.</p>
               <p>The Firſt Reaſon is, Becauſe he will have a little<note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> emblem and picture of the kingdom of heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Saints and Children in this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> life; in the kingdom of heaven there is no buying and ſelling, no eating and drinking, no worldly buſineſſe, there is nothing but prayſing and glorifying of God, and ſpeaking of God, and ſinging of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah unto his holy Name; there is nothing but enjoying communion with the Lord, and feeding upon him continually, there is nothing but this in the kingdom of heaven; Now God will have a little picture of this among his Saints here upon earth: You know <hi>there remains a reſt for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God,</hi> Heb. 4. 9. It is an expreſs place, the word in the Original is, <hi>There remains a Sabbath for the people of God.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, There is a glorious Sabbath that all the Elect of God ſhall have, and they are preſerved for it, and that is reſerved for them, and they ſhall enter into it, when this body of death is laid down, and they ſhall enjoy God face to face, to all eternity, they ſhall behold him as he is, and have communion with him; now the Lord will have a little picture of this here in this life; we cannot have it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this life, for we have mortal bodies, that muſt be fed, and cloathed, and ſtand in need of the creature; for mans ſin is not yet purged away, but there is a great deal of rubbiſh ſtill left, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this cannot be complete here: but yet God will have a little picture ot this, even in this life, and that is the Sabbath day, wherein they are to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:93432:90"/>
lay aſide all the works of their ordinary callings, and reſt from all ſervil labours, this is Gods day, and we muſt now call upon him, and hear what he ſaith, and wholly employ, and occupy our ſelves about him, as neer as we poſſibly can; but now, this we cannot do every day, for we have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to look after, and Families to provide for, and there be an hundred occaſions to call a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; it may be a man thinks to go into his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and ſeek God in private, and one occaſion or other calls him aſide, that he cannot go on; but the Lord will have a little emblem and expreſſion of the kingdom of heaven upon the Sabbath day: therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, It <hi>remains for us,</hi> ſcil. <hi>in the life to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second Reaſon, why the Lord will have a<note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note> ſet day for his Worſhip and Service beſides the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day Sabbath, is becauſe the honour of God doth ſo require, it doth require that there ſhould be a ſolemn day for Gods Service; as Kings, though their ſubjects are to obey them every day, and keep their Laws every day, and if a ſubject tranſgreſs the Laws at any time, he is in danger of the diſpleaſure of the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he will have one day of ſolemnity to his Majeſty: So God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, though every day we are to tremble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and ſtand in aw of his Word, and take heed we do not err from his Commandments, yet he will have one ſolemn day for the honour of his Name, he will have a ſolemn day, wherein his people ſhall have nothing elſe to do, but to ſet themſelves apart for his Worſhip; therefore this ſet day is called, <hi>The honourable of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 58 13. that is, we muſt count the Sabbath day an
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:93432:90"/>
honourable day, a day of honour, wherein Gods Servants ſhould from morning to evening fall down before him, and confeſs that great is the Lord God: We ſhould wholly dedicate it unto him, ſeeking of him in Publick and in Private, that we may ſtore up holy affections for all the week following.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe God ſometimes calls for an<note place="margin">Reaſ. 3.</note> extraordinary day, and an extraordinary day hath ever relation to an ordinary; if I ſay this is my extraordinary food and diet, I imply that I have ordinary diet: ſo if the Scripture tells us that God calls for extraordinary dayes, it is an evident Argument, that there be ordinary dayes which he calls for.</p>
               <p>Now that God calls for extraordinary dayes, it is plain.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, He calls for extraordinary dayes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing; when God compaſſeth us about with ſongs of Deliverance, and works wonderful Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies for us, we ought to ſet a part a day for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, and delighting in his goodneſs and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour towards us, and this day is to be an holy day, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 8. 9. <hi>This day is holy unto the Lord your God, mourn not, nor weep;</hi> So that when we are to rejoyce towards God for any ſpiritual favour towards us, we ought to keep this day an holy day, we ought to employ the hours of the day in labouring to affect our hearts with his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and labouring to make his goodneſs to have impreſſion upon us, that we may with cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs run over all our dayes afterwards, that we may adhere unto him the better all our life time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:93432:91"/>2. Secondly, As he calls for extraordinary dayes of rejoycing, ſo he calls for extraordinary dayes of Faſting and Humiliation, and that in Four Caſes.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, When we fear ſome heavie judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come upon us, or elſe when ſome judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is already upon us: may be ſome heavie judgement is upon us, or elſe we fear it to come upon us, and now we are to ſet an extraordinary day apart to ſeek the Lord; as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſaphat</hi> proclaimed a Faſt, when the Land was in danger: Suppoſe the Lord ſhould take away the Goſpel, and the feet of thoſe that bring glad tydings ſhould be turned from us, then ſhould we Faſt in thoſe dayes, we ſhould grieve before God, and bewail the loſs of his Mercies and Favours; that we may have his Goodneſſe to quicken us, and keep us, and uphold us in the want of them.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, In caſe that we want ſome Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that we cannot well be without, in ſuch a caſe as this, if ordinary ſeeking will not do the deed, we ought to ſet apart an extraordinary time to prevail with God; as <hi>Ezra,</hi> he was in danger of the enemy, and if he ſhould go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the enemy would ſet upon him; now, thought he, if I ſhould go to the King, though he were very great with the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> at that time, yet thought he, if I ſhould go to the King for a Band of Souldiers, he would think our God were a weak God; I have told him what a ſtrong God we have, and that he is ready to help all thoſe that truſt in him; now if I ſhould go to him for a Band of Souldiers, he might think that our God
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93432:91"/>
were not able to deliver us, and it would be a great diſhonour to God; therefore he ſet a day a part for a Faſt, and laboured to get aid and help from heaven, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8. 21. So when a Child of God is exceedingly afflicted with any croſſe or temptation, and he ſhall wonderfully diſhonour God, and caſt a ſnare upon them that fear his Name, in this caſe he is bound to ſeek God extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily, and if the ordinary means that God hath appointed will not prevail, he is to ſet a part a Faſt to ſeek him extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, If we be aſſaulted from hell, and Satan, and our own hearts, with ſtrong temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then we are to ſeek God extraordinarily, as it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> when the Meſſenger of Satan was ſent to buffet him, when he lay under ſome heavy temptation, either unto Pride, or Luſt, or Uncleanneſſe, ſome prick in the fleſh, that the Lord ſent upon him, and let him be encountered withal; then <hi>Paul</hi> ſought God in a ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, more then ever he did at other times, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8. <hi>For this I beſought God thrice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Fourthly, In caſe a man is to do ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſervice, he is to enter into ſome new Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; or if the Lord doth put him upon ſome new ſervice, that doth require ſome more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary help, now a man is to ſeek God by Faſting and Prayer, as you may ſee it was with <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> when they entred into the Miniſtery, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 3. Now the reaſon why I name theſe things is to ſhew you, that ſometimes God will have an extraordinary ſet day for his immediate worſhip and ſervice, when we are to lay aſide all
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:93432:92"/>
other buſineſſe, and ſet our ſelves apart, to call upon his Name, and ſeek him. The thing I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from hence is this, If there be an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſet day, then there muſt be an ordinary ſet day for Gods immediate Service.</p>
               <p>Another Argument is taken from the Equity of<note place="margin">Reaſ. 4.</note> it, and that ſtands Two wayes:</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, It is very equal when as we have ſix dayes to provide for our ſelves, and for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of our bodies, God gives us divers dayes for that; now Equity doth require that we ſhould give one day to him, we having ſeveral dayes; it is equity that he ſhould have at leaſt one for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Therefore this doth aggravate our ſins ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, if we give not this day to God. Did not this aggravate the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> in eating of the forbidden fruit? in that God gave him liberty to eat freely of all other trees in the garden, and for bad him only the eating of that one? Now what excuſe could <hi>Adam</hi> have for not abſtaining from that one? So here, God having given us divers dayes for the good of our bodies, and for means and maintenance of the things of this life; equity requires, that we ſhould not touch Gods day, nor ſet our foot upon it, nor turn our eyes away from it, we ought to remember it; as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> ſaid in regard of his Miſtris, when ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed him to folly; mark how he anſwers the temptation, <hi>My Maſter hath put all things into my hands that are in the houſe, he hath with-held nothing from me but only thee his Wife,</hi> and that is equal, and reaſonable, <hi>how therefore ſhall I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> Gen. 3. 9. So ſhould we ſay, when we are tempted to break
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93432:92"/>
the Lords day, we ſhould ſay, The Lord hath not impoſed any day beſides, the Lord hath given us all the ſix dayes for our uſe, how therefore ſhall I do this great wickedneſſe, and ſin againſt God with worldly thoughts, and ſpeeches, and actions upon that day? It ſtands with very good equity that it ſhould be ſo.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, It ſtands with equity, in regard of our Souls; if our bodies which are the worſer part, have ſeveral dayes for their uſe, then how much more ſhould the ſoul have one day, which is a thouſand times more worth then the body? You know what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>What will it profit a man to gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> Matth. 16 26. Our ſouls are more worth then our bodies, and we have more need to ſeek out for Holineſſe and Grace for them, and to be well provided for in regard of them, then for any thing in this preſent world; if we want meat, we can but ſtarve; if we want cloaths, we can but famiſh; if we want outward things, we can but temporally periſh; but if we want Grace and the Favour of God, we periſh for ever. Now if there be ſix dayes allowed for the good of our bodies, how much more ſhould we be willing to have one day for the good of our ſouls, ſpecially conſidering what need we have thereof? This Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument our Saviour Chriſt uſeth to prove the Sabbath, <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 27. <hi>The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath:</hi> The Sabbath was made for man, as meat was made for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and a man cannot be without food, no more can the ſoul be without the Sabbath; ſo that we ſee, there muſt be a ſolemn day
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:93432:93"/>
ſet a part for Gods Worſhip and Service.</p>
               <p>The Fifth Propoſition is this, That as there<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 5. One day of Seven to be ſet apart for Gods worſhip.</note> muſt be a ſet day for Gods Worſhip and Service, ſo this day muſt be one of ſeven, not one of eight, or nine, or five, or four, but one of ſeven; and this, though it be not naturally moral, yet it is poſitively moral, though it be not natural, written in the heart of man, as a man: if he had no teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his conſcience would find out that he ſhould not be idle, and ſteal, and commit murther; the Conſcience will grope out theſe Ordinances and Statutes of God; and the Conſcience will find out that there muſt be a ſet day for Gods Worſhip and Service; the light of nature will find out that, but that it muſt be one day of ſeven, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find out; but I ſay, that it is the poſitive law of God, that it muſt be one of ſeven.</p>
               <p>Now, Becauſe it is not written in the heart of<note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> man, but in the Commandment of God poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered to us, and required of us; I can give no other Reaſon for it, but only the reaſon taken out of the Scripture; there can be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon taken from the judgment of man, as other Lawes, the very law of Reaſon will enforce them; but there can be no other reaſon for this, but only out of the Word of God. The Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, ſix dayes thou ſhalt labour, and being his Will, it muſt be performed; for God might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſix dayes for himſelf, and leave us but one day; God might have ordained it ſo; but God intending we ſhould live by the ſweat of our brows the Lord was pleaſed to allow us ſix dayes; now he giving us ſix dayes, doth reſerve unto himſelf one of ſeven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:93432:93"/>Secondly, Another Reaſon is this, As the Lord<note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note> hath commanded this ſeventh day, ſo he ſaith it is his day, <hi>The ſeventh day, is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God;</hi> Now then if the ſeventh day be the Sabbath of the Lord our God, then we muſt not divert any of the hours, or any part of the day away; when our minds run into the world, we muſt curbe them, and remember that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day is the Sabbath of the Lord our God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another Reaſon is, That our Cattel,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 3.</note> and Servants, and Children, may reſt as well as our ſelves, they are to labour ſix dayes, and one of ſeven they are to reſt.</p>
               <p>Another Reaſon is, Becauſe he hath ſanctified<note place="margin">Reaſ. 4.</note> it; therefore <hi>the Lord bleſſed the ſeventh day, and hallowed it.</hi> Now then, if the Lord hath ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the ſeventh day, and appointed it, if he hath ſet it a part for that purpoſe, for ſpiritual em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, and not to be filled up with any thing elſe, we are guilty of Sacriledge, if we do not give him this, as <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. 28. the Lord ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever is devoted unto the Lord, that is moſt holy unto him;</hi> now God ſaith, he hath devoted the ſeventh day to himſelf, therefore we are to keep it holy: <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> a very heathen, when he knew that the Veſſels came out of the Temple of the Lord, he would not employ them to a common uſe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>He put them into the houſe of his god;</hi> which was the holieſt place he had.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This is neceſſary, becauſe we are apt<note place="margin">Reaſ. 5.</note> to be worldly, and carnal, and non-reſident from Prayer, and from the Word, and ſerious humbling

of our ſelves before God, if we be never ſo little taken off; how ſuddenly do our minds cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and grow vain, and unfit, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered? Now if God ſhould not once in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dayes, have a day to take us off from the world; as ſix dayes are employed in worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, ſo if there were not a ſeventh day to take us off, there would be no hoe with us; therefore there muſt be a whole day to accuſtom us, and habituate us to the Service of God, otherwiſe we ſhould drown our ſelves in the world.</p>
               <p>The Sixth Propoſition is this, That as it muſt be<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 6. That day of the ſeven to be kept holy, on which God reſted.</note> one of ſeven, ſo it is not indifferent which of the ſeven dayes we keep holy, but it muſt be that day whereupon God reſted, therefore it hath the name of a Sabbath; Sabbath is nothing but reſt: The reaſon of the name is Two-fold, Firſt, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God reſted upon that day; And Secondly, Becauſe we are to reſt upon that day.</p>
               <p>The Seventh Propoſition is this, That all that<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 7. All that is in the Fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not eſſential to it.</note> is in the fourth Commandment, is not eſſential to the Commandment, the fourth Commandment delivers only theſe Two things, Firſt, <hi>That God will have a ſeventh day;</hi> Secondly, <hi>That this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day is to be the day of Gods reſt:</hi> This is the whole meaning of the fourth Commandment: now all other particulars in the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are not eſſential to the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as that <hi>God made Heaven and Earth in ſix dayes, and reſted the ſeventh day, &amp;c.</hi> It is not eſſential to the fourth Commandment, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at that time when God delivered the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, there was no greater work then the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the reſt from that work, was the reſt
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:93432:98"/>
from the greateſt work in the world; therefore it was kept upon the laſt day of the week, upon which God reſted from the Creation: Now the meaning of the fourth Commandment, is in the eighth Verſe; all the other particulars, are but Commentaries to open it to the Jewes, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Sabbath day to keep it holy;</hi> this is the fourth Commandment: <hi>The Sabbath,</hi> that is, the day that God reſted on and the day that we are to reſt upon: this is the holy day that is devoted to the Lord; now it was kept upon the laſt day of the week, becauſe God created heaven and earth, and reſted upon that day; and the Creation of heaven and earth was the greateſt work that God then had done.</p>
               <p>But then you will ſay, <hi>Why doth the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> 
                  <hi>ſay, That in ſix dayes God created Heaven and Earth, and reſted the ſeventh day?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, It is no ſtrange thing, to ſee ſome<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> things in the Commandments which are not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to them, becauſe the Commandments were delivered to the Jewes: though they concern the whole world, yet the perſons, that actually ſtood before God, when the Decalogue was delivered, were only the Jewes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 22. God ſpake to the Jewes; now no wonder, God ſpeaking to the Jewes, did ſpeak divers particulars according to them, and in their phraſe, which if we had been alive, and they to ſucceed us, God would have ſpoken according to us, as he did according to them.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, We ſee plainly, there are ſome things in the Commandments, which do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the whole world, but only the Nation of the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93432:99"/>
Jewes, as in the firſt Commandment, <hi>I have brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the houſe of Bondage:</hi> [<hi>Thou ſhalt have no other gods but me:</hi>] That is the Commandment; but though they, together with the other, were put into the Tables of Stone, yet it concerns only the Jewes. 'Tis true indeed, it is a type of our deliverance, that we are delivered from Hell, and Sin, and Satan, as they were delivered out of Egypt, and the houſe of Bondage; but literally theſe words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long only to the Jews; and the Commandment is this, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other gods but me;</hi> So it is for the fourth Commandment.</p>
               <p>Again, There is ſomething in the Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, that doth not concern us, but only them, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother, &amp;c.</hi> [<hi>That thy dayes may be long in the Land which the thy God giveth thee</hi>] that belongs only to the Jews, it is meant particularly of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> This then is the effect of the Commandment, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother, that thy dayes may be long in the Land of</hi> Canaan. So that the firſt words are the Commandment, and the latter part belongs only to the Jewes: So <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 14. the Fourth Commandment, it was put into the Tables of Stone thus, <hi>Remember the ſeventh day to keep it holy, for the ſeventh day is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Lord thy God: in it thou ſhalt do no manner of work, thou nor thy Son nor thy Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp;c. that thy man-ſervant, and thy maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant may reſt as well as thou;</hi> that belongs to us, as well as to them; but then it follows, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thou wert a ſervant in the Land of Egypt:</hi> Here you ſee the Jewes have another Argument,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93432:99"/>
beſides the Arguments that we have; but though we have not that Argument, yet the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtands ſtill, and the Commandment is only thus much; namely, That there muſt be a Seventh day, and that ſeventh day God reſted upon: now whereas the Jewes kept the laſt day of the week, that was only by a temporary Commandment, becauſe the making of heaven and earth, was the greateſt thing that God had then done, and God reſted from that upon that day; but now if God work a greater work then the Creating of heaven and earth, and reſt from that, then by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the fourth Commandment, we are to keep that day holy, upon which he reſted from that work.</p>
               <p>Now I come to the Eighth Propoſition, That<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 8. The fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men continual, alwayes to abide in the Church.</note> this Fourth Commandment, concerning a Sabbath day, concerning the keeping of a Seventh day ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is a continual Commandment, alwayes to abide in the Church of God; I will prove it by divers Arguments, that it was not to continue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the time of the Jewes, but it is to abide al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the Church to the coming of the Son of man; there is not a jot of Ceremony in the fourth Commandment.</p>
               <p>The Firſt Reaſon is, Becauſe God did inſtitute<note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> the Sabbath before there was any room for Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; it was commanded to <hi>Adam</hi> in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency: Now all Ceremonies did prefigure Chriſt; and before <hi>Adam</hi> fell, there was no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Seed of the Woman, nor no need of it, and ſo no need of a Figure to repreſent it; but before <hi>Adam</hi> fell, the Sabbath was preſcribed, Gen. 2. 2, 3. <hi>On the ſeventh day God reſted from</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:93432:100"/>
                  <hi>all that he had made, ſo that God bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it:</hi> So that you ſee God having reſted upon this day, he ſanctified it, and put ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs upon it; therefore we are not to name that Common, which he hath named Holy; now though we do not read of <hi>Adams</hi> keeping this day, nor <hi>Abels,</hi> nor <hi>Enochs,</hi> nor <hi>Noahs,</hi> nor <hi>Abrahams,</hi> nor <hi>Iſaacs,</hi> nor <hi>Jacobs;</hi> yet it doth not follow it was not kept: for <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not take in hand to ſet down the actions of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but only generally: for you ſee what a ſhort ſtory we have of <hi>Methuſhelah</hi> a good man, though he lived a thouſand years almoſt, yet we have ſcarce Three Syllables concerning him. Now ſith <hi>Moſes</hi> did not undertake to ſet down all that they did, therefore they might keep the Sabbath, though he did not ſet it down: neither afterwards doth he ſet it down for 319. years, and 111. years, which 430. years, to the time of the Judges, we have nothing ſpoken of concerning the Sabbath; therefore ſeeing God did Inſtitute it to <hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocency, that is enough; but what though the Fathers had not kept it holy, doth it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow that we muſt not keep it holy? They had many wives, doth it therefore follow that we muſt have many wives? So, ſuppoſe they did not ſanctifie the ſeventh day, (though we can ſee no proof that they did not) yet this is enough, That God did ſanctifie it before any Ceremony was.</p>
               <p>Again, Though we do not read that they practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this, yet the Scripture doth intimate to us that they did it.</p>
               <p>The Second Argument to prove this, is out of<note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:93432:100"/>
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 23. before the Law was delivered upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> before the Commandment was ſpoken from <hi>Horeb;</hi> yet you may ſee that the Sabbath is ſpoken of, and the Lord doth finde fault with Iſrael, for not keeping of it, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timateth it was a day they well knew, and the Lord ſaith afterwards to Moſes, <hi>How long will ye refuſe to keep my Laws and Statutes?</hi> As in the 28. <hi>verſ.</hi> the Lord there ſpeaks of a Sabbath, as a day well known unto them, that it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be ſanctified by them, and this was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the delivering of the Ceremonial Law; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not a ceremonial Law, but a poſitive Law, equipollent with the moral Law.</p>
               <p>A Third Reaſon is, Becauſe it was written by<note place="margin">Reaſ. 3.</note> the finger of God in Tabels of ſtone and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ark, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 18. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 12. the Commandments were written upon Two tables of ſtone, and by the finger of God; Now all Divines, in all ages, agree upon this, that the writing of this Commandment in the Two tables of ſtone, is an evident Argument of the morality of it. For as a Reverend Divine ſaith, Not to think the Fourth Commandment to be moral, is the way to all Atheiſme, for if one ſhould ſay the Fourth Commandment is not moral, but cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial; another might ſtep up the next year and ſay the Second, and the Fifth, is not: So that whereas the Law is written by the finger of God in tables of ſtone, if we root it out of the tables of ſtone, we ſhall root it out of the heart of man; therefore the writing of it in the tables of ſtone, is an evident Argument of the morality of it to all ages.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:93432:101"/>A Fourth Argument is this, The Lord doth urge<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eaſ. 4.</note> this Commandment, more then any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment in the Decalogue; ſo that a man may queſtion the Firſt, or Second, or any of the Ten as well as this; for firſt we know that God hath made this Commandment larger then any of the reſt: Secondly hee hath made it ſtronger, and urged it with more arguments then any of the reſt. 3. he hath fixed a <hi>memento,</hi> remember be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it: As who ſhould ſay, Be carefull of this, and take heed of forgetting it, take heed of thoſe that ſhall teach you the contrary, that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is not morall. 4. It is negatively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and affirmatively; the other delivered on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one way; either affirmatively only, as the Fifth, <hi>Honour thy Father and Mother:</hi> or elſe negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly only, as all the reſt: There is never a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment delivered both negatively and affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, but only the Fourth, as, <hi>Remember the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, to keep it holy;</hi> there it is delivered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively: And afterwards it is delivered nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, <hi>In it thou ſhalt do no manner of work, thou, nor thy ſon, nor thy daughter,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord hath delivered it both wayes; noting, that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is equall and equipollent with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and the Lord did this in infinite wiſdome, becauſe he had not written this Commandment in the heart of man by the light of nature, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord did urge it more with Arguments, that what was wanting in the light of nature, might be ſupplyed by the preſſing of Arguments.</p>
               <p>5. Another Argument is, Becauſe if this be<note place="margin">Reaſ. 5.</note> not morall, then we have not Ten morall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, there are but Nine: now this is falſe;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:93432:101"/>
for the Scripture tels us, that the Commandments are <hi>Ten,</hi> as <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 4. it is not an Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call thing, but the Lord hath ſaid it, as you may ſee there: <hi>And he wrote upon the Tables ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the firſt writing, the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which the Lord ſpake unto you in the Mount, out of the midſt of the fire.</hi> The Lord ſpake <hi>Ten</hi> Commandments; now if the Fourth Commandment be not morall, there be not ten Commandments: And you may as well deny the Articles of the Faith, and the Petitions of the Lords Prayer, as the ten Commandments.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> Argument is this; Chriſt tels us<note place="margin">Reaſ. 6.</note> plainely, that it is a morall Commandment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 20. <hi>Pray</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that your flight be not in the winter, nor on the Sabbath day.</hi> Our Saviour Chriſt here propheſied of the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was forty yeares after Chriſts Aſcenſion, when all Ceremonies were ceaſed, as <hi>Paul</hi> had proclaimed before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> That <hi>if any man would</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 2</note> 
                  <hi>be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhould profit him nothing, Galat.</hi> 5. 2. That is, if he would keep the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law: Now Chriſt bids thoſe that ſhould live forty years after the Ceremonies were cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I would have you have a care of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and delight in hearing of the word of God, and meditating upon it, and ſo forth; and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſion come that you fall into the hands of your enemies, pray that your flight be not in the Winter, nor on the Sabbath day: as who ſhould ſay, If it be in the Winter, that will do hurt, and be troubleſome to your bodies: and ſo if you fly upon the Sabbath day, that will
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93432:102"/>
trouble your conſciences, if you regard Gods commandment and the good of your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; if you regard or fear Gods name, it will grieve you to fly on the Sabbath day, whereby you ſhall be deprived of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Gods Saints; therefore pray that your flight be not upon that day: Intimating, that it was Morall; for if it had been Ceremoniall, he would not have wiſhed them to pray that it might not be upon that day.</p>
               <p>Now whereas our Saviour doth ſo often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Phariſees in regard of their ſtrictneſſe of the Sabbath; it is not as if he did diſallow the keeping of it; but they were fooliſhly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, they ſtrained at a gnat, and ſwallowed a camel; they crowded out, and regarded not Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Judgment, they would not pull a poor beaſt out of a pit, or relieve a poor man upon the Sabbath day: they found fault that a man ſhould be helped from deaths door by our Saviour upon the Sabbath, this was their folly. Now our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did not condemn ſtrict keeping of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, but he did condemn their Superſtition; for ever ſince <hi>Adams</hi> time, it was lawful to do works of Mercy on the Sabbath, it was Lawful to pull a beaſt out of the pit, and do works of Mercy, and Neceſſity upon the Sabbath day. And, whereas the Law ſaith, The Jews might not kindle a fire<note place="margin">Exod. 35. 3</note> on the Sabbath day, if we were in their caſe, we might not neither; for they were in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in an hot Countrey, where they needed no Fire, and having their Food provided to their hands. And being in an hot Countrey, if they kindled a Fire, it was out of wantonneſſe; but if
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:93432:102"/>
it had been a cold Countrey, in <hi>Adams</hi> time, and <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, and in all times, it was lawful to kindle a Fire.</p>
               <p>Againe, another Argument is this, The very<note place="margin">Reaſ. 7.</note> Heathen themſelves have ever kept a Sabbath day, though they could not tell which the day was; ſome kept the Eighth day, and ſome the Ninth, yet they ever kept a Sabbath day: Yea, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, many of the Heathen themſelves kept the Sabbath after their manner. <hi>Alexandrinus,</hi> a godly Father, that lived but a little after Chriſt, ſaith, That the Heathen did count the Seventh day, an Holy day. And it is related of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Severus</hi> Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> though he were a Pagan, and Infidel, yet every Sabbath day, he retired from his Warlike affaires, and went up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Capitol to worſhip his gods. And it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported againe in Heathen Hiſtories, our boyes go not to School upon the Sabbath day, neither are Humane Arts taught on that day; but we have a Reſt upon that day: Nay, ſome of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens tell us, That they keep it from the Creation; therefore <hi>Philo</hi> tells us, That the Sabbath day, is the Creation day: and divers other poor people, that never had Scripture, or Prophet, or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter among them, but went meerly by the light of Nature, and what they had learned from their Anceſtors and Fathers, they did keep the Sabbath day. Nay, one of them ſaith, That on the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, all the Hoſt of Heaven and Earth was finiſhed. Therefore ſeeing the very Heathen have learned to keep this day Holy, it is an Evident Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that this is a Moral Commandement. I conclude the Proof of this Point, with the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:93432:103"/>
of our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth ſhall paſſe away, but not one jot or title of the Law ſhall paſſe away:</hi> Marke, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith there, that there ſhall not one jot or title of the Decalogue paſſe away. As for the Ceremonial, and Judicial law, they ſtand not ſtill, but the whole compaſſe of them is removed, the Ceremonial Law is quite and clean aboliſhed; and the Judicial Law, in many particulars; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour meant it not of thoſe two Laws, but he ſpeaks of the Decalogue, and he ſaith, <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth ſhall paſſe away, before one jot of it ſhall paſſe away,</hi> much leſſe an whole branch be rooted out. And <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Curſed is every one that continues not in all things that are written in this Law to do them:</hi> not only he that continueth not in the firſt, or ſecond, or third Commandment, but he that continueth not in the fourth, and fifth, and all the reſt. And <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 10. the Apoſtle there ſaith, <hi>If a man ſhould keep the whole Law of God, and be guilty only in one point, he is guilty of all.</hi> Suppoſe thou didſt keep the Three firſt Commandments, and all the Six laſt, if thou keepeſt not the Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, thou art guilty of the breach of all the Commandments.</p>
               <p>I let this paſſe, and come now to the laſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 9. The firſt day of he week was the Lords day, and ſo to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to the end <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> the world.</note> which is this, That though the laſt day of the week were kept for the Sabbath, till the coming of Chriſt, yet the firſt day of the week, that ſeventh day, is now the Lords Day, and is ſo to continue to the end of the World: I frame it thus, The change of the ſeventh day, to the firſt day of the week, is not by Eccleſiaſtical Law,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93432:103"/>
or by the Law of man, or Apoſtolical Tradition, but it is by the Inſtitution, and expreſs Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>
               <p>The firſt Argument to prove it, is taken out of<note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 24. It is an Argument uſed by the Church of God in all Ages, ever ſince twelve hundred years agoe. Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> did uſe it in his time, the Pſalmiſt Prophecieth of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt, <hi>the Stone which the builders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ver. 22. 23</note> 
                  <hi>is become the Head-ſtone of the Corner, this is the Lords doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</hi> (Our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. doth expound it of his Crucifying, and Reſurrection) <hi>This is the day that the Lord hath made, we will be glad and rejoyce in it.</hi> The Pſalmiſt ſpeaks here of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt; now ſpeaking of this very day, ſaith he, <hi>This is The day that the Lord hath made:</hi> And we for our part, that are godly, and deſire to be built upon this Corner Stone, we will be glad, and rejoyce in it; we will keep it as a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious day; a day of Thankſgiving, and Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in God. The thing is plain, ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 1, 2 the Prophet Prophecyeth of the Day of Chriſt, and ſaith, They are bleſſed that keep the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, <hi>thus ſaith the Lord, Keep Judgement, and Juſtice, for my Salvation is at hand to come, and my Righteouſneſs is to be revealed: Bleſſed is the man that doth this, and keepeth my Sabbaths.</hi> This is a Prophecie of the day of our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt; and he pronounceth a bleſſing upon thoſe that keep the Sabbath in thoſe dayes. Again, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 10. it was Prophecied of old, that the firſt day of the week, ſhould be the Sabbath day, the Lords day: <hi>In that day, there ſhall be</hi>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:93432:104"/>
                  <hi>a Root of Jeſſe, which ſhall ſtand up for an Enſigne to the people, and the Nations ſhall flie unto it, and his Reſt ſhall be Glorious:</hi> Not only the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Reſt ſhall be glorious, when he had Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Heaven, and Earth, and reſted the ſeventh day, but Chriſts Reſt alſo ſhall be glorious; for all Divines agree, that the Prophet ſpeaks of the Reſt of Chriſt, from the work of Redemption; now his Reſt ſhall be glorious. As God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reſted from his work, and his Reſt was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for four thouſand years together; ſo Chriſts Reſt from his work ſhall be glorious, there ſhall be glory and honour put upon it, as well as upon the Reſt of the Father, when he Reſted from make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Heaven and Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Argument to prove this,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note> is out of <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. there Saint John ſpeaking of the firſt day of the week, the Spirit of the Lord calls it the Lords Day, <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lords Day,</hi> ſo that it is not by Apoſtolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition only, but by the Inſtitution of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he doth call it <hi>the Lords Day, I was in the Spirit upon the Lords Day;</hi> he calls the firſt day of the week the Lords Day, by the ſame reaſon that the Sacrament is called the Lords Supper. Now the Sacrament is ſo called, becauſe the Lord Inſtituted it, and therefore it muſt be Holy: ſo the Lords Day is called ſo, becauſe the Lord Inſtituted it, and therefore it muſt be kept Holy.</p>
               <p>Another Argument is this, Our Saviour Chriſt<note place="margin">Reaſ. 3.</note> himſelf doth Intitle himſelf to be the Lord of the Sabbath, and therefore able to alter it, and change it, and appoint what buſineſſe is to be
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93432:104"/>
done, and what not to be done, upon that day; he doth openly profeſs, that he is <hi>Lord of the Sabbath,</hi> Mark 2. 28. and <hi>John</hi> 5. 23. he ſaith, <hi>They ſhall Honour the Son, as they Honour the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> As they honour the Father with a Sabbath, in regard of his Reſt from the work of Creation, ſo they ſhall honour the Son with a Sabbath, in regard of his Reſt from the work of Redemption, which being compared with <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. where it is called the Lords Day: Theſe two being put together, do plainly prove it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Chriſt himſelf did command his<note place="margin">Reaſ. 4.</note> Apoſtles to keep this day, it was not by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles counſel, as if they would ſet up this day in the Church, as ſome would have it, but Chriſt did command them ſo to do; for the Apoſtles did deliver nothing Generally to the Church, but what they received from the Lord, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>What I have received from the Lord, that I declare unto you,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. But I will prove it was the Commandment of Chriſt to them, by this Argument, Becauſe the firſt day of the week was alwayes kept for the aſſemblies of the people of God, before the Apoſtles durſt order any thing in the Church: the Apoſtles never durſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to ſet up any order in the Church, until the Holy Ghoſt fell upon them in fiery tongues, and that was fourty dayes after. Now the firſt day of the week was kept long before this, <hi>John</hi> 20. 19. they kept the firſt day of the week: and again the next week, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. they kept the firſt day of the week; and <hi>Luke</hi> 24. they kept the firſt day of the week. And if you compare three or four places of Scripture together, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93432:105"/>
16. 20. together with <hi>John</hi> 20. 19. 26. we ſhall ſee plainly in <hi>John,</hi> that they did meet upon the firſt day of the week, and in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. we ſhall ſee that Chriſt appointed them ſo to do, it was by his Commandment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Another Argument to prove that it<note place="margin">Reaſ. 5.</note> is by Divine Inſtitution, and not by Humane Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, is this, Becauſe the Wiſdome of Jeſus Chriſt, would never have committed ſuch a weighty thing as this is to the Judgement of man. Certainly the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, before his aſcending up unto his Father, would never have left things ſo raw, and uncertain, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as to leave ſuch a Branch of ſuch a Sacred Ordinance, to be at the Arbitrament of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo apt to take liberty, and ſo negligent to keep any day Holy, ſurely the Lord would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have left it to the Arbitrament of men. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may well conclude, it is to be found in Scripture by Ordination of God; for mark what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>As<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Moſes was faithful in all his houſe, ſo Chriſt is faithful in all his houſe,</hi> Heb. 3. 2, 3. He proves that Chriſt is more faithful then <hi>Moſes:</hi> Now <hi>Moſes</hi> was faithful, for he delivered the whole mind of God to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there was nothing left out, for time, or place, or manner; there was not any Ceremony in the worſhip of God left out, but he delivered all to them, he was faithful. So Chriſt is faithful in his houſe, therefore ſeeing Chriſt knew how ready men were to neglect, and prophane the Sabbath, plain reaſon tells us, that he would order it himſelf.</p>
               <p>Again, Who ſhould Inſtitute any Ordinance<note place="margin">Reaſ. 6.</note>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:93432:105"/>
in the Church, but only he that is the Head of the Church?</p>
               <p>Again, Another Argument is this, It hath<note place="margin">Reaſ. 7.</note> been the Practice of all holy men ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles daies, to keep this day. That it was the practice of the Apoſtles, that you will grant, that they kept the firſt day of the week. Now if there were no Argument but this, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did keep it, this were enough to prove the change of the day, when we find that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did ſanctifie this day, this were proof enough to ſtay our mindes; for certainly they had a more Infallible guidance and direction then we have, and they inſiſted upon this day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1. 2. They, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, and John the Divine kept this day, though he were in the place of his baniſhment, where he could hear no Sermon, but was all alone, yet he would keep the Sabbath, on the firſt day of the week, and the Lord rewarded his ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this day, by declaring the Revelation unto him, to incourage all good people to go on in keeping this day. But to leave theſe, and come to the time of the ancient Fathers, immediately after the Apoſtles; they all agree upon the firſt day of the week: <hi>Ignatius</hi> doth ſo; and Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, as the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is among women, ſo is the firſt day of the week, among dayes; as ſhe was bleſſed above women, ſo is the firſt day of the week bleſſed above daies: No man that makes conſcience of his wayes, but ſhall find a bleſſing upon every day; but God hath bleſſed this day in a more peculiar manner, and the ſoul that makes conſcience of the keeping of it, may by the Covenant of God expect a bleſſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:93432:106"/>Now to come to the dead times of Popery, If ever the Sabbath was out of memory, and out of date, then was the time; for then there was a great falling away, a great forſaking, a great declining, and people hearkned to Doctrines of Divels, and Damnable Hereſies, and the whole world groaned under Popery: Yet in the dead times of Popery there were abundance of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the Lord did keep their Judgements en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in this thing, as <hi>Gregory,</hi> and <hi>Silveſter,</hi> and others, though they were Superſtitious Papiſts, yet they ſay, That the change of the Sabbath, from the laſt day of the week to the firſt, is by Divine Inſtitution. Now to come to the times of Reformation, here we have abundance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend men beyond the ſea, both in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> that maintain it is by Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
               <p>Another Argument is taken from the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<note place="margin">Reaſ. 8.</note> of God; If men will not hearken to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the examples of the Saints, and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Divines in all ages, yet the Lord will make it appear from heaven, that this is the Lords Day, and the Lord hath ſealed it.</p>
               <p>Firſt by his Judgements, for the wrath of God hath been revealed from heaven upon thoſe that have prophaned this day: the Stories in all ages ſhew it. In the Councel of <hi>Paris,</hi> where Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines out of all Countries in Chriſtendome were met together, to conſult about matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; Miniſters ſtepped up, and made complaint, concernining the Sabbath, Let us make a Canon for the ſanctifying of the Sabbath day, for to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:93432:106"/>
our knowledg, the Lords wrath hath broken out upon the Countrey for the breach of this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and one related one ſtory, and another, another; as one told a Story of a Miller, that grinding upon the Sabbath day, a fire brake out, and burnt Mill, and Man, and all. Another, of an Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, that going into the field to fetch home his Corn upon the Sabbath day, thunder and lightning brake forth, and burnt him and his corn. Many ſuch ſtories were related in that Councel, and the <hi>Magdenbergs</hi> have a ſtory of a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that uſing to Hunt upon the Sabbath day, the Lord brought it ſo to paſſe, that his Wife brought forth a child, with a head juſt like a dog. I could relate abundance of Stories beyond ſea, but we have enough here at home; the Town of <hi>Stratford,</hi> in <hi>Warwick</hi> ſhire, as it is related in the Practice of Piety, was Burnt three times upon this day. And the Story of the <hi>Parris</hi> Garden, 1683. they were gathered together this day, to ſee the ſport of the Beaſts fighting together, and the Scaffold fell down, and eight were ſlain, and abundance hurt. So there are many more ſuch Examples, I remember my ſelf above a dozen within this half year; the Lord hath revealed his diſpleaſure from heaven, for the breach of this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Again the Lord hath ſealed this in the conſcience of his people. For who are they that break this day, but looſe, and vain, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane men? And who make conſcience of it, but thoſe that moſt fear God, thoſe that God hath moſt crowned with Righteouſneſſe and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification? they delight in this, and Sanctifie it,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93432:107"/>
and count it Holy to the Lord; and the more a man fears God, the more careful he is of the keeping of this day, and the more he is grieved to ſee it prophaned, either by himſelf or others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath experience of the bleſſings of God upon the keeping of this day; no man doth San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie this day conſcionably, but he ſhall find a bleſſing, therefore it is ſurely from the Lord.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is this, Is the firſt day of the week<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. 1.</note> the Sabbath by Divine Inſtitution? then here we ſee, that we are to keep a whole day. The Divel, if he cannot make men keep no day, then it is his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to make them keep it by halves. Oh, ſay they, Do we not keep the Sabbath? Do we not come to Church, and hear the word, and Divine Service Morning and Evening? Is not this to keep the Sabbath? But if the Lord hath Inſtituted this day, then certainly he hath Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a whole day. It is madneſſe, and want of reaſon for a man to think the contrary. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I hire a man to labour with me for a day, do I not make account he ſhould work one whole day? Suppoſe I hire a Servant for a year, do I not mean an whole year, though I put not in the word <hi>Whole,</hi> yet I ſuppoſe he muſt dwell an whole year with me. And if I hire a man for a day, it is for an whole day? ſo that in Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical ſenſe, when the Scripture ſaith, Thou ſhalt Sanctifie the Sabbath day, it is meant a whole day. It is not in this, as in other words; any piece of a ſtone, is ſtone: but in things that ſignifie the whole, it is not the ſame, as a day; a part of a day, is not a day: the leaſt part of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93432:107"/>
is water, or of fire is fire; but a part of a day, is not a day; Remember thou keep holy the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day; and, I was in the Spirit on the Lords day; and, they met together on the firſt day of the week: it is a day, therefore the meaning of the ſcripture is, that it ſhould be a whole day, and it is ſo in reaſon, and therefore we are to keep an whole day: therefore we ſhould not curtail the Lords day, as the ſervants of <hi>Hanun</hi> did the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Davids</hi> ſervants. You know what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> that brought but, part, when they ſhould have brought the whole; they ſhould have brought the whole price of their inheritance, but they brought but part, therefore the Lord ſmote them with death: ſo when the Lord requires a whole day, and we give him but a part, we ſhall bring vengeance upon our own heads.</p>
               <p>There are divers arguments for it: Firſt the<note place="margin">1.</note> weeke conſiſts of ſeven dayes, and he hath given ſix to us and reſerves one day to himſelf: now we wil grant that we have not part of ſix dayes, but ſix whole dayes. If you aske a man what, do you work all day? <hi>Why yea,</hi> the Lord hath given us ſix dayes, therefore ſix whole dayes. Now by the ſame reaſon God muſt have an whole day; if we take any part of the ſeventh day then we have more then ſix dayes, which is contrary to the ſcripture.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon is this, God reſted the ſeventh<note place="margin">2.</note> day: now looke what time God reſted, that time we muſt ſanctifie: now God reſted the ſeventh day, all of it, he left none of the creation
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93432:108"/>
to do upon the ſeventh day; he had finiſhed the creation in ſix dayes, and reſted all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, therefore we muſt keep the whole day. Thirdly, becauſe this is the nature of a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,<note place="margin">3.</note> to be 24 houres, not to be an artificiall day, but to be a naturall day 24 houres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as you may ſee Lev. 23. 32. <hi>you ſhall keep the Sabbath from evening to evening;</hi> then the dayes were reckoned from evening to evening from the creation; though now under the goſpel, becauſe Chriſt aroſe in the morning, they are reckoned from morning to morning.</p>
               <p>Fourthly another argument is this, God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<note place="margin">4.</note> ordained dayes half-holy in his Church: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Church of Rome have halfe holy dayes, as Saint <hi>Blac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es</hi> day, which is to be kept in the fore noon: ſo they have other dayes that are to be kept in the after-noone, but in the fore-noone they may do what they liſt: ſo heathens did, as <hi>Ovid</hi> ſaith, the former part of the day is holy, the latter part of the day is not holy; the Lord hath no ſuch days as theſe, but all holy dayes in ſcripture: if God ever appointed a faſt, or new moon, or feaſt of Tabernacles, whatſoever holy day, he did inſtitute, it was an whole day, and not a part of a day, therefore much more this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn day.</p>
               <p>Again, the judgment of all Divines in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges<note place="margin">5.</note> hath been concerning an whole day. I could inſtance in the fathers, as in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who ſaith, we are to continue in the Sabbath all the day long, for the Lord hath required all the day to be kept holy unto him, and the ſaints of God have alwayes kept an whole day: ſo Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:93432:108"/>
ſaith, It is not enough, that wee keep three or four houres of the day, but that we reſt the whole day. And what reſt? not only to reſt from our bodily labours, for the beaſts keep this Sabbath; nor the reſt of ſport and paſtime, for that is the Sabbath of the golden calfe, they ate and drink, and roſe up to play: No, but that thou mayeſt be vacant to God all the day in prayer and ſerving of him. So in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Mexicon,</hi> there was an aſſembly of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters out of all nations in Chriſtendome, and they ordained a canon, concerning the Lords day, <hi>We ordain, that people keep the whole Lords day holy, and that they ſet themſelves the whole day to pray to God, and delight in God, and heare his word: and if a countreyman's ſervant breake this day, his puniſhment ſhall be to be beaten with ſevere blowes,</hi> [<hi>ictubus gravioribus,</hi> are the very words of the Councell;] <hi>and if a Lawyer offer to plead this day, he ſhall not have the benefit of his pleading or caſe; and if a miniſter breake this day, he ſhall be excommunicated half a year, and throwne out of the Church, and ſhall not be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Church again, but upon great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</hi> This was the judgment of Divines in all ages, and it is the obſervation of a reverend Divine, <hi>Muſculus,</hi> upon <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. God doth not ſay, Remember the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> to keepe it holy; he that keeps it an hour or two, keeps it holy: but, Remember the <hi>Sabbath Day,</hi> to keepe it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; he will have a <hi>day</hi> kept holy: Nay <hi>Calvin,</hi> whom they take to be on their ſide, to be a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of their liberty, he himſelfe writing upon <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. upon theſe words, <hi>Remember the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>

                  <hi>day,</hi> he ſaith, we are to keep this day, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelfe, and all the people of God,) we are to keepe this day; and not a <hi>part</hi> of it, but <hi>all</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Uſe is this: we may hence ſee<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. 2</note> that ſports and paſtimes are not agreeable to the Lords day; for if the Lord hath forbidden our weekly works on that day, then ſurely he hath forbidden ſports and paſtimes.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is good, firſt becauſe our weekly works, are things Commanded at other times, now ſports and paſtimes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are never Commanded by God, but onely permitted: now if things commanded, and things that are good at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, if theſe notwithſtanding may not be done upon the Lords day, then much leſſe muſt thoſe be done that are permitted onely</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe weekely works do leſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract a man from God, then ſports and paſtimes. I appeale to any man here preſent, if he be not more heavenly and better employed, and leſſe diſtract from good thoughts, and gracious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, when he is plowing, or ſowing, or threſhing, then when he is diceing, and card<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſports and paſtimes beat a man further off from religion, and let a man go to prayer after ſports and paſtimes, he ſhall (find himſelfe more unfit and unaffected a great deal, then he ſhall when he comes from the works of his calling. Now if thoſe things that do leſſe diſtract from Gods worſhip and ſervice are forbidden upon the Sabbath day, then ſurely much more thoſe things that do more diſtract, muſt needs be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden upon that day.</p>
