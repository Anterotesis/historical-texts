         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AFTER I had finished these Sheets, I mett with a Paper
in Answer to the same Pamphlet that here I deal with,
which at first made me lay aside thoughts of publishing this
Piece: Yet I after considered, that few things are coincident
in that and this Paper: And that tho' the Pamphlet it self
deserveth no such notice: Yet some may either through prejudice, and a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ass
to the one side, or through unacquaintedness with our Affairs, receive
undue impressions of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and their way from the confident affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of that Author. For, <hi>Calumniare audacter, aliquid adhaerebit.</hi>
Therefore I was willing to suffer it to go Abroad after it, and the Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix
to it, had been ready for the Press, now more than 13 or 14 Months: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
things concurred to occasion this procrastination, which I shall not

            <head>A Just and Modest Reproof of a Pamphlet called,
The Scottish Presbyterian Eloquence.</head>
            <p>IT is to be lamented, that men who call themselves Ministers of the Gospel
(being laid aside from their work) imploy their time so ill, as to hatch false
and railing Accusations against their Brethren, to render them odious and
useless in the Church. And if the Author of this Pamphlet were of another
Character, yet it is unsutable to Christianity to use such Artifices: But it is no
new thing, but hath alwayes been one of Satans Methods for hindering the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
of the Gospel: The Pamphlet under consideration is an evidence, that <hi>Ill
men and Seducers use to wax worse and worse.</hi> For this man hath out-done all that
went before him in this Hellish way of managing his cause, and himself too; (if
he was one of the former Scriblers of this strain, as is supposed) in malicious
Railing; in the Characters that he giveth to Presbyterians, (and that without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of any among them) and in the most groundless fictions, in the Historical
part of his Book, that ever the Press groaned under. I cannot imagine how such
Stories have been framed: For few of them were ever commonly talked of, even
among the Mockers of this age, till this worthy book saw the light, which hath
furnished profane Wits, with better helps to ridicule all that is serious, or sacred,
than the World hath hitherto been acquainted with, and no doubt the Author
shall have his reward, for such a singular work, from the Lord, as he deserveth
it from Man: If this Collection of Historical Passages, had been this, Authors alone,
his Invention must have been singularly fertile, when imployed about this subject;
exposing Preaching and Prayer: But I find, by page 116, it was the product of
many Drunken Meetings, where each Man hath given in his Symbole, out of
which our Author hath made up this Bundle of Lyes, as the Creed of these Lone-Companions.</p>
            <p>He hath in this latter Age engaged in this same work against Presbyterians, (and
through their side, against them who regard the truth, in opposition to Popery,
and the practice of Religion, as contrary to Atheism and Prophaness) which their
common Master of old imployed <hi>Porphyry</hi> and others in against Christianity, and
afterward not a few of the Popish Writers, against our Reformers, and Reformation,
who endeavoured to make <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and other worthy Servants of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41752:3"/>
God, as black, and as Ridiculous as this Man doth the Presbyterian Ministers:
Neither hath his own party escaped the Lash of such Pens as his; and that from
such as disliked it, not as Episcopal, but as Protestant, as is to be seen in a piece
called <hi>Causes of the Contempt of the Clergy,</hi> whose Ape this Author seemeth to
be: Tho' I doe not know, that so many untruths in matters of Fact, are in that
Book, as I am sure there are in this.</p>
            <p>They who read this Book, and are Strangers in <hi>Scotland</hi> (for none else is cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to believe one of many of his Stories) will think him an unnatural wretch,
so to expose his native Countrey: For can any rational Man be perswaded, (that
<hi>Scotland,</hi> being divided into Presbyterians, and Episcopalians, and whatever may be
said of the Lat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er, the former are so considerable a party of all Ran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, and owned
as the Legal Church, by King and Parliament) that I say all the Latter should be
such learned and polite Men, and the former such silly Noddies, and illiterate
Fools: Or will they not rather think, that <hi>Scots</hi> Men are a contemptiable Crew,
or that this Man is a foul mouthed Reviler of his Nation, and a degenerat Son,
that so bespattereth his Mother.</p>
            <p>No wise Man will be at pains, to consider every passage in this Pamphlet, nor
could once reading it over be excusable; but that it was needful to know what he
saith: His general assertions concerning the Presbyterians, need not another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
than denying them, and appealing to all that know us, and are capable
to judge impartially. Neither his particular Histories; but by denying the matter
of Fact, and leaving it to him to prove them: Together with the improbability
of the thing, to all that know the persons whom he so belyeth; that thousands who
had <hi>Causam sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>entiae</hi> of these passages do disown that they knew them, or heard such
words as he alledgeth: if these Topicks may have place, we can make it appear
that seldom hath a Book appeared in print, stuffed with more falsehoods and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies,
and these manifestly and notourly such: which I hope will reflect
that shame on himself, and his Partners in these Inventions, which he thinketh
to throw on others.</p>
            <p>I come now to take some more particular Notice of his Book. What First
occureth is, His mock Dedication to the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>C.</hi> where he treateth that Noble
and truly Honourable Person with that petulant Contempt, which none but a
Man of this Author's Temper and Breeding could be capable of. And he rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Wit to say all the ill of his Lordship, that is imputable to any Person, not
considering either Truth or Probability of what he writeth; nor sparing to mock
at the Exercise of Religion in that Family, which hath been for many Generations,
and continueth to be, Honoured for their Zeal for, and Practice of Religion.
His whole Dedication deserveth no other Refutation, but to be marked with a
<hi>Nigrum Theta,</hi> as purely Lies and Railing.</p>
            <p>His First Section pretendeth, to give us a Character of the <hi>Presbyteria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> Pastors
and People in <hi>Scotland:</hi> Which he performeth most Unjustly, and without either
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41752:3"/>
Truth or Candor. <hi>Pag.</hi> 1. He asserteth that <hi>Presbyterian Preachers labour not to
make good Christians, but rigid Presbyterians.</hi> This is so remote from Truth, that
no Evidence of it can be given: And it is known to all their Hearers, that in
their Sermons, Catechising, and other Instructions, and Converse with their
People, they insist constantly on such Subjects as tend to Awaken and Humble
Sinners, and to let them see their Need of Christ; and in Directing and Perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to come to God by him; and on the Duties that Men owe to God and
their Neighbours: And that it is but rarely, that they insist on the Differences that
are among us, about Church Government. And their Consciences bear them
Witness, that though they desire that all the People may be <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> yet
that desire beareth small, or no proportion, with the desire they have that <hi>Christ
may be Formed</hi> in the Hearts of their Hearers.</p>
            <p>Next <hi>Pag.</hi> 2. He giveth us the Character of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> People (whom he
most falsly affirmeth to be <hi>The Guides of the Church</hi> and that <hi>The Ministers must
follow them)</hi> and that we assert the <hi>Power of Calling and Constituting Ministers is in the
Mob</hi> that they are <hi>Void of Sense and Reason, and are led by Fancy and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>regular Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</hi>
If this had been said of some, this Author might have saved his Credit:
For what Party of Men have not among them some unintelligent Persons? But
when it is said of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in general, and no exception made, it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to derogate from the Truth of all that he affirmeth, and to expose him as
a Person who hath no regard to Truth. I Appeal to all who Converse in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
if the Nobility, Gentry, Lawyers, Physicians, Merchants, and even the meaner
sort of the People who are <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> may not Vye in all commendable Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments
with them of the same Ranks and Stations, who are of the other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion.
He giveth an Instance of their want of Common Sense, that they will
tell you, <hi>That ye ought to fight the Battels of the Lord, because it is said in Epistle to the</hi>
Hebrews, <hi>Without sheading of Blood there is no Remission.</hi> That ever any Man
talked at this rate, is more than I know or heard before; nor am I obliged to
believe it, because this Author's Veracity is pledged for it: but that he imputeth
it as the Sentiment of the Party in general, and as a part of their Character, is a
piece of Effrontery peculiar to this Scribler. He next calleth them <hi>Covetous and
Deceitful,</hi> with the same Truth that hitherto he had used. It is to be lamented
that these Vices are so common every where, but the World knoweth that his
own Party has a full Share of them; and that as much of the contrary Vertues
are found among the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as among any Party of Men on
Earth That <hi>they are not taught Morality in the Sermons that they hear,</hi> is so false as
nothing can be more. 'Tis true, we Preach not Morality alone, as some do; but
Instruct People in the Mystery of Christ, that they may look after Righteousness
in him, and attain Gospel Obedience to the Law of God by dependance on him
for Strength to obey: But we Preach the Necessity of Good Works, and that
Moral Vertues are not only the great Ornament of practical Religion, but a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41752:4"/>
part of it, without which all Pretences to it, or Appearances of it, are
but Hypocrisie. The <hi>Debate</hi> he saith he had <hi>with one of them</hi> (who must not be
Named lest the Truth of the Matter of Fact be enquired into) proveth no more
(if what he saith be true,) but that there was once an ignorant <hi>Presbyterian</hi> in the
World: And if we cannot find one as Ignorant among his Party, we shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that, so far, be hath the better of us. He had very little to say, when he
blotted Paper with the Story of <hi>George Flint, and the Names he gave to his Dogs:</hi> Are
we to Answer for every Indiscretion any <hi>Plebe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an</hi> is guilty of.</p>
            <p>His next Charge of <hi>Perjury, Cheating, Lying, Murther,</hi> &amp;c. is of the same stamp
with the former, that is, Calumnious Falshoods. The Ignorance that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
to be found among them is not (generally speaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be compared with
that found among his own Party. Neither is it asserted with any Truth or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
That <hi>Our People are not taught the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, and the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi>
His Instance of a <hi>Shee-Saint</hi> (which with his mention of the <hi>Sighing
Fraternity,</hi> are some of the Flowers of his Profane Mocking Rhetorick) is either
his own invention, or a single instance of an Ignorant Girle among the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
to prove that all the Party is such: Which is a frequent way of Reasoning
with this Learned Author.</p>
            <p>What follows <hi>P</hi> 5. Of <hi>their Conventicles producing many Bastards, and the Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
abusing of Scripture,</hi> whereby he saith, <hi>They defended it,</hi> is a parcel of the most
Horrid and Wicked Lies that ever were invented on Earth, or in Hell. Our
Souls abhorr such Principles: And for these Practices, though we do not deny
that such Scandals have fallen out among <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> yet through the Mercy
of God, it is rare, and is severly Censured when it happeneth: Whereas among
his own Party, it is common to a Degree far beyond what has been seen among
us: And when they were in Power, such Scandals were but slackly Censured; so
that one thing that maketh the Looser sort of People dislike the Presbyterians, is,
That such Immoralities are more strictly Observed and Censured than before.
The Odious Story that he (in his usual Jeering Strain) telleth of Mr. <hi>Williamson,</hi>
hath been indeed talked of among many Men of this Author's Kidney; but we
Challenge him, or any other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to bring any rational Evidence of the Truth of it,
as may easily be done, if the thing be as he saith: But this was never yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
by any of them; which is a sufficient Exculpation of him, even by his
Adversaries. If they will attempt it and get not a fair Hearing, or if they will
prove it, and do not see Justice done on the Offender, then let them Reflect on
Presbyterians: But without this they are to be held as Malicious Calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours:
This very Story was Answered in another Paper, which this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
pretendeth to Answer: But he taketh no notice of what was there said;

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41752:4"/>
pretendeth to Ridicule (though never any of us used it to defend Sin) that the
Apostle there speaketh in the person of an Unregenerat Man, is the Gloss of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,</hi>
contrary to the Sentiments of all other Reformed Divines, as well as
Presbyterians. I wish this Author had given us a Specimen of his Learning, to
confirm what he alledgeth: But he is shie of that, for some Reasons; thinking
it enough to disparage the Learning of Others, without shewing his own, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing
of what they hold. But his Consequence that he draweth from the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that the Apostle speaketh of himself in that place, sheweth no small degree
of Ignorance, That <hi>this Place is a good Defence for For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The two instances that follow of two Women guilty of Uncleanness, and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Hypocrisy joined with it, look like his own invention: He is sure they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be disproved, because no person is named, if he will prove the Fact against
any persons, he shall see Presbyterians vindicated from this imputation, by the
Censures of the Church duely executed on so vile persons. What he telleth us
<hi>of Peoples being moved with a loud and a Whineing, tone and being affected with what
they understand not,</hi> is another of his Calumnies. None preach more intelligibly then
Presbyterians ordinarly do: And no People judge of Preaching by the truth and
usefulness of the matter, more then the more intelligent Presbyterians: and if
any are commoved by what they understand not, (as sometimes is observed among
some of the Ignorant Vulgar) this is far more frequently found among them who
cleaved to the Episcopalians when they had the Churches, than among them who
owned the Presbyterians. What he saith of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uffing</hi> and <hi>twang of the Nose</hi> (a notion
borrowed out of <hi>Cleavland,</hi> another such profane Mocker as himself) and <hi>being more
affected with a Sermon of Railing and Nonsense than with Christs Sermon on the Mount;</hi>
is like the rest of his affirmations, pure Railing and falsehoods: The confirmation of
this from what he alledgeth Mr. <hi>D. D.</hi> to have said, is not concludent, for we
have but his word for the truth of the Story (and his Reader by this time know
of what value that is) and that good Man once an eminent Preacher, hath been for
many years under Hypochondriack Melancholy, and often speaketh at Random.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more false then what is said <hi>p.</hi> 8. That <hi>They take it for a sure

he doth But we meet with no such person, nor do we own any such Opinion.
His citation out of <hi>Review of History of Indulgence,</hi> is a full proof against him,
that these are not the sentiments of Presbyterians; but reproved by them, when
found among some who had gone out from among the Presbyterians. The Stories

Or that there were some strangely deluded persons that went out from
among that party; as they were who were called the <hi>Sweet Singers,</hi> some of whom (as
hath been reported) tore outsome places of the Bible where words were found that
displeased them. But it is the height of Malice, to impute these things to Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who did always testify their dislike of such principles and practices, more than
other men did: And do reckon the whole Bible and all the other parts of it Sacred.</p>

this is not to be imputed to Presbyterians in general, seing it was the deed of a few:
And was no formed design; but was the effect of horrid and unsupportable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
from the Episcopal Party: The Doctrines Preached at that season, which
he mentioneth, may rationally be look't on as his own invention, of what he
thought probable: As better Historians than he, do often make speeches and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
them to Generals of Armies, as spoken by them to animate the Souldiers.
That any of the Presbyterians ever thought that <hi>all Bishops were Cloven Footed:
That they had no Shadow:</hi> Is what I never heard before: But I am sure if this
Book should obtain belief in the World (as I hope it shall not, while Men are
Rational) Strangers will look on <hi>Scotch Presbyterians</hi> as more monstrous than ever
any ignorant persons among vs could imagine <hi>Bishops</hi> to be: And it will be little
Credit to his party, that the Learned Writters among them, have as absurd Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
of Men, and things, as he can impute (though falsely) to the most igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
among us. The long Story that filleth up <hi>Page</hi> 11 and 12: of a Preacher who
came to the <hi>Merse,</hi> and there discoursed most absurdly, on <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. And reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as Ridiculously with a Minister; this Tale I say, I never heard before. And
though our Author telleth us, it was proved before very many famous Witnesses
in <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> yet is he neither pleased to name the Preacher, nor what place of
the <hi>Merse</hi> (which is a large Country) this happened in, nor the Minister with
whom he reasoned, nor these famous Witnesses in <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> So that we are
wholly out of Capacity to enquire into the truth of this Fact. If such a person
were known, the Presbyterian Church would soon stop his mouth from Preaching,
for they abhorre such Ridiculous Nonsense.</p>
            <p>His next essay in which he laboureth from <hi>Page</hi> 12. to 14. <hi>Is to give a true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the Presbyterian Preachers;</hi> where he spueth out all the Gall against them
that he is capable to vent: About which I observe 1. That he feigneth a strange
uniformity among them, as if not only the practice and natural temper of them
all; but their very Looks were the same, as <hi>Page</hi> 12. which is a plain evidence
that the man hath as little Judgement to contrive a Fiction well, as he hath veracity
to oblidge him to speak nothing but truth. 2. most of his Instances whereby he
proveth his strange assertions, are but one or two to prove one part of their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41752:5"/>
And if ye will not believe, <hi>sic de ceateris,</hi> he will be puzled to convince
any one of the truth of what he affirmeth: If we should do so by his party, how
black could we make them all: But we abhore such injustice to the Reputations
of Men. 3. Most of his instances are taken from some of the <hi>Hill Preachers,</hi>
who then were in a perfect separation from all the rest of the Presbyterians, and
spake as much against them, as against those whom they called <hi>Curats.</hi> 4. His
whole Discourse is stuffed with the most notorious falsehoods that can be devised,
as will appear as we go along. The Author seemeth to have but one design,
to disparage the <hi>Presbyterians:</hi> And his <hi>Impetus</hi> this way maketh him not only
forget veracity, which may be expected from a Christian; but that <hi>Decorum</hi>
which becometh a wise Man: And the civility that a Man of breeding would shew
to the worst of Men. It seemeth he careth not what he say, if he can but say ill
of the <hi>Presbyterians:</hi> And an impartial Reader will think that the Author hath
sufficiently characterized himself; while he pretendeth to give a Character of
the <hi>Presbyterian Ministers.</hi> 5. When he hath a mind to expose any of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
as absurd, or ridiculous; he is then pleased (most disingenuously) to advance
him to be one of the most eminent among us, that so he may make the World
believe (if their credulity be as large as his boldness in asserting) that we are all
such: But this silly artifice will fail of its design among them who are acquainted
with us.</p>
            <p>He first accuseth them (and that without exception) as <hi>Proud, Soure, unconvers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible.</hi>
Here is not one true word: where one is such among us (and never a party
consisted of all its individuals so well tempered as they should be) many are such
among his own party, and yet we are far from being so unmanly as to make this
the Character of the party. I leave it to the Reader to judge what Humility or
sweetness of mind our Author hath shewed in what he hath said, or in what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:
That <hi>they have faces like their horrid Decree of Reprobation.</hi> Where he vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his spite against the truth of God, as well as against the Men against whom
he hath indignation. Do not all the Reformed Divines, except <hi>Arminians,</hi> own a
Decree of Reprobation? yea doth not the Apostle so too? <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. I wonder what a
Face he thinketh the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> had. He, and Presbyterians need not be asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have their Pictures drawn, and shewed with that of this <hi>Momus.</hi> If a
<hi>Presbyterian</hi> had spoken so ignorantly, and indistinctly of such a head of Divinity,
how would he have accused them of Ignorance? For who can own Election, but
they must at the same time acknowledge a preterition, or Non-election, and that
as a positive Act of the Divine will: See <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 13. And who can say that some
are Damned in time, and yet this Damnation was not foreknown and foreap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
or decreed by him <hi>who worketh all things according to the Counsel of his
own will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this Author will shew his Argumentative Talent, as well as he hath that of
Railing, on this head, it would be more easy to Answer him. Their <hi>want of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41752:6"/>
and common Civility and Catholick Charity,</hi> are as many calumnies as words:
He asserteth: I deny it, and appeal to all that converse commonly among them:
But it is evident that what he asserteth of them he abundantly proveth of himself:
such Assertions being remote from all these vertues and good qualities. That
they <hi>dare not converse with them who differ from them, lest the people take it ill,</hi> is false.
They not only converse with them (such of them as are Sober) but have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
some of them into a share of the Government of the Church: And do not
shun to converse with others of them as occasion requireth. And if any people
be displeased at this (as I am sure the more intelligent are not) they instruct them
of the reasonableness of this practice. His <hi>certainty that we have as little Learning as
good nature, which is next to none,</hi> is a proof this Authors <hi>good Nature;</hi> as many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
passages of this Book are of his Learning: about the measure I shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine;
seing it is easy for any unbyassed Reader to judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Presbyterians differing from all other Churches,</hi> he boldly asserteth. I deny not but
there are some circumstantial things in which all the Churches in the World do
differ one from another; and our Church (may be) hath, in some of the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
things, her peculiar customs: But in her Confession of Faith, in her Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church, and in the worship of God, it is evident that we are, (for the
substance of these) exactly one with the generality of the Reformed Churches. And
for the circumstances, we are far nearer to the Reformed Churches than the
Church of <hi>E.</hi> is, which he gloryeth so much in, and which indeed hath a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
Discipline, and Worship, widely different from the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
World, yea on the matter they unchurch all other Churches, by
denying the validity of their Ordination; and re-ordaining all who have not a
Bishops hand laid on them. We are far from carrying so toward Her, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Church.</p>
            <p>That which goeth for a proof of this absurd Assertion, I shall now consider.
It is that we have banished <hi>the Lords Prayer, the Creed, and the ten Commandments,
the Doxology, and the publick reading of the Scripture.</hi> For the first of these, It
is false: for we endeavour to make the people understand it: And tell them the
true use of it; which is to direct them what to Pray for, and also in most other
things that concern Prayer. Its true we do not commonly repeat the words of
it, but we neither condemn them who do it, nor forbid to do it, Our reason is,
There is no command for using these words, nor do we find that the Apostles
or the Church in their time did repeat the words. Our reason for the other is,
these words are as fit to be used as any other. It is false that the Author of the
Answer to the ten Questions, (which he is pleased to ascribe to Dr. <hi>Rule,</hi> on what
grounds he best knoweth; for it beareth no name) used this as a reason against
Repeating the Lords Prayer, that it is inconvenient: It is only said <hi>Quest: 4, P.</hi> 20.
That <hi>We are not tyed to what had been injoined, if afterward it be found inconvenient</hi>
while the discourse was of the use of the <hi>Doxology, the Creed</hi> at Baptism, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41752:6"/>
the <hi>Lord's Prayer;</hi> now if any of these be inconvenient, that Assertion is pertinent,
tho' the rest were not, but were forborn on other grounds. Yea, If none of
them were inconvenient, what is said there is enough to free us from noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Churches on this head; with which that <hi>Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist</hi>
chargeth us; The words are plainly Hypothetick, and therefore assert no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Categorically. Them who use the words of the Lord's Prayer we do not
Judge, either as acting against what is lawful, or what is expedient. If Mr. <hi>K.</hi>
said, that he forbore Repeating the Lord's Prayer, <hi>because it is a Badge of the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Worship;</hi> and did mean, it was pressed in <hi>Scotland</hi> as such distinguishing
mark, perhaps it were not so absurd as our Author pretends, though I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
say, we forbear it because it hath not now of a long time been the practice
of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Church in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and we know no Command or other
Principle that maketh it necessary. What followeth, imputed to Mr. <hi>James Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quhart,</hi>
we reckon horrid Blasphemy: And if any will make it appear that Mr. U.
said such words, he ought to be desposed, or to make very solemn profession of
his Repentance for this Scandal: But Mr. U. denyeth it, and biddeth defiance to
any who will attempt to prove it against him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other Blasphemies to the same
purpose which follow, we abhore as much as he or any other can do. And I
affirm that it is the grossest of Falsehoods <hi>that it is ordinary to hear our People speak
so,</hi> for my part I have never heard such words from any, nor have I heard by
Report that any did speak them, and I assure the World that if any among us
were heard to utter such words they could not escape a severe Censure.</p>
            <p>He saith the <hi>Creed</hi> is not mentioned at Baptism. This we deny not, but was
it ever forbidden by our Church, or were any ever Censured for using it. We
take Parents bound to Educate their Children in the Knowledge of the Chief
Truths contained in the Scriptures: And do often mention the <hi>Confession of Faith</hi>
of this Church, as containing a more full and plain System of Scripture Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
than the <hi>Creed</hi> doth; though not differing in any Point from it. For our
National Engagements they are rarely mentioned at Baptism, and but by few:
But if they were, I know no Hurt in it, except it be, offending some tender Ears,
who love not to hear of the Ties which they have so little regarded, after they
had taken them on. What he imputeth to Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> in denying this, we regard
not. I am guilty of the same Dishonesty, in saying what he (or who ever that
Writer is) saith in the place cited by our Author: For these other honester Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,
whatever be their Honesty we are not of their Opinion. Nor are the
Sentiments of Presbyterians to be judged of by what they say, who had lest the
Presbyterians, and stood in opposition to them, when the Papers he mentioneth
were written. His Imputation on Mr. <hi>Dickson</hi> (that <hi>He called the Lords Prayer,
Creed, and Ten Commandments, rotten Wheel-barrows to carry Souls to Hell)</hi> I am not
foreward to believe it, having nothing for it but this Author's Word: But if
he said so, it was ill worded at best: And if he meant any more than to express
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41752:7"/>
the danger of Peoples resting on having these by Heart, as if that were to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious:
He deserveth to be Censured: None of us disswade People from Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them; but do seriously press it, and labour to make them understand them.
That we have abolished <hi>Publick Reading</hi> of Scripture, is a Calumny: It is true in
stead of Reading by a private Person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have the Scripture Read and Expounded
by the Minister; and that a Chapter or Psalm at once: And if any Read but
two or three Verses, it is an Abuse not allowed by us. That <hi>the Precenter Readeth
a Sermon in stead of Reading Scripture,</hi> is two Falsehoods in one Breath, one is that
this is done: I have heard indeed that one hath Read a written Sermon while
the people were conveening: But that this is either commonly, or alwayes done,
I never heard: also that this is in stead of Reading the Scriptures, is false: For
as hath been said the Minister Readeth and expoundeth Scripture, in stead of
what had wont to be Read without Exposition by a private person, who hath
no Authority to teach publickly. The <hi>Doxology</hi> we use not, because we think
Scripture Songs fittest to be sung as the publick Worship of God: And this is
not such; though the matter of it be consonant to Scripture. The Idle Story that
he telleth of <hi>Maggy</hi> twitting a Minister with this, is probable enough to be one
of his Inventions: But if it were true, we think the Minister was undiscreet, in
calling it a Malignant Song. We confess the matter of it is sung in Heaven: If
he will prove that the words are so too, we shall use it: They talk much of the
Antiquity of this Hymn which I am not now at leasure to enquire into: One of
their Divinity Professors Mr. <hi>William Douglas</hi> at <hi>Aberdeen</hi> (a diligent searcher into
Antiquity) <hi>Psalm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from the Apostles time: But his Authority in such things hath little weight
with Protestants: <hi>Pope Damasus</hi> in the 4 <hi>Century,</hi> enjoined it: And it is probable
that it was invented as a Testimony against <hi>Arianism:</hi> But so was the <hi>Trina Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersio;</hi>
which the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Church doth not think fit to retain. I Assent to the
Author now cited: Who after an heap of Authorities that he had collected, saith,
it is no defect of Worship where it is left out: And that none should be offended
with these Churches that use it. We constantly do the same thing materially,
naming the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost in the Conclusion of our Prayers. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
quarrel he hath with <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers is, <hi>they have no distinguishing Garb
from the lay Men,</hi> I hope this is no singularity: What Churches except these of
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> do distinguish their Clergy by their Garb: Our Ministers
wear a Grave and Decent Habit, and are mainly distinguished from the People,
by the Gravity and Edifyingness of their Conversation, which is a better Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteristick,

Cloak,</hi> is a notorious Falsehoood; to call it no worse. His saying <hi>They did it,</hi> seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41752:7"/>
to make it a publick Rebuke in the Assembly; or that it was done by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

privatly for this; and if any did, they were impertinent in so doing: I never
heard that any so much as whispered against it among themselves; nor do I know
a Reason why the Kings Commissioner is obliged to use another Garb than other
persons of his Rank. The long Story that he bringeth in about Mr. <hi>Lesks</hi> call,
for the sake of a quible used by my Lord <hi>R.</hi> to the <hi>Presbytry,</hi> is a silly piece of
impertinency: only I take notice, that he alledgeth, that Mr. <hi>Lesk,</hi> had for him
the <hi>Elders;</hi> which is false; for none, in the sense of the Law of <hi>Scotland,</hi> are <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi>
but such as are received by the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> so as these men were not and
for the Episcopal Church, they own no Ruling Elders; and the Law that set up
that party (having abolished all Presbyterian Judicatures) did only allow Ministers
to chuse such of the People as they thought fit to assist them: Which can be no true
notion of a Ruling Elder: nor did ever such Elders sit; or vote, in their Syn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ds.
His denying us to be Ministers, is an impudent Assertion, which he doth not
attempt to prove: and how it consisteth with the <hi>Catholick Charity,</hi> which he
blameth us for the want of, I cannot apprehend. That we are <hi>called by the People</hi>
we think it more sutable to the Gospel way than to be imposed on the People by a
<hi>Patron:</hi> that we are <hi>sent by the people, or our fitness judged of and determined by them,</hi>
is an impudent Falsehood: Our Ministers are tryed and sent, or ordained, by the
<hi>Presbytry,</hi> who hath better warrant for so doing than a <hi>Bishop</hi> hath: But if I

points were too much the subject of the Sermons of some, and there may be need
that they should be more insisted on at one time than at another: but that this is
now so practised is most false. I am affraid we are rather defective that way,
though I would not have these controversies made either the whole or the main
part of <hi>Sermons.</hi> In comparison, we <hi>should know nothing among</hi> the People <hi>but Christ
and him crucified.</hi> And I am sure that this is the strain of the <hi>Presbytorian</hi> Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
that I have occasion to hear: that they call the Government of the Church,
<hi>Christ,</hi> and that <hi>is was not the design of their Sermons, nor ever is like to be, to Preach
up Christ and Eternity</hi> (which he asserteth, <hi>P. 17.)</hi> is most false and calumnious:
He pretendeth to trace them in their <hi>Politicks Morals, Mysticks and Metaphysicks</hi> (a

prove his assertion he bringeth an instance of Mr. <hi>Donald Cargill,</hi> a <hi>Hill Preacher</hi>
whom yet he confesseth to <hi>have been disowned by the sober Presbyterians:</hi> which maketh
this instance wholly impertinent: but somewhat he must have to fill up his Paper.
The sober <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are foully by him misrepresented that <hi>they disowned the
Hill Men on account of their refusing to thank</hi> K. J. <hi>for his Tolleration:</hi> Whereas it is
known that they disowned them on account of their wild Principles, inconsistent
with the Government both of the State and of the Church; and that this they
did long before <hi>K. J.</hi> came to the Crown, or gave Indulgence.</p>
            <p>It is also false that <hi>none but Cameronians suffered any thing:</hi> and that <hi>all the Sober
Presbyterians were setled by the Indulgence.</hi> For many of the Soberest were put to
hard Sufferings both for Preaching, and for not complying with the way then
set up. And when the <hi>Indulgence</hi> came, which freed some who had suffered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
it was at first granted but to a few: and when it was enlarged by K. <hi>Charles</hi>
some were permitted to enjoy it but a short time. it is unfair dealing, that when
the <hi>Review of Hist. of Indulgence</hi> (which he citeth) doth condemn and refute these
Principles, he should yet charge us with them. If Mr. <hi>D.</hi> did so condemn (as
this Author alledgeth) paying Cess to the K. (the truth of which I know not)
his Brethren with whom he now joineth, did never approve of such Doctrine. He
telleth us of <hi>Acts of Assemblies and Covenants,</hi> which prove our unpeaceableness
such of them as have been cited in other places by his party, have been Answered:
We cannot Answer such general alledgances, but by denying that either the Acts
of the Assemblies, or the Covenants, contain any thing that prove what he asserteth.
The Book he mentioneth (which I have not seen) it is like may have an Answer,
if it deserve it. If it assert that <hi>Presbyterians renounce Monarchy, and all Power save
that of the Kirk:</hi> so absurd a position is to be despised, being abundantly refuted by
our due subjection to our present Rulers, which Sober <hi>Presbyterians</hi> payed also to
them under whose heavy hand they groaned. For farther proof of this imputation
he mentioneth <hi>Murthers committed in 3 Rebellions:</hi> But he must know that his own
party gave the rise to all these, by their horrid cruelty, and injustice which forced
people beyond the bounds of that patience that was fit.</p>
            <p>He blameth <hi>their flying to Arms in the time of the late Revolution;</hi> but doth not
tell his Reader, that it was by publick Authority, and for defence of the States of
the Nation, against them who were ready to destroy them, or hinder their meeting.
All this hath been alledged and Answered in other Papers. The men who he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
did last year <hi>endeavour to have the Solemn League and Covenant by force re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
and imposed,</hi> were none of the <hi>Presbyterians:</hi> Though they call themselves
such; nor can this be charged on us, more than all the practices of the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi>
in <hi>Germany</hi> can be rationally imputed to the <hi>Protestants,</hi> which yet his
Friends the <hi>Papists</hi> do, and that from the same Spirit by which this Man is
acted.</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:41752:8"/>
He considereth <hi>P.</hi> 19 the Learning of the <hi>Presbyterians:</hi> which he is pleased to
confine to two heads, <hi>Antiarminian Metaphisick, and practical Divinity, which they
pretend to draw from the heads of Election and Reprobation; whereby they Preach Men
out of their Wits, and very often into Despair, and self Murther.</hi> Nothing can be
more falsely, more disingenuously, nor more Maliciously uttered. The former
he barely asserteth. We acknowledge that <hi>Scotch Presbyterians</hi> are generally <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arminians;</hi>
but that they bring no Arguments against that way but from the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysicks</hi>
(which may be useful in the controversies about <hi>Predetermination. Free will,</hi>
and <hi>scientia media)</hi> is false, altho' it is a wonder that he will allow so much Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be among us. We can, and do, disprove all the <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrines from
the Scripture, and sound Reason, as <hi>Augustine, Bradwardine,</hi> and others before us
had refuted the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> their Ancestors.</p>
            <p>On the other Calumny he insisteth at length, but with weak and Ridiculous
proofs. The design of his Discourse seemeth to be to Ridicule all Soul-trouble,
and Fears and doubts about ones Souls case, and about Salvation, as <hi>Melancboly
and Distraction.</hi> What Service some Men of his Atheistical temper have done to
the Kingdom of Satan, by thus skarring People from serious considering the state
and danger of their Souls, is too well known: Our Opinion and practice in this
matter I shall briefly declare, and then consider what he bringeth against either.
We believe that the Lord hath, of his own Soveraign Pleasure, chosen some from
Eternity to obtain Salvation by Jesus Christ in the way of Repentance and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Christ, and perseverance in Holy walking; and we believe also that he hath
passed by others and from Eternity Decreed not to give them Grace, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
to Damn them, because of the Sins that he foresaw would follow on this
preterition, or on their not getting Grace from him. These deep Mysteries of
the Divine Providence we do not often, nor without necessity insist on in Sermons;
though we think we ought not to be wholly silent where the Lord hath spoken
in his word: Far less is it our practice to draw consequences from these Decrees,
to frighten People, or to lead them to Despair: But on the contrary (whereas
troubled Souls do often abuse these Truths, and Satan assists them in it, to move
them to cast of thoughts of Believing in Christ, as a hopeless and bootless thing)
we use to tell them, that though the Election of a particular person may be known
by the fruits of Holiness, yet that such a person, in particular, is a Reprobate,
cannot be known before their Death by themselves nor by others (except they be
guilty of the Sin against the Holy Ghost, which is rarely known) and therefore
none can rationally say, I am a Reprobate, and therefore need not come to Christ;
We inform them from the Gospel that whoever will come to Christ shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of him and shall find that they are no Reprobates: We tell them of Christs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to save to the uttermost, of the Free, Gracious, Cordial, Universal offer of
Christ made in the Gospel: of his undertaking in the Covenant of Grace to draw
the Soul to him, to give it strength to come, as well as to accept of them who
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41752:9"/>
come: And it is evident to all that know us, that none do more encourage Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
even the worst of them, to close with the offers of Christ by Faith on the
terms of the Gospel, then <hi>Presbyterians</hi> do. It is true, it is no small part of our
work to awaken the Consciences of secure Sinners: and this is that which this
Man, and such as he, carp at: But this we do, not by telling them of Reprobation,
but by laying before them the sinfulness of their nature, and of their way, their
lyableness to the Wrath of God because of Sin: And the Holy Justice of
God that pursueth Sinners while they live without Christ: and the impossibility
of escaping Wrath without Believing, and of Believing without conviction of sin
and Repentance, and turning from Sin unto God: And if this Doctrine were
considered it would make awakening of Conscience to be more frequent than it is;
but not that Doctrine, but peoples own obstinacy and unbelief, will drive them
into Desperation: Which we deny not may be the effect, though <hi>per accidens,</hi> of
the Preaching of the Gospel, as sometimes Hardning is.</p>
            <p>These things being considered it is easy to blow away all the obloquy that he
casteth on us from this topick. If Mr. <hi>Brody</hi> called a man, on the brink of Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
a <hi>Good Man:</hi> If Mr. <hi>Kir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oun</hi> called Soul-trouble for Sin a <hi>whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Disease.</hi> I hope they did not mean that Desperation is such; but that it is a
more hopeful thing to see a Man to have his Conscience frightned with the sense
of sin and Soul danger; than that he should be lying in stupid presumption and
delusion, or unconcerned about Salvation; as a Fever coming upon a Palsy is no
desireable Disease of it self, nor without danger; yet it giveth more hope than
if the Palsy should continue and resist all remedies: and as no wise Physician will
designedly procure a Feaver to a Paralytick person, but endeavour the cure by more
safe and gentle means, so we do not endeavour to beget Desperation; but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it, by Preaching the Gospel with the Law, yet the Conscience must be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened,
or the Soul is undone for ever. That any of us represent God in this
Mans Blasphemous notion, <hi>as a Sour, Severe, and Vnmerciful Being;</hi> is a false<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
wicked imputation: We proclaim his Mercy through Christ, and offer it in his
name, to all that hear us, good and bad, on the terms of the Gospel, indeed we
tell people that there is no Mercy in God for them while they live impenitently
in sin, and live without Christ, and if this make Men Despair, we Lament it.
That Mr. <hi>Vetch</hi> said <hi>of 2000 who were hearing them, 80 would not be saved,</hi> I do not
believe; it is unwarrantable boldness so to determine; neither is it our way to
go farther in this head, than to say, <hi>there are few that shall be saved,</hi> which is our
Lords own Doctrine. What he imputeth to Mr. <hi>Selkrig</hi> is none of our Doctrine
we know that God seeth Sin in the Elect before Conversion, and imputeth it to
them too, though after Conversion he knoweth that they Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is angry with
them because of it, yet their Sin is pardoned on their Repentance and flying to
Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Their <hi>Iniquity sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l not be their Ruine, Ezek.</hi> 18. 30. We mantain that
no Sin shall hinder the Conversion of the Elect, nor Damn them who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41752:9"/>
Yet there is no encouragement to Sin: Because they who go on in Sin to
the end, can be none of Gods Elect: Nor can they be in the state of Grace who
live in Sin, or allow any sin in themselves. Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd's</hi> expression which he
quarrelleth, is parallel with that of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> last cited.</p>
            <p>For the Story of two Self-murderers in the Parish of <hi>Leswade:</hi> We know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it, if true, what doth it make against us: Have not many of his own
way come to that woful End; and must that he made an Argument against <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy?</hi>
That the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Preacher in that Parish discoursed at the rate
that this Author mentioneth, we have no ground to belive, nor do we approve
such Discourse. That <hi>Presbyterians decry solid Learning, and particularly Antiquity,</hi>
is said with a Brow of brass. That <hi>we condemn Morality,</hi> is a horrid Calumny:
We preach it up: And I wish that he or such as he who talk so much of it, did
commend it to the People by their own Example. For the Book called, <hi>The
whole Duty of Man,</hi> we commend it as useful; and so are <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Writtings: But
we desiderate in it the Doctrine of the Righteousness of Christ, and His Vertues
and Grace, by which these excellent Duties which that Book layeth on us, must
be performed and accepted, and without which the highest Morality, as it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
from supernatural Grace, is not regarded by God. His Characters
of our Sermons as <hi>Nonsensick Raptures, Canting, impertinent and base Similies, that
we value no Works, but what tendeth to propagate Presbytry: That we make Christ and
the Gospel to be our Kirk Government:</hi> Are a parcel of such absurd Lies as deserve
no Answer, no Men do more mistake these things than we. If any do use some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
some Modes of expressing Things, which are too course and low; yet
these are but few, and they are not approved in that way by others: And there
are as many of his own Party who are the same way culpable. That <hi>we are for
the most part on</hi> Believe, <hi>and mistake Faith for a meer Recumbency:</hi> It is no
sign of Understanding in this Author to tax us with it, seing it was the Apostles
work to know nothing but Christ and Him Crucified: And seing Faith is called
the Work of God and His Commandment, above other things that are enjoined:
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dd way that some have of acting in the Pulpit is barely asserted: Certainly
among no Party all Ministers are uniform in this. If there be any thing in this
among us that amounteth to Undecency, we reprove it; which we rarely have
occasion to do, and no doubt we might recriminate if we were so disposed: But
we think this Author's way not very imitable. <q>That Mr. <hi>Thomas Hog</hi> said to
one that he could not be Happy till he saw the Devil, and had a personal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
and Combat with him:</q> Is a pure Invention, and not to be believed of
that Wise and Good Man, who is now in Heaven: And I give assurance that it is
no Presbyterian Principle.</p>
            <p>He cometh now <hi>Pag</hi> 25 to discourse of the <hi>Civility of Presbyterians,</hi> and setteth
them out as <q>Denying the common Civilities due to Mankind, to Persons of the

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41752:10"/>

               </q> is of the same Stamp. Now
he will give some Instances for proof of these Assertions. The first is, <q>The
Commissioners of the General Assembly refused to appoint one to preach a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
for the Anniversary Day of the Martyrdom of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the First, when
the Privy Council enjoyned it,</q> and that according to an Act of Parliament:
(which Act is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eer Invention of his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) Here is an Instance of this Author's

               </gap>ticity of the Ministers: Had

               </gap>is
Instance had been pertinent: If a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> had so reasoned, he would have
called it <hi>Nonsense:</hi> Were the three Children Rude or Uncivil when they refused
to fall down before an Image at the Kings Command? I suppose he will not say
it, though their Answer was not half so smoothly worded as that of the Ministers
to the Council: (I do not compare the things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>njoyned, but only the Carriage
in both cases, of them who could not obey) It is matter of Conscience to us, to
observe Anniversary Holy Days without Divine Warrand: If any spake indiscreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in their Sermons on that Day, themselves are to Answer for it: The Answer
that he maketh the Ministers to give to the Council, is purely of his own coyning:
If Civility ly in subjecting the Conscience to whatever Men shall please to enjoyn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
we willingly yeild to this Man and his Party, in that good Quality. His Second
Instance, of what Mr. <hi>Areskine</hi> said, the Day after the Adjournment of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
is as little to the purpose: For what ever it may prove of Mr. <hi>A</hi>—'s dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction

to Answer for himself: But they who heard him deny that he spoke such words
His <hi>3d.</hi> Instance is a gross Untruth, the Moderator said no such words as he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth,
<q>That the Terms of Communion proposed by the King, for taking
in the Conformists, was insolently rejected by all the Assembly, except Mr.
<hi>Orrock;</hi> is another Falsehood:</q> For 1. The Consideration of this Matter never
came before the Assembly: It was Referred to a Committee; and the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees
Determination was never suffered by his Grace my Lord Commissioner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
come before the Assembly. 2. The Committee did not reject these Terms of
Communion, but agreed to them, provided they who should be taken in would
explain some dubious Expressions in them, which they refused to do. Another
thing he falsly asserteth is, <q>That the common Discourse and Preaching of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians

in her Assemblies. <q>That they went to the Cross of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and took a for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mal
Protestation against the King;</q> is so notoriously false, that all <hi>Edinburgh</hi>
knoweth the contrary. It was indeed reported (whether true or false, I know
not) that a certain obscure Person (who he was, of what Principle, or whence
he came, we know not; or whether he were not set on by this Author, or some
of his Gang) on the Street, near the Cross, did Protest against the Dissolution
of the Assembly; But I hope the Presbyterians are not to Answer for every thing
that is done at the Cross of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> The several Stories <hi>P.</hi> 28. and 29. that
he hath either Coyned, or pickt up from Men of the same Talent of Invention
with himself, we are little concerned in. I am sure Presbyterians generally do
Love, Honour, and Pray Cordially for King <hi>William,</hi> and do hope that as the
the Lord hath made him an Instrument of Good for his Church, that so he will
do still.</p>
            <p>He hath another Fling at them for not observing Anniversary Days, which
he repeateth, it seems, for the sake of a new Notion that had come into his Head;
<q>That we Preach an Anniversary Sermon on Mr. <hi>Heriot,</hi> because the Preacher
getteth 5 <hi>lib.</hi> a new Hat, and Bible.</q> I pass in silence his Mistake about the
Reward for the Sermon, as not material. The real difference lyeth in this; that
the Days that we have refused to keep are holy Days, or pretended to be such, and
separated by Mens Authority from the other Days of the Year: This that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth,
is not so; only a Sermon is that Day Preached to put People in mind of
the Works of Charity, in which the Pious Founder of that Hospital had been
examplary. The rest of the Day is imployed as other Days are. He chargeth
us with Disingenuity, Hypocrisie and Covetousness (according to his <hi>Catholick
Charity,</hi> which he elsewhere denieth to be in us) his proof of this is, we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Pluralities; and yet Dr. <hi>Rule,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Vetch,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Vetch,</hi> Mr.
<hi>David Williamson,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Dickson, are sueing for 5 or 6 Stipends at once: And Mr.</hi>

               </gap>ton <hi>in</hi> Edinburgh <hi>went to</hi> Marten <hi>where he had been Preacher, and got the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
put out, and a Right to his Stipend, and to that in</hi> Edinburgh <hi>too.</hi> Answ. 1.
I have heard indeed that one of these named did Petition the Lords of Council
for one or two Vacand Stipends for one Year, to make up some great Losses that
he had sustained; what he obtained I am not certain. But even the motion was
disrelished by his Brethren: But this is far from approving Pluralities where one
Man taketh up yearly the Revenue of diverse places, by which a Minister in each
of these places should be maintained. 2. Some of these whom he nameth are
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41752:11"/>
most shamefully abused by him (for it seemeth he throweth his Darts at random
not caring where they hit, if they light but on a Presbyterian) Mr. <hi>David William<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
had no accession to this practice; nor did Mr, <hi>Rule</hi> ever seek a Stipend, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any, except what fell yearly due, and when it was due, in the place where
he laboured. 3. As for Mr. <hi>Kirton,</hi> the Stipend that became due to him at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi>
most of it he freely gave to the Episcopal Minister that was put out; the rest
to the Poor; which this Author might have known by a Book, which he in this
Pamphlet pretendeth to Answer. Another Story he hath to the same purpose of
Mr. <hi>Anthony Murray,</hi> who is now at rest from his Labour, and whom he grossly
belieth; Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> having lived (during his being put from his Charge, at <hi>Coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)</hi>
in <hi>Dunsire,</hi> and Preached there: When he was to return to his own Charge,
he got the half of 1689, in <hi>Dunsire,</hi> and the other half of it in <hi>Coulter:</hi> Here is
no plurality; most of which he bestowed on the Poor of these Parishes; for he
was neither Needy nor a Niggard. The Episcopal incumbent in <hi>Dunsire,</hi> though
put out, yet got the half of the Stipend of the Year 1691. The Story of Mr.
<hi>George Johnston</hi> is too famous among us: He grew Rich by the beneficence of good
People, who valued him highly for his excellent Gift of Preaching, and his good
Conversation in all things else, only he overlooked in his Wife many Covetous
Practices, which were a grief of Heart to Presbyterians, when they came to be
known. The Passages at the dying Man's Bed-side, that our Author imputeth
to Mr. <hi>Johnston,</hi> is a most wicked Invention: Such horrid Hypocrisy had been
enough among Presbyterians to render a Man uncapable to exercise the Ministry.</p>
            <p>The Story of Mr. <hi>Balf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ur</hi> we deny not, but lament: He was for it Deposed by
the Presbytry; and for many Lords Days did publickly profess his Repentance at
the several Churches where he had occasionally preached. as well as at <hi>Eccles,</hi>
where he was fixed in a Meeting-house; and yet this Author hath the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to Charge Presbyterians with this blame, and to bring them in, excusing
or extenuating it as a <hi>Slip of the Saints:</hi> I wish Scandals were as duely Censured
among his own party. What he telleth us <hi>of Injury done to Mr.</hi> Heriot <hi>in</hi>
Dalkeith, is abundantly Vindicated in a Paper Printed last year on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
to which I referr the Reader: He was first Deposed by the Presbytry,
not for <hi>Dancing about a Bonfire</hi> (tho that was mentioned also in his Lybel)
but for other Immoralities: He Appealed to the General Assembly, who
referred his Case to the Synod; they Examined it, and Ratified the Sentence.
He made Application to the Privy Counsel, who desired the following Synod to
review their own sentence: Which they did and again confirmed it. He hath
taken it on trust (because he hateth us) that <hi>we are of a Malicious and crabbed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi>
And he strains at assigning the cause of it; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>we never suffered Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
Which he largely insisteth on in his mocking stile: <q>That the Godly Sisters sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
them so that they lived better than before:</q> This our party needeth not be
ashamed of: this Mocker would have Ridiculed Christ also, to whom Women
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41752:11"/>
(the <hi>Godly Sisters</hi> that he flouteth) Ministred of their substance. The Charity of
his party is not so commendable by far. The Railing and Mocking that on
this occasion he farther venteth, is not to be Answered but to be despised, as the
the Froth of a Distempered Mind. It is not to be overlookt that he saith <hi>P.</hi> 84.
<q>that we disown the practices of the wild Men, and yet magnify that persecution
that they underwent,</q> as if we had shared in it, which we did not. Here are
several Mistakes (to use the softest words that such Absurdities are capable of)
first that we counted them all <hi>Wild Men</hi> who had an hand in the insurrections
and suffered: We know many of them were Good and Sober Men otherwise, tho'
in these practices we do not approve their conduct; yet pity them, as being forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on these courses by the highest degree of Hardship, that they were put to for
their Consciences. <hi>2dly.</hi> That none but they who took Arms suffered any thing,
how many were Fined in a fourth part of their yearly Rent for hearing one Sermon:
How many intercommuned, Imprisoned, forced to flee, for not hearing? Yea
the spite of that party appeared more against the Soberest than against others.
<hi>3dly.</hi> These whom the Book that he ascribeth to Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> calleth <hi>Wild-Men,</hi>
were a party which sprung out of them who took Arms, and disowned the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Church as well as the Episcopal Men, and State: Of these indeed some
suffered for disowning the Kings Authority; but few in comparison of others. As
for Mr. <hi>Wisharts</hi> Sufferings, we do not approve the severity that was used against
him; but do commend his Moderation and Charity after he was advanced:
But I am sure many <hi>Presbyterians</hi> suffered as much, and shewed as much meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to their Persecutors. He compareth the Meekness, and Moderation of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal
Men when in power, with the ingratitude of <hi>Presbyterians, who now are the
Instruments of persecuting them that saved them:</hi> And he bringeth two instances;
one of a nameless person who informed against Mr. <hi>Monro</hi> of <hi>Stirling;</hi> Another,
of one <hi>Ronaldson against on</hi> Mr. <hi>Burnet, Minister at Cranston.</hi> I deny not but some
few of the Episcopal Ministers had aversion from that horrid Persecution that
their Brethren practised, and did some Acts of Kindness to some of the Sufferers;
and I am sure when these persons had to do with <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Judicatories, they
had respect to them for that their Moderation; but if one or two were not so
thankful as was fit to their Benefactors (which yet is not sufficiently prov'd by
this Authors assertion) the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> blame such Actions, and are not to be
blamed for them. His citation out of Mr. <hi>D. D.</hi> Sermon, is Answered, as Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the same persons above. He chargeth us that <hi>singly we condemn the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of our party, But in meettings we approve them;</hi> this is a gross Calumny; if he
can charge any individual among us with such disingenuous dealing, and make
it appear in any particular Act, we shall blame such practices as much as he can;
but that he hath not attempted. In what remaineth of this Section, tho' there is
nothing of truth, yet the Author is secure from a Refutation of his Lies; because
they are a bundle of Calumnies in general terms, without either instances, or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41752:12"/>
any thing that looketh like a proof. That the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers do either
Preach so fillily as he saith, or <hi>are deserted by their Hearers,</hi> or even <hi>by persons of
the best Rank and Understanding,</hi> is most false: And I am sure their people are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
of better Morals than they are who leave them. That <hi>we condemn mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
use of Books in composing Sermons;</hi> is false: We disprove Repeating of other
Mens Sermons, as it is known some of their most eminent Men have done, and that
ordinarily: But there is an other use of Books then Transcribing large parcells of
them: If any of ours have done so, let them bear their blame; I am sure it is not
so common with us, as it is with his own party. After all these Falsehoods, he
hath the impudence to say that <hi>these things are too well known to be denied among us:</hi>
I appeal to all the Nation if ever they heard of most of his Stories, till his Book
brought them to light; yea it is known among us, that many of them are down
right Lies.</p>
            <p>Our Author in his second Section (having said so much against <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
without Book in his first) will now make surer work, and expose them out of
their Printed Books, which every one may Read, and Judge whether he dealeth
fairly with them or not. But even here his Candor will be found short of that which
becometh a Christian; for he chargeth some things on the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of things written by Men who were as opposite to the Sober <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
as to <hi>Episcopal</hi> Men; what is in others of their Books he doth often misrepresent.
But the thing will appear more clearly in particulars, to be observed as we go
along. The first he dealeth with is a Sermon of Mr. <hi>William Guthry;</hi> who was
an eminent Servant of God; he hath now been Dead 20 or 30 years. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
be saith <hi>is fall of Curse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and he citeth one passage in it, which I am sure no
<hi>Presbyterian</hi> will approve. He saith that Sermon is mightily applauded in the <hi>West.</hi>
He is not ashamed to Reproach the Living and the Dead. For all that knew Mr.
<hi>William Guthry,</hi> will averr that such horrid and rude expressions are not like to
have dropped from his mouth. I have indeed heard of a Sermon that went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Mr. <hi>Guthries</hi> Name; which was pretended to have been written from his Mouth,
(but by some ignorant and unskilful person) and Printed without his Knowledge
whether this may not be the Sermon he speaketh of I know not; that Sermon I
have never seen, and therefore cannot tell how faithfully the words are cited by
our Author. And surely if the people in the <hi>West</hi> were so taken with it, we should
have heard more of it, I cannot meet with any person who knoweth any thing
of it. His next citation we are little concerned in, Mr. <hi>Walwood</hi> was one of the
<hi>Hill Preachers</hi> who did not much favour the Soberer sort of <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> neither
do I know the truth of what is alledged, having never seen that Sermon. He cometh
next to some of the Sermons that were Preached before the Parliament (where he
unmannerly and calumniously Reflecteth on a person of great worth, and Honour
His Majesties high Commissioner the Earl of <hi>Melvill:</hi> others of them, which were
also Printed, he taketh no notice of: He falsely (as well as in a wickedly scoffing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41752:12"/>
(strain asserteth that <hi>these Sermons were carefully kept from Malignant Hands:</hi> For
they were exposed to publick Sale, and called in the streets, as other Prints use
to be: So that every one who pleased might have them. That these Sermons, <hi>Extol
Presbyterian Government with Epithites due to the Gospel, as Christs Bride,</hi> &amp;c. is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
asserted: He is challenged to shew where this is done: They commend
<hi>Christs Bride, Gods House</hi> &amp;c. But do never give ground to think that they mean only
of Church-Government, but evidence that they mean the Reformation of the
Church, in Doctrine Worship, and Discipline; whereof <hi>Presbyterian Government</hi> is but
a part, and not the chief part: These Preachers spake to a Parliament who had under
consideration the Christian Reformed Religion, contained in the <hi>Confession of Faith,</hi>
and therefore had good ground to put them in mind of the great weight of what
was before them, though <hi>Presbytry</hi> had deserved no regard. What he citeth out of
Mr. <hi>Spaldings</hi> Sermon is very applicable to what I have mentioned: Indeed if the
Reader will allow all this Mans glosses on these Sermons, and think that they mean
whatever he fancieth, they may be lookt on as absurd enough: But let this be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
once for all, that tho' <hi>Presbyterians</hi> never thought that the whole of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of Religion, nor the chief part of it, lay in the setting up <hi>Presbytry;</hi> yet they look
on it as Christs Ordinance and therefore the setting it up is one thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to building of the House of God: And if he can disprove this Notion
of things, let him produce his strong Reasons.</p>
            <p>He next dealeth with Mr. <hi>Rules</hi> Sermon: Where first he quarreleth with the
Text, and from it observeth that <q>their (the Presbyterians) Texts are generally
out of the obscurest places of the old Testament,</q> where an intelligent Reader
will laugh at his Folly, unless he can make it appear, first that Mr. <hi>R.</hi> is <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
in general, or either that he always hath such Texts; or <hi>Presbyterians</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
do as he did at this time, in chusing their Texts. 2. That <hi>Isai.</hi> 2. 2. is one
of the obscurest places of the Old Testament. He next affirms that <q>Mr. <hi>R.</hi> tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it for granted that the Mountain of the Lord, there spoken of, is expresly
meant of Scottish Presbytry:</q> How he can make this appear is hard to guess:
for no such thing is said, or hinted or implyed, in any part or passage of that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:
Yea nor is <hi>Presbytry</hi> so much as once mentioned, either expresly or by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locution
in it, but what the Parliament is there exhorted to, is, to settle the true
Religion among us, and to establish the Church in Purity: To which we deny
not the setting up of <hi>Presbytry</hi> doth belong. It is then a strange notion that he
hath, that <hi>to us, the only true Religion is Scotch Presbytry,</hi> but he thinketh his
Tongue is his own, who is Lord over him. Let any Man read that Sermon,
and compare it, with this Authors Marginal, and other Notes he hath on it, and
he will find that the Man can find no way to reach it, but by his own Additions
to it, not by any thing brought out of the Discourse itself: And it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
that in that Sermon the Preacher did purposely shun mentioning our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences;
but pressed in general a Reformation of the Church by Scripture, as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41752:13"/>
may be gathered from the Conclusion of his Sermon in these words, <q>I have
not in this Discourse been very particular, in bespeaking your care and zeal for
the things controverted among us: Partly because time doth not allow to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
on such Debates: And partly, because I am confident they were Men cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for the advancement of the Life and power of Religion, they would rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
fall in to accord about the things that have been the matter of our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</q>
These considered all his quibbles against this Sermon will evanish like
Smoke.</p>
            <p>He useth this same quibbling way with Mr. <hi>D. Williamson</hi>'s Sermon: Nothing
that is in any degree to purpose he bringeth against it, save on passage. <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>That Presbyterian Government is no light matter it is an ordinance of God
the Royal Diadem of Christ; He was a Martyre on this head, for it was his dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
on the Cross,</q> 
               <hi>John.</hi> 19. 19. Jesus of Nazereth the King of the Jews. A. It is
evident that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> doth there <hi>(P. 17.)</hi> speak in the general of a Government in
the Church: And that Christ was a Martyr for his Kingly Office, one part of
the exercise of which, is to appoint a Government in his house: And if we can
make appear (as hath been done by several) that the Government of the Church
by the parity of <hi>Presbyters</hi> is that Government which Christ insituted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. And that
this parity is observed in <hi>Scotland;</hi> then it will follow that <hi>Scotch Presbytry</hi> (which
he is thus pleased to vilify) belongeth to (tho' it be not the whole of) <hi>Christs Royal
Diadem;</hi> and that they who would set up another way do usurp upon the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
of Christ.</p>
            <p>The Sermon that he next maketh his Observations on, and that from <hi>P.</hi> 45. to
49 seems to be done (if his Citations out of it be just, for I have not seen this
Sermon) by one of too hot a temper: And there are many things in it that the
more intelligent and Sober <hi>Presbyterians</hi> do not own: Wherefore there needs no
more be said in Answer to what he asserteth against us from that Discourse; only
on his Margine he taketh notice, that Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> (for all along he is pleased to suppose
him to be the Author of the Answer to the five Pamphlets) <q>denieth that it hath
been used to take Parents engaged, when their Children are Baptized, to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</q>
Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> (or who ever be the Author of this Book) saith only, that
<hi>this is not the common practice</hi> in the <hi>Presbyterian Church now settled:</hi> And I do joyn
with him in that assertion. Neither do I know the contrary, as this Author impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
imputeth to Mr. <hi>R.</hi> The next Book he taketh to task, <hi>the Hind let loose,</hi>
we also disown, as done by one who then headed a party who separated from
almost all the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers in <hi>Scotland:</hi> so that I have no more to Answer
of his Book till <hi>P.</hi> 71 where he blameth us, that <q>the Author of the Vindication
disowneth that Book, and yet it was never condemned by any publick deed of the
Presbyterians,</q> A. Will this Author disown no Book written by an Episcopal
Man, unless it hath been condemned by some publick Deed of their Church, I
suppose he will not say so. No Church is obliged to condemn every faculty Book
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41752:13"/>
in particular: It is a sufficient general Condemnation of every errour, that a
Church do approve the truth, and do not teach any errour. Before I pass from his
Notes on this Book, I observe one Falsehood twice asserted; <hi>viz.</hi> on the Margine
of <hi>P.</hi> 56. and of 58. <q>That the late Assembly refused, at King <hi>Williams</hi> desire, to
admit any of the Episcopal Clergy with them into the Exercise of the Ministry;
and that they refused to receive them into any terms of Peace,</q> and Communion.
This I say is false; For 1. The Assembly were not suffered to bring in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of their Committee about that Affair, nor to determine any thing in it.
2. Their Committee had concerted terms of Communion with these Men, but
they would come into no terms with the Assembly: For they refused to explain
any one word in that <hi>Formula</hi> which they proposed to the Assembly: but of this
a little was said before, and more afterwards may be said.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 71. He beginneth to deal with another Book, which he was pleased to make
Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> the Author of; though it hath no name prefixed to it; with this Book
he is very Angry, and doth what his witt and Malice (which are very dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned)
can reach, to disparage the Author: That we do not much reckon upon;
for we defend not Men, but Principles. If Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> were the Author of that Book,
and if he had leisure for such work; it is like this Pamphlet had received a more
exact Answer: The Book spoken of is, <hi>The second Vindication</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in Answer to 5
Pamphlets.</hi> he giveth it a very slight Refutation, passing over the most material
parts of it: And using his Critical skill about some few things which fall in on
the By, or that he thought to have more advantage against. He begineth with
<hi>P.</hi> 125 of that Book: where the Author had said, that <hi>none of the Ministers were
Murdered by the Camer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nians</hi> (for his words are not faithfully here cited) he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
that <q>the Author knoweth that Instances might be given of Ministers
Murdered by them.</q> This is false, for we all know the contrary and it is strange
that this Author should be so confident in this, when he knoweth (if he read the
Book that he refuteth any farther than here and there one Line of ten) that the
Author doth in the very next Line challenge his Antagonist to bring any such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
And this Man saith instances might be brought, but attempteth not to
do it. What seemeth to be the proof of this confident assertion is a notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of our Authors skill in Logick: It is confest <hi>(postser: of 2d vindication)</hi> that
<q>some Men and Women invaded the house of a Minister, tore off his Cloaths, and
beat him on the Head and Legs, which looked but too like a design to Murther
him.</q> The consequent must be, E. they Murthered him: On this strong Argument
he calleth the Authors Answers to what was charged on the <q>Presbyterians, a
Ridiculous disguising of what he could not deny:</q> whether it be so or not, I hope
Readers will judge, by comparing what is said <hi>pro &amp; contra,</hi> and not take it on this
Mans word: <q>That Mr. <hi>P.</hi> refused to Answer the Pamphlets, because he found
it impossible to speak any thing in their <hi>(Presbyterians)</hi> Vindication but
what all <hi>Scotland</hi> knew to be false:</q> This I say, is a bold assertion: Mr. <hi>P.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41752:14"/>
no such Reason for his Refusal: But this pretender can by guess, assign
the most secret Reasons of things.</p>
            <p>He undertaketh to shew that <q>in every page that Book aboundeth with
scurrilous Railings,</q> Untruths, Contradictions, and Nonsense: And will charge
these on the whole party, because they enjoined the writting of this by him
who did write it: This is like our Authors way of Reasoning. I am perswaded
that one shall not find so much <hi>Nonsense</hi> in all that Book as he hath here present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us with: For what Sense is it, the party bid such an one Answer such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>amph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
E. all the faults in the manner of Writting are the blame of the whole par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
If our Author would make it appear that the <hi>General Assembly</hi> enjoined the
Answerer to Rail, write Lies, Contradictions, and Nonsense, then indeed he
spoke to the purpose: If not, these Faults, if they be, are only chargeable on the
Author; as the halting of the Horse is on his being Lame, not on the Rider:
And it is Nonsense to lay the blame on them who are so innocent.</p>
            <p>The first of these Accusations (which he insisteth on <hi>P.</hi> 73, 74, 75. is <hi>Scurrt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Railing.</hi> This he endeavoureth to make out, because Preface <hi>P.</hi> 1. he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Prelatists <hi>the Seed of the Serpent</hi> &amp;c. let any one Read that Passage, and see
whether either <hi>Prelatists</hi> be named, or the words can be drawn to signify either
all <hi>Prelaticts,</hi> or that party in general. It is plain that they who are spoken of are
a party of Men (who it is like may be found among the <hi>Prelatists)</hi> who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
disquieted the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and do now bespatter her with all the
Calumnies they can invent: The Pamphlets Answered in that Book, and this, now
under consideration, are a sufficient proof that such Men there are among them:
Tho' we are far from thinking that all <hi>Prelatists</hi> are such: For some we know
who differ from us soberly and maintain their Principles, not with such a Spirit
as appeareth in this Pamphlet, but abhor such wayes, and are ashamed that their
cause should be so patronized: This considered, all that he collecteth out of the
Preface falleth to the ground: Men of his kidney, we say, use the stratagems of
<hi>Heathens, Papists,</hi> yea that they do the <hi>Devils work;</hi> and what followeth: if he
can disprove this, let him do. What he saith of the Authors of their late Books
being charged with some ill things <hi>P.</hi> 73 if they be not retracted by the Author
of that Book, shall be disowned by us all, if they can be made appear to be either
false or unnecessary truths, who could shun calling these things <hi>Lies, Misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi>
&amp;c. which are manifestly such, and made appear to be such: let any
impartial Reader compare what is said of these Pamphlets with the passages to
which they are applyed, and we are not afraid to endure his Censure. We know
<hi>Moses</hi> could be provocked: The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> spake harsh words to one who
endeavoured to <hi>Pervert the right wayes of God:</hi> And our Lord himself called some
Men <hi>a Generation of Vipers.</hi> What he observeth out of <hi>P.</hi> 21. that it is said, that
<hi>the Prelatical party is eminent for Spite</hi> is a Misrepresentation, like what hath gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
It is said of his party, that it is a degenerate sort of furious Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41752:14"/>
a Reproach to either <hi>Episcopal,</hi> or any other party they own: And truly though i
had not been said, this Book is a proof, that such Men may be met with in <hi>Scotland</hi>
The same is Answered to what he objecteth out of <hi>P.</hi> 25 where <hi>Episcopalians</hi> are
not so much as mentioned. What he citeth out of <hi>P.</hi> 51 I do not find, if I
knew where else to seek after it, I should consider it: But if the Author he dealeth
with have spoke so Reproachfully of any worthy Man, whose words are not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
such as he calleth them, let him hear his own blame. I wonder where the
Contradiction lyeth between <hi>P.</hi> 146. that our differences are irreconcilable
without the yeilding of one party (these last words he leaveth out) and <hi>P.</hi> 1. they
own the same Religion with us: May not lesser difference be irreconcilable
as well, as greater? Are not many differences in Philosophie irreconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and yet the persons differing may agree well enough, tho' not about that
thing. Out of <hi>P.</hi> 168 he citeth these words <hi>Prelatists spend their short Glass:</hi>
Whereas the words are <hi>his party spend</hi>—<q>if this be fair dealing, let the Reader
judge.</q> What is said of a <hi>Snarling Cur, P.</hi> 191, was but the expression of a just
Indignation against a most vile Reproach cast on a person famous in his day in all
the Churches, now when he hath many years been in Glory, what he ranteth with
(while he chargeth Ranting on others) throughout <hi>P.</hi> 75 is not worthy of an
Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 76, He falleth on another head of the Faults he findeth with that Book:
Whether it be the <hi>Falsehoods,</hi> or the <hi>Contradictions</hi> of it, is not easy to discern,
he doth so jumble things together, but I shall take things as they come to hand.
We disown that principle on which he saith much of that Book is founded, <hi>Dods
you have been done by</hi> he might see <hi>(sed impedit ira Animum ne possit cernere verum)</hi> that
that very Book doth blame the <hi>Rable</hi> who did to others; but a small part of what
they had suffered from them: And if it do at any time excuse them by their suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
so far as to say, that they were to be pitied, and that it was but suitable to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
infirmity: I hope this is far from establishing such a Principle as he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
or from building on it; neither is their any (much less a shameful) Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
here, or at every turn. It is rather a shameful Ignorance of the nature of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to assert this. If <hi>Cameronians</hi> be sometimes called Godly, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Wild and ungovernable: A Contradiction is easily shuned, unless both
propositions were universal; which neither is nor can be alledged: There are of
both sorte among them: And we deny not but some degree of Wildness may
consist with a degree of Godliness, though it is to be Lamented that they
should meet in one person: It is not easy to determine what degree of Sinfulness
(especially that which consisteth in, or floweth from Errour in the understanding)
may consist with the least degree of Grace: Hence we have Charity to some <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal</hi>
Men, who we think have made very foul steps. Another Contradiction he
either findeth or maketh, is, <hi>Treating the Adversaries as Brethren,</hi> and at the
same time <hi>calling them the seed of the Serpent, Devils, Drunkards,</hi> &amp;c. What is more
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41752:15"/>
obvious to them who will understand, than that it is the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Party whom we
own as Brethren, and would gladly engage to an Union with us, on good Terms:
And yet there is a Party among them (especially of their late Writers) who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
all these Epithites that are alledged to be given them (only they were never
called Devils in that Book) save that his work of false Accusing is ascribed to
them; and if he pleaseth to draw this Consequence, they are false Accusers, E. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
we shall not reclaim. Yea, it is no inconsistency to treat these Adversaries

Terms.</p>
            <p>Another great Contradiction he bringeth, <hi>P.</hi> 77. <q>I build not on Hear-say
or common Fame: And I take many of the Matters of Fact from others: And
the veracity of my Informers, not mine, is pledged for them.</q> I wish this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
would study <hi>Logick</hi> before he would undertake to write Books any more.
Where is the Contradiction between not asserting any thing on common Report,
and building on a particular Report or Information: A Judge will not pass
Sentence on a common Report. <q>I have heard; and it is reported, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
person told me so;</q> which is the strain of the Pamphlets Answered by that
Book: And yet he giveth a Decreet on the testimony of particular Witnesses; tho'
he hath no personal knowledge of the matter of Fact. And why may not one
who vindicateth others from false Imputations, disown the one way of procedure,
and yet make use of the other? It must likeways be a Contradiction with this
Learned Author, <q>That we do not interpose in the Affairs of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi>
               </q> tho' some of them have medled with ours beyond their Line; and
yet we call them <hi>Superstitious, Popish,</hi> &amp;c. Hath he so little Witt, as that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
distinguish between telling our Opinion of a Way, and medling in the Affairs of
them of that Way: the one is matter of Opinion, the other of Practice. We think
the Popish Way is wrong, but we manage no Intrigues to pull down the Triple
Crown, we leave that to them who are called by God for that work: Some of
the <hi>Church of England</hi> have Consulted, and Contrived with our Enemies in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
how to disquiet and over-turn us: We have done no such thing toward
them. His Construction on our asserting, That the Covenant only Bindeth us
to concurr with <hi>England</hi> when called by them, in the Reformation of the <hi>Church:</hi>
is his own, none of ours: And will be despised by impartial Readers. He mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it also a Contradiction, That <hi>King</hi> James <hi>Abdicated the Government,</hi> and that
<hi>The Nation took away His Royal Authority.</hi> It is just such a Contradiction as to say,
That a Man deserteth his Wife, and will not dwell with her; and therefore she
obtaineth a Divorce by Course of Law; but these high Points I unwillingly medle
with. That the Book he Refuteth sayeth any where, <q>That we owe no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
to King <hi>William,</hi> but in so far as he supporteth Presbytry, is denied:</q>
I wish he had cited the Page where such words were to be found. This will
no way follow from what is cited out of the Acts of the Convention of Estates.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41752:15"/>
For <hi>Episcopacy</hi> may never he restored, and yet <hi>Presbytry</hi> not supported. What he
is angry with, as reflecting on <hi>Heredetary Monarchy,</hi> the Estates of the Nation
must answer for it, not the Ministers of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Another Contradiction he fancieth, <hi>P.</hi> 79. it is said in that Book <hi>P. 36. Parag.</hi>
11. <q>Most of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Ministers</q> (the words are, most of them who went
out. For very many Episcopal Ministers neither went out, nor were put out)
<q>were put out by their own Consciences; for they deserted their Charges with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
threatning, sentence or Compulsion. And yet <hi>P.</hi> 26. it is owned the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Rable did persecute and drive them away.</q> A Child could tell him
that there is no incoherency: for some left their charges the one way, and some the
other way. But what most angereth him is, that it is said, <q>these things were in
an <hi>Interegnum.</hi> Which he saith is impossible in an heredetary Kingdom,
where the King never Dyeth.</q> Whether the Author of the <hi>2d Vindication,</hi> spake

I am sure there was then no exercise of Government; either in the State, or in
Church, which could take course with what was amiss; and if the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

this bold Asserter, by defending their own Deed in a way suitable to their

<hi>W.</hi> the Government is in no safe Condition. It is said <hi>2d Vindication, P.</hi> 26,
<q>the oppressed people having <hi>Potentiam,</hi> tho' not <hi>Potestatem,</hi> it was not to be
wondred at,</q> that they relieved themselves: Whence our Author very wisely
observeth; <q>it is no new thing for <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to think power a sufficient Call
to Act Illegally:</q> As if these were Equivalent Terms; it is not to be wondred
at, if such a thing be done: And there is a sufficient Call to do it: The one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
no more, but that there was Provocation; which we affirm that the
<hi>Rable</hi> had, The other that they had warrant, and that they did well in what
they did: Which was never Asserted in the Book that he Refuteth; but often,
and expresly disowned.</p>
            <p>He doth indeed make a real Contradiction (which it seems he behooved to
do; for he could find none) whereas he alledgeth that <hi>P.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>61. it is said, <q>in
<hi>Galloway</hi> the Incumbents were generally driven away: And yet elsewhere, they
deserted without Threatning, or Compulsion.</q> The strength of this Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
lyeth in his leaving out half of the Sentence that he citeth (by the like
means he might make the Scripture speak Blasphemy: And so the Devil cited it
when he tempted Christ to cast himself Headlong) the Authors words are <q>in
<hi>Galloway</hi> the Incumbents were generally driven away,</q> or Deserted. We have
next <hi>P.</hi> 80 a horrible Contradiction: it is said <hi>P.</hi> 34 <q>That the Rable went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from Mr. <hi>Skinners</hi> House after they had Eaten. and <hi>P.</hi> 27. they took the
Poors Box by force out of the House of Mr. <hi>Russel,</hi>
               </q> and yet it is said <hi>P,</hi> 29,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41752:16"/>
that they are misrepresented, when it is said that they did Eat and Drink at the
Expence of them whom they Rabled: And that all the Reports of them, give
<q>account of their not laying their hands on the Prey <hi>Est. 2. 15. A.</hi>
               </q> At Mr. <hi>Skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
House, they did Eat at the Invitation of the Mr of the Family: Neither
did they any violence to that Family; both which are expressed in the place that our
Author citeth: But it was not fit to take notice of these Circumstances, for it
would have spoiled the designed Contradiction: If he can instance, where they
took Meat or Drink by force, than may be Glory in a Contradiction, at lest a
Falsehood. For <hi>taking the Poors Box,</hi> it was not laying hand on the Prey; for
they offered Security, that the Box, and Money and other Utensils of the Church,
should be safely kept, and restored to them who should be concerned in that
Church: But this also must be overlookt for the former Reason: If he can make
it appear, that they put any of these Goods to any other than the proper use, or
disposed of them to themselves, he should say somewhat to the purpose.</p>
            <p>Yet another Contradiction, <hi>P. 80<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> it is said 2 <hi>Vind, P,</hi> 145. <q>it is better that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Scotland</hi> be not united, than that the Institutions of Christ should be
thwarted; And yet it is said, may not two Nations Trade together, and be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by the same Laws: And yet bear with one another, as to Church
ways?</q> I confess my shallow wit cannot reach a Contradiction in these two Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The Author is there Answering an Argument brought why <hi>Episcopacy</hi>
should be the Church Government of <hi>Scotland,</hi> because without it we can not
have a National Union with <hi>England;</hi> and he bringeth these two Answers; either
of which is sufficient. If he think that the Author of the <hi>2d Vindication</hi> meant, that
<hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> might be united in Trade, and Civil Government; and
yet not so united: Then certainly, either that Author or this, must be a very
Dunse. On this occasion he asketh; <q>may not the West of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the
other parts of that Kingdom Trade together, and be Governed by the same
Laws, And yet the West not impose their Kirk ways on the rest of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</q>
And here he Triumpheth, with a <hi>Responde Gilberte.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>—Some will think this fine Notion no great matter of triumph; but rather it
exposeth the meanness of the Authors understanding. I hope he will accept of a
rational Answer, tho' it be from another hand then Mr. <hi>Rules,</hi> whom he there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulteth
over. I say first; there were no inconsistency, nor would imply both
parts of a Contradiction, if <hi>Presbytry</hi> should be in the West, and <hi>Episcopacy</hi> in other
parts of the Nation: tho' it might breed much breed much Confusion; and were an irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
setlement, <hi>Scotland</hi> being one National Church. 2. The Reason why the
same Government should be setled all the Nation over, is, because there is but
one Government instituted, or warranted in Scripture. If our Rulers had other
grounds for this determination, these do not weaken, but strengthen this. 3. It
is false that the West imposeth on the rest of the Nation: The Law hath setled
the same Church Government through the whole Nation; and it is not in the
West only that that Government is desired by Ministers and People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:41752:16"/>
Amidst his pretended Contradictions he findeth <hi>P.</hi> 81. some other faults, with
this Book, that it saith <hi>P, 151, Presbyterian Government was setled by Christ:</hi> And
this he doubteth <q>whether it be an Oath, or not: but saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it is an Oath is
most natural to the words.</q> An intelligent Reader will wonder how such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
could be put upon such words by one whose witt is not a wool-gathering:
But his wonder shall be increased if he shall Read the whole passage out of the Book
it self, which is, <q>we desired to meet for other ends, than setling the Presbyterian
Government, we know it was setled long before by Christ as his institution</q> But
fain he would disprove the truth of this assertion which he endeavoureth by two
Topicks, well suited to the size of his Learning: The former is, he setteth
down a most Ridiculous parcel of Arguments against <hi>Episcopacy;</hi> which he saith,
<hi>is our ordinary Cant:</hi> Can he produce any Author among us that ever used such a
way of a Reasoning? And this he is obliged to do, seing that which he professeth
to be now on, is, to give some expressions out of their Printed Books, as the Title
of this his second Section beareth: If the meannest of our party should talk at that
Rate, we would sharply Rebuke them: If there be not on our side found stronger
Arguments against <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> we shall yeild the cause. If he cannot tell us
where these passages are to be found (as he hath not done) I leave to the World
to pass a Judgement on his Conscience and Honesty; I take notice of two things
that he observeth, before I come to his other mighty Argument. One is, <q>we
never call the Apostle St. <hi>Paul;</hi> because he never Swore the Solemn League
and Covenant:</q> This is to talk Ridiculously, I will give him better Reasons for this
our Practice (tho' we can bear with them that do otherwayes than we do) one is
we usually give that Glorious Instrument in the work of the Gospel, a more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Title than that of <hi>Saint; the Apostle Paul.</hi> Every Good Man is a Saint; and
every one Canonized is called <hi>Saint:</hi> But every one is not called <hi>an Apostle:</hi>
Again the Title of Saint before the name of any person doth (in the Popish Church
from whence we derive this Custom) absolutely depend on the Popes Canoniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that person, as that of <hi>Sir</hi> prefixed to ones name, on the Kings Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him. They do not call a Man <hi>Saint</hi> only because he lived a Holy Life on
Earth, and is now in Heaven: For then <hi>Moses, Aaron, David,</hi> &amp;c. should have
this Title prefixed to their Name, which the Men I now debate with will not
allow, nor do they practise it. Farther it may be made appear that the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church did not thus <hi>Saint.</hi> Men, but when she also Worshiped them, and their
Relicts. As the Learned <hi>Mede Comment in Clav Apocal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pt</hi> sheweth out of <hi>Surios</hi>
in <hi>T: 6. No:</hi> 28. <q>That when from <hi>Council: Constant:</hi> under <hi>Comstantin: Iconomach:</hi>
Some were sent to convince <hi>Stephen</hi> the Monk, he accused them, that they
had banished the Name of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Saint, and would have these Holy Men called
only Apostles and Martyrs.</q> And <hi>Cedrenus</hi> telleth us, <q>That the same <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
made an universal Law (which, saith <hi>Mede,</hi> was no doubt according
to the Sentence of the Council) that none of the Servants of the Lord should
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41752:17"/>
be called Saint, but that their Relicts, if found, should be neglected.</q> Hence
some will inferr, that the use of this <hi>Praenomen</hi> began with <hi>St. Worship,</hi> though
afterwards it was confirmed by Canonization, as <hi>St. Worship</hi> also was by the <hi>Pope;</hi>
and therefore they ought to be laid aside together. It is true Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> laboureth
to appropriate this Prohibition to the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as signifying <hi>the honour of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession:</hi>
But I would gladly know what other Epithete, which can betranslated <hi>St.</hi> they
put in the stead of it. Neither do I find ground from any good Author that ever <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
signified an <hi>Intercessor,</hi> But enough of this Digression, which is sufficient to excuse
<hi>Presbyterians,</hi> in this matter. Another thing I note on this first Argument of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
that he saith, the Author of the <hi>2d Vind.</hi> from these <hi>(viz.</hi> the senseless Discourse
that he had framed for us) and such like Arguments: <q>Allows no Church, but the
Presbyterian to be of Divine Institution; and unchurcheth all the Episcopal
Churches; while yet he denyeth not Papists to be lawful Ministers.</q> The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity
of this Allegation is manifest to any that have Read the Book he
mentioneth; for from the beginning to the end of it, neither any of these
Arguments, nor any such Arguments are mentioned, if he can point
to the place where they are to be found, I shall bear what blame he
pleaseth to affix upon me, on this account. The Conclusion also that he draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from these, and such like Arguments is falsely, and Disingeniously ascribed
to that Author: For no such Conclusion is to be found in his Book, we ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<hi>Episcopal</hi> Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be true Churches, and their Ministers to be
true Ministers. His other Argument is, <q>if he can but refure the Learned Dr.
<hi>Pearsons</hi> Defence of <hi>Ignatius Epistles,</hi> or shew us any authentick record, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Antient History, that Presbytry was ever the Government of the
Church;</q> than we shall yeild the Cause. If he will not be of our Opinion
without this condition, let him even enjoy his own: For all that can be demanded
that way having been abundantly done by several of our Perswasion: neither
that Author, nor I, think it with our while to essay any thing farther for the sake
of such a pitiful Pamphlets as this: But if he will please to Answer what our Men
have Written; it is like what he bringeth may be considered. It had been as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
by some of the Pamphleters Answered in the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d Vind,</hi> 
               <q>that in stead of
14 Bishops, 60 were set up to Rule the Church:</q> And he is pleased to call the
Answer to this, <hi>Quibbles,</hi> but thinketh not fit to give any return to what is said
in disproving of that absurd Assertion: And so the whole of it standeth in its intire
strength: only he affirmeth that <q>all there said dependeth on this Supposition,
that the Parliament is the Church,</q> because that the Parliament put the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into the hand of those 60. It is strange that this Writter will needs have
the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers, and Elders in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when the Government was
setled by Parliament to be but 60. Where in the Book he pretendeth to Answer, it
was told him that their Representative, the <hi>General Assembly,</hi> consisted of 116
Ministers, and 47 Ruling Elders; and nothing said to disprove it: But some
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41752:17"/>
will keep to the Conclusion, let the premisses be what they will; We are far from
making the Parliament the Church: The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had intrinsick Power to
Govern the Church, and what the Parliament did was no more but allowing the
Exercise of this Power, and adding their civil Sanction to it. <hi>P. 82 P.</hi> 83. He is
very Angry with an Assertion, that <hi>We are for Moderation;</hi> and on the contrary
he bringeth a multitude of Accusations against us, partly false, and all of them
abundantly answered, as of old<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when things were recent, so lately in the <hi>1st</hi> and <hi>2d
Vind:</hi> To which Answers he doth not pretend to Reply any thing, but confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repeateth the former Imputations. It is in vain to debate with Men of this
strain, or to Answer what they say: I have seen some Scolds so insist, in spite
of all Reason that could be brought against them: But for Men pretending to
Learning to use such a Method, is not usual. He speaketh <hi>P.</hi> 83. of an Answer
given in <hi>2d. Vind: P.</hi> 157 about a Protestation given by some Presbyters against
the King, and some Acts of Parliament. I have lookt over that Page, and some
before and after it, and can find no such Passage: and therefore must leave it
till he give us a more distinct Information about it. He findeth (as he fancieth)
a plain Contradiction; That it is said <hi>ibid:</hi> 
               <q>That the fatal Division about Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
and Remonstrance was not so much as mentioned among us: And yet
it was moved that some of the Sentences of the Remonstrators should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off</q> What was moved in the Assembly was, That some Brethren had
been deposed in the time of our late Differences, and these Sentences were taken
off by other Judicatories, that this might be confirmed by the General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
which was done. Is here any reviving of these Differences: If he Childish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lay the Stress on the Word <hi>[mentioning these Differences]</hi> he may know that
old Debates are said not to be mentioned, when they are sopite, not contended
about, nor do divide the Church into Factions; though they be discoursed of,
as things that once had a Beeing. He quarrelleth <hi>P.</hi> 84, with the Constitution
of the <hi>General Assembly;</hi> but will not be at the pains to Answer what hath been
answered to either himself, or some of his Brethren, making the same objection,
in their former Pamphlets. It was a <hi>General Assembly</hi> of the <hi>Presbyterian Church,</hi>
which had the ruling Power by Law, as it always had a Right to it by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.

pretty odly. For his Vindication I recommend it to any who in this would

Raileth, but doth not argue. I hope the want of the Kings Authority could
not make the matter of the Oath to be bad, if it be otherwise good. Neither did
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41752:18"/>
the Covenant want the Royal Authority: The National Covenant was signed
by K. <hi>I.</hi> and by <hi>C.</hi> 2. and the League and Covenant also by the Latter.</p>
            <p>Again it is said by Mr. <hi>M.</hi> that the <hi>submitting of some to Reordination is Scandalous</hi>
All that he hath in Answer to this is, <hi>some of the Reformed French did submit to it,</hi> E.
It is not Scandalous. If this be a good Argument I could tell him some of the
French Protestant Ministers, and those of the most Eminent that came to <hi>England</hi>
refused to submit to it, E. It is Scandalous; His account of Subscribing a Paper
that was said to be the Oath of Canonical Obedience, our Author is pleased to
call <hi>Shufting and Shifting:</hi> And this is all the Refutation he thinketh needful to
to that Discourse; and so it standeth in its intire strength. That <hi>he lamented and
yet continued in his Canonical obedience.</hi> Is an invidious Representation. He La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
his signing of that Paper: he did nothing but what he thought himself
obliged to though he had never signed such a Paper, which was not formal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
Obedience; but performing of these Duties that his office obliged him to,
tho' there had been no Bishop in the World. He putteth off all the rest of this
Letter and the Book in which it is, by telling us it needed no Answer; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be so or not, let the Readers judge.</p>
            <p>He now undertaketh another Antagonist, the famous Learned and Holy Mr

whose same shall remain in the Learned World, when the name of such an One as
this Scribler shall Rot. Among the many excellent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rks of that Author, he
singleth out his Letters; which were written on several occasions, in a famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
(but most Heavenly and affecting Stile) to private persons, some of them but
of ordinary Capacity, tho' of eminent Piety: And without any design of being
made more publick then between the Writer and Receiver. These were many
years after his Death collected, and printed by a great Honourer of Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

In these Letters there are many passages that are expressed in words
not very Common but very apt and significant, and many homely similitudes are
used; but these most plain and expressive of the thing designed. But I challenge
this <hi>Moinus,</hi> with all his Critical skill, to shew any thing in them that is unsound,
that is derogatory from the Majesty of God, or the Glorious Excellency of our
Redeemer, or that tendeth to corrupt the Soul; and not to engage it to Christ,
and to the way of Holiness. There are indeed many passages uninte ligible by two
sorts of persons, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>English</hi> Men, who are not throughly acquainted with
our Language: And by Men who are unacquainted with the Exercises of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Soul, and its Communion with God in Christ: which I suppose gave the
occasion of this Writters Laborious transcribing these passages. There are many
who speak Evil of the things they know not. Let them who are acquainted with
the Mystery and power of Religion, consider these Letters, and I am perswaded
that, so far as they understand the Language they are written in, they will have
other thoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41752:19"/>
our Author hath one short observation, which if ye will believe it (and ye have
his word for it) will make all these Letters most absurd: that is <hi>P.</hi> 95 all that is
meant here by Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is <hi>Presbyterian Government.</hi> If <hi>Presbyterians</hi> know, nor
mind no more of Christ but that, Let them be hissed at and abhorred by all the
World; can the Man who uttered this word have any regard to Conscience,
or Credit? Is he to be lookt on as one who understandeth what he re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

one day <hi>be made strong?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He concludeth this Section with our Principles about Civil Government,
which he proveth out of some passages in publick Papers in time of the late War
between King and Parliament. These were the effect of the unhappy differences,
that then were; which were man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the Church, that was drawn along with them, did not consist of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi>
wholly (tho' that was then the publick profession) as did appear when
<hi>Episcopacy</hi> was after set up. What he citeth out of the <hi>Hind let loose,</hi> and <hi>Jus Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli,</hi>
we will not Answer: For these Books were never owned by all, nor the
generality of the more judicious <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now proceed to his third, and last Section, in the former of which he hath
made a Collection of Notes of Sermons; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in the latter of passages in Prayer
said to be uttered by <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers. I joyn these Sections together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they contain things of the same nature, and the Answer to them is the
same. To examine all the particular stories here set down (considering to what
distant times and places they relate) would take much time, much pains, and
also no small expence, for intelligence: And when all this were bestowed, the result
would not be <hi>Operae pretium;</hi> tho' we should find all to be Lies; for many of them
carry their improbability and falsehood in their face, and will be believed by none
who is acquainted with <hi>Scotland</hi> nor by Strangers who have not enslaved their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity
to a party, whose work it is to disparage their Opposits, and to get esteem to
themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>Forgeries,</hi> Nor can the impudence of this Author, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<hi>P.</hi> 116. in his asserting the truth of what he hath writen, be able to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
upon judicious and unbyassed persons.</p>
            <p>I shall not say, that all that he hath here narrated is Lies, and pure Forgeries;
(tho' I solemnly declare that I know not any one passage among them to be folly
true, as he relateth them; nor can I meet with any person who hath such know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of them) for I know there are among us some who are not: so polished as
they should be, who may be guilty of some expressions that are rude,
unexact, or too course or bald, and unbesee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing the gravity and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Gospel Truths. But I gladly would know what party of Men are,
or ever were in the World consisting of so many Individuals, among whom
some such might not be found. I am sure the <hi>Episcopalians</hi> cannot pretend to it:
if we were disposed, so to imploy our selves (but we abhore to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
and that without <hi>Lying</hi> or <hi>Forgery;</hi> I do not say we could equalize him for vile, and
absurd Stories: For I do not believe that it is incident to Men who bear the
Christian name, or that ever stept into a Pulpit in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to speak some of the
things he here relateth: and therefore we will not vie with him in the Talent of
Writing at this rate. But we could make it appear that his party hath no cause
to Glory over ours, in the matter of freedom from indecencies in Preaching and
Prayer. Wherefore it is evident that the tendency of this part of his Book is to
expose his Nation to the contempt of Strangers; yea to make the work of
Preaching Ridiculous to a profane, Atheistical Generation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who already misregard it</p>
            <p>The Stories that he (with the help of a Cabal of the same spirit with himself) hath
collected for <hi>P.</hi> 116. he mentioneth the <hi>Collectors</hi> of these Notes are not all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
absurd, some of them being horrid Blasphemies; others Ridiculous Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense;
some false Doctrine: Some scurrilously obscene; and there are some
which have no other evil in them, but that the manner of expression is undecent,
and too mean. So what is here narrated is not equal, as to truth or ground and
occasion given for such Stories. Sometimes he disguiseth what was truly said,
and putteth it in another dress, to make it Ridiculous or absurd: others he mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
up, by tacking 2 or 3 passages together, which might be spoken at diverse
times, and diverse occasions, and little harm in them: but when blended into
one, they appear odd and become unsavoury. Others again are pure fiction, and
no occasion given for such Report; but the witt of the Caball is both Father
and Mother to them, and this Scribler is the Midwife at least. If I give a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of this kind, and bid him (or any else) defiance to prove them by any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
Testimony, I hope the Reader will think his whole Collections sufficiently
discredited, and this part of his Book refuted. I give for instances two Stories of
Mr. <hi>Kirton, P.</hi> 105. another of his <hi>P.</hi> 107. and of Mr. <hi>Kennedy, Ibid.</hi> also these of
Mr. <hi>Artkine,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Kirton P.</hi> 108. and one of him in the top of <hi>P:</hi> 110, and the <hi>1st</hi>
two of him <hi>P.</hi> 111. that Prayer of Mr. <hi>Blair P,</hi> 113, and especially what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
affirmeth that several in the Meeting-Houses of late have made use of the
same expression: That Prayer ascribed to a head of a Colledge, <hi>P.</hi> 114. and that
which followeth, beginning, <hi>Good Lord what have ye been doing</hi> &amp;c. That Prayer
about the Election of Parliament Members at <hi>Edinburgh, P,</hi> 115. and the <hi>1st</hi> of
Mr. <hi>Areskine, Ibid,</hi> that of Mr. <hi>Rule Ibid,</hi> that Prayer of the Minister at the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of the Assembly: I might mention abundance more of them, which are
as false and groundless Forgeries as ever were uttered by any Tongue: But these
may suffice for a taste of the honesty of this Author, and his Collectors.</p>
            <p>What followeth in the last page sheweth to what an height of Boldness one may
come in averring known falsehoods, when he is left of God, to invent and
spread them. Hence this Author hath the Brow to say <q>these are but a few of
many thousand instances and that these are dayly used in their Preachings and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41752:20"/>
Prayers: Also, that though Strangers will hardly believe these, yet they who
are unfortunatly bound to converse with them are sadly sensible that all is true.
And that many of the worst expressions are purposely left out:</q> And this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footh,
under pretence <q>of tenderness to offend the Ears and Eyes of Modest
Readers, (O horrid Hypocrisy) and that thousands in <hi>Scotland</hi> of the best Rank
and Reputation are ready to attest these.</q> Also, that <q>Presbyterians will not
deny what they so much Glory in, <hi>viz.</hi> This extraordinary way of Preaching
and Praying, which they think an excellency and perfection, and call it a Holy
Familiarity with God;</q> and a peculiar priviledge of the most refined Saints.
Not one word of truth is in all this: The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are so far from Glorying
in such Praying and Preaching, that they abhore it, and Judge, that they against
whom such things can be proved, ought to be severly Rebuked for the least of
these: And for others of them, cast out of the Ministry and no more be suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to profane so Holy a Work, as Preaching is.</p>

deservedly been famous among the Churches of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> To receive all

Conduct as is intollerable in one who pretendeth to inform the World of the
Truth and Certainty of all Occurrences.</p>
            <p>I intended farther to expose this Author, but hearing that by his Death we are
out of hazard of being Injured by him a second time, I onely shall give a true Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of what he hath misrepresented: And for some other Reasons I shall forbear
a more full narrative which once was intended. He saith <hi>P.</hi> 147. <q>That a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
of the Presbyterians in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               </q> met (I suppose he meaneth of the General
Assembly, which was indicted by Royal Authority, with consent of the former
Assembly, which begun at <hi>Edinburgh January 15. 1690)</hi> 
               <q>that they came to some
Heats in that Assembly; so that the Earl of <hi>Lothian,</hi> finding their Heats increase,
dissolved the Synod.</q> Here are two palpable Falsehoods in one Breath; One is,
That <hi>they came to Heats in that Assembly;</hi> and that <hi>these Heats increased.</hi> Nothing
could be affirmed with less semblance of Truth. I believe seldom have so great
a body of Men met about so weighty and difficult Affairs, among whom less did
appear that could be called <hi>Heat.</hi> They had no Heat with the Episcopal Men,
who made Address to them; but treated them with all Respect and Civility,
(which they themselves did publickly acknowledge) tho' they could not yield to
what they demanded, for good and weighty Reasons, which they gave for their
determination. Neither was there any Heat among themselves, but did Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
debate Matters in the Committee, and concluded on what Course should
be taken: In the Assembly it self, the Matter was not so much as debated: The
Opinion of the Committee not being brought in before they were dissolved. The
other Falsehood is. That <hi>the Earl of</hi> Lothian <hi>dissolved the Assembly on account of their
Heats.</hi> This is so far from Truth, that his Grace never complained of any Heats, nor
mentioned any such cause of his dissolving them, but only that <hi>they had sat long, and
had not brought their Business to a period.</hi> There was indeed some confusion at the
dissolution of the Assembly, by a Cry that was raised in the House: but that was the
effect of the Dissolution (or rather of the manner of it) not the moving Cause.</p>
            <p>The Mercury doth farther Injure the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the Remarks that
he maketh on his own false History: Calling the Presbyterians <q>A Terrible sort
of People, that for the most part we find nothing in their Assemblies but Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union,
Discord, and a Spirit of Persecution.</q> No Answer is fit for such an
indefinite Charge against a whole Church, but to deny the truth of it; and bid
defyance to her Adversaries (whose Tool this Man was) to prove what they lybel
against her: Every one will see that this pitiful Historian hath brought nothing
that can bear such a Conclusion. It is also too great Impudence and Petulancy
for a Stranger to talk at this rate, against a Church so much honoured by all
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41752:21"/>
Learned and Good Men, who have known her, or her Principles and Way; and
that on so slender Ground, as the Information of her sworn Enemies: And when
even what Account he hath given (which is wholly false) if true, could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to what deserveth such a Censure: What if they had unreasonably refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Communion with a sort of Men who had stept out of the way, and who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
had so heavily persecuted them? Is this the whole of their Actings in
their Assemblies? Make they no good Acts? Do they nothing for bearing down
Sin and advancing of Holiness? He next compareth them to <hi>the Priests of</hi> Spain,
and saith, <hi>They would erect an Inquisition Tribunal if they were not restrained.</hi> If

that is like the <hi>Inquisition Tribunal?</hi> Whom have we Imprisoned? Whom have
we Burnt, or Fined, or Banished? What Civil Punishments have we inflicted?
Or have we Censured any person for Truth? Or forced any to tell the secret
Thoughts of their Heart, and then taken their Lives for them? But why do I
take so much notice of his spite against us: It is also spued out against <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
in general; and these in other places as well as <hi>Scotland.</hi> What Religion
he was of for his Principles. I know not; but I am sure in this Narrative, and

up the War between the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the <hi>Pope.</hi> But wherein, I pray you, lyeth
this Similitnde, do any of us medle in the Affairs of State, or in the making of
Peace or War? Do also the Ministers of <hi>Holland</hi> intermix in these Affairs? The
design of all this Clamour is evident to be that the Church, as well as the State,
should give a vast <hi>Toleration,</hi> and that of all kind of Opinions and Church Practices, that the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi>
should allow them who are for the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> to Govern the <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
Church; and suffer <hi>Arminians</hi> to Teach, and spread their Doctrine in the Congregations which
are intrusted to the care of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and of whose Souls they must give an account: And
the Ministers of <hi>Holland</hi> should allow Arminians to be Ministers and Elders, to Teach and Rule
their Flocks. And that it is not enough that they do not trouble them while they seduce their own
followers; but they must incorporate with them, as one Body, both for Teaching and Ruling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And nothing will please this Man but the Magistrates persecuting the Church, unless she will take
Vipers into her Bosom. We plead not that Ministers <hi>may be suffered to do what they please;</hi> as he
invidiously representeth the Matter: If Ministers transgress the Laws, let them be punished: If
they oppress their Neighbours, let them be restrained. But it is no good service to the interest of
Religion, to stir up the Magistrat to restrain the Church from exercising that Government and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
that Christ hath instituted, and the Law doth allow. It may rather be said, That it will not
be well with the Reformed World, if one of this Man's Temper be <hi>suffered to write what he pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;</hi>
and that as the publick Intelligence.</p>
