            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>OUr beloued Brother Mr. He. Cl.
after no small trauell, he finished a

booke lying in myne house for a season,
I procured the third chapter of the Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
(the whole contaynes about 26. ch.) to
be copied out for myne owne vse, what
tyme both Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Booke was presently
(by reason of busines in England) to be
sundred from me. In whose absence, as I
tooke no small delite in the same chapter,
so I demed it my duty (not knowing
when the whole might be published) to
put it in print for publike vtility. If cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous

such hearing is tyed to preaching: 3, and
it must be the word of God preached, that

not Antichristian: for Ministers
sent of Satan, or els of God in his wrath

a Sowle cannot be possessed with faith,

so, the spirituall father (at least) must ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue

By the way therefore to say, that the

it hath bene somtymes wholy invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
it is passing false. For as none can

and that cannot so be preached
of anie except they be sent of God: so, all
this cannot be without externall Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

Which <hi>Iesus</hi> (in english, <hi>Sauiour)</hi> must
be confessed the <hi>Christ</hi> (in english, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted:</hi>
in hebrue, <hi>Messiah)</hi> that is,
that blessed One which from Adams fall
was frely promised of God to be sent in

by prophecy, sacrifice and
invisible powre: weakly fore-figured
by the annoynted Prophets, Preists and

how can anie be sayd to haue faith in
him, that confesse not they beleiue him to
be that One which saueth his people, as
the Lord had appoynted. Nor can this
be without beleyuing him to be the
<note n="*" place="margin">Math. 16 16. 17.</note> Son of the liuing GOD, the beleif
<pb facs="tcp:11532:6"/>
whereof is sayd, not to com by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
off flesh and Blood, but by our
father which is in heauen. And vppon
the confession of this,<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 8. 37.</note> Philip baptised
the Eunuch. Nor is this to be marvay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at, seing the epithet <hi>Livinge,</hi> it distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
the true GOD from all false
Gods: and the beleiving Iesus to be
his Son sent for sauing such as com vnto
God by him, it is to flesh and blood vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable.
And that we se in the Iues,
who held it blasphemy (or an euell speach)
in him, to make himself the Son of God.
To haue made himself the Son of God
but only in regard of this obedience to
God, that they wold not terme an euell
speach (for they thought so of themselues
and theyr princes but teaching himself so
to be Son, as he is and euer was one
with the father (that is, the same<note n="*" place="margin">Micah. 5 2.</note> for es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence

helde blasphemie.<note place="margin">Pro. 8. 23.</note> The impossibility of

               <hi>Com in our Nature]</hi> This nature of
Man (body and sowle) assumed of him,
this the Iues sawe: but that nature
whereby he was the only begotten of the
father (figured in <hi>Isaac,</hi> thonly begotten
of Abram <hi>hy-father)</hi> that the naturall<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy
sawe not, and therefore beleiued not.
<pb facs="tcp:11532:7"/>
The humaine nature was not in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
amongst the Iues (for that they veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sawe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d felt without ani guiste of faith)
but to acknowledge this visible nature
assumed of the former invisible nature,
that required the fathers revelation: as
the humaine nature the mothers declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And this nature was figured by
the Ramme that was sacrificed for <hi>Isaac.</hi>
And both of them foretyped<note n="‡" place="margin">

Hegoates, whereof the One died (Body
in his kynd, and the sowle in his kynde,
both being but Man, and death otherwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
raigning ouer both: which a late writer
shold haue obserued, before herein he had
so easilie contradicted the Auntients) that
One died for satisfying <hi>Iehouah</hi> for Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els

God his boyling indignation, so far was
it from scapinge) thother scaped carying
Syn (as Captiuity captiue) into the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce

And yet in this same humaine nature,
touching the manner of generation, the
reason of faith is also required. For that
cawse I adde:</p>

preached of old: but the mysterie touching
the manner of his Conception, that was
concealed till his comminge. And yet this
mysterie was before preached vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert

<hi>Samuel:</hi> so we se theyr mothers <hi>(Satah,

not by naturall course (though Nature
not reiected) but by promise and Grace.
Touching the end of whose comming,
this must be confessed:</p>

no One to help or vpholde that, according

Thus much touching a visible Christian
<pb facs="tcp:11532:10"/>
vnbaptized, who by reason of such fayth
and avowed allegiance cannot but couet
baptisme: nor may be denyed Baptisme.
Who, as he is by the ministrie of Som
begotten vnto the fayth, so is he not to
refuse the seale of his fayth by such minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie:
euen as the Males vnder the lawe
received Circumcision by the ministrie of
theyr Parents. And such subiection is
due vnder payne of being cut of from Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.
I meane, such refusers of Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
by the ministry of such as haue begot
them (notwithstanding all other protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of fayth and obedience) they are
to stand excommunicate to the Church,
because they rebell agaynst the glorious
seale of entring into the Church: for<note n="“" place="margin">Ge. 17. 14</note> so
they cast themselues out of the Covenant,
whereinto they were entred by such a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall

<hi>it is of absolute necessity that they be found

spirituall defects we are to admonish,

adding this:</hi> The Apostle elsvvhere
saith, the stipend of Syn is death, but here
he sayth not, the stipend of Righteousnes is
lyfe eternall, But, the Grace of God is life
