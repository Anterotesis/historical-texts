            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALL the account I can give of this Book, or the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi> is in the following Letter which came to my hands a few dayes after I received these Sheets, and is prefixed to them in stead of a <hi>Preface.</hi>

               <head>For the <hi>Stationer.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THough these <hi>Dialogues</hi> were brought to you by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand than my own, yet since it is upon my motion that they came to be Published, contrary
<pb facs="tcp:44658:3"/>
to the <hi>Authors</hi> design, and truly without his order: I think my self oblidged to say somewhat of the <hi>Author</hi> and the book, and the rather that the <hi>Author,</hi> not being forward to the publishing of it, will say nothing of <hi>Preface</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; But withall, I am resolved you shall be as ignorant of the <hi>Writter</hi> of this, as of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of the Book.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Author</hi> is a person of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary moderation and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablness: he can allow any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of opinion, but such as is incompatible with the peace and quiet of the Church. And though there be some expressions
<pb facs="tcp:44658:3"/>
in these <hi>Dialogues</hi> that would appear tart; yet it is meerly occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by the zeal he hath against that uncharitable spirit, which can allow of nothing that is not exactly of their own way.</p>
               <p>The occasion of writting in this way, was, that a Book of the same title and nature, printed in <hi>England,</hi> came to the <hi>Author's</hi> hands; and he, being pleased with that familiar way of Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, thought presently of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>Dialogues</hi> suitable to our <hi>Differences</hi> here, as that was to the <hi>Differences</hi> of that <hi>Nation</hi>: If there be any thing in this coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident with that Book, it is in
<pb facs="tcp:44658:4"/>
such things as the humours of that unquiet spirit in both <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are the same. And the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> designs not vanity by these few <hi>sheets,</hi> written, to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in as few houres as they could hardly be transcribed; But wisheth every one to see the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of those grounds upon which such specious structurs are built; which when they come to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, prove but painted sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres.</p>
               <p>The great design of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> in this small Book, is, to let some well-meaning people, who have a love to godlinesse, see that <hi>Religion</hi> is not at all concerned
<pb facs="tcp:44658:4"/>
in things wherein they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themselves very much, and that in contending for the <hi>shell</hi> we are like to loose the <hi>kernell</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The language and manner of Writting, is accommodated to these meaner capacities, who are most apt to be abused, by such as care not, nay, which is very sad, but too true, wish not <hi>Religion</hi> nor godliness to prosper in the hands of those who differ from them in opinion about externall things, vvhich are not of great moment: as may appear from their persvvading poor souls to take for a mark of zeal that which in al

               <p>May be it was more sweetly then sincerly; for to tell you of an interest in him, while you are strangers to his Laws and Gospel, is to deceive you: since you can have no interest in the blood of Christ, till you have his Spirit dwelling in you.</p>

               <p>It is very true, that we are saved by the blood of Christ: but it is as true, that we must be puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his Spirit, else we are none of his. If by renouncing your own righteousnesse; you mean, what you naturally can perform without grace,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44658:8"/>
you are in the right, but if you lean so to Christs righteousnesse, as to neglect to be righteous your self, you with <hi>Iudas,</hi> kiss your Master, while you betray him. And <hi>I</hi> fear your Ministers studied more to convince you of the need of Christs righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then of having any of your own: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is a cheap Religion, to lean so intirely to Christ, that we do nothing our selves.</p>

               <p>Truly your practices tell, you think there is as little need of them to Salvation, as to Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, remember the Gospel is plain and simple, and came not to teach men Sophistry or Logick: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>I</hi> shall not contend with you about words or phrases: for as <hi>I</hi> believe, that Christ came to <hi>lay down his life a ransome for our sins</hi>; so if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that <hi>without holinesse we shall never see the face of God,</hi> we are agreed in this matter.

               <p>Yes, I hear some of you are still talking of holiness and peace, but you forget truth: which is so necessary, that without it holiness is but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie.</p>

               <p>I acknowledge that, if you speak of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Articles of our Faith. But all truths are not of equal certainty, nor of equal importance: now it is a certain and important truth, that there should be an unity in the Catholick Church; which

is not to be broken, but upon a matter of greater certainty and weight.</p>

               <p>If you were required to condemn or deny any thing you judged truth, <hi>I</hi> confesse you ought <hi>to obey God rather than man.</hi> But it is another case to quite the communion of the Church; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not, as you think, in the truth: unlesse that truth be of greater importance than is the Article of your Faith, <hi>The Catholick Church, and the communion of Saints.</hi> And when you are as sure of your call to contend for these truths, as <hi>Moses</hi> was of the will of God, you may use his words. Let me then examine you a little, how do you know your opinions are truths?</p>

               <p>Who can doubt of it? are they not the cause and interest of Christ, his Kingdom and Crown, his glorious work, to which we are all bound by the oath of God taken in the Covenant, whereinto even the children unborn are oblidged.</p>

like arrogant pride, and the other like the modest Spirit of Jesus Christ.</p>

               <p>I confesse it was so the work of God, as the Prophet said, <hi>is there any evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it</hi>: but in the sense you take it, it was as far from it, as darknesse is from light.</p>

               <p>I confesse you studied to represse some sins: so did the Pharisees. But remember the Apostle divides <hi>filthinesse, in that of the flesh, and of the Spirit</hi>: and indeed, the latter proves a much sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiller and stronger opposition to the Gospel, than the former. It is true, some of these were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by you; though <hi>I</hi> must add, in a way, scarce suitable to the Gospel: but for other sins, you were very gentle to them, nay, were guilty of them your selves: for they mingled in all you did.</p>

               <p>I love moderation as much as any can, and declare to you once for all, that <hi>I</hi> have no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel at any, for their opinions in these matters: nor shall <hi>I</hi> labour to disgrace the leaders of your party, by searching into their private escapes; a practice much used by you against us, your mouthes being ever full of bitter reproaches against some of our way: but it is directly contrary to the Spirit of

Christ and his Gospel, wherein we are put in mind to speak evil of no man. <hi>I</hi> shall therefore from your publick and avowed actions, and printed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, shew how far you are out of the way of God.

               <p>It is yet under debate, whether it be the Cause of God: Suppose it were, shew me one place in either Testaments, that warrands Subjects fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Religion? you know <hi>I</hi> can bring many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it; yea, though the old dispensation was a more carnal and fiery one, than the new one is; yet, when the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> made A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy from the living God, into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neither do the Prophets that were sent by God, ever provoke them to any such courses. And you know the whole strain of the New Testament runs upon suffering.</p>

               <speaker>N.</speaker>
               <p>The law of nature teacheth us to defend our selves, and so there is no need of Scripture for it?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>This is marvelous dealing, in other things you alwayes flee from reason, as a carnal principle, to Scripture; but here you quite Scripture and appeal to it: but it seems you are yet a stranger
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44658:10"/>
to the very design of Religion, which is to tame and mortifie nature: and is not a natural thing, but supernatural. Therefore the rules of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and advancing it, must not be borrowed from nature, but grace: The Scriptures are also strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrived, since they ever tell us of suffering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der persecution: without giving your exception, that we resist when we are in a capacity. And <hi>I</hi> appeal to your conscience, whether it be a likelier way to advance Religion, fighting or suffering? since a carnal man can do the one, but not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>If there were not a God who governs the World, your reasoning might have force: but do you think that God cannot maintain his own right, but the wrath of man must work his righteousnesse? nay, we see the contrary, for from the beginning, till this day, God hath made the sufferings of his people, the chief mean of propagating Religion; whereas fighting hath been ever fatal to it. And Christ did begin the Gospel with his suffering, though he could have commanded Legions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels for his defence.</p>

               <p>Since you go to examples, rather begin with the Ages that immediatly followed Christ, in which for three hundred years the Gospel was preached and propagated by sufferings, but never by fighting, though their number enabled them to it, and they were irritated by the cruellest provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and persecutions: And it is to be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that they who saw and conversed with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, understood their meaning better than these who lived at so great a distance from them: I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge there was force used in our Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but so much the worse for that: And you know the enemy sowes his tares, even in that field, wherein the Wheat is sowen.

               <p>Truly, I expected to have heard some great matter from you, of the self-denial, contempt of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44658:15"/>
the world, resignation, humility, meeknesse, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, obedience, charity, abstraction of minde, and the other great heights of Christian Religion; but you tell me only of their external devotion, which how good soever it be, yet is far from being the Character of a Christian; since the very Pharisees were eminent in those things.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.</speaker>
               <p>I told you, you were carnal, and savoured not the things of God; you look after morality, as the great matter: but we look after true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>If by morality, you mean the affecting a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous behaviour, without a dependance on God and Christ, <hi>I</hi> have as low an account of it as any can have; but if by morality, you mean a pure and holy Conversation, <hi>I</hi> doubt it is the greatest and best part of Religion: Without which, the other parts are but hypocrisie and formality. But <hi>I</hi> shall examine all these things which seem to knit your hearts so much to that way: And shall begin with their diligence in repressing sin. <hi>I</hi> confesse they had a kind of Discipline: but it was wholly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the rules of the Gospel, and far short of the ancient Bishops discipline.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.</speaker>
               <p>I see you undervalue every thing we did, but <hi>I</hi> am sure you have no reason for it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>First then, were not your Church-Sessions like Birla-Courts, where every one came and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of wrongs, which belonged to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate: for the Church should only meddle with sins, as they are Scandals, and not as they are inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Next, Dilations, according to our Lords
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44658:15"/>
rule, should not be received, till the person be first privately admonished by the party offended; next, by two or three; and if he be obstinat, the Church should be told: But you observed no such rule. Next you imposed and exacted Fines, which was the Magistrate's work, whereas the Church should take no money, but what is offered in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. You also forced people to stoop to your Discipline, for if they refused, you threatned them with the temporal sword: which by the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse of the times, was too much at your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And this sheweth, that you did not carry on the Gospel, by a Gospel-spirit, though that was ever in your mouthes, but by secular wayes: for, offenders should come and offer themselves to Discipline, and not be driven to it. The time wherein your pennance lasted, was also short: the ancient Bishops did separate offenders, as many years, as you did weeks. It is also clear, you used Discipline to put a temporal shame upon offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: For you set them in a high place to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon, whereas they should have been rather set without the doors of the Church. And to conclude, how wretchedly did you abuse this? subjecting people to censure, for your triffling matters, when you knew they were acting a mock-penitence: and were more zealous to preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst oppositions to your courses, than against the oppositions to the everlasting Gospel.</p>

               <speaker>N.</speaker>
               <p>Now you tax us for what we were very free of: Was ever sin so boldly reproved, as in our Pulpits? Our Ministers sparing no rank nor quality.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I confesse some things, I say not sins, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved boldly enough: not sparing the Lords Anointed, whose pretended faults, you, like so many unnatural <hi>Hams,</hi> were ready enough to publish, when your so doing, could have no other effect, but to irritate his Subjects against him. How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten was that sacred Prince charged with Popery, Tyranny, and the Massacre of <hi>Ireland</hi>? and that Royal Family termed, the bloody-house? yea, after his accursed enemies had murdered him, when common humanity should have oblidged you to let the dead alone, and Christianity should have taught you to have had more reverent thoughts of one who died so piously and devoutly; yet you ceased not to persecute and tear his memorie, which in spite of your malice, will be glorious to all posterity: and that with the height of inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and barbarity, in the very hearing and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his Son, who now reigneth. This was your bold reproving of faults. But how little were you in secret reproving faults? When you got to the Pulpit, there indeed you triumphed, because you knew none were to oppose you. Now it is certain, reproofs should be begun in private, and not brought to publick; but upon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate rejecting of private admonitions. And for what end were you often so bitter to absents? This, and such other things could be upon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther design, but either maliciously to disgrace them, or to get a following among your party, and the name of faithfull, free, and zealous preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>

               <p>May be so, I wish both they and their Gifts had been seven-fold better than they were: but if I shall judge of them, either by their printed Sermons, or those I have heard, they are no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary things. And first, The half of their Sermons were upon publick matters: and what did these concern the Souls of the poor people? Was not this for bread, to give them a stone? Next, for the solid practises of a Christian life, I scarce ever heard them named, except overly. Whom heard you preach against the love of the world, seeking of esteem, quarrelling, seeking of revenge, anxiety and passion? Vertue was little preached, and far lesse practised.</p>

As for your spiritual Doctrine, the true heights of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality were as little preached, as the living much in abstraction, silence and solitude, the being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the still contemplations of God and Christ, the becoming dead to all things else, spending dayes and nights in secret fastings and prayers, how seldom were these things spoken of?</p>

I shall not here take notice of their strange methods, which they so much admired in preaching: though I could tell you how our Saviour and the Apostles used none of these: but <hi>I</hi> shall be sparing in this, it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of so great, or necessary concernment.</p>

               <p>I do approve of a part of it, and think it a pious and a Christian custome, to have Families worshipping God together, providing the way of it be grave and regular: of which <hi>I</hi> shall speak af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. But for Masters of Families, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Scripture, it is intollerable, unlesse they be very intelligent persons. How patent a way otherwise may this prove, for venting and broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing errours, and heresies? but I would not have you value this too much: Otherwise <hi>I</hi> shall send you to the religious houses in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where they have worship seven hours a day, in a word, those external things make not men good of themselves.</p>

               <p>Truly the thing in it self looks fair and well, but since these secret assemblings have been much scandalized, since also they may be a cloak for hatching mischievous practices, and for debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peoples minds into schism and faction, and to a contempt of the Publick Worship, they are not to be used. Let people meet as oft as they will in Church for Worship: and what is not fit to be said in a Church, is not fit to be said in a Chamber full of people.

This generation was engaged by you, ere they could well consider things, to your way, and your oaths, and then you strive to keep them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in a non-age, by telling them they must be stedfast, and that it is a snare after vowes to make  enquiry. And what strange doctrine is it, to tax  an obedience to the Laws of the Kingdom (when in our consciences we can so do) as time-serving?

               <p>This is well asserted: any thing in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that makes for you, call it ordinary, and what doth not please you, is extraordinary. But truly, since it is impossible to get a whole Church ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with such a Ministery, as were to be desired, it seems to be necessary, even in those dayes, to have an office of Evangelists. But further, in what place of Scripture read you your classical Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Sessions to Presbyteries, <hi>&amp;c</hi>? This <hi>I</hi> acknowledge is rational and orderly, but founded upon no divine right.</p>

               <p>How did they of <hi>Antioch</hi> send up to these at <hi>Ierusalem?</hi> and are not <hi>the spirits of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets subject to the Prophets</hi>?</p>

               <p>By the last place, it is clear, he is speaking of Parochial Churches, which subjection none deny; but for the former, it is ridiculous to urge it, since it is certain they of <hi>Antioch</hi> sent not up to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> either as to a Church superior to it, or as to an Oecumenick Council, but to men

For to preface our acts, with, <hi>It seems good to the Holy Ghost,</hi> and yet to say, we are subject to error, is a contradiction. And thus the subordination of your Courts was a meer hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane device; so that if the <hi>jus divinum</hi> be the rule, the Independants had the better of you. But as for your Discipline, what warrand of Scripture have you for it?</p>

               <p>I do not deny, but there are clear grounds for separating scandalous persons from our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; but, why so many dayes? and why in a place of repentance? and why the use of Sack-cloath sometimes? is not this the device of men? bring Scripture for it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.</speaker>
               <p>Sure the Church hath power to do in these things, as shall tend most to order: and the dayes, place, and habit, are but external things.</p>

               <p>Now I have you at a great advantage, though you understand it not. Why may the Church impose such dayes of penitence, and not as well order all for the sins of the year to be in penitence all the time of Lent? And why is one place made a part for Penitents to be in, and may not another with as good and better reason be made the proper place for Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating? And why may not a Church-man officiat

in a Surplice, as well as a penitent put on Sack-cloath? since the one is a ceremony expressive o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> repentance, as well as the other is of innocence: and both were equally practised under the Law.</p>

               <speaker>N.</speaker>
               <p>I confesse, <hi>I</hi> did not think on these things, but <hi>I</hi> believe our Ministers have answers to them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>You may well believe, for you shall never see it, for there is no imaginable difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them: One thing <hi>I</hi> confesse, that a man once resolved not to believe a thing, if he have any subtiltie of spirit, will make a shift to say somewhat upon any thing. But I have not done with shewing your difformity with the Scripture-pattern; since then we were just now speaking of the Council at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> why do you not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that Law?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.</speaker>
               <p>Because that was only to bury the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue with honour, and as for the meats offered to idols, St. <hi>Paul</hi> takes that away.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>This is like you, still to devise fancies against expresse Scripture; where sayes the Scripture, that was done to please the Jews? as for St. <hi>Paul,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that he wrote his Epistle before he went to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and yet St. <hi>Iames</hi> tels him these things were still observed there; which shews, that a thing may be obligatory in one place, and not in another: and so, that in these externals, commands are not intended for lasting obligations. Next, why use you not washing of feet, since there is no Sacrament set down more punctually in Scripture? The Element is, Water, the Action, washing the feet, the Institution, <hi>as I have done, so do ye, and ye
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44658:26"/>
ought to wash one anothers feet,</hi> and the spiritual use of it, is humility. Why do you not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore use this rite?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.</speaker>
               <p>Why do not you use it, since you cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse the Scripture more than we?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>For all such matters, <hi>I</hi> have a clear answer, that in these externals, God intended no perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual obligation; and therefore in them <hi>I</hi> follow the practice of the Catholick Church. Next, in your Worship, why do you not kisse one another with a holy kisse? why do you not anoint the sick with oyl, as St. <hi>Iames</hi> commandeth?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.</speaker>
               <p>It is clear, that was extraordinary, for he promises recovery upon the anointing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>No such matter, it is upon the prayer of faith, that he promises recovery, he also promiseth forgivenesse, and since you pray by all, and do not say that it is more then a mean for their being rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up and forgiven; why do you not as well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint, since the Scripture commands it? But all this shews, that however, with women, and simple people, you talk much of your sticking to the Word, and by your grave nods, and big words would perswade them, that it is so; yet you are as far from it as any. <hi>I</hi> shall end all this with an instance of great importance, who taught you the change of the Sabbath? <hi>I</hi> am far from speaking against the Church that did so, but you will read the Bible long ere you finde it there; that of their meeting on the first day of the week, sayeth not, that they antiquated the Saturnday; that of the Lords day, saith yet lesse for it.</p>

               <p>Well, what make you of all this? it may well prove, our Church was not perfect; it never justifies you. Or, do you mean to lay aside the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>

               <p>It once checks your insolence, who pretend so big, upon so light grounds; and it is certainly a directer opposition to Scripture, to neglect what is expresly enjoyned, as you do, than to add in some lesser matters. All I say upon the whole matter, is, that the Scriptures were designed by God, for the purifying the hearts and conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men; and therefore it was not necessarie they should contain direct rules; for the Church-policy, which being a half civil matter, needs not divine warrands; and therefore the common rules are in Scripture, that there should be Church Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, that those should be separate for that Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that they should be obeyed, that things should be done to order, edification, and peace. These are everlasting obligations, because the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of them are perpetual: But the other rules were accommodat to the then state of things; which altering, they alter likewise. And this is so rational, that I can see nothing to be excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, with any shew or colour of reason. Nay, this looks like the Christian liberty, for, whereas the old dispensation was bound up, and limited to the smallest matters, <hi>Christ hath delivered us from that law of Ordinances, and hath made us free.</hi>

               <p>This is to take the Crown off Christs head, and to pull him off his Throne, and to deny him
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44658:27"/>

               <p>These are fine devices to terrifie simple people, and with such talk you triumph among women, and in your Conventicles. But, how little reason will suffice to let a man see through that canting? I say then, Christs Crown, his Throne, and Kingdom, is an inward and spiritual one, and not of the world, nor as the Kingdoms of the world: And a great part of his Kingdom, is, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty whereto he hath called us, freeing us from the yoke of the former slavery and pedagogy. And since no Allegory holds, it is ridiculous to argue, because offices in a Kingdom are named by the King, therefore it must be so in the Church; since you may as well say, there must be coin stamped by Christ. Beside, what King will think his prerogative lessened, by constituting a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to whom he shall leave a liberty to cast themselves into what mould they please, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they obey the general lawes, and hold that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as a thing depending upon him? Christs faithfulnesse consisted in his discharging the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission given him by the Father; of which, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doubts, let him be <hi>Anathemae Maranathae.</hi> But, who told you, it was in the Fathers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission? If you argue from <hi>Moses,</hi> it will say more than you will grant, that all particulars must be determined: since then, as <hi>Moses</hi> determines the dayes of separation for a legal uncleannesse, why
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44658:28"/>

                  </gap> spiritual uncleannesse? Nay further, consider <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> instituted no Church-Government, in the way we use it; for that of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> and house of <hi>Aaron,</hi> was only Typical, and to wait on the Temple, and the Worship to be performed there. Beside which, they had Synagogues all the Land over, and wherever they had Colonies in the World, and in these they had their Rabbies, their Scribes, and their Rulers, and their chief Ruler of their Synagogues, which read their Law, performed such Worship as was not tyed to the Temple at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and they inflicted Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline upon offenders: and these might have been of any Tribe, not only of that of <hi>Levi</hi>; and yet our Saviour never challengeth this, but went in to the rulers of their Synagogues; the like you finde done by his Apostles, and they never declame against it, as an humane invention. Whence it must follow, that you must grant, either what they did, was founded on divine tradition (which no Christian will grant) or that a form of Government was devised by men, and yet no unlawful thing. And if the Jews had such liberty, certainly the Christian Church is at least more free, as to these externals. And after all, since Christ is the Head of the World, as well as of the Church, why did not he determine the order of the one, as well as of the other?</p>

And though I should grant, the Church, as Church, is dearer to Christ, then as they are men, a foolish and childish nicety: Yet a King, though he looks most to what is dearest to him, he will have his authority acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in all his dominions: whence it will, with the same parity of reason follow, that since Christ is the King of the earth, there should be no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in it, but of his appointment.</p>

If by carnal reason, you mean a sober examining things, by the dictates of Nature; see that you condemn not that, which is indeed the voice of God in us, and therefor is to be received. And if you make this contrary to Religion, you bring as great a stain upon Religion, as an Atheist could devise: But if by reason, you mean little pittiful nibling with some ill understood, and worse applied di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions, out of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Ramus,</hi> as is very frequent among you, that is justly called vain Philosophy.

And thus if you can rightly weigh things, I have said enough to convince you, that in matters of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the Church is at liberty: But if you will still go to Scripture, I can positively say, though in it nothing amounts to a demonstration; There are fairer likelihoods for Bishops, from that of the <hi>Angels of the Churches,</hi> than ever you shall find in it for Presbytery: but I will not say more of this.

Epistles are plain Language. The Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Canons (a work of very venerable antiquity, at least the first 50 of them, though none of theirs perhaps) all over, shew the difference was then betwixt Bishops and Presbyters, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the 40. Can. <hi>The Presbyters and Deacons shall finish nothing without the Bishop's sentence: For, he is intrusted with the people of God, and shall be required to give account of their souls.</hi> And the same thing was also enjoyn'd, Syn. Azel. Can. 19. And in <hi>Cyprian's</hi> time it is undenied, that their power was then well regulate and settled. For though that great Saint and Martyr tells, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. Epist. 10. <hi>That he had decreed in the beginning of his Bishoprick to do nothing without the advice of his Presbyters, yet,</hi> Ep. 9. of that book to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatian</hi> a Bishop, who had asked his advice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning an affront he had received from a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, he sayes, that <hi>by his Episcopal vigour and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Chair, he had power presently to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him</hi>: And towards the end of that Ep. he sayes, <hi>these are the beginnings of Hereticks, and the rise and designs of Shismaticks, to please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and contemn their Bishop with insolent pride.</hi> And it is clear, Presbyters at that time, even in the Vacancy of a See, did not judge themselves sufficiently impowred for Ecclesiastical administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by what the Presbyters and Deacons of <hi>Rome</hi> write to <hi>Cypr.</hi> lib. 2. Ep. 7. saying, <hi>That since a Bishop was not at that time chosen, in place of the deceased</hi> Fabian, <hi>there was none to moderate

all things amongst them, who might with authority and advice take account of matters:</hi> Sure they thought little of Presbyters, being equal in power to their Bishop, who write so of a Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Episcopal power might seem devolved on them. But, I believe, few of you know these Writings. In the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> speaking of the power of Metropolitans, which was an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional thing to that of Bishops over Presbyters: The Canon sayes, <hi>Let the ancient Customs be in force.</hi> Now, how this excressing power should have crept into the whole Church, and no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when it came in, no temporal Princes, nor universal Councils to introduce it, and that at a time of persecution, when the Church was least to be suspected of pride, no Secular considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being to flatter this power; nay, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they alwayes bore the first brunt of the Persecution; and how none opposed it, if this was not introduced by Apostles, or Apostolical men, passeth my divination.

to think us wrong, in matters of Religion: And since it is not a matter of Religion, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you cannot without being Schismatical, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from us. But further, even every errour in Religion, ought not to unty the bond of the unity of the Catholick Church, unless the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour be of greater importance, than the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints is: a consideration which you never seem to weigh. How did the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> become a <hi>Iew</hi> to the <hi>Iews</hi>? though he tells us to do these things, out of an opinion of necessity in them, was to antiquat the crosse of Christ. And let all men judge, whether to circumcise, and purify in the Temple, were not greater compliances, in matters more justly to be scrupled, than what we contend about. Nay, the free spirit of Christianity, made St. <hi>Paul</hi> see well that these externals were of themselves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; so that either doing, or forbearing in them, might be acceptable to God; as he clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sheweth in his fourteenth Chapter to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> Yea, he carrieth this liberty further, even to an instance, which I confess, I should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have yeelded to, had not he determined in it; that is, the eating in the Idols Temples, of their feasts, and eating meat offered to Idols. Now, if St. <hi>Paul</hi> did this freely, both to Jew and Gentile, are not you bound to more obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when not only charity, but duty to the Laws exact it?

               <p>You in this bewray great simplicity; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not refuse compliance, because they were commanded by authority, which you do: but because certain false brethren came <hi>to spy out his liberty, to whom he gave place by subjection, no not for an hour.</hi> If therefore any require your compliance, as if it were necessary of it self, you have reason to <hi>stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free.</hi> But it is unsufferable peevishness, to say, if the Magistrate enjoyn a thing, declaring that it is still free in it self, and only necessary, because it is commanded, upon that score, to refuse obedience. And may not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders as well refuse to undergo the Discipline you enjoyn them, and say, though the thing be lawful, yet it is but indifferent, and therefore they cannot obey you, because you command things indifferent, which, as you reason, makes them necessary. As for the point of scandal, do not mistake it, as if the displeasing your party, were a giving of scandal, as many of you weakly think; to give scandal then, is, to stretch your liberty, when that freedom of yours, may draw others to follow your practice, though they have not the same clearness in their mind. And hence it appears, that to avoid scandal, is only an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridging your liberty, for the good of your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If therefore you be not at liberty, but already restrained in it by the lawful command
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44658:33"/>
of authority, you ought not in that case to be disobedient, upon a pretence of avoiding scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal. But I shall yet examine the matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, more closly. And, first, why do not your Ministers join with our Courts for Church-dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline?</p>

               <p>They cannot do it, because they are no Legal Courts, the Law that established them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, so that now they are but the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Deputies.</p>

               <p>I have before studied to convince you, that all that is divine in Discipline, is, that scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous persons be noted, and separated from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; but how this shall be administered, can be no matter of Religion; since, wherein are souls concerned, whether a Court, acting in a parity, or with one over them, do this; providing it be done? But waving this, whether judge you the Presbyters power for Discipline is founded upon a Divine Law, or upon the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? no doubt, you will say, the first: well then, can the abolishing that Act of Parliament take away your power? if not, you ought to sit in these Courts, and still do your duty.</p>

               <p>But this is to sit in a Bishops Court, which acknowledgeth his authority.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I pray you, suppose the case, that the King should abrogate all Laws for the worship of God, and declare, that all that assemble to worship God, shall be understood to worship Mahomet, and thereupon oblidge all to meet; though you meet not upon that command, yet I hope you
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44658:34"/>
will still meet to worship God; let them inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret that as they please. So, I say, since a power of Jurisdiction, is that to which Presbyters lay claim, by a divine right, they ought to meet in these Courts, let the Law call it what it will.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>But the Bishop is over them, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruleth them as he pleaseth.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>But, suppose this were true, and that Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy is a tyranny in the Church; Why ought you not to submit to them, as well as you did to the late Tyrants in the State? And why, as your Ministers say, they will be content to take Churches, and preach, but let Discipline alone; which is a quiting of some of their Rights, that they may retain the greater? May they not as well exercise Discipline, though they cannot do it with all the liberty they desire? Sure, there is nothing but peevishness in this.</p>

               <speaker>N.</speaker>
               <p>Do you think our Ministers would quite their Churches, and liberty of Preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, which is dearer to them than all the world, for any thing but Conscience?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I am not so severe as to doubt, but in most of them it is Conscience; but I must adde, it is ill informed Conscience. But what can you pretend, for your peoples withdrawing from our Churches? since our Religion, in Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Discipline, is the same: only a small alteration in the point of Government is made.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.</speaker>
               <p>I am not for separating from you, as my practice tells, but much may be said for it; therefore I will judge none that do it.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Truly I desire to be as sparing in passing Judgements on people, as any can be: but since separation must be either a necessary duty, or a very great sin, being a forsaking the unity of the Church: it can be no light matter to tear the Body of Christ, when there is scarce a colour of pretence for it. Now, the Schismatical humour among you, appears palpably in this, that you come sometimes to Church, but seldom; this seems indeed to be time-serving, that you may both evite the punishment of the Law, and also retain your interest with your party; for, if you come once in three moneths, you may come e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Lords day; and if you may come, you ought to come; otherwise you forsake the assemblings of the Saints, and contemn what you call the Ordinances. Others of you also joyn with some of us, but not with others. Now as to our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick transgressions (if they be such) we are all equally guilty, why then make you a difference? Others of you come to Churches in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, but do not so in the City: what doth this look like, but that you have freedom for the thing, but will not do it, for fear of being noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced? which is to prefer the pleasing of men, to the pleasing of God. And finally, some of you joyn with us in the ordinary Worship, but will not communicat with us, which bewrayes great solly; for if you may pray and praise with us, which is the spiritual communicating: why do you not joyn in the Eucharist, which is but so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn praise?</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>N.</speaker>
               <p>How can we acknowledg them our Pastors, who are intruders, and are in the places of our faithful shepherds, whom you have torn from us?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Supposing it were as you assert, yet that will never warrand your separating from them: since, although by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> the eldest of the house of <hi>Aaron</hi> was high Priest; and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes by force driving them from their right, exposed this most sacred function to sale, so that the high Priests not only invaded the right of others, but also obtained their office by the most horrid Simony imaginable; yet <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> as high Priest, prophesied; Our Saviour also answered at his Bar, and gave confession, when he authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively adjured him, <hi>in the Name of the living God.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> also acknowledged <hi>Annanias.</hi> And though the Pharisees were wretched teachers, guilty both of greater crimes and heresies, than you dare charge on us; Yet our Saviour saith, <hi>hear them, for they sit in</hi> Moses <hi>Chair.</hi> This is so convincing, that nothing in reason can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged against it: Yea, it was the doctrine of your own Teachers. Finally, what cruelty is it, if a Minister be put from his place, be it justly or unjustly, that the people should be starved? It shews your Ministers can have no love to their flocks, if they desire it should be so.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>This is an excellent piece of Religion in you, to take up, and use reproachful names of your Pastors. For though the name <hi>Curat,</hi> be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44658:35"/>
a designation, no Minister ought to be ashamed of; it signifying one that hath the care of Souls; yet ye use it as a term of contempt: and this is your obedience to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, honour them that are over you in the Lord: Which, as he addes, is for their works sake, and not for their persons sake, as you do. As for their persons and Gifts, where is Christian charity, that should make you slow to take up a bad impression upon slight grounds? But if your grounds be good, where is your charity to the Church? since you do not make it known, that they may be cast out. Beside, it will open a very wide door to separation, if you say, that upon the personal fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, much more weaknesse of a Preacher, you may separate. This is to ty the good of Church Worship to him that mannageth it. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it seems, you think to hear Sermon, all you go to Church for: But the chief reason of our meeting, is solemnly to acknowledge God, and that we are members of his Church: which we can do, be the Minister what he will; and hear good Scriptures read, and sing good Psalms. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, let me tell you, you are not so zealous for good Preachings, as you would make the world believe. For, are there not many of your Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who, while they were in place, were of no esteem, nor following; and are undoubtedly men of weak Gifts, yet now are crouded to by you? and the Church Sermons are deserted, and their Conventicles frequented. All the reason for this is, because they rail against the Church and State;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44658:36"/>
which is the only way to make a man popular a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you.</p>

               <p>You have pretended to answer a great many things, but one thing remains, wherein our chief strength lieth, and that you shall never be able to unbind; which is, the Covenant: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the whole Nation, and the generations to come in their loins are engaged; and, can such sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and solemn vowes be broken, without shameful perjury?</p>

               <p>This you alwayes bring out as your <hi>Goliah,</hi> to defy the Armies of the living God. But as <hi>Sampson's</hi> strength lay in his hair, without which he was as other men; so upon a full survey, it appears that the Covenants strength consisted in the Armies that fought for it, and not in any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or innate vigour. And, first, what a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous fancy is it, to say, Children can be bound by their fathers Oath? is not this to make us the servants of men, and to give them authority over our consciences; which is Gods peculiar power? Alas, what kind of souls have you, that can be led into such conceits!</p>

               <p>A mans debt affects his estate, which if the son get, he is bound to pay the debt. But if the son get no estate by his father, then <hi>I</hi> hope you will not say he is bound to pay his fathers debt.

               <p>This is strange dealing, to apply a mysterie of our faith, which we cannot well comprehend, to your triffling matters. But take notice, that <hi>Adam</hi> did not binde his children, by his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking for them, but by a secret transaction of Gods; who covenanted with him, as with the common head of mankind. And if Parents can bind duties upon their children, they may as well bind sins upon them. And this is new Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine unheard-of in the Church, which never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged any Original sin, but that derived from <hi>Adam.</hi>

               <p>The Parent binds for the childe, as a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in legal matters for his Pupil: that is, they bind for their interest.

               <p>This is great arrogance for you thus to judge of things ye understand not. Consider then, the Will is the supream power of the Soul, and the fancy is a lower faculty; the true and spiritual devotion therefore, must be that which lies in the Will, and not in the Fancy: now, the varying of one thing into several shapes, is only a gratifying of Fancy: and all the devotion can be raised by such Chimes, is only sensible, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as one of a deep and stedfast spirit, is equally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with a thing, though still in the same dress. Since then, for instance, our petition for pardon of sin, is fully comprized in this, <hi>have mercy u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon me, O God,</hi> doth it not shew, that the thing, and not the words, affect him, who with the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of affection, can make that prayer, though an hundred times repeated, at every return, new? whereas he must have a lower minde, who needs a new phrase to renew his servour. And thus you see, it expresseth a more spiritual temper, to be able to worship God in simple and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant forms.</p>

               <p>It needs but a very little knowledge of our selves, and none of Logick, to make you compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend this: for, do you think, the heating of the fancy cannot make wicked men pray without the Spirit, as to appearance very spiritually? Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, words, and all the heat begot by words, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, voice, or phrases, or the like, are but a false fire in the natural powers of the Soul, which may well heat the brain, draw forth tears, seem to wring the heart; and all this, is but a sensible fervour, which (as the temper raised by musick) amounts to nothing, but to a present tickling; whereas the true devotion of the heart, is, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, still, humbling and melting thing, and so equable, that it is above these frisking fits of the fancy. And it is certain, to pray by the Spirit, must be the immediat work of the Spirit of Grace: Since then we see, that the praying in words depends most upon Memory, Fancy, Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, Confidence and Custome; he that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in these, is like to excel in it; whereas one, defective in all these, so that he cannot pray in a variety of words, yet may understand inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior prayer and spiritual converse with God, better than any other.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Consider then, that the sublimest way of prayer, is in the simplest acts: such as these; <hi>thou art my God, and I am thine.</hi> And in such breathings, a devout minde will persist long, with great sweetnesse: and in this, God hath strangely
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44658:41"/>
shapt Religion, so that the highest strain of it, is, what the simplest minde can most easily reach. Nay, perhaps multiplicity doth lead out the minde from pure and still devotion. And thus extemporary prayer, cannot be called praying by the Spirit, except by <hi>spirit</hi> you understand the animal or natural spirits: for, if it be by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, it must be infallible, since all that is dictat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Spirit of God is so: yet your people do not assert their prayers as such. Further, let one with a short-hand, follow that mans prayer, who you say prayes by the Spirit; then, may not that prayer be read and used over again? or, is the Spirit in the prayer so volatile, that it eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porats in the saying, and the prayer becomes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal when it is repeated? Finally, if praying by the Spirit, be a praying in new words, then only he that conceives the prayer, prayes by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: since they who hear and joyn with him, are tyed to his words.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.</speaker>
               <p>The words were dictated by the Spirit to him that conceives them.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Then to the people it is not necessary, the words be new: since to them it is all one, if it were once dictated by the Spirit. But why do you not believe the prayer composed by the Church, to be of the Spirits dictating, as well as that of your Ministers? And, since the people can joyn and pray by the Spirit, though the words be not of their framing; why may not the Minister pray in the Spirit, though he use words framed by others? All this shows how weak and ill grounded a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44658:42"/>
notion, that of praying by the Spirit, in the sense you understand it, is. And it clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the dresse of the prayer in words, and the life begot by them, is but sensible and low.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.</speaker>
               <p>But doth not the <hi>Spirit help our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and teach us to pray</hi>?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>If you consider the words aright, they speak out a thing very far different from what you would draw from them. The Spirit teacheth us to pray, for what we ought, that is the matter of our prayers; and as we ought, that is the manner, to wit, the temper of our hearts. For, that words are not meant, appears from what follows, <hi>and maketh intercession for us with groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings that cannot be uttered</hi>: or literally, <hi>which cannot be worded.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.</speaker>
               <p>But though the renewing of words were a lower way of devotion; yet, we in this inbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died state, need to have our souls stirred up by the commotion of our fancies.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Then at least, this must convince you, that such a way of praying, is not so sublime, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be called praying by the Spirit. And you must acknowledge, such as can worship God devoutly in a set Form, to be of a higher size: as being above these gratifications of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and fancy. I will next convince you of the evil of extemporary forms. In such then, I must long exercise my attention to consider what he who prayes, intends; that I may judge, whether I can joyn with him or not: Now this strangely draweth out the minde from devotion: for, two
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44658:42"/>
powers of the Soul cannot be vigourously acted at one time. The attention therefore must put great stops to the progresse of the devotion: and the mind being so prone to wander in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; this opens a wide door to it. But he who knoweth already what the prayer is, runs along in his devotion, without anxiety, or wavering. Hence I have heard devout men say, they were ever much troubled, while they joyned in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary Worship, to keep their minde from distraction; which they found wholly remedied, when they were where God was worshipped in set Forms.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.</speaker>
               <p>What sort of devout men could these be? sure they knew not what devotion meant.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>This is like all weak people, to censure what is above them, and they do not understand. But judge whether it be fit, I blindly join with one in the worship of God, when I know not how he is to mannage it: and you cannot deny, some may pray things you dare not join in. Shall I not trust a man in any matter, without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing how he will discharge it? only in my devotions to God I will blindly trust so great a concernment, to one who saith he doth not know how he will mannage it himself. It is not enough to say, you join not in these things to which you cannot say <hi>Amen</hi>; for, at least to others you seem so to do. And this will keep you still in some anxiety, when in your heart you may say <hi>Amen,</hi> and when not: and indeed this way of praying, was the best could have been devised,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44658:43"/>
for spreading of errour, or sedition: for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters prayed over their Sermons; so that what in the discouse seemed the words of man, in the prayer was called the dictate of the Spirit. And this was an excellent device, to make all go down, had it been of the worst stuff.</p>

               <p>Things of themselves good, falling into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse, ought not for that to be taken away; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the abuse be greater than the goodness of the thing: but, if a thing, not of it self good, be grossly abused, then there is ground to change the use of it. Now, since we speak of abuses, I might run out in a long career, and tell of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious length, the scurrilous expressions, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved periods, the petulant and wanton affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, and other great abuses in extemporary prayer: with which, no doubt, you your self hath been often much troubled; but I bear that tender respect to every thing that hath any rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God's service, that I love not so to scoff at any thing looks that way: But you know these are sad truths. Whether then, Is it not necessary to redress these abuses by a regular form?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>And why may not you have a Directory for words, as well as things? since the Spirit rather helps in things than in words. But it was clear you brought up that Directory meerly to cozen the world; which otherwise might have been
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44658:43"/>
startled, to have seen you without all form, or rule for Worship: for, even your Leaders quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wearied of it, and regarded it not. And one thing clearly followed, that the Preaching was the great matter of the Worship: all the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Psalms relating to it. But the constant acts, wherein the Church should adore God, were thought too homely. To conclude, the least evil of extemporary forms, is, that a Minister is ready to pour out his soul to God, in such devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as are then most in his own spirit: Suppose he be mourning for sin, under affliction, rejoicing in God, or the like; he is apt to pray in these strains. But these being his private exercises, are not fit for publick Worship, which, as it ought to be grave and solemn; so, it should be general and comprehensive.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N.</speaker>
               <p>I see you are for set-forms: but what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son have you for them? Sure the Apostles used them not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>You are not so sure as you imagine, for I cannot doubt but they used our Saviours Prayer, he taught them; for whereas, at first, in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the Mount, he had given it as a pattern of Prayer, they afterwards, as is clear by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Gospel, came and asked a form of him, as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> had given his Disciples: and then he doth not say, as he formerly said, <hi>After this manner pray,</hi> but <hi>when you pray,</hi> which clearly sheweth, he intended it as a practice, as well as a pattern. Nay further, the Jews at that time had a Liturgy, and their hours of Prayer,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44658:44"/>
which our Saviour never reproves, as a formal thing: but, on the contrary, he takes his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, word for word, out of it, as may be seen, if you will read their Liturgy. And this shews how foolish that exception against the Liturgy of <hi>England</hi> is, that some of its prayers are translat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Missall or Breviary. But though the Apostles and persons immediatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired, might pour out extemporary prayers, thence it will not follow, that every one may assume the same liberty. Beside, you see by the Worship of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> they used Hymnes of their composing, as well as Prayers: Now I could never comprehend why you will allow the Spirit to be restrained in praising, as to words, and not in praying, since both are duties equally spiritual; nay, perhaps praising, is the most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime of the two.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.</speaker>
               <p>Because the Plalms are a collection of praises dictated by the Spirit of God for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>This is all you can say upon the matter, but never were more absurdities crouded in less bounds. And first, it is clear, we may worship in the Spirit, and yet be restrained as to words; since you acknowledge God hath done it in prais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Next, the Psalms are full of acts that are prayers, as well as thanksgivings; why may we not use these for constant prayers, as well as the other for constant praises? Nay, since we use to sing these prayers, why may we not for instance use the 51. <hi>Psalm,</hi> in plain words, with a plain
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44658:44"/>
voice, as prayer, as well as in hobling ryme, with a Tune? Sure you will find no difference in this, since you cannot say we are bound to use the Psalms in Meeter, or with Tunes: for nothing proves we ought to use them with vocal Tunes, but will conclude as strongly for all <hi>Davids</hi> Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Besides, who told you that all <hi>David</hi>'s Psalms were to be constantly used in Worship? It is clear, most of them was not intended for constant use: they relating to particulars of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s History and Victories, which belongs not to us. And it is hard to say, we ought to sing his imprecatory Psalms: As also, many things are in the Psalms which we cannot sing, because we do not understand them: And it is clear, we ought to praise God with our understandings; and not above twenty of the Psalms were used by the Jews in Worship. To conclude, why may not the Christian Church compose new Hymns, as they of <hi>Corinth</hi> did? for which they are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And this is the more necessary, because from <hi>David</hi>'s Psalms, we are not furnished with such full and clear Hymns, upon the great Mysteries of the Christian Belief, as were needful. And what kind of reasons can you have, who plead so much for a liberty in Prayer, and yet allow none in making of Hymns? Why then do not ye use the <hi>Glory to the Father</hi>?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Because it is not in the Scripture, and is but a device of men.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Who would not be sick with such pitiful folly? Show me a reason why you may make pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44658:45"/>
and not praises? Beside, are not your Meeter Psalms a device of men? And they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from the Text, as I can trace it in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred places, as much as the Doxology doth from Scripture words. And you understand Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick little, if you do not know that the Psalms in Prose may be sung as well, and as Musically, as they can be in Ryme. Besides, since the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the S.S. Trinity, is not so clearly in the Old Testament, nor in any Psalm, why may not the Church use an acknowledgement of it, in the end of their singing, as well as in the end of prayer, is ordinarily said, <hi>To the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, be glory for ever and ever</hi>? Such childish weakness makes me sometimes doubt whether your rational faculties be not troubled: since what difference can you pretend betwixt singing and saying? But I will return to Prayer. Consider next, how <hi>Hosea</hi> the Prophet prescribes a form, when he saith, <hi>take with you words, and say,</hi> &amp;c.

One thing is strangely inconsequential a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, you will not pray in a Liturgy, and yet you alwayes bless the people in a set form.

Church. Our Saviour said, <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, I will be in the midst of them.</hi> As for the necessity of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, none calls them simply necessary to Salvation; but since they were commanded, they ought to be used, unless some more cogent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son stop the use of them, than is the want of a dedicated House. And who should expect, that they who are so much against reverence to Sacred Houses, should likewise be against private Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? As for Baptism, what a cruel thing is it, to oblidge Children; especially when they are tender, to be brought, perhaps in the coldest season, many miles, rather than go and Baptize at their Houses? this looks liker Heathenish bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity, than the Christian tenderness. And for Communion, why should not sick persons receive on death-bed, when all the reasons of receiving are most strong? Their faith and love needs then to be most quickened; Never is the death of Christ more to be remembred, than when they are to pass through the valley and shadow of death; and never is it more fit, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their Communion with the Church, and their love to the Brethren, than when they are entering upon their last pangs: And it is well known how early a practice this was in the Church of God. <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> tells, that they sent of the Eucharist to them that were absent: and by the famous Story of <hi>Serapion,</hi> about the 200. year, it is apparent how necessary the Christians then thought it was to be guarded with this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>Since you do not exactly follow Christ, you ought not to stand at this: none therefore should alledge this, but such as Communicat lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and after supper, and in an upper Room. And though the Passover was ordained to be eaten by the Jews <hi>standing with their loins girt, and their shooes on their feet,</hi> yet without any written warrand, they changed that posture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ordinary eating posture, and did eat the Passover leaning, in which our Saviour conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them.

               <p>If by holy dayes you mean, portions of time so sacred, that in these dayes, our services are more acceptable to God than on other dayes; or that of their own nature they are holy, so that of it self it is a sin not to be particularly devout on these dayes, you have reason to say, none can make a day holy. And this was never asserted. But it is another thing to keep pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar dayes of thanksgiving, for the great and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mercies of the Gospel-dispensation. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse I am so dull, as not to be able to apprehend what evil can be in such customs. And it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted, that in all ages and places of the Church, Christians have had a peculiar veneration for these Dayes. St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of the legall holy Dayes, <hi>he that regardeth a day, to the Lord he doth regard it</hi>; And, if <hi>Moses</hi> his Feasts might have been kept <hi>holy</hi> to the Lord, much more may these be which the Church hath instituted. Beside, you know the observation of <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Pentecost,</hi> are according to clear History derived from Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical practices. And it appears, St. <hi>Paul</hi> hasted to be at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to keep the feast of <hi>Pentecost</hi> there. And, from all this I may assume, that your dislike of these Festivals and the other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of <hi>Perth,</hi> is ill grounded.</p>

And certainly the great itch of multiplying and canvassing subtile questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in matters of Religion, hath proven one of the chief pests of the Church; it is good to be sober-minded. As for Gods Soveraignty in all things, but more especially in the conversion of souls, and the gracious influence of his Spirit, I do firmly believe it: I as firmly believe, that God is infinitly good and holy, and think I may well take his own Oath for it, <hi>that he takes no pleasure in the death of sinners:</hi> But how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile these his Attributes, I confesse is beyond my capacity. God is an unfathomable Abysse, and imperscrutable to any but himself: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as I do not doubt there are Three persons in one God, though I cannot reconcile that to <hi>Aristotles</hi> Logick; so I believe, God is Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and absolute, as well as holy and just,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44658:52"/>
though I cannot answer all objections. In a word, let this whole matter be thus transacted, and no article of faith is violated; <hi>Let none of our good be ascribed to our selves, and none of our evil be imputed to God.</hi>

               <p>Ah, how strangely is the world mistaken in matters of Religion! Some placing it wholly in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, others in external forms; others in some private devotions, and others in a regulation of the outward man; but true Religion is power and life, and far above all these shadows. <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

of God is not meat and drink, but righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost</hi>; it doth not level at externals only, but secretly insinuats it self into the Soul; whereas a divine seed it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagates, diffusing its vertue through the whole man: In a word, Religion was given of God to transform a man into the Divine likeness, and to a real participation of the Divine Nature.</p>

               <p>You shall feel such a belief and sense of the divine perfections in your soul, as shall make the thoughts of God familiar and easie to you: your converse with him shall not only consist in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and acts of worship, but you shall be often admiring him in his Attributes of Power, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Goodness, and chiefly his Love to you in Christ; which sense of God shall be as <hi>a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of living waters,</hi> ever jetting up divine thoughts into your mind: And these will not be crabbed, curious, or subtill speculations, but humble adorations, and divine imbraces, in such acts, as, <hi>Thou art my God, my good God, I am thine, I will love thee above all things, and none but thee; thou art my joy and only delight.</hi> Thus the more you converse with God, your acts will grow the simpler and the purer: it will not only be at some returns, morning or evening, or in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship, that such thoughts will stir in you; but your heart will be full of them, and swiming in them, and they will rise natively in you. Hence will gush in upon your soul much inward sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mind; you will be ever well pleased, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you will see God in all things, and you will

see all he doth is good; you will therefore not only practise submission, but complacency and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in all his wayes; you will also rejoyce in the Divine Attributes, and glory in your interest in Heaven. Oh, how sweet will your hours then grow to you!

And as he doth not cowardly stoop to mean things, so he doth not stubbornly refuse the poorest office God calls him to: he peaceably obeyeth the publick Father of his Countrey, and the Ghostly Fathers of his Soul: he undervalueth none but himself, neither are his ears pained with applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses given to others, nor itching for them to himself. His charity also appeareth in his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to do good to all men, looking on that as one of the greatest conformities to the Divine Nature: He relieveth the poor with his Goods, the perplexed with his Advice, the oppressed with his Assistance, the disconsolat with his Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy; and all with his Prayers. He judgeth rashly of none, he doth not easily believe, but quickly pardoneth an injury: he is not soon irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, but readily pacified: he confineth not his charity to a party, but extendeth it to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.

               <p>I Am heartily glad of this opportunity of meeting with you again, and will be more glad to find our last Conference pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the effect design'd by it; which was to beget in you a true sense of Religion, that you <hi>may walk worthy of your high and holy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>; for, I can have no greater joy than to see you walking in the truth.</p>

               <p>I thank you for being so concerned in the welfare of my Soul: and, by the grace of God, I shall make it my daily work to be perfecting holinesse in his fear: But, I must be on my guard when I converse with you; since you publish our private discourses, which I do not take kindly; for, you take advantage from my weakness, and, by running me down, make the whole party suffer.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>The true reason why I consented to the publishing of our Conference (for I candidly assure you, <hi>I</hi> did no more but give my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to him, who, being pleased with the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44658:61"/>
written account of it, desired to make it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick) was, since <hi>I</hi> thought <hi>I</hi> had allayed a great deal of the heat I met with in you upon these matters, <hi>I</hi> presumed it might produce the like good effect in others. If in any thing <hi>I</hi> seem to take too great advantage against you, it is with reason: neither is it an humour of drolling or insulting, that makes me some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a little pleasant; since in all Dialogues you will find the transitions sweetned with somewhat of that, even when the gravest mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are treated of.</p>

               <p>Some charge you with <hi>Socinianism,</hi> others with <hi>Popery,</hi> others with <hi>Arminianism,</hi> and others with <hi>Quakerism.</hi> I confesse their grounds seem'd to me, very slender, but they say it is very clear, and tell their followers to shun you as a pest.</p>

               <p>God forgive their malice, I pray God it be not laid to their charge at the last day, that they so falsly and injuriously reproach me. I know the Arts of some well, they will tell their people that we are unsound and Heterodox, and back their hard words with grave nods and wry faces; and the poor people, too inured to implicit faith, give an undoubted credit to what they say: But do they understand things, who charge a man with <hi>Socinianism,</hi> who believeth that Christ is the eternal Son of God, and hopes for salvation only through his blood? and they are as well
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44658:61"/>
versed in <hi>Popery,</hi> who charge me with it; for, can he be heretical in Justification, who ascribes all we receive in this life and in that to come, to the love and grace of God through Jesus Christ? And you know all that <hi>Calvin</hi> and his followers aim at in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Arminius</hi> his points, is, that all ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> good be ascribed to God: how then can he be erroneous in this matter, who asserts that? But as for <hi>Quakerism,</hi> the grounds on which they tax me of that, are so ridiculous, that I am ashamed to name them; and, I assure you I am so far from inclining to <hi>Quakers,</hi> that <hi>I</hi> look on that Sect, as one of the subtillest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices yet broached for the overthrow of Christian Religion. But, if that spirit be not the womb, from whence all these Sects and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours have sprung amongst us, let all that look on, judge; none falling to them in this Country but such as were formerly most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in their way. And though <hi>I</hi> am sure, they are far enough from being <hi>Quakers,</hi> yet their principles have a natural tendency that way: whence, think you, have they suckt their rejecting of all forms and order (under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44658:62"/>
the present or antient Church, (I plead not for implicit faith) opens a wide door for their pretensions to a liberty of the Spirit; which at once renounceth all modesty and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. Next, your humour of <hi>separation,</hi> begets that giddiness in people, that, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they, being shaken from the unity of the Church, also stagger through unbeleef. As also, many of you cherish in your followers a dejection of mind too much, as if Religion, which gives a man a right to the purest joyes, should become a life of doubting, and this introduceth a spirit of Melancholy, which clearly makes way to that pretended <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasm.</hi> And thus you may see who are to be blamed for the progresse that way makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, you having prepared the people so to it. But still <hi>I</hi> assure you, though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but see the faults, too many amongst you are guilty of, I am far from hating or despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing you, God knowes <hi>I</hi> pity and love you with all my heart.</p>

               <p>I hope you know my temper better, than to think these things will much move me: <hi>I</hi> will learn to live through good report and ill report, and am so far from being angry with those who thus traduce me, that if <hi>I</hi> knew how to do them a good office <hi>I</hi> would infallibly do it. Yea, if my heart deceive me not, <hi>I</hi> could die to do them service.

I alwayes classe them in two divisions, the one is, of such as are indeed differing from us in their opinion, but withall are so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and modest, not rash in their censures, nor bitter in their passions: and such <hi>I</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and love, and doubt not but there are grave and pious persons of that persuasion, whom <hi>I</hi> also honour the more, because of their first founder <hi>Calvin</hi> (take not this as a jeer; for, I assure you, the first being ever Presbytry had, was in <hi>Calvius</hi> brain.) But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, besides their opinion in the matter of Church-government, are of foure tempers, condemning such as differ from them, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all who are not as violent as themselves,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44658:63"/>
placing Salvation in these matters, and thus confining their charity within the narrow cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of their own opinion: as for such, they get but their true name, when they are called <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> and though I will be loath to judge them as to the state of their souls; yet, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good Christians they might prove in a Cell, or in a Desart, I assure you, they are not shap't for Societies; their maximes being inconsistent with peace, order and unity: And they are as unfit to govern, as uncapable of being governed; and, for these do not quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel me, if I speak severly of them: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what one of your own deservedly esteemed Preachers sayeth (it is like occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the differences then, when they were forced to represse the insolence of the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Party) on <hi>Iob</hi> 17. verse 10.

I should indeed be very injurious to the Presbyterian party, did I charge them with all the humours and follies that are among you: the English Presbyterians
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44658:63"/>
are far beyond you in their moderation, as is notour to all that know them, and may appear from Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> Disputations on Church-government: yea, in the late treaty, all they desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, was, to be conjoined with the Bishops in the exercise of Discipline, which you refuse, though it be offered and pressed upon you.

               <p>The odds is very great; for, then Presbyteries stood by the Legal establishment; the Act for them being still in force, which was rescinded at the restoration of Bishops, <hi>Anno</hi> 1662: so that the old foundation being razed, they are no more Presbyteries.</p>

               <p>Truly you are in the wrong to many of them, for few of them are so bitter against you as you seem to be against them: and I assure you they pray often for you, though you I doubt seldom pray for them.</p>

               <p>I tell you again and again, I have no quarrel with such of them as are calm and modest, only I regrate they are too few. As for the others love to us, wo should it be to you and me, if the love of God to us (which ought to be our measure of love to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) did appear in such effects as theirs
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44658:64"/>
doth. If they pray for us, it is in the most invidious strain imaginable, that God would bring us down and destroy such of us as are incorrigible, and shew the rest of us the evil of our apostacy and defection: this you know is the universal strain of their prayers concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us. But, how would they take it, if we should pray that God would destroy their party, and shew them the evil of their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, rebellion and other wicked courses? Now this is the true Character of an <hi>insolent,</hi> who takes a liberty with all the world, but cannot be touched himself. And you know, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes pray, that God would unite this poor Church, and heal our breaches; which shews the healing and peaceable spirit is on our side: Our prayers being such, that none can refuse to say <hi>Amen</hi> to them: And upon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we declare we are not only ready to unite with them, but are extreamly desirous of it. And if you will believe me, I assure you, I dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray for them in this strain most cordially: whereas there is nothing they fear more than an accommodation; nay, in their Books they directly own, that all that can be done, ought to be done for keeping life in our differences: and who could ever have expected to have heard this doctrine in the school of Christ? And let all men judge, if there be not a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse in the preface to Mr. <hi>Rhetorfort's</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the <hi>Apologetical Narration,</hi> and <hi>Naphta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:44658:65"/>
which is unsampled in any <hi>Satire,</hi> not to say grave and Christian writing. And what cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed doctrine is it <hi>Naphthali</hi> broacheth concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning private persons their punishing of crimes in case of the supinnesse of the Magistrate? for, ransack all the <hi>Provincial letters, Escobar</hi> or the other profane <hi>Casuists</hi> of that wicked school, you shall not find a more impious and detestable opinion among them; and what cursed effects this produced, all the Nation saw: when in the sight of the Sun a vilain with a pistol invaded the persons of two of the Fathers of the Church, and that in the chief street of our royal City. And though the providence of God shielded the one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally from his fury, and preserved the life of the other, though with the losse of his arm, all shattered with the wound; yet his malice was not to be blamed, for that asassinations were only wanting to compleet the parallel betwixt that <hi>spirit</hi> and the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> which is indeed the same spirit moving in different Characters. I do not charge the fact on that party, but acknowledge, I never spoke with one who did not express their abhorrency of it; but, without all uncharitableness, I may charge it on the Author of <hi>Naphthali.</hi>

state of the Church, which is, that <hi>I</hi> be only self-concerned, and neglect the interests of Christ, whereas, what ought to be dearer to me then the glory of God? and surely when that suffers, all that love him will be tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected, so was <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> for the desolations of their times; and it is a strange piece of Religion to be unconcerned in Gods glory, which is to be like <hi>Gallio,</hi> to care for none of these things.</p>

               <p>All things have two sides; so this doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of resignation, if you look to it on the wrong one, seems like unconcerned stupidity; yet, rightly considered, it is one of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est pieces of Christianity: for, if you believe (which you must believe, else you are no good Christian) that Christ governes his Church, you must also believe that he doth all things well: <hi>since he hath all power in heaven and earth committed to him; and in him are all treasures of wisdom and of knowledge; and he loved his Church so, that he died for it.</hi> Now since his power enables him to do what he pleaseth, and his goodness inclines him to please what is best, and his wisdom cannot erre in the choice, Where is there rowm for any miscarriage in the government of the World? why then are we to vex our selves with any anxiety? doth not that tacitly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse God, as if he did not mind his Church as he ought? or doth it not imply if we were
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44658:66"/>
of his council, we could adjust things better? Therefore, as in all our personal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we ought to go about our duty with diligence, leaving events wholly to Gods care; So, in the publick conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nments of his Church, we are to commit the management of them to him, on whose shoulders the Government was laid by the Father; and rest securely in this perswasion, that all things cooperat in promoting the grand designs of eternal wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodness: but still we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our selves in the good of the Church above all things, next to the salvation of our own souls: but this is to be expressed, as in our most servent solliciting of God in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his Church (to which we are oblidged as well as to pray for our selves, we thereby expressing to God our zeal for his glory, and our servent charity to the brethren) so also we are to let no opportunity slip, that God puts in our hands of doing good: But, as we are called, we are to do good as far as our station reacheth, and that upon all hazards; yet, even in that, we are with <hi>David,</hi> not to meddle in matters too high for us, and with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> not to stretch our selves beyond our own measure and line; but withall, we are to let no inward dejecting melancholy possess our souls, which is contrary to the end of Religion, wherein we are called to rejoyce evermore; it being contrived of God to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44658:66"/>
beget in us joyes, which cannot be taken from us; and nothing marrs the souls inward joy in God more than such sorrowes.</p>

               <p>It seems you consider little the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the two dispensations: for, that of <hi>Moses</hi> was carnal, chiefly made up of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral promises of an external prosperity; so these outward desolations were then signes of Gods displeasure against them, and therefore they did lament because of them: but now the Scene is wholly altered, and these outward afflictions and persecutions, are so far from being curses, as they were of old, that our Saviour hath pronounced them blessings; yea, he hath made these trials the Badges of our conformity to our Head, who was made perfect through sufferings. And therefore we are to glory and rejoyce in our sufferings, as did the Apostles; and in the primitive Church, though they were made havock of, in the most cruel manner, some torn by Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other wilde beasts, some killed by the sword, some burnt in the fire, some roast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Gridirons, some thrown in boy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Caldrons, some had their flesh torn off by pincers, some were starved to death by hung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and cold; in a word, all the crueltie that diabolical malice could devise, was exercised upon them; yet not only the Martyrs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves bore all, singing in the midst of their tortures, but the Churches also rejoyced in it: And the dayes of their death, were Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, called <hi>naetalitiae Martyrum,</hi> they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Martyrdom their most glorious birth. And by the Epistles <hi>Eusebius</hi> inserts in his History, we see they were far from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining because of their sufferings. But you (because the Lawes are altered, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate hath denied you further encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and punished you, not for your Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, of which you cannot brag much, since none hath suffered because he was for <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> or against <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> but for your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly humours and practices) make such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to God as if heaven and earth were mixed, and adapt all the Lamentations of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> to your sorrie matters, as if the <hi>overthrow of Presbytery</hi> were to be compared to the <hi>Babylonish captivity</hi>; And see if the conclusion of the <hi>Apology,</hi> and all your other writtings run not in this stile.

               <p>This showes how overly you read Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, when you bring this as a president. When <hi>Luther</hi> rose, the Duke of <hi>Saxe,</hi> being moved of God, did receive the Reformation peaceably into his principalities, without any force; and his example was followed by other Princes and free cities: but, in the year 1524. and 1525. there arose a War in <hi>Germany,</hi> fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by some troublesome Preachers, as saith the Historian, who pretended the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Gospel for their chief quarrell; and this was called <hi>the War of the Rusticks.</hi> And
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44658:69"/>
they appealing to <hi>Luther's</hi> judgement, he wrote again and again to them, condemning what they did, as an execrable and cursed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. He saith indeed, it was a great wickednesse in their Princes to force their consciences, but that did not at all excuse them; and tells how far he himself had been ever from such courses: and he calles those that somented the Rebellion, <hi>vilains</hi>; and not content with this, he stirred up the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Princes against them, who fought them and broke them. And in this I desire you will not consider the tatles of some ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but read the History it self, and those excellent papers of <hi>Luther</hi>: for which I refer you to <hi>Sleidan,</hi> Lib. 5. And he will give you full satisfaction. Afterwards the Duke of <hi>Brunsuick,</hi> and some other Princes of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> did invade their neighbour protestant Princes, and combined in a league for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Lutheranisme</hi>: whereupon the Duke of <hi>Saxe,</hi> the <hi>Langrave</hi> of <hi>Hessen,</hi> and other Princes and free cities, met at <hi>Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cald,</hi> to unite among themselves: but <hi>Luther</hi> was dissatisfied with this, till their Lawyers shewed him how by the <hi>bulla aurea,</hi> and other constitutions of the German Empire, it was lawfull for them to defend themselves: whereupon he consenting, they entered into that famous League. And every one who knowes any thing of that Empire, knowes well
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44658:69"/>
that the Princes are Soveraigns within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and that the Emperour is only the head of the union. As for the War that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards followed betwixt <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th, and the Duke of <hi>Saxe,</hi> besides, that the Duke of <hi>Saxe,</hi> was free to defend himself, as I have told, <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th, declared it was not for Religion he fought, whatever his design was: neither did all the Princes of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion join against him. The Electors of <hi>Cullen</hi> and <hi>Pallatine,</hi> both Protestants, lay neuters; and the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and <hi>Maurice,</hi> afterwards Elector of <hi>Saxe,</hi> armed for the Emperour: So you may see, what pitifull Historians they are, who alledge the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>Germany.</hi> In <hi>Sweden,</hi> King <hi>Gustavus, Anno,</hi> 1524. with the States of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, peaceably received the Reformation; neither were their any broils about it, till about seventy years after, that <hi>Sigismond,</hi> King of <hi>Polland</hi> (whom notwithstanding of his being Papist, they received for their King, he being the son of the former King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and peaceably obeyed him) was by force entring the Kingdom, resolving to root out the Protestant Religion: Whereupon (<hi>Vide Decret. in comitiis Lincop.</hi> Anno, 1660.) they deposed him, and choosed his Uncle <hi>Charles</hi> King; no strange thing in the Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish History, that being an Elective Crown, before the Year, 1644. that the States re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

                  <hi>Gustavus</hi> then reigning for their Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary King; but still the States retained the supream Authority, as may appear by all their writs. Nor was it any wonder, if they, who had but a while before, crept out of an Elective Kingdom into an Hereditary, could not brook <hi>Sigismond</hi> his tyrannical invasion. And if this serve not to vindicat the <hi>Swedes</hi>; at least, the Reformation was not introduced by Wars among them, neither were ever the actions of that State, lookt upon as a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to others.

               <p>I say still, it was not for Religion they sought, Papists and Protestants jointly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring; And C. <hi>Egmond</hi> and C. <hi>Horn</hi> who were beheaded by the Duke of <hi>Alve,</hi> as the chief instruments in it, died both Papists; yea, the State by a placart, declared it scandalous to say they fought for Religion; the true ground of the quarrel (as you may read in all the Histories) was, that their Prince was not an absolute Soveraign, but limited in his power, and that by expresse compact, they might use force if he transgressed his limits: which he did most notoriously and tirandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally: and for all this, I refer you to <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, de Antiquitate Bataviae &amp; in lib.

               <p>The first civil Wars were mannaged by the Princes of the blood, who by the Laws of that Crown, are not ordinarie subjects. Besides, the Wars were begun in the mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the King; in which case the powers of the Princes is greater: I do not for all this deny their following Wars, were direct re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; but consider the fierce spirit of that Nation (ready to fight for any thing) and you must confesse, it was not Religion, but their temper that was to be blamed; but now many of the eminent men of that Church are fully convinced of the evil of these cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: and do ingenuouslie condemn them. Yea, in the Wars of the last King, one of the glories of our Nation, <hi>Cameron,</hi> at <hi>Mountow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> directly preached against their courses, and taxed them of Rebellion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.</speaker>
               <p>But if that was Rebellion, how did the late King of <hi>Britain</hi> give assistance to the <hi>Rochellers</hi> in the last Wars?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>There was a particular reason in that, as appears from the account the illustrious Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> gives of it: for the King of <hi>Britain</hi> had interposed in the former pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and had given surety to the Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, that the <hi>French</hi> King should religiously observe the agreement: But the King of <hi>France</hi> violating this, the King of <hi>Britain</hi> thereby receiving so publick an injurie and affront, was oblidged in honour to assist
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44658:71"/>
them: which for his part was most just, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Subjects of <hi>France</hi> their part in it might be. And thus <hi>I</hi> have cleared the Churches abroad of that injurious stain you brand them with: And by this let all men judge whether you or I do them the best of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. But to come to our own <hi>Britain,</hi> you know it is the glory of the English Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it was stained with no blood, save that of Martyrs, which was its chief orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Yea, though a Popish and persecuting Queen interveened betwixt the first Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and the second of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; yet, none rebelled: For that of <hi>Wyat,</hi> was not upon the account of Religion; but in opposition to the match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> It is true <hi>Scotland</hi> hath not that glory: but as we were long allyed to <hi>France</hi>; so we have too much of their temper: so that it passeth as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon saying, of Scots-men, <hi>praefervida Scotorum ingenia.</hi> And all that travelled the world, can witnesse that we were not approven in our late rebellion abroad. I shall not instance what <hi>Diodati, Spanhem, Rivet, Salmasius, Blondel, Amerald,</hi> de <hi>Moulin,</hi> and many of the greatest and most famed Forreign Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, have publickly expressed against it. Some in Print, others in publick discourses and Sermons. One thing I will not passe by, that in the consistory of <hi>Charrenton,</hi> they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44658:72"/>
made an Act, that no man should be barred the Communion for the Scots excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, except it were for a crime; and so told the late Bishop of <hi>Orkney</hi> then of <hi>Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> that the pretended excommunication of <hi>Scotland,</hi> should no way hinder their receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to their Communion; and this was a loud declaration of their disowning and condemning the Scots practices.</p>

               <p>But tell me ingenuously, Are there no precedents in History for Subjects fighting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Religion; and have none of the Writters of the Church asserted it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, there have, and I will deal inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously with you upon this head. The first I know is Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the seventh, who arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the subjects of <hi>Germany</hi> against <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth Emperour, upon the account of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; because the Emperour laid claime to the investitures of Bishops, they being then secular Princes. And this prospering so well in the hands of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> other Popes made no bones, upon any displeasure they conceived, either against King or Emperour, to take his Kingdom from him, and free his subjects from their obedience to him; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes pretending some matter of Religion, as you may read particularly in the History of <hi>Frederick</hi> the first, <hi>Frederick</hi> the second, <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baviere,</hi> Emperours, <hi>Philip Le bell</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12th of <hi>France, Henry</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44658:72"/>
and <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>England, Conradine</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Navarre.</hi> These are the eldest precedents I meet with in History, for your bussinesse; and the latest is the holy League of <hi>France,</hi> from which our whole matter seems transcribed. The authors who plead for this, are only <hi>Courtiers, Cannonists</hi> and <hi>Iesuits.</hi> Now how are you not ashamed in a matter of such importance to symbolize with the worst gang of the Roman Church, (for the soberer of them condemn it) yet fill heaven and earth with your clamours if in some innocenter things the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> seem to symbolize with them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.</speaker>
               <p>No, you still retain the Papacy, you only change the person from the Pope to the King, whom you make head of the Church, and swear to him in these termes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>This is so impudent a calumny, that none but such as have a minde to reproach would use it: which I shall clear by giving an account of the whole matter. In <hi>England,</hi> you know the Pope, beside his general tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anny, exercised a particular authority, after King <hi>Iohn</hi> had basely resigned the Crown to him, <hi>vide Matth. Paris. ad An.</hi> 1213. When therefore the Reformation was introduced in <hi>England,</hi> and the Papal yoke shaken off, the oath of Supremacy was brought in to exclude all forreign jurisdiction, and to reinstate the King in his civil authority <hi>over all persons
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44658:73"/>
and in all causes, as well ecclesiastical as ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> I confesse <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, did directly set up a civil Papacy, but you know the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of <hi>England</hi> was never dated from his breach with the Bishop of <hi>Rome:</hi> But the oath of Supremacy was never designed to take away the Churches intrinsick power, Or to make that the power of Ordination, giving Sacraments, or Discipline, flowed from the King, to which he only gives his civil sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and confirmation. However, because the words being general, might suggest some scrouples, they are clearly explained in an Act of Parliament of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; and in one of the 39 Articles, and more fully by the incomparable and blessed Bishop <hi>Vsher,</hi> to whom, for his pains, King <hi>Iames</hi> gave thanks in a letter. Now this Oath being brought from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> none ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend scrouples, since both the words in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are sufficiently plain, and the meaning affixed to them in <hi>England,</hi> is yet plainer: And we having it from them, must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to have it in their sense.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>This is one of your mutinous Arts, to find out long and hard names, and affix them to any thing that displeaseth you. In the Old Testament, you find the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently medling in Divine matters; and the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44658:73"/>
                  <hi>Sannedrim,</hi> which was a civil court, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all matters of Religion; And you are very ignorant in History if you know not, that the Christian Emperours still medled in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion. The first general Councils, were called by them, as appears by their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodical Acts and Epistles. And by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts all the Historians give, they also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the Councils; so <hi>Constantine</hi> at <hi>Nice, Theodose</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> Earl <hi>Candidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> in name of <hi>Theodose</hi> the second at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Martian</hi> at <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> Its true in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, they only ordered matters, but did not decide in them, as particularly appears from the Commission given to Earle <hi>Candidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi> inserted in the Acts of the <hi>Ephesin</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. They also judged in matters of schisme; so <hi>Constantine</hi> in the Donatist bussinesse, even after it had been judged, both by <hi>Miltiades</hi> and <hi>Marcus,</hi> Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Millan,</hi> by the Synod of <hi>Arles,</hi> and by the Council of <hi>Nice</hi>; Yea, the <hi>Code</hi> and <hi>Basilicks,</hi> and the <hi>Capitolers</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the great, shew, they never thought it without their sphere, to make lawes in Ecclesiastick matters. The Bishops also were named by them, or, at least, their elections were to be approven by them, not excepting the Roman Bishop, though he was the proudest pretender of all, who after the overthrow of the <hi>Western</hi> Empire, was to send to <hi>Constantinople</hi> or <hi>Ravenna,</hi> to get
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44658:74"/>
his Election ratified: and when the Western Empire was reasumed by <hi>Charles</hi> the great at <hi>Rome,</hi> it was expresly provided, that the Emperour should choose the Roman Bishop. So Kings medling in Ecclesiastical affaires, was never contraverted till the Roman Church swelled to the height of Tyranny, and since the Reformation, it hath been still stated as one of the differences betwixt us and them.</p>

But though I have made considerable observations in this,

But let us all jointly pray, that God, in whose hands all our hearts are, may incline us all to peace, love and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: I shall therefore sum up all in the words of Scripture, which if they weigh not with you, there is no hope man shall prevail on you; <hi>If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies: fulfill ye my joy, that ye be like minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. Let nothing be done through strife, or vain glory, but in low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of mind, let each esteem others better then themselves. Who is a wise man, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of wisdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if you have bitter zeal</hi> (for that is the word in the Original) <hi>and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the truth: this wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual and divelish: For where zeal</hi> (the word is still the same) <hi>and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work. But the wisdom that is from above, is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy, and good fruits, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality, and without hypocrisy; and the

fruit of righteousness is sowen in peace, of them that make peace. Put on therefore (as the elect of God, holy and beloved) bowels of mercies, kindnesse, humblenesse of mind, meeknesse, long-suffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave the Church, so also do ye: but above all these things, put on Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is the bond of perfectness; and let the peace of God rule in your minds, to the which also you are called in one body: and be ye thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
