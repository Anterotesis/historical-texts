            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>OF Auricular Confeſſion.</head>
            <p>THE Zealots of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are wont to Glory of the ſingular advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in the Communion of that Church, eſpecially in reſpect of the greater means and helps of Spiritual comfort, which they pretend are to be had there, above and beyond what are to be found amongſt other Societies of Chriſtians. Which one thing, if it could be as ſubſtantially made out, as it is confidently aſſerted, could not fail to ſway very much with all Wiſe men, and would undoubtedly prevail with all devout per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, (who were made acquainted with the ſecret) to go over to them. But if contrariwiſe it appear upon ſearch, that their pretenſions of this kind are falſe and groundleſs, and that the methods of Adminiſtring conſolation, which are peculiar to that Church, are as well unſafe and deceitful, as ſingular and unneceſſary: Then the ſame Prudence and Sincerity, will oblige a man to ſuſpect that Communion, inſtead of becoming a proſelyte to it, and to look upon the aforeſaid boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as the effect either of deſigned impoſture, or at the leaſt of Ignorance and Deluſion.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other things, that Church highly values it ſelf upon, the Sacrament of Penance (as they call it) and as deeply blames and condemns the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and other Reformed Churches, for their defect in, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54888:3"/>
of ſo important and comfortable an Office. And under that ſpecious pretext, her Emiſſaries (who are wont according to the phraſe of the Apoſtle, <hi>to creep into houſes, and lead Captive ſilly Women,</hi> &amp;c.) inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themſelves into ſuch of the People as have more Zeal then knowledge, and now and then wheadle ſome of them over into their Society. To that purpoſe, they will not only harangue them with fine ſtories of the eaſe and benefit of it, as of an Ancient and uſeful Rite, but will alſo Preach to them the neceſſity of it as of Divine Inſtitution, and that it is as important (in its kind) as Baptiſm or the Lords Supper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For that Confeſſion to a Prieſt, and his Abſolution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon obtained, is the only means appointed by God for the procuring of Pardon of all mortal ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>As for Original ſin, or whatſoever actual tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions may have been committed before Baptiſm, <note place="margin">

And for ſins of Infirmity or Venial ſins, theſe may be done away by ſeveral eaſy methods, by Contrition alone ſay ſome, nay, by Attrition alone <note place="margin">

               </note> (ſay others) by Habitual Grace ſays a third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But for mortal ſins committed after a man is admitted into the Church by Baptiſm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for theſe there is no other door of Mercy, but the Prieſts Lips, nor hath God appointed, or will admit of any other way of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation then this, of Confeſſion to a Prieſt, and his Abſolution.</p>
            <p>This Sacrament of Penance therefore is called by them, <hi>Secunda Tabula poſt naufragium,</hi> the peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of a lapſed Chriſtian, the only Sanctuary of a gu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lty Conſcience, the ſole means of reſtoring ſuch a perſon to Peace of Conſcience the Favour of God, and the hopes of Heaven. And withal, this method is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54888:3"/>
held to be ſo Soveraign and Effectual a remedy, that it cures <hi>toties, quoties;</hi> and whatever a mans in fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages have been, and how often ſoever repeated, if he do but as often reſort to it, he ſhall return as pure and clean as when he firſt came from the Font.</p>
            <p>This ready and eaſie way (ſay they) hath God allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, of quitting all ſcores with himſelf, in the uſe of which they may have perfect peace in their Conſciences, and may think of the day of Judgment without horror, having their Caſe decided beforehand by Gods Deputy the Prieſt, and their Pardon ready to produce, and plead at the Tribunal of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>What a mighty defect is it therefore in the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches, who wanting this Sacrament, want the principal miniſtry of reconciliation? And who would not joyn himſelf to the Society of that Church, where this great Caſe is ſo abundantly provided for? For if all this be true, he muſt be extreamly fool-hardy and deſerve to periſh, who will not be of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion from whence the way to Heaven is ſo very eaſie and obvious, no wonder therefore I ſay, if not only the loose and vicious are fond of this Communion where they may ſin and confeſs, and confeſs and ſin again without any great danger, but it would be ſtrange if the more Virtuous and Prudent alſo, did not out of more caution think it became them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his expedient. For as much as there is no man who underſtands himſelf, but muſt be conſcious of having committed ſins ſince his Baptiſm, and then for fear ſome of them ſhould prove to be of a mortal nature, it will be his ſafeſt courſe to betake himſelf to this refuge, and conſequently he will eaſily be drawn to that Church, where the only remedy of his diſeaſe is to be had.</p>
            <p>But the beſt of it is, theſe things are ſo oner ſaid then
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54888:4"/>
proved, and more eaſily phanſied by ſilly People, then believed by thoſe of diſcretion. And therefore there may be no culpable defect in the reformed Churches, that they truſt not to this remedy in ſo great a Caſe. And as for the Church of <hi>England</hi> in particular, though ſhe hath no fondneſs for Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank Medicines, as obſerving them to be ſeldom ſucceſsful; yet ſhe is not wanting in her care, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to the Souls of thoſe under her guidance, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth as much tenderneſs of their peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can pretend to. Indeed ſhe hath not ſet up a Confeſſors Chair in every Pariſh, nor much leſs placed the Prieſt in the Seat of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, as thinking it ſafer, at leaſt in ordinary Caſes, to remit men to the Text of the written word of God, and to the publick Miniſtry thereof, for reſolution of Conſcience, then to the ſecret Oracle of a Prieſt in a corner, and adviſes them rather to obſerve what God himſelf declares of the nature and guilt of ſin, the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations or abatements of it, and the terms and conditions of Pardon, then what a Prieſt pronounces. But however this courſe doth not pleaſe the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for reaſons beſt known to themſelves, which if we may gueſs at, the main ſeems to be this, they do not think it fit to let men be their own carvers, but lead them like Children by the hand; my meaning is, they keep People as much in Ignorance of the Holy Scripture as they can, locking that up from them in an unknown Tongue; now if they may not be truſted with thoſe Sacred Records, ſo as to inform themſelves of the terms of the New Covenant, the conditions of the Pardon of ſin, and Salvation, it is then but reaſonable that the Prieſt ſhould Judge for them, and that they await their doom from his Mouth. Yet I do not ſee why in a Proteſtant Church,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54888:4"/>
where the whole Religion is in the Mother Tongue, the Old and eſpecially the New Teſtament conſtantly, and conſcientiouſly expounded, and the People allowed to ſearch the Scriptures, and <hi>to ſee whether things be ſo or no,</hi> I ſee not, I ſay, Why in ſuch a caſe the Prieſt may not in great meaſure be excuſed the trouble of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſecret Confeſſions, without danger to the Souls of men.</p>
            <p>But beſides this, there is a conſtant uſe of Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Abſolution too, in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in every Days Service; which though they be both in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms, as they ought to be in publick Worſhip, yet every Penitent can both from his own Conſcience ſupply the generality of the Confeſſion by a remorſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reflection upon his own particular ſins, as well as if he did it at the knees of a Prieſt; and alſo by an Act of Faith can apply the general Sentence of Abſolution to his own Soul, with as good and comfortable effects, as if it had been ſpecially pronounced by his Confeſſor.</p>
            <p>But this publick Confeſſion doth not pleaſe the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> neither, and they know a Reaſon for their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; namely, becauſe this doth not conciliate ſo great a Veneration to the Prieſt-hood, as when all men are brought to kneel to them for Salvation: Neither doth this way make them to pry into the ſecret thoughts of Men, as Auricular Confeſſion doth, wherein the Prieſt is not only made a Judge of mens eſtate, but a Spy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their behavior, and is capable of becoming an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencer to his Superiors of all the Deſigns, Intereſts, and even Conſtitutions of the People.</p>
            <p>Moreover the Church of <hi>England</hi> allows of private Confeſſions alſo, as particularly in the Viſitation of the ſick, (which office extends alſo to them that are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Mind or Conſcience, as well as to the afflicted in Body) where the Miniſter is directed to examine
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54888:5"/>
particularly the ſtate of the Decumbents Soul, to ſearch and romage his Conſcience, to try his Faith, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, his Charity, nay, to move him to make a ſpecial Confeſſion of his ſins, and afterwards to abſolve him upon juſt grounds.</p>
            <p>Nay further yet, if (beſides the caſe of Sickneſs) any Man ſhall either out of perplexity of Mind, ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſity or remorſe of Conſcience, or any other devout conſideration, think it needful to apply himſelf to a Prieſt of the Church of <hi>England</hi> for advice, eaſe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, he hath incouragement and direction ſo to do in the firſt Exhortation to the Holy Communion, and may be ſure to find thoſe who will tenderly, and faithfully, as well as ſecretly adminiſter to his neceſſities. So that I ſee not what defect or omiſſion can be objected to this Church in all this Affair, or what Temptation any Man can have upon this account to go from us to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all this will not ſatisfy them of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they are neither contented with publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, nor with private, no nor with ſecret neither, if it be only occaſional or voluntary: It is the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality and neceſſity of it which they inſiſt upon, for it is not with them a Matter of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, to prevent the Scandal of the Society, to conſerve the Reverence of the Church, or to reſt rain men from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or much leſs an Office of Expediency and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be reſorted to upon exigencies, or ſuch as may accidentally become neceſſary upon emergency as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the atrocity of ſome fact committed, the ſcandalouſneſs of ſome perſons former life, which may make him more doubtful of his Pardon, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Judgment, the Melancholy of his Temper, or the Anxiety of his Mind, or any ſuch like occaſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it muſt be the ſtanding indiſpenſable duty of all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54888:5"/>
men, as the condition of the Pardon of their Sins; in one word it muſt be a Sacrament of Divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of Univerſal Obligation.</p>

Now in oppoſition to this Doctrine and Decree of theirs, and the practice of that Church purſuant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as well as in defence of the Doctrine and Practice of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in that particular, I will here endeavor to make good theſe Three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our bleſſed Lord and Saviour hath neither in his Goſpel inſtituted ſuch an Auricular Confeſſion as aforeſaid, nor much leſs, ſuch a Sacrament of Penance as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſuppoſes in the recited De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Auricular Confeſſion hath not been of conſtant and univerſal uſe in the Chriſtian Church, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> pretend, much leſs looked upon as of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental and neceſſary Obligation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Auricular Confeſſion as it is now uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not only unneceſſary and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, but in many reſpects very miſchievous to Piety, and the great ends of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>If the firſt of theſe appear to be true, then (at the worſt) the want of ſuch an Auricular Confeſſion in the reformed Churches, can be but an irregularity, and no eſſential defect.</p>
            <p>If the ſecond of theſe aſſertions be made good, then it can be no defect at all in thoſe Churches that uſe not ſuch a Rite, but a novelty and impoſition on their parts who ſo ſtrictly require it.</p>
            <p>But if the third be true, it will be the corruption and great fault of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to perſevere in the injunction and practice of it, and the excellency and commendation of thoſe Churches which exclude it.</p>
            <p>I begin with the firſt, that it doth not appear that our Saviour hath inſtituted ſuch an Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, of ſuch a Sacrament of Penance as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends and practiſes.</p>
            <p>I confeſs it is a Negative which I here undertake to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54888:6"/>
make good, which is accounted a difficult Province, but the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath relieved us in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular by founding the Inſtitution expreſly upon that one paſſage of the Goſpel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 22. So that we ſhall not need to examine the whole Body of Scripture to diſcover what footſteps of Divine Inſtitution may be found here or there, for the Council wholly inſiſts and relies upon that Text of St. <hi>John,</hi> and therefore if that fail them, the whole <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> falls to the ground.</p>
            <p>Now for the clearing of this, let us lay the words before us; and they are theſe, <hi>He breathed on them, and ſaid, Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt, whoſoever ſins ye remit they are remitted unto them, and whoſoever ſins ye retain, they are retained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here I appeal to any Man that hath Eyes in his Head, or Ears to hear, whether in this Text there be any one word of Auricular Confeſſion, or much leſs of ſuch a circumſtantiated one as they require; And this is ſo manifeſt and notorious, that their own ancient Canoniſts and ſeveral of their learned Divines are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the pretence of Divine Inſtitution founded upon this or any other paſſage of Scripture, and therefore are content to defend the practice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this particular, upon the account of the Authority, and general uſage of the Church; which we ſhall come to examine by and by in its due place.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I cannot chooſe but admire the mighty Faith of a <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> who can believe in ſpight of his own Eyes. It ſeemed to us an unſuperable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty heretofore, for a Man to perſuade himſelf that in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt Bread was tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated into Fleſh, becauſe it was againſt the expreſs Teſtimony of Senſe, yea, although for that there was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54888:7"/>
the countenance of Five figurative (but miſtaken) words to ſupport the credulity; but this of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Penance clearly out-does it, for here a Man muſt believe a thing to be, when as there is not ſo much as one word for the ground of his Faith, or the proof of the thing in queſtion. How many Sacraments may not ſuch men have if they pleaſe? What voluminous Creeds may not they ſwallow and digeſt? What Mountains may not ſuch a wonderful Faith remove?</p>
            <p>But let us hear what they have to ſay for themſelves; perhaps in the firſt place they will plead the Authority of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which hath peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the ſenſe of the paſſage of the Goſpel to the purpoſe aforeſaid. Indeed that Council in the third Canon of their fourteenth Seſſion, doth damn all thoſe who deny that a Sacrament of Penance and Auricular Confeſſion is preſcribed in that Text of St. <hi>John,</hi> or who apply it to any other purpoſe. But in ſo doing, they both uſurp a Prerogative which was never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to or practiſed by any Council before them, and withal they betray a conſciouſneſs that the Text it ſelf yielded no ſufficient evidence of the thing which they deſigned to countenance by it; for what Councils (ever till now) brought a Text, and then impoſed an Interpretation upon it contrary to the words? And then backt that Interpretation with an <hi>Anathema?</hi> If the Text were plain or could be made ſo, why was not that done? And to be ſure if that cannot be done by other means, the curſe will not do it; at leaſt to any but very obedient <hi>Roman</hi> Conſciences. Beſides if this courſe be allowed, I ſee not but a Council may bring in what Religion they pleaſe, having firſt made a Noſe of Wax of the Holy Scripture, and then writhed it into what ſhape they beſt phanſy; for in ſuch a caſe, if the words of the Goſpel do not favour me, I can go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54888:7"/>
the ſenſe, and if the letter be ſilent or intractable, I can help that with an Interpretation; and if I have authority or confidence enough to impoſe that, under the peril of <hi>Anathema,</hi> I am no longer an Interpreter or a Judg, but a Law-giver, and need not trouble my ſelf with <hi>Scriptum eſt,</hi> but may (if I will ſpeak plain) ſay <hi>decretum eſt,</hi> and the buſineſs is done.</p>
            <p>But if neither the Letter of Scripture, nor the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Council will do in this caſe, then in the ſecond place they think they have at leaſt ſome colour of Reaſon to relieve them; and if they cannot find Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular Confeſſion in the Text, yet they will by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence infer it thence; for they ſay although indeed it is true it is not here expreſly mentioned, yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that our Saviour in the Text before us inſtituted a Sacrament of Penance, and therefore Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion muſt neceſſarily be implied becauſe abſolution cannot be without Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>Here the Reader will obſerve that the point in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion between us is very much altered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we are now fallen from the conſideration of the Divine Inſtitution of Auricular Confeſſion in particular to that of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Penance in general, <hi>i. e.</hi> from a direct proof to a <hi>ſubintelligitur.</hi> But we will follow them hither alſo, and for the clearing of this matter we will brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether that can properly be ſaid to be of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution, and neceſſary to Salvation, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on an inference, and is proved only by an <hi>innuendo?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether it can be reaſonable to aſſert that our Saviour there inſtitutes a Sacrament of Penance, where not only Auricular Confeſſion, but the whole matter of ſuch a Sacrament is leſt undefined?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether if our Saviour (had done that which it is plain he hath not, that is,) had here inſtituted and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54888:8"/>
appointed all thoſe things, which by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are required as the material parts of Penance, yet this could have been eſteemed a Sacrament?</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt of theſe, we have no more to do but to conſider the force and ſignification of this word <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</hi> Now that in the common uſe of men (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of thoſe which ſpeak diſtinctly and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly) implies a ſetting up <hi>de novo,</hi> or the appointing that to become a duty, which was not knowable, or at leaſt not known to be ſo before it became ſo appointed. For this word <hi>Inſtitution</hi> is that which we uſe to expreſs a poſitive command by, in oppoſition to that which is Moral in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, and of natural obligation. Now it is very evident that all things of this Nature ought to be appointed very plainly and expreſly, or elſe they can carry no obligation with them; for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Reaſon of their becoming matter of Law or Duty, lies in the will of the Legiſlator, if that be not plainly diſcovered, they cannot be ſaid to be inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, and ſo there can be no Obligation to obſerve them, becauſe <hi>where there is no Law, there can be no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion;</hi> and a Law is no Law in effect which is not ſufficiently promulged. Is it not therefore a very ſtrange thing to tell us of an Inſtitution by implication only, and yet at the ſame time to tell us that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo (pretended to be) inſtituted, is no leſs then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely <note place="margin">Seſſ. 14. C. 2.</note> neceſſary to the Salvation of Sinners?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond of theſe will eaſily be reſolved by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what we obſerved before from the Council of <hi>Trent, viz.</hi> that this Sacrament of Penance conſiſts of <note place="margin">Seſſ. 14. C 3</note> Matter and Form; the Form is the Prieſts Abſolution, but the Matter or Materials of this Sacrament are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, Confeſſion to a Prieſt, and Satisfaction or Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Penance enjoyn'd by him; now it is evident that not only Auricular Confeſſion (of which we have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54888:8"/>
ſpoken hitherto but alſo Contrition and Satisfaction, are wholly omitted and paſt over in ſilence by the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt in this paſſage of Scripture, from whence they fetch their Sacrament of Penance; and is it not a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſtrange thing, that our Saviour ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to inſtitute a Sacrament without any Materials of it at all? Surely therefore this muſt be either a very <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Sacrament, or none at all.</p>
            <p>Let us gueſs at the probability of this in proportion to either of the other undoubted Sacraments. Suppoſe our Saviour inſtead of that accurate form in which he inſtituted the Euchariſt had only ſaid, I would have you my Diſciples and all that ſhall believe on my Name to keep a Memorial of me when I am gone: Or ſuppoſe he ſaid only as he doth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 55. <hi>My Fleſh is Meat indeed, and my Blood is drink indeed,</hi> would any one have concluded here, that our Saviour in ſo ſaying, had appointed Bread and Wine to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, to be received in ſuch a manner, and in a word that he had (without more ado) inſtituted ſuch a Sacrament as we uſually celebrate? No certainly, and therefore we ſee our Saviour is the moſt expreſs and particular therein that can be, <hi>for he takes Bread, bleſſes it, breaks it, gives it to them, ſaying, Take eat, this is my body,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>after Supper he takes the Cup, bleſſes it, gives it to them, ſaying, Drink ye all of this, for this is the New Teſtament in my Blood,</hi> &amp;c. and then adds, <hi>do this in remembrance of me.</hi> Now who is there that obſerves this accuracy of our Saviour in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, can imagine that he ſhould intend to inſtitute a Sacrament of Penance, and that as neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (in the Opinion of the <hi>Romaniſts)</hi> as the other, only with this Form of words, <hi>Whoſoever ſins ye remit they are remitted,</hi> &amp;c. and without the leaſt mention of Confeſſion, Contrition, or any other Material or neceſſary Part of Circumſtance of it.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:54888:9"/>
3. But in the third and laſt place, let us ſuppoſe that our Saviour had in the Text before us inſtituted Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and had appointed particularly all thoſe things, which they call the Material parts of it, (as it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he hath not) yet even then, and upon that Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, Penance would not have proved to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament properly ſo called.</p>
            <p>I confeſs according to a looſe acceptation of the word Sacrament, ſomething may be ſaid for it; for ſo there are many things have had the name of Sacrament applied to them. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſomewhere calls <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s Ax the Sacrament of Wood, and in his Book againſt <hi>Marcion</hi> he ſtiles the whole Chriſtian Religion a Sacrament. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in ſeveral places calls Bread, Fiſh, the Rock, and the Myſtery of Number, Sacraments, for he hath given us a general Rule in his Fifth Epiſtle, <hi>viz.</hi> That all ſigns when they belong to divine things are called Sacraments: And in conſideration hereof it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by <hi>Caſſander,</hi> that the Number of Sacraments was indefinite in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, until the times of <hi>Peter Lombard.</hi> But all this notwithſtanding, and properly ſpeaking, this Rite of Penance taking it altogether (and even ſuppoſing whatſoever the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> can ſuppoſe to belong to it) cannot be reputed a Sacrament, according to the allowed definitions of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament delivered by their own Divines. Some of them define a Sacrament thus, <note n="a" place="margin">Hugo <hi>de S.</hi> Vict. <hi>lib. de Sacram.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Sacramentum eſt corporale ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum foris ſenſibiliter propoſitum, ex ſimilitudine reprae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentans &amp; ex inſtitutione ſignificans, &amp; ex Sanctificatione continens inviſibilem gratiam.</hi> And the <note n="b" place="margin">Magiſt. Sent. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>diſt.</hi> 1.</note> Maſter of the Sentences himſelf deſcribes it ſomewhat more briefly, but to the ſame effect in theſe words: <hi>Sacramentum eſt inviſibilis gratiae viſibilis forma, ejuſdem gratiae imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem gerens &amp; cauſa exiſtens;</hi> both which definitions are acknowledged and applauded by the Jeſuite <note n="c" place="margin">Becanus <hi>Tract.</hi> 2. <hi>de Sacramentis.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Becanus:</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:54888:9"/>
And the plain truth is a Sacrament cannot be better expreſt in ſo few words, then it is by St. <note n="*" place="margin">Aug. <hi>c.</hi> Fauſt. <hi>Lib.</hi> 19. C. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Auſtin</hi> when he calls it <hi>verbum viſibile</hi> a viſible Word or Goſpel: For it pleaſed the Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs by this inſtitution of Sacraments to condeſcend to our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and thereby to give us ſenſible Tokens or Pledges of what he had promiſed in his Written word, to the intent that our dulneſs might be relieved, and our Faith aſſiſted; foraſmuch as herein, our Eyes and other Senſes as well as our Ears are made Witneſſes of his gracious intentions. Thus by Baptiſmal waſhing he gives us a ſenſible token and repreſentation of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and the waſhing away of our ſins by the Blood of Chriſt; and by the participation of Bread and Wine in the Lords Supper we have a Token and Symbol of our Union with Chriſt, our Friendſhip with God and Communion with each other.</p>
            <p>But now it is manifeſt there is no ſuch thing as this in their Sacrament of Penance (as even <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſes.) For they do not ſay or mean that the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Prieſt is a Token or Emblem of God's forgiveneſs, but that the Prieſt actually pardons in God's ſtead, by Virtue of a Power delegated to him. So that according to them, here muſt be a Sacrament, not only without any material parts inſtituted, but alſo without any thing Figurative, Symbolical or Significative which ſeems to be as expreſly contrary to their own Doctrine in the aforeſaid definitions as to the truth it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Nay, further to evince the difference of this Rite of Penance from all other proper Sacraments; it deſerves obſervation, that whereas in thoſe other acknowledged Sacraments, the Prieſt in God's Name delivers to us the Pledges and Symbols of Divine Grace. Here in this of Penance we muſt bring all the material Parts and Pledges our ſelves, and preſent them to God, or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54888:10"/>
to the Prieſt in his ſtead: My meaning is, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as (for inſtance) in Baptiſm the Prieſt applies to us the Symbol of Water, and in the Euchariſt delivers to us the conſecrated Elements in token of the Divine Grace, contrary-wiſe here in Penance we muſt on our parts bring with us Contrition, Confeſſion, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction too, in which reſpect we may be rather ſaid to give Pledges to God, then he to us; which is wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from the Nature of other Sacraments, and ſeems no leſs to be contrary to the Reaſon and Notion of a Sacrament in general.</p>
            <p>The Sum of what we have hitherto diſcourſed, amounts to this; Firſt, That here is no Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion inſtituted by our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 22. as was pretended. Secondly, Nor, any Sacrament of Penance in which it can be included or implied; no nor indeed any Sacrament at all.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I might have ſpared all the words I have uſed in proving the latter, for ſo long as I have made appear that private Confeſſion is not inſtituted, it was not ſo very material to conſider whether Penance could be a Sacrament or no; but this I added to ſhew the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious dictates of that Church, and their extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy in impoſing the moſt Sacred Names upon their own inventions, thereby to give them the greater ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration with the People.</p>
            <p>And thus I would diſmiſs the firſt part of my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, but yet the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will not forego their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions for Auricular Confeſſion; for they will yet urge, that whether or no we will call it a Sacrament which our Saviour inſtitutes in the Text before us, it is however certain here is a Power conferred on the Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors, of remitting and retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſins; for by theſe words, <hi>Whoſoever ſins ye remit they are remitted,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Chriſtus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituit Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes ſui ipſius Vicarios.</hi> Seſſ. 14. <hi>Praſides &amp; Judices</hi> Ib. c. 4.</note> Our Saviour hath made the

So they.</p>
            <p>But I crave leave to demand in the firſt place, Is it certain that upon ſuch a Confeſſion as they require, the Prieſt (as ſuch) will be able to make a right judgment of a Mans caſe that addreſſes himſelf to him, eſpecially conſidering the intricacy of ſome Caſes, and the ignorance of ſome Prieſts; upon this account are thoſe memorable words of St. <hi>Auſtin Confeſſ. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>Quid mihi ergo eſt cum homini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ut audiant Confeſſiones meas, quaſi ipſi ſanaturi ſint omnes languores meos, &amp; unde ſciunt cum à meipſo de meipſo audiunt, an verum dicam? Quando quidem ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo ſcit hominum quid agitur in homine, niſi ſpiritus hominis qui in ipſo eſt. i. e.</hi> 
               <q>To what purpoſe ſhould I Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my ſins to Men who cannot heal my wounds? For how ſhall they (who know nothing of my heart but by my own Confeſſion) know whether I ſay true or no? For no one knows what is in Man, but the Spirit of Man that is in him.</q> O yes, they will ſay <hi>clave non errante,</hi> that is to ſay, if he judge right, he judges right, and no more, and this is mighty comfort to a diſtreſſed conſcience.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Though we grant our Saviour hath given the Prieſt Authority to Remit and Retain ſins, yet how doth it appear that this extends to Secret ſins; ſins; in thought only, or as the Council expreſſes it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54888:11"/>
againſt the ninth and tenth Commandments? Of open ſins and publick ſcandals the Church hath cognizance, and hath a right which ſhe may inſiſt upon, or recede from, if ſhe ſee cauſe, becauſe ſuch ſins are an injury to the Society as well as an offence againſt God, and therefore here the Officers of the Church may diſpenſe her Authority, and Remit or Retain (as we ſhall ſee more by and by;) but in ſecret ſins where only God is injured, and to which he is only pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, what hath the Church to do, unleſs they be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily diſcovered to her? Otherwiſe they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly reſerved Caſes to the Tribunal of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I would be bold to enquire further, why may not ſins, eſpecially ſuch as we laſt named, be Remitted upon Confeſſion to God, without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to the Prieſt alſo? And I the rather ask this for theſe two reaſons, Firſt I obſerve that this very Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſaith, that until the times of our <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> Saviour, and his Inſtitution of this Sacrament, ſins were remitted upon contrition only, and application to the mercies of God, without Auricular Confeſſion. They cannot therefore now ſay, remiſſion implies this Confeſſion, for that cannot be ſaid to be implied in the nature of a thing, when the thing it ſelf can be had without it.</p>
            <p>They will anſwer that it is ſufficient, that it is now made neceſſary by our Saviour. But I reply, Then that Inſtitution which now makes it neceſſary, muſt be better proved then yet it hath been, or elſe Men will be very apt to hope they may now under the Goſpel obtain Pardon (at leaſt) upon as eaſie terms as it was to be had at before.</p>
            <p>My Second reaſon of asking that Third Queſtion is this; I obſerve that their own Schoolmen acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aquinas ſumm. part.</hi> 3. <hi>Q.</hi> 68.</note> ſins to be remitted under the Goſpel by the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54888:11"/>
Prieſt without any Confeſſion to Men, particularly in the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm, by which it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears, that Confeſſion is not implied in the nature of Remiſſion, but one may be had without the other, and then why may not a ſinner after Baptiſm, hope for Pardon upon his contrite and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout application to the Word and Sacraments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this new device and pick-lock of Conſcience, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular Confeſſion.</p>

I proceed now to the ſecond thing propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, namely, to inquire hiſtorically whether or no Auricular, or ſuch a ſecret, and Sacramental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as aforeſaid, hath been of conſtant and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal uſe in the Chriſtian Church, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> aſſerts, <hi>Seſſi.</hi> 14. Chap. 5.</p>
            <p>This inquiry is not into matter of Law or Divine Right, as the former was, but of Fact only, yet never the leſs it is of great moment upon a double account:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe this is the ground which the Old <hi>Roman</hi> Canoniſts wholly went upon, (as I noted before;) they exploded all pretence of Divine Inſtitution in the caſe, as having more modeſty (it ſeems) then to pretend ſo high upon no better evidence, or at leaſt they contented themſelves to preſcribe for it only upon the Authority of conſtant and univerſal practice; now if we ſhew the falſeneſs, of this ground, as well as of the other, then will their Hypotheſis of Auricular Confeſſion have no foot to ſtand upon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Credit of what hath been already ſaid under the former head doth very much depend upon this, and that Diſcourſe will be confirmed or impaired reſpectively to what ſhall be evidently made out in this ſecond point. Foraſmuch as if on the one
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54888:12"/>
ſide it be made apparent that ſuch a Rite hath been of conſtant uſe in the Chriſtian Church, it will afford a great preſumption that it took its riſe at firſt from Divine Inſtitution, notwithſtanding all we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the contrary. So on the other ſide, if the Evidence here anſwer not the Pretenſion, and no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient footſteps of conſtant and univerſal practice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: Then will all that which we have hitherto diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed, be greatly ſtrengthened and confirmed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is by no means probable, that if there had been a Divine Law in the caſe, that ſuch a thing would have been generally neglected by the Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>Now for the clearing of this, though I am here on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the defenſive, and ſo bound to no more then to examine the proofs which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> bring for their pretenſions, yet I will deal ingenuouſly, as ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to find Flaws, but to diſcover the Truth, and therefore give theſe inſtances as ſo many reaſons for the Negative.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place I crave leave to premiſe this: If Auricular Confeſſion were ſo great a Goſpel myſtery, ſo wonderfully efficacious a method of ſaving Souls, as to be typified in the Law (as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> teach) as well as inſtituted in the Goſpel and practiſed by the whole Church, one might ſeem juſtly to wonder how it comes to paſs that there ſhould be no mention, nor appearance of it in the whole courſe of our Saviours own Miniſtry; he uſed to be an example, as well as a Law-giver to the Church, he waſhed his Diſciples Feet, before he enjoined them to waſh one another; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified the other Sacraments before he preſcribed his Apoſtles to adminiſter them, &amp; one would have thought ſuch an Inſtance of his example had been more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in this buſineſs of Penance, rather than any other, if it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54888:12"/>
had been but to make way for the Underſtanding of ſo obſcure an Inſtitution; ſince eſpecially, one would have thought to find ſome Traces of this in the Miniſtry of our Saviour, becauſe he daily converſed with ſinners, he reproved them, inſtructed them, healed them, pardoned them, but never brought any of them to ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as we are treating of; <hi>viz.</hi> To a particular enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of their ſins with the circumſtances, nor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo doing formally abſolved them. His very Diſciples (ſome of which had been great ſinners) were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without it; the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> was told by him all that ever ſhe did, but ſhe was not brought on her knees to make her own Confeſſion; but moſt ſtrange of all it is, that the Woman taken in Adultery, when he had made her accuſers ſlink away, was not privately brought to it; it may be they will ſay, there was no need of Confeſsion to him who knew all before, but yet it might have been neceſſary to bring theſe Sinners to be aſhamed of themſelves by that means to work Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and fit them for Pardon, at leaſt if this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod had been of ſuch mighty uſe and wonderful neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as is pretended.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But to let paſs that; in the next place it is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of wonder that nothing of this practice appears in the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles; they went about preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel, calling Men to Repentance, ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and governing Churches, but never ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves down in a Confeſſors Chair for penitents, ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to tell them in their Ear, the Story of their vicious Lives; indeed we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 18. That ſome came <hi>in and ſhewed their deeds;</hi> but firſt it was voluntary, and in a fit of Holy Zeal, for we cannot find that they were required to do it, as of Sacramental Obligation; &amp; beſides, the Confeſſion was publick before the Church, not clancular, and whiſpered in ſecret; it is true al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54888:13"/>
that St. <hi>James, chap.</hi> 5. 16. adviſes the Chriſtians to confeſs their faults one to another, (which is made a mighty evidence in this Caſe;) but it is as true, that this was ſpoken in an extraordinary Caſe, as appears <hi>v.</hi> 14. in bodily ſickneſs and diſtreſs of Conſcience, they are adviſed to lay open their condition, in order to relief and ſuccour, by the more ardent and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Prayers of thoſe who ſhould be made privy to it, but it is not made a ſtanding and univerſal rule for all Men to comply with, whether they be ſick or well, in proſperity or adverſity, perplexed or quiet in their Conſciences, much leſs of Sacramental and Neceſſary Obligation, as in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us go on in the next ages after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, for about two hundred years we find not one word of this kind of Confeſſion, which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for. Indeed the writings of that time which are extant, are not many, but if this buſineſs had been of ſuch conſequence as is pretended, it is ſtrange that thoſe Holy Men <hi>Ignatius, Clemens</hi> and <hi>Juſtin</hi> Martyr, ſhould not have any mention of it.</p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>Bellarmine</hi> brings us one inſtance within this Period, and that is from <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who ſpeaking of Certain Women who had been abuſed by <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> the Heretick, ſaith they afterwards came and Confeſſed all, with ſhame and ſorrow, to the Church. But what is this to the purpoſe? We diſpute not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt publick Confeſſion, which is acknowledged to be truly Primitive, and we wiſh it had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly maintained in after ages, it is only the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Clancular Confeſſion that we are unſatisfied in and this paſſage ſpeaks nothing at all to that Caſe.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:54888:13"/>
4. In <hi>Tertullians</hi> time, which was alſo much about Two hundred Years after our Saviour, we find great things ſaid of Confeſſion, but it is of that which was publick, and in the face of the Church, not to a Prieſt in a Corner, and this indeed was greatly incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and required by the Holy Men of thoſe times, as that which in the Caſe of open and ſcandalous ſins, freed the Church both from the guilt, and from the reproach of them, and in the Caſe of ſecret ſins, was a means (by open ſhame) to bring Men to Repentance, and ſo to Pardon. And the Confeſſion was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally directed to God, who was the perſon offended by the ſin, yet it was made before Men to raiſe a fervency in their Prayers, as is noted before, and to obtain their effectual interceſſion with God on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the penitent. This that Ancient writer makes manifeſt to be his Senſe in his Book <hi>de Poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia</hi> in theſe words <hi>Plerumque vero jejuniis preces alere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, ingemiſcere, lachrymari, &amp; mugire dies noctéſque ad Dominum Deum tuum, Presbyteris advolvi, &amp; aris</hi> (or rather <hi>charis) dei adgeniculari, omnibus fratribus lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones ſaae deprecationis injungere, haec omnia ex homolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſis ut poenitentiam commendet, &amp;c.</hi> the penitent often joyns Faſting to his prayers, weeps, wails and moans night and day before God, caſts himſelf at the feet of the Prieſts, kneels to all holy people, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats all the Brethren to be his Interceſſors with God Almighty for his Pardon: This is penitential Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="6">6. If we go lower yet to the times of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> we find thoſe Holy Men ſpeaking very <note place="margin">

St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>'s Judgment in the caſe we have heard before, in the Tenth Book of his Confeſſions, and third Chapter; and for the other, the Teſtimonies out of him are ſo
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54888:14"/>
many, and ſo well known, that I cannot think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to tranſcribe them; and as for St. <hi>Jerom</hi> who lived about the ſame time, I think it ſufficient to repeat the account of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> who was very converſant in his Writings, and indeed of all the other Fathers, and who had no other fault I know, but that he did uſe <hi>Mordaci radere vero,</hi> to be too great a Tell-truth; which ſure will not invalidate his Teſtimony; his words are theſe, <hi>Apparet tempore Hieronimi nondum inſtitutam fuiſſe ſecretam admiſſorum Confeſſionem.—Verùm in hoc labuntur Theologi quidam parum attenti, quòd quae veteres ſcribunt de publica &amp; generali confeſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, ea trahunt ad occultam &amp; longe diverſi generis, i. e.</hi> It is evident (ſaith he) that in St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s time (which was about Four hundred years after our Saviour) there was no ſuch thing as Secret Conſeſsion in uſe; but the miſtake is that ſome few later and inconſiderate Divines have taken the inſtances of general and publick Confeſsion then practiſed, for arguments of that Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion which is now uſed, though quite of a different nature from it.</p>
            <p>Thus we have traced the Current of Antiquity for Four or Five hundred years to ſearch for the Head of this <hi>Nilus,</hi> the ſource and riſe of that kind of Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is ſo highly magnified by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but hitherto we have found nothing of it, and this methinks ſhould be ſufficient to ſtagger an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial inquirer, (at leaſt it is as much as can be expected in ſo ſhort a Treatiſe as this is intended to be) and may ſatisfy the unprejudicate, that there is as little of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to favour this Rite, as there is of Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be pleaded for it. But yet I know on the other ſide, that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> pretend to bring abundance of Teſtimonies for it, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> particularly goes from Century to Century with his Citations to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54888:15"/>
for the conſtant and uninterrupted uſe of it, but I do ſincerely think that theſe Four following ſhort Obſervations will inable a Man to anſwer them all.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I obſerve that whereas this word <hi>Exomologeſis</hi> is commonly uſed by diverſe of the Fathers, as the Phraſe whereby they intend to expreſs the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Repentance in all the parts and branches of it, as is evident by the paſſage I cited out of <hi>Tertullian de Poenit.</hi> even now, and is acknowledged by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf; nevertheleſs, merely becauſe that word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Confeſſion properly, and nothing elſe, theſe <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Sophiſters, where they find this word <hi>Exomologeſis,</hi> force it into an Argument for that Confeſſion, which they contend for; and ſo ſeveral Diſcourſes of the Fathers, concerning Repentance in general, are made to be nothing but <hi>Exhortations</hi> to, or <hi>Encomiums</hi> of Confeſſion in particular, and that muſt be nothing elſe neither but Auricular Confeſsion, the thing in Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A caſt of his skill in this way, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> gives us in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> the very firſt Author he cites for Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Confeſsion in the laſt quoted Book and Chapter of his Writings <hi>De Sacramentis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Whereas the Novatians excluded all hopes of Repentance or Pardon for ſins committed after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, but the true Church contrariwiſe admitted to hopes of Pardon upon their Repentance; upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, when ſome of the Fathers juſtly magnify the advantages, and comfortableneſs of the true Church above the Schiſmatical, as that it ſet open a Door of Hope to thoſe who confeſſed their ſins, and applied themſelves to her Miniſtry: Hence theſe witty men will perſuade the World, that every true Church had a Confeſſors Chair, and ſuch a formal way of pardoning as they now practiſe at <hi>Rome;</hi> as if there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54888:15"/>
of Sin, where there was no Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, and as if all that excluded the latter, rejected the former too, and were no better than Novatian Hereticks; whenas in Truth the Power of the Keys is exerciſed in all the Miniſtries of the Church, and ſhe Pardons and retains Sins, otherwiſe than by the Oracle of a particular Confeſſor, as we have ſeen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. This piece of jugling the ſame <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is <note place="margin">Bellarm. <hi>de Poenit. Lib.</hi> 3. C. 8.</note> alſo guilty of in his Citation of <hi>Lactantius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Whereas the Ancient Writers are much in the Commendation of Confeſsion of Sins, whether it be to God or to the Church, but generally intending that which is Publick, it is common with thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to lay hold of all ſuch ſayings as were intended to perſuade to, and incourage publick Confeſſions, and to apply them to Auricular or Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Confeſſions, thus particularly the aforeſaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor does by <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Citation of him. <note place="margin">

            <p n="4">4. And Laſtly, Whereas it is alſo true that ſeveral of thoſe Holy Men of Old, do in ſome caſes very much recommend Confeſſion of ſecret ſins, and perſuade ſome ſorts of Men to the uſe of it, namely thoſe that are in great perplexity of Conſcience, and that needed Ghoſtly Counſel and Advice, or to the intent that they might obtain the aſſiſtance of the Churches Prayers, and make them the more ardent and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al on their behalf, whereas I ſay, they recommended this as an expreſſion of Zeal, or a prudent expedient, or at moſt as neceſſary only in ſome caſes <hi>pro hîc &amp; nunc.</hi> Theſe great Patrons of Auricular Confeſſion do with their uſual artifice apply all theſe paſſages, to prove it to be a ſtanding and univerſally neceſſary duty, a Law to all Chriſtians, this is a very common fault amongſt them, and particularly St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is thus miſapplied by the ſame forementioned Writer, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:54888:16"/>
Hitherto inquiring into the moſt Ancient and Pureſt times of the Church, by the Writings of the Fathers of thoſe times, we have not been able to diſcover any ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground for ſuch an Auricular Confeſsion, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends to, much leſs for a conſtant and uninterrupted ſucceſsion of it. But now after all I muſt acknowledge there is a paſſage in Eccleſiaſtical <note place="margin">Socrat. <hi>Hiſt. Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 19. Sozomen. <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. C. 16.</note> Hiſtory which ſeems to promiſe us ſatisfaction herein, and therefore muſt by no means be ſlightly paſſed over without due conſideration; it is the famous ſtory of <hi>Nectarius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and Predeceſſor to St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> which happen'd ſomething leſs then Four hundred years after our Saviour.</p>
            <p>The Story as it is related by the joint Teſtimony of <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> runs thus: In the time of this <hi>Nectarius</hi> there was (it ſeems) a Cuſtom in that Church (as alſo in moſt others) that one of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of greateſt Piety, Wiſdom, and Gravity ſhould be choſen Penitentiary, that is, be appointed to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Office of receiving Confeſſions, and to aſſiſt, and direct the Penitents in the management of their Repentance: Now it happens that a certain Woman of Quality, ſtricken with remorſe of Conſcience, comes to the Penitentiary (that then was) and according to Cuſtom, makes a particular Confeſſion of all ſuch ſins, as ſhe was conſcious to her ſelf to have committed ſince her Baptiſm, for which he according to his Office appointed her the Penance of Faſting, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Prayers to expiate her Guilt, and give proof of the Truth of her Repentance. But ſhe proceeding on very particularly in her Confeſſions, at laſt amongſt other things comes to declare that a certain Deacon of that Church had lien with her; upon notice of which horrid Fact, the Deacon is forthwith caſhier'd and caſt out of the Church: By which means the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54888:16"/>
takes Air, and coming to the knowledge of the People, they preſently fall into a mighty commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and rage about it, partly in deteſtation of ſo foul an Action of the Deacon, but principally in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Diſhonour, and Scandal thereby reflected on the whole Church. The Biſhop finding the Honour of the whole Body of his Clergy extreamly concern'd in this accident, and being very anxious what to do in this caſe, at laſt by the Counſel of one <hi>Eudaemon</hi> a Presbyter of that Church, he reſolves thenceforth to aboliſh the Office of Penitentiary, both to extinguiſh the preſent flame, and to prevent the like occaſion for the future; and now by this means every Man is left to the Conduct of his own Conſcience, and permitted to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Holy Myſteries at his own peril. This is the matter of fact faithfully rendered from the words of the Hiſtorian; but this if we take it in the groſs, and look no further then ſo, will not do much towards the deciding of the preſent Controverſy, we will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examine things a little more narrowly by the help of ſuch hints as thoſe Writers afford us, perhaps we may make good uſe of it at laſt; and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I obſerve in the firſt place, that though at the firſt bluſh here ſeems to be an early and great example of that Auricular Confeſſion which we oppoſe, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as here is not only the Order of the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for Confeſſion to a Prieſt, but that to be of all ſins committed after Baptiſm, and this to be made to him in ſecret; notwithſtanding upon a more thorough view it will appear quite another thing from that pleaded for, and practiſed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that eſpecially in the reſpects following: Firſt, In the Auricular Confeſſion in the Story, there is ſome remainder of the ancient Diſcipline of the Church
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54888:17"/>
(whoſe Confeſſions uſed to be open and publick, as I have ſhewed) in that here a publick Officer is appointed by the Church to receive them, ſuch an one as whoſe Prudence, and Learning, and Piety ſhe could confide in for a buſineſs of ſo great nicety and difficulty, and it is neither left to the Penitent to chooſe his Confident for his Confeſſor, nor at large for every Prieſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Authority of the Church in ſo tickliſh an Affair as that of Diſcipline, but to a publick Officer appointed by the Church for this purpoſe; ſo that Confeſſion to him cannot be ſaid to be private, ſeeing it is done to the whole Church by him. To confirm which, <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Penitentiary it ſeems was bound (as there was occaſion) to diſcover the matters (opened to him in ſecret) to the Church, as appears in the Crime of the Deacon in the Story; there was no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Seal of Confeſſion in this Caſe, as in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by Virtue of which a Man may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and go on to ſin again ſecretly, without danger of being brought upon the Stage, whatſoever the atroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Crime be, and indeed without any effectual courſe in Order to his Repentance and Reformation. Again, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Confeſſion in the Story doth not pretend to be of abſolute neceſſity as if a Mans ſins might not be pardoned without it; but only a prudent Proviſion of the Church to help Men forward in their Repentance, to direct the Acts and Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of it, and eſpecially to relieve perplexed and weak Conſciences, and to aſſiſt them in their prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper; and this appears, amongſt other things, by the account which the Hiſtorian gives us of the conſequence of aboliſhing it, <hi>viz.</hi> That now every Man is left to his own Conſcience about his partaking of the holy Myſteries; but it is not ſaid or intimated that he was left under the guilt of

his Sins, for want of Confeſſion. To which add in the laſt place, that this Office whatever it was, was not reputed a Sacrament, but rather, as I noted before, an expedient to prepare men for it, for doubtleſs nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Biſhop, nor that Church would have ever conſented to the abolition of a Sacrament, for the ſake of ſuch a Scandal as happen'd in the miſmanagement of it, or if they had done ſo, much leſs can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that the greateſt part of the Chriſtian Church would have concurred with them in it, as we ſhall by and by ſee they did.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I obſerve concerning the beginning of this Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary Office, the time and occaſion of this uſage; namely, that the Hiſtorians do not pretend it to have been Apoſtolical, much leſs of ſtrictly Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but they lay the Heat of its firſt riſe about the time of the <hi>Decian</hi> Perſecution, which was about Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after our Saviour. I confeſs <hi>Nicephorus</hi> would <note place="margin">Nicephor. <hi>Lib.</hi> 12. <hi>Cap.</hi> 28.</note> perſuade us of its greater Antiquity, and that it was rather revived then inſtituted at that time, for he ſpeaking of the bringing it into uſe at the <hi>Decian</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Church purſuant of the Ancient Eccleſiaſtical Canons conſtituted a Penitentiary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Petavius</hi> is ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the <hi>Roman</hi> Hypotheſis, as very unreaſonably to favour this Conceit; but the Truth ſeems to be (as <hi>Valeſius</hi> very ingenuouſly acknowledges) only this, that here was a miſtake of the import of the words of the Hiſtorian, who ſaith only that when the Church had choſen their Penitentiary <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they added him to the Canon, that is to the number of thoſe in the <hi>Matricula</hi> or Roll of ſuch as were to be maintain'd in and by the Church, or as we would ſay they made him Canon of the Church; not that he was Conſtituted in ſuch an Office, purſuant of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54888:18"/>
Law or Canon, as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> careleſly or will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully miſtakes. Beſides afterwards when the Hiſtorian obſerves that the Novatians univerſally withſtood this Order from the beginning of it, he calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>q. d.</hi> this new Inſtitution, or Addition, or Supplement of the Ancient Rites of the Church; ſo that there is no reaſon we ſhould date this Inſtitution higher then the Hiſtorian doth, namely, after the <hi>Decian</hi> Perſecution.</p>
            <p>But what ſhould be the ground and reaſons of erecting this new Office, and Officer in the Church then, if it was not before? Of this I give two accounts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Church being now very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and the Zeal and Devotion very great; and what by the compaſſionate reception which the Church gave to Penitents, and her ardent Prayers for them, what by the earneſt harangues of Holy Men to move People to repentance, abundance were incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to confeſs their ſins, and this Confeſſion being till that time accuſtomed to be open, and publick in the face of the Congregation, it muſt needs happen (all thoſe circumſtances conſidered together) that a great many things would be brought upon the Stage, the Publication of which would be attended with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences; for ſome ſins are of that Nature, that they ſcarce can take Air without ſpreading a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, ſome Confeſsions would make ſport for light and vain Perſons, and beſides abundance of other inconveniences (eaſy to be imagined by any one) the publication of ſome ſins might expoſe the Penitents to the Severity of the Pagan Criminal Judge; upon theſe and ſuch like conſiderations, the Church thought fit therefore I (as have intimated before) to appoint one wiſe and very grave Perſon in her ſtead to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54888:18"/>
receive the Confeſsions; who by his diſcretion might ſo diſcriminate matters, that what things were fit for ſilence, might have private Methods applied to them, but what were fit to be brought upon the Stage, might be made Publick examples of, or receive a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick remedy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, But the Hiſtorian leads us to a more ſpecial Reaſon of this Inſtitution at that time; namely, that the rage of the <hi>Decian</hi> Perſecution cruelly ſhook the Church, and abundance of her weaker members fell off in the Storm, and, which was worſt of all, the Church was diſtracted about the reſtitution or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rejection of thoſe that had ſo miſcarried; for though the beſt and wiſeſt of the Church were ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and conſiderate of humane infirmity, as to be willing to receive thoſe in again, upon Repentance, over whom the Temptation of fear had too much prevailed, yet the Novatians a great and Zealous part of Chriſtianity, looked upon ſuch as deſperate, who had once broken their baptiſmal Vow, and would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeparate from the Church themſelves, than ſuffer ſuch to be reſtored to it. Here the Church was in a great ſtrait, either ſhe muſt be very ſevere to ſome, or ſhe ſhall ſeem very unkind to others, ſhe muſt either let the weak periſh, or ſhe muſt offend them that counted themſelves ſtrong. Now in this caſe ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both tenderly compaſſionate towards thoſe that had fallen, and withal willing to ſatisfie thoſe Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Diſſenters, or at leaſt to deliver her ſelf from Scandal, takes this courſe, ſhe requires that thoſe who had fallen, and deſired to be reſtored again to her Society, ſhould acknowledge their faults, and make all the Penitent ſatisfaction that was poſſible for them to perform, that ſo neither they may be too eaſily tempted to do ſo again by the gentleneſs of the remedy, nor the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54888:19"/>
Novatians reproach her Lenity, or take pet, as if no difference was made between the ſound and the lapſed; for theſe cauſes, though the moſt publick Penance was thought little enough to be undergone by the lapſed; but yet on the other ſide, conſidering wiſely the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of publick Penance in ſome caſes (as I ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before) ſhe therefore took this middle courſe; namely, ſhe appointed a publick Confeſſor, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt heard privately the ſeveral caſes of the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, ſhould bring into publick, only ſuch of them as (without incurring any of the aforeſaid dangers) might be made exemplary. And this appears to be the true reaſon of this Inſtitution, and the bottom of this affair, by this remarkable paſſage in the Hiſtorian; That whereas the generality of the Orthodox cloſed preſently with this wife temperament, the Novatians only, thoſe ſelf conceited Non-conformiſts, rejected <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, this expedient as a new invention; they were too humourſome to comply with ſuch a temperament.</p>
            <p>But here another Queſtion ariſes, <hi>viz.</hi> How far this new expedient was imbraced by the Orthodox Churches, for if it was only received by that of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> the Authority would not be ſo great; for it is poſſible to imagine, that other Churches might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low every private Prieſt to confeſs, and ſo admit of no publick Penitentiary.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that by the Hiſtory it ſeems plain enough, that this was not the peculiar manner of the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> only, but the uſual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in that time of moſt other Churches alſo; but I muſt needs ſay, I do not find that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> complied with them herein, though it was not much to her Honour to be ſingular, where there was ſo much Prudence and Piety to have inclined her to Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54888:19"/>
However this is gained, which is my point, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not countenanced in her practice of private and clancular Confeſſions, by the general uſage of the Church, as they pretend.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I obſerve concerning this Office of Penitentiary, that as it was erected upon prudential conſiderations, ſo it was upon the ſame grounds aboliſhed, by the ſame Authority of the Church which firſt inſtituted it, and that after about Two hundred years continuance in the time of <hi>Nectarius,</hi> as we have ſeen; &amp; therein he was followed, ſaith <hi>Sozomen</hi> by almoſt all the Biſhops and Churches in the World; this therefore was far from being thought either a Divine or Apoſtolical Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: <hi>Petavius</hi> would here perſuade us, that it was only publick Confeſſion, and not private, which was upon this occaſion ſo generally laid aſide, as we have ſeen, but this is done by him more out of tenderneſs of Auricular Confeſſion, than upon good reaſon; and <hi>Valeſius</hi> goes beyond him, and will needs perſuade us, that neither publick nor private Confeſſion were put down in this juncture, but only that the lately erected Officer of Penitentiary was caſhier'd; but I muſt crave leave to ſay, there is no ſufficient reaſon for either of theſe conjectures, but on the contrary plain Evidence againſt them, for <hi>Socrates,</hi> who is the firſt and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal relater of this whole ſtory ſaith he was perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally acquainted with this Presbyter <hi>Eudemon,</hi> who gave the advice to <hi>Nectarius</hi> to make this change in the Diſcipline of the Church, and that he had the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid relation of it from his own Mouth, and expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with him about it, giving his reaſons to the contrary, and ſuggeſted his ſuſpicions that the ſtate of Piety would be much endamaged by this change, and in plain words tells him, that he had now bereft men of aſſiſtance in the conduct of their Conſciences, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54888:20"/>
hindred the great benefit men have, or might have one of another by private advice and correption. Now this fear of his had been the abſurdeſt thing in the World, if upon this counſel and advice of his, only one certain Man in the Office of publick Confeſſioner had been laid aſide, but both the uſe of publick and private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions had been kept up and retained.</p>
            <p>But after all (for ought appears) the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> kept her old Mumpſimus, ſhe tenacious of her own cuſtoms eſpecially of ſuch as may advance her Intereſt and Authority, complies not with this Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or Reformation (be it for better or worſe) but her Prieſts go on with their Confeſſions, and turn all Religion almoſt into Clancular Tranſactions, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of the example of other Churches. It may be ſhe met with oppoſition ſometimes, but ſhe was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to diſemble it till the Heroick Age of the School-men, and then thoſe luſty Champions with their Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-ſtuff of <hi>videtur quod ſic, &amp; probatur quod non,</hi> make good all her pretenſions. After them in the year 1215 comes the Fourth <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, and that decrees Auricular Conſeſſion to be made by every body once a year at the leaſt; and laſt of all comes the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and declares it to be of Divine Inſtitution, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, and the conſtant and univerſal cuſtom of the Chriſtian Church: And ſo we have the Pedigree of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Auricular Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. I come now to the third and laſt Stage of my undertaking, which is, to ſhew that Secret or Auricular Confeſſion, as it is now preſcribed and practiſed in and by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not only unneceſſary, and burdenſom in it ſelf, but alſo very miſchievous to Piety, and the great ends of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>For the former part of this charge, if it be not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough already, it will eaſily be made out from
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54888:20"/>
the Premiſes, for they cannot deny that they make this kind of Confeſſion neceſſary to Salvation, at leaſt as neceſſary as Baptiſm it ſelf is, (ſuppoſing a Man hath ſinned after Baptiſm) now if it be neither made ſo by Divine Inſtitution, nor acknowledged to be ſo by the conſtant Opinion of the Church, what an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible impoſition is here upon the Conſciences of Men, when in the higheſt and worſt ſenſe that can be they teach <hi>for Doctrines the Commandments of Men,</hi> and make Salvation harder than God hath made it, and ſuſpend mens hopes upon other terms then he hath done? If it was preſcribed by the preſent Church as a matter of Order and Diſcipline only, or of convenience and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency, we ſhould never boggle at it upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or diſpute the point with them; or if it was only declared neceſſary <hi>pro hîc &amp; nunc,</hi> upon extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary emergency, by the peculiar condition of the Penitent, his weakneſs of judgment, the perplexity of his Conſcience, his horrible guilt or extream Agonies, we would not differ with them upon that neither; but when it is made neceſſary univerſally, and declared the indiſpenſable duty of all men whatſoever who have ſinned after Baptiſm (when God hath required no ſuch thing, but declares himſelf ſatisfied with true contrition and hearty remorſe for what is paſt, and ſincere Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for the time to come; this I ſay is an intolerable Tyranny and uſurpation upon the Conſciences of Men. And that is not all neither, for beſides its bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſomneſs in the general, it particularly aggravates and increaſes a Mans other burdens, for inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving perplexed Conſciences, which is the true and principal uſe of Confeſſions to Men, this prieſtly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as it is preſcribed by the Council, intangles and afflicts them more; for that injoyns that the Penitent lay open all his ſins, even the moſt ſecret, although
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54888:21"/>
but in thought or deſire only, ſuch as againſt the Ninth or Tenth Commandment, (according to their Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Decalogue,) now this is many times diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult enough; but that's not all, he muſt alſo recount all the circumſtances of theſe ſins, which may increaſe or diminiſh the guilt, eſpecially ſuch as <hi>alter the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and kind</hi> of ſin: Now what ſad work is here for a Melancholy Man? All the circumſtances are innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and how can he tell which are they that change the Species of the act, unleſs he be as great a School-man as his Confeſſor. Beſides all this, it may be he is not very skilful in the diſtinction between venial and mortal ſins, and if he omit one mortal ſin, he is undone; therefore it is neceſſary for him (by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) to confeſs all venial ſins too, and then where ſhall the poor Man begin, or when ſhall he make an end Such a <hi>Carnifieina</hi> ſuch a rack and torture, in a word, ſuch an Holy Inquiſition is this buſineſs of Auricular Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion become. And that Eminent Divine of <hi>Strasburgh</hi> (of whom <hi>Beatus Rhenanus</hi> ſpeaks) ſeems very well to have underſtood both himſelf, and this matter who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces that <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> had with their tricks, and ſubtilties, ſo perplexed this plain Buſineſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that now it was become plainly impoſſible And ſo much for that.</p>
            <p>But as for the ſecond part of this impeachment, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Auricular Confeſſion now uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is miſchievous to Piety; This remains yet to be demonſtrated, and we will do it the rather in this place, becauſe it will be an abundant Confirmation of all that which hath been diſcourſed under the two former Heads; and might indeed have ſaved the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of them, but that we were unwilling to leave any pretence of theirs undiſcuſſed; for if this practice of theirs appear to be miſchievous to Prety, it will
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54888:21"/>
never by any ſober man be thought either to have been inſtituted by our Saviour, or to have been the ſenſe and uſage of the Catholick Church, whatever they pretend on its behalf.</p>
            <p>Now therefore this laſt and important part of my charge I make good by theſe Three Articles following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, This Method of theirs is dangerous to Piety, as it is very apt to cheat People into an Opinion that they are in a better Condition then truly they are, or may be in towards God, as that their ſins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and diſcharged by him, when there is no ſuch matter. The Church-men of <hi>Rome</hi> complain of the Doctrine of ſome reformed Divines touching aſſurance of Salvation, that it fills men with too great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and renders them careleſs and preſumptuous; but whatſoever there is in that, it is not my buſineſs now to diſpute it, however methinks it will not very well become a <hi>Romaniſt</hi> to aggravate it, till he have acquitted himſelf in the point before us; for by this Aſſurance Office of theirs they comply too much with the ſelf flattery of Mens own Hearts, they render Men ſecure, before they are ſafe, and furniſh them with a confidence like that of the Whore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>who wipes her Mouth, and ſaith I have done no evil.</hi> For Men return from the Confeſſors Chair (as they are made to believe) as Pure as from the Font, and as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent as from their Mothers Womb; as if God was concluded by the act of the Prieſt, and as if he being ſatisfied with an humble poſture, a dejected look, and a lamentable murmur, God Almighty would be put off ſo too.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ah nimium faciles qui triſtia crimina,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            <q>
               <l>Ah cheating Prieſts who made fond Men believe,</l>
               <l>That God Almighty pardons all you ſhrieve.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:54888:22"/>
Perhaps they will ſay this is the fault and folly of the Men, not of the Inſtitution of the Church: But why do they not teach them better then? Nay, why do they countenance and incourage them in ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous miſtakes? For whither elſe tend thoſe words in the Decree of the Council of <hi>Trent, ipſi Deo reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andis? q. d.</hi> that by this way of Confeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 14. <hi>Can.</hi> 1.</note> men are reconciled to the Divine Majeſty himſelf; or thoſe other forecited, where the Prieſt is ſaid to be the <hi>Vicar of Chriſt, and in his ſtead,</hi> a Judge or Preſident; or <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid. Cap.</hi> 5.</note> eſpecially what other meaning can thoſe words have where it is ſaid, that <hi>this Rite is as neceſſary as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, for as in that all ſins are remitted which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid. Cap.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>in former time, ſo in this all ſins committed after Baptiſm are likewiſe remitted?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I ſay, what is the natural tendency of all this, but to make People believe that their Salvation or Damnation is in the Power of the Prieſt, that he is a little God Almighty, and his diſcharge would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly paſs current in the Court of Heaven. But there is ſophiſtry and juggle in all this, as I thus make appear; for,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Prieſt cannot pardon whom he will, let him be called <hi>Judex</hi> and <hi>Praeſes</hi> never ſo; for if his Sentence be not according to Law it will be declared Null at the Great Day; only it may be good and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid in the mean time <hi>in foro Eccleſiae;</hi> and here lies the cheat.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor are all ſins retained or unforgiven with God, that are not pardoned by the Prieſt; it is true in publick Scandals, till the Sinner ſubmit to the Church, God will not forgive him; <hi>For what that binds on Earth is in this ſenſe bound in Heaven;</hi> but what hath the Church to do to retain, or to bind the Sinner in the caſe of ſecret ſins, where it can charge no guilt on him?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:54888:22"/>
3. Nor is it properly the act of the Prieſt which pardons, but the Tenor of the Law, and the diſpoſition of Mind in the Penitent agreeable thereunto, qualifying him for Pardon, to which the Pardon is to be imputed: As it is not the Herald which pardons, but the Prince who by his Proclamation beſtows that Grace upon thoſe who are ſo and ſo qualified.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nor, Laſtly, Can the Prieſt be ſaid to pardon ſo properly by thoſe Majeſtick words, <hi>abſolvo te,</hi> as by his whole Miniſtry, in inſtructing People in the Terms of the New Covenant, and making Application of that to them by the Sacraments; this he hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to do, but thoſe big words I cannot find that he hath any where Authority to pronounce, and therefore (as I think I obſerved before) the Ancient Church had no form of Abſolution, but only receiving Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents to the Communion: And the <hi>Greek</hi> Church had ſo much modeſty as to Abſolve in the third Perſon, not in the firſt, to ſhew that their Pardon was Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial and Declarative only.</p>
            <p>All theſe things notwithſtanding the People are let to go away with ſuch an Opinion as aforeſaid (becauſe it is for the Grandeur and Intereſt of the Prieſthood, that they ſhould be cheated; but theſe miſapprehenſions would vaniſh, if their teachers would be ſo juſt as to diſtinguiſh between God's Abſolution, and the Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Church; the firſt of which extends to the moſt ſecret ſins, the latter to open Scandals only; the one delivers from all real guilt, the other from external Cenſure only; of the latter the Prieſt may (by the leave of the Church) have the full diſpenſation, ſo that he is really pardoned with her that hath ſatisfied the Prieſt; but of the former he diſpenſes but conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. To confirm all which I will here add only two Teſtimonies of the judgment of the Ancient Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:54888:23"/>
The firſt is of <hi>Firmilianus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> in his Epiſtle to St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> reckoned the Seventy Fifth of St. <hi>Cyprians,</hi> where ſpeaking of holding Eccleſiaſtical Councils every Year, he gives theſe reaſons for it; <hi>

               <hi>vero quae Sacerdoti fit, docet qualiter purgentur. Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to God properly obtains the Pardon of Sin; but by Confeſſion to Men, we are only put into the right way to obtain pardon.</hi> Thus they:</p>
            <p>But now in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the caſe is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; there the Prieſt ſuſtains the Perſon of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and is not ſo much his Delegate as his Plenipotentiary, and his Pardon is as full and good as if the Judge of the World had pronounced it <hi>pro Tribunali;</hi> ſo that if the moſt lewd and habitual Sinner have but the good fortune to go out of the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Bleſſing of his Ghoſtly Father, that is to ſay, either death came ſo ſoon after his laſt Abſolution, or the Prieſt came ſo opportunely after his laſt ſin, that he
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54888:23"/>
hath not begun a new ſcore, he is ſure to go Heaven without more ado. This I repreſent as the firſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief attending their Doctrine, and Practice of Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Confeſſion. But this is not all, for</p>
            <p>Secondly, It corrupts and debauches the very Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Nature of Repentance which the whole Goſpel lays ſo much ſtreſs upon: Making Attrition (which is but a ſlight ſorrow for ſin, or a diſlike of it in Contemplation of the Wrath of God impendent over it) paſs for Contrition, which implies an hatred and deteſtation of it for its own moral evil and deformity, with a firm reſolution of amendment. This they many of them are not aſhamed to teach, and their practice of Abſolution ſuppoſes and requires it. The Jeſuites in particular, who have almoſt ingroſt to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the whole Monopoly of Confeſſions, avow this as their Principle. Father <hi>Bauny, Eſcobar,</hi> and <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> declare their Judgment, that the Prieſt ought to abſolve a Man upon his ſaying, that he deteſts his ſin, although at the ſame time the Confeſſor doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he does ſo. And <hi>Cauſſin</hi> ſaith, if this be not true, there can be no uſe of Confeſſions amongſt the greateſt part of Men. Theſe things (it's true) are diſliked by ſome others of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and the <hi>Curees</hi> of <hi>France</hi> are ſo honeſt as to cry ſhame of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the World; for, ſay they, Attrition is but the work of Nature, and if that alone will ſerve for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, then a Man may be pardoned without Grace. But therefore, ſay the others, the Sacrament of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance doth it alone, and this is for the Honour of the Sacrament; greatly for the Honour of it (ſay I) that it is of greater power then our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his Goſpel, which cannot help a wicked Man to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, whileſt he continues ſo, but this Sacrament it ſeems can. Nor can they excuſe this matter by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54888:24"/>
theſe odious aſſertions are but the private Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of ſome Divines. For they are plainly favoured by the determinations of the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that Council delivers it ſelf warily and cunningly <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Conc.</hi> Trident. <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 14. <hi>Cap</hi> 4.</note> in this point (as it uſes to do in ſuch caſes) yet theſe are their words, <hi>Illa vero contritio imperfecta quae at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritio dicitur, quamvis ſine Sacramento Poenitentiae per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe ad juſtificationem perducere peccatorem nequeat, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men eum ad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dei Gratiam in Sacramento Poenitentiae im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrandam diſponit,</hi> &amp;c. Which is as much as to ſay, though Attrition or a ſuperficial Sorrow for Sin, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, alone, and without Confeſſion to a Prieſt, will not juſtify a Man before God, yet Attrition and Confeſſion together will do it, for then they are as good as true Repentance. And in this ſenſe <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> long ſince thought he underſtood the Council well enough.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This buſineſs of Auricular Confeſſion, as it is practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is ſo far from being a means to prevent and reſtrain ſin, as it highly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be (and I am ſure as it ought to be, if it be good for any thing) that contrariwiſe it is either loſt labour, and a meer Ceremony, or it greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages and imboldens, and hardens Men in it, both by the Secrecy, the Multitudes, and the Frequency of theſe Confeſſions, by the curſory, hypocritical and evaſive ways of confeſſing, by the ſlight Penances im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and the cheapneſs, eaſineſs, and even proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Abſolutions.</p>
            <p>It were eaſy to be copious in inſtances of all theſe kinds, but it is an uncomfortable ſubject, and I haſten to a concluſion; therefore I will only touch upon them briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the privacy of theſe Confeſſions. In the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church (as I have noted before) the Scandalous Sinner was brought upon the Stage before a great
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54888:24"/>
Aſſembly of Grave and Holy Men, he lay proſtrate on the ground, which he watered with his Tears, he crept on his Knees, and implored the Pitty and Prayers of all preſent, in whoſe countenances (if for ſhame he could look up) he ſaw abhorrence of his fact, indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at God's diſhonour, conjoined with compaſſion to his Soul, and joy for his Repentance; his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was full of remorſe and confuſion; the remedy was as ſharp and diſguſtful to Fleſh and Blood as the Diſeaſe had been pleaſant, and the pain of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation was able to imbitter the ſweet of Sin to him ever after. Or if the Confeſſion was not made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole Church, but to the Penitentiary only, yet he was a Grave and Holy Perſon, choſen by the Church, and repreſenting it, a Perſon reſident in that Church, and ſo able to take notice of, and mind the future Converſation of thoſe that addreſſed themſelves to him; a Perſon of that Sanctity and Reverence that he could not chooſe but deteſt and abhor all baſe and vile actions that ſhould come to his knowledge: Now it muſt needs be a terrible cut to a Sinner to have all his lewdneſs laid open before ſuch an one, and then to be juſtly, and ſharply rebuked by him, to have his ſins aggravated, and to be made to ſee his own ugly ſhape in a true glaſs held by him, beſides to be enjoined the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of a ſtrict Penance of Faſting and Prayer, and after all (if this do not do) to have the Church made acquainted with the whole matter (as in the caſe of the Deacon aforeſaid.) This courſe was likely to work ſomething of remorſe in the Sinner for what was paſt, and to make him watchful and careful for the time to come.</p>
            <p>But what is the way of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> like to this? Where a Man may confeſs to any Prieſt, to him that knows him not, and ſo cannot obſerve his future
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54888:25"/>
life and carriage; nay, perhaps that knows not how to value the guilt of ſin, or to judge which be Venial, and which Mortal Sins, or eſpecially what circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances do alter the ſpecies of it, and it may be too, he may be ſuch an one that makes no Conſcience him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the ſins I confeſs to him. Now, when all is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted between me and ſuch a Prieſt in a corner, and that under the inviolable Seal of Confeſſion, what great ſhame can this put me to? What remorſe is it likely to work in me? What ſhall diſcourage me from going on to <hi>ſin again, if no worſe thing happen to me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And then for the multitude of Confeſſions in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that alſo takes off the ſhame, and weakens the efficacy of it, ſo that if it do no harm, it is not likely to do any good; for who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd much in the doing that which he ſees all the World do as well as himſelf; if only notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sinners were brought to Confeſſion (as it was in the Primitive Church) then it might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably and reaſonably provoke a bluſh, and cauſe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe in him to whom ſuch a remedy was preſcribed; but when he ſees the whole Pariſh, and the Prieſt too brought to it, and Men as generally complying with it, as they approach to the Lord's Table; What great wonders can this work? What ſhame can it inflict upon any Man! What effect can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from it, but that it ordinarily makes Men ſecure and careleſs, and grow as familiar with ſin as with the remedy, or at leaſt think as well of themſelves as of other Men, ſince it ſeems they have as much need of Confeſſion and abſolution as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
            <p n="3">3. To which the frequency and often repetitions of theſe kind of Confeſſions adds very much; it is very
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54888:25"/>
likely that modeſty may work much upon a Man the firſt or ſecond time he goes to Confeſſion, and it may ſomething diſcompoſe his Countenance when he lays open all his ſecret miſcarriages, to a Perſon eſpecially for whom he hath a Reverence (for we ſee every thing, even ſin it ſelf is modeſt in its beginnings;) and no doubt it is ſome reſtraint of ſin whilſt a Man is ſenſible that he muſt undergo a great deal of pain and ſhame in vomiting up again his ſweet Morſels which he eats in ſecret: But by that time he hath been uſed to this a while, it grows eaſie and habitual to him, and cuſtom hath made the very pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment pleaſant as well as the ſin; eſpecially, if we add,</p>
            <p n="4">4. The formal, curſory, hypocritical, and illuſive ways of Confeſſion in frequent uſe amongſt them; as that a Man may chooſe his own Prieſt, and then to be ſure the greateſt Sinner will have a Confeſſour right for his turn, that ſhall not be too ſevere and ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous with him; that a Man may confeſs <hi>in tranſitu,</hi> in a hurry or huddle, and then there can be no remark made upon his Perſon nor his ſins; that a Man may make one part of his Confeſſion to one Prieſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the other part for another, ſo that neither of them ſhall be able to make any thing of it; that he may have one Confeſſour for his Mortal ſins, and another for his Venial; ſo that one ſhall ſave him, if the other damn him; nay, for failing, the forgetful ſinner may have another Man to confeſs for him, or at leaſt he may confeſs, that he hath not confeſſed; theſe and abundance more ſuch illuſive Methods are in daily uſe amongſt them, and not only taken up by the licentious and unconſcionable People, but allowed by ſome or other of their great Caſuiſts; now let any Man judge whether this be a likelier way to reſtrain ſin,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54888:26"/>
or to encourage it; whether the eaſineſs of the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (if this be one) muſt not of neceſſity make the Diſeaſe ſeem not very formidable; in a word, whether this be not a ridiculing their own Religion, and, which is worſe, a teaching Men to be ſo fool hardy <hi>as to make a mock of ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. This ſad reckoning will be inflamed yet higher if we conſider the ſlight Penances uſually impoſed by theſe Spiritual Judges upon the greateſt Crimes. The Council determines that the Confeſſour muſt be exactly made acquainted with all the circumſtances of the ſin, that ſo he may be able to adjuſt a Penance to it; now when ſome great ſin is confeſſed and that in very foul circumſtances, if the Penance proportioned to it, by the Prieſt be to ſay two or three <hi>Pater Noſters,</hi> or <hi>Ave-Maria</hi>'s extraordinary, to give a little Money in Alms to the Poor or ſome Pious uſe, to kneel on his bare knees before ſuch a Shrine, to kiſs ſuch an Image, to go on Pilgrimage a few Miles to ſuch a Saint, or at moſt to wear an Hair Shirt, or it may be to faſt with Piſh, and Wine, and Sweetmeats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth not this make that ſin which is thus mawled and ſtigmatized, look very dreadfully, can any Man find in his Heart to ſin again, when it hath coſt him ſo dear alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?</p>
            <p>Oh, but they will tell us theſe Penances are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to correſpond with the guilt of the ſin, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſatisfy the debt of Temporal puniſhment. But we had thought that the end of Penance had been, to work in the Penitent a diſpoſition for Pardon, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him both opportunities and direction to expreſs the ſincerity of his Repentance; and this was the uſe of Penance in the Primitive Church, together with the taking off the Scandal from the Society; and for that other end how doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> know
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54888:26"/>
ſo certainly that there is a debt of Temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remaining due, after the ſin is pardoned before God; it is true, God may pardon ſo far only as he pleaſes, he may reſolve to puniſh temporally thoſe whom he hath forgiven eternally, as we ſee he did in the caſe of <hi>David;</hi> but that this is not his conſtant Method appears by this that our Saviour releaſes the Temporal puniſhment to many in the Goſpel, whoſe diſeaſes he cured, ſaying to them, <hi>Your ſins are forgiven you,</hi> when as yet it did not appear that all Scores were quitted with God ſo, but that they might have periſhed eternally, if they did not prevent it by Faith and Repentance.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But laſtly, to come to an end of this ſad ſtory, the eaſineſs and proſtitution of their abſolutions in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> contributes, as much to the encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Vice and careleſneſs in Religion as any of the former; for what elſe can be the natural effect and conſequence of that ruled caſe among their Caſuiſts (as I ſhew'd before) that the Prieſt is bound to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve him that confeſſes, and ſaith, he is ſorry for his ſin, though he doth in his Heart believe that he is not contrite, but that either the Prieſts Pardon is a very cheat, or elſe that Pardon is due of courſe to the moſt impenitent Sinner, and there is no more to do but <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and be Saved?</hi> or what is the meaning of their common practice to abſolve men upon their Death-beds, whether they be contrite, or attrite, or neither, at leaſt when they can give no Evidence of either? If they intended this only for abſolution from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Church it might be called Charity, and look ſomething like the practice of the Primitive Church, which releaſed thoſe upon their Death-beds, whom it would not diſcharge all their lives before, tho not then neither without ſigns of Attrition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54888:27"/>
too; but theſe pretend to quite another thing; namely to releaſe men <hi>in foro Conſcientiae,</hi> and to give them a Paſs-port to Heaven without Repentance, which is a very ſtrange thing, to ſay no worſe of it. Or to inſtance one thing more, what is the meaning of their practice of giving Abſolution before the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is performed (as is uſual with them) unleſs this be it, that whether the Man make any Conſcience at all how he lives hereafter, yet he is pardoned as much as the Prieſt can do it for him, and is not this a likely way of reformation?</p>
            <p>I conclude therefore now upon the whole matter that Auricular Confeſſion, as it is uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is only an Artifice of greatening the Prieſt, and pleaſing the People; a trick of gratifying the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devout and impious as well as the Devout and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; the latter it impoſes upon by its outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Humility and Piety; to the former it ſerves for a palliative Cure of the Gripes of Conſcience, which they are now and then troubled with; in reality it tends to make ſin eaſie and tolerable by the cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its Pardon, and in a word, it is nothing but the Old Diſcipline of the Church in Duſt and Aſhes. And therefore though the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her Liturgy, piouſly wiſhes for the Reſtauration of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Diſcipline of the Church, it can be no defect in her that ſhe troubles not her ſelf with this Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh.</p>

            <head>A POST-SCRIPT.</head>
            <p>AFter I had finiſhed the foregoing Papers, and moſt part of them had alſo paſt the Preſs, I happened to have notice that there was a Book juſt then come over from <hi>France,</hi> written by a Divine of the <hi>Sorbone,</hi> which with great appearance of Learning maintained the juſt contrary to what I had aſſerted (eſpecially in the Hiſtorical part of this Queſtion) and pretended to prove from the moſt Ancient Monuments of the Holy Scriptures, Fathers, Popes and Councils, that Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Confeſſion had been the conſtant Doctrine, and Univerſal and Uninterrupted uſage of the Chriſtian Church for near 1300 years from the Times of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to the <hi>Laterane</hi> Council.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as I heard this, I heartily wiſhed, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſaid Book had come out a little ſooner, or at leaſt that my Papers had been yet in my hands; to the intent that it might have been in my Power, to have corrected what might be amiſs, or ſupplied what was defective in that ſhort Diſcourſe, or indeed if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion were, to have wholly ſuppreſt it.</p>
            <p>For as ſoon as I entered upon the ſaid Book, and found from no leſs a Man than the Author himſelf, that he had diligently read over all that had been written on both ſides of this controverſy, and that this work of his was the product of Eighteen years ſtudy, and that in the prime of his years, and moſt flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54888:28"/>
time of his parts, that it was publiſhed upon the matureſt deliberation on his part, and with the greateſt applauſe and approbation of the Faculty, I thought I had reaſon to ſuſpect, whether a ſmall Tract, written in haſte by a Man of no Name, and full enough of other Buſineſs, could be fit to be ſeen on the ſame Day with ſo elaborate a work.</p>
            <p>But by that time I had read a little further, I took Heart, and permitted the Preſs to go on; and now, that I have gone over the whole, I do here profeſs ſincerely, that in all that learned Diſcourſe I ſcarcely found any thing which I had not foreſeen, and as I think in ſome meaſure prevented. But certain I am, nothing occurred that ſtaggered my Judgment, or which did not rather confirm me in what I had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; for though I met with abundance of Citations, and a great deal of Wit, and Dexterity in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, yet I found none of them come home to the point; for whereas they ſometimes recommend and preſs Confeſſion of Sin in general ſometimes to the Church, ſometimes to the Prieſt or Biſhop as well as to God Almighty: Again ſometimes they ſpeak great things of the Dignity of the Prieſt-hood, and the great Honour that Order hath in being wonderfully uſeful to the relief of Guilty or Afflicted Conſciences; other while they treat of the Power of the Keys, and the Authority of the Church, the danger of her Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, the Comfort of her Abſolution, and the ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her Diſcipline, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but all theſe things are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by us without laborious proof, as well as by our Adverſaries: That which we demand, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect therefore, is, where ſhall we find in any of the Ancient Fathers, Auricular Confeſſion ſaid to be a Sacrament, or any part of one? Or where is the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal neceſſity of it aſſerted? Or that ſecret ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54888:28"/>
after Baptiſm, are by no other means, or upon no other terms pardoned with God, then upon their being confeſſed to men? In theſe things lies the hinge of our diſpute, and of theſe particulars one ought in Reaſon to expect the moſt direct and plain proof ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, if the matter was of ſuch Conſequence, of ſuch Univerſal practice and notoriety as they pretend; but nothing of all this appears in this Writer more than in thoſe that have gone before him. In contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of which I now adventure this little Tract in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, with ſomewhat more of Confidence then I ſhould have done, had it not been for this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
            <p>But leſt I ſhould ſeem to be too partial in the Caſe, or to give too ſlight an account of this Learned Man's performance, the Reader who pleaſes ſhall be judge by a Specimen or two which I will here briefly repreſent to him.</p>
            <p>The former of them ſhall be the very firſt argument or Teſtimony he produces for his Aſſertion, which I the rather make my choice to give inſtance in, becauſe no Man can be ſaid ingenuouſly to ſeek for faults, to pick and chooſe for matter of exception, that takes the firſt thing that comes to hand.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs is this, Chap. 2. Page 11. of his Book he cites the Council of <hi>Illiberis</hi> (with a great deal of circumſtance) as the firſt Witneſs for his Cauſe, and the Teſtimony is taken from the Seventy Sixth Canon, the words are theſe, <hi>Si quis Diaconum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> If any Man ſhall ſuffer himſelf to be ordained Deacon, and ſhall afterwards be convicted to have formerly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſome Mortal (or Capital Crime;) if the ſaid Crime come to light by his own voluntary Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſhall for the ſpace of Three years be debarred the Holy Communion, but in caſe his ſin be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54888:29"/>
and made known to the Church by ſome other hand, then he ſhall ſuffer Five years ſuſpenſion, and after that be admitted only to Lay Communion.</p>
            <p>Now who would have ever thought this paſſage fit to be made choice of as the firſt proof of Auricular Confeſſion, or who can imagine it ſhould be any proof at all, much leſs a clear or direct one?</p>
            <p>Oh, but here is Confeſſion! It may happen ſo if the party pleaſe, but it is not enjoyned, but voluntary, and that not Auricular neither, but unto the Church, at leaſt for ought appears.</p>
            <p>And it is confeſſion of a ſecret Sin too! True it was ſo, till it was either confeſſed or betrayed.</p>
            <p>And here is Penance impoſed for a ſecret ſin: True when it was become publick.</p>
            <p>And here is a different degree of Penance impoſed upon him that ingenuouſly confeſſes, from him that ſtays till he is accuſed, and hath his ſin proved upon him: And good Reaſon, for the one gave tokens of Repentance, and the other none. But then here is—What? no Sacrament of Penance, no declared abſolute neceſſity of Confeſſion to Men in order to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don with God, but only a neceſſity that when the Fact is become notorious, whether by the Confeſſion of the Party, or otherwiſe, that the Church uſe her endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to bring the Sinner to Repentance, and free her ſelf from Scandal by making a difference betwixt the Good and the Bad, the more hopeful, and the leſs.</p>
            <p>If this be a clear and proper Argument for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Auricular Confeſſion: God help poor <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> that cannot diſcern it; but oh the Wit of Man, and the Power of Learning and Logick! What may not ſuch Men prove if they have a mind to it?</p>
            <p>The other paſſage I inſtance in, is in his Tenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Pag. 156. <hi>viz.</hi> the Critical and Famous Buſineſs
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54888:29"/>
of the <hi>Nectarian</hi> Reformation at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> of which I have ſpoken ſomewhat largely in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Papers. Now for this: This Learned Gentleman after he hath acknowledged very frankly that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Confeſſion of ſins was the Ancient uſe of the Church in the times of St. <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> and <hi>Origen;</hi> that is, for the ſpace of about Three hundred years, and that inſtead of that ancient uſage (upon occaſion of the <hi>Decian</hi> Perſecution) a public Penitentiary was appointed at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and moſt other Orthodox Churches, and in ſhort, after he had with more ingenuity then ſome others of his party, owned the undoubted Truth of the Relations of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> touching this Affair, and made ſome Obſervations thereupon not much to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his cauſe, he at length delivers that which would be very much to his purpoſe, if it could be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; namely, that upon the whole matter <hi>Nectarius</hi> in aboliſhing the Penitentiary, neither aboliſhed pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick nor private Confeſſions, but inſtead of obliging Men to go to the Penitentiary left every Man bound to reſort to his reſpective <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> and confeſs his ſins to him; and ſo Auricular Confeſſion is after this change every whit as neceſſary as it was be<gap reason="illegible" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap>e; very true (ſay I) it is as neceſſary now as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for it was only voluntary before, and ſo it may be after. But if the intention of <hi>Nectarius,</hi> and the effect of that alteration was only the change of the Perſon, and every Man ſtill obliged to confeſs to ſome body, how comes it to be ſaid in the ſtory that every Man was left to his own Conſcience, doth that word ſignify the Biſhop? then we have found out a right Fanatic <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> for they will all readily confeſs to this Biſhop, and believe his Abſolution as ſufficient as any <hi>Romaniſt</hi> of them all doth: And yet it ſeems to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably
