            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>KNowing that it is the duty of every man, and eſpecially of ſu h as live under a Civil Government, (where the general Intereſt always includes the particular) to contribute as much as he can (in his own ſtation) to the publick Good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and alſo of what Importance it is to all men to be informed of thoſe Benefits which by my Art they may enjoy; I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſet down here what I think moſt convenient for every one to underſtand concerning the preſervation, and melioration of his own Teeth; A thing indeed of little eſteem among moſt people, but in truth, of ineſtimable value for its many and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant conſequences. However, in ſo doing, I ſhall acquit my ſelf of my duty towards God and Man: And provided my Indeavors prove but beneficial to others, (as certainly they will, if put in practice) it is all I deſire, caring very little what opinion the Criticks of <hi>Words</hi> and artificial <hi>Logick</hi> may have of me.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:40751:4"/>
ſcope is to prevent the loſs of <hi>Teeth;</hi> the uſe of which is ſo neceſſary in the preparing of food, that the want of ſuch a help (if not ſupplied by ſtrong diſſolvents) hinders a true concoction of the Aliments in the Stomach; whence do proceed Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, and abundance of Crudities very noxious to the body of man; as being the ſeed of most of thoſe innumerable Diſeaſes and Infirmities, whereby life is not only made trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to us, but alſo conſiderably ſhorter than it would otherwiſe be, which is ſo conſonant to truth, that vulgar obſervation it ſelf has turned it into a common Proverb: For they uſe to ſay of one whoſe Teeth are naturally thin, that he is ſhort-lv'd, whereof the reaſon is, that ſuch perſons do not chew their meat well. Moreover, the loſs of Teeth renders the pronounciation both troubleſome to ones ſelf, and unintelligible to others.

               <head>SECTION I. Of the Nature of the TEETH.</head>
               <p>WHat men are wont to call Science, or the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of any being, is by them commonly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two ſeveral parts: one whereof is termed <hi>Theoretical,</hi> and the other <hi>Practical.</hi> The firſt includes the reaſons and cauſes of things, with the order and manner of their progreſs in coming to be what they are. The ſecond regards only their Properties and Effects, and what they are actually in themſelves, without inquiring how they come to be ſo made, or thus qualify'd. As for example of thoſe two branches of Humane Learning, (in reſpect to Phyſical matters) when Philoſophers go about to inſpect the nature of the <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> they ſearch into its <hi>Origine,</hi> tracing out the ſeveral cauſes of its Formation, even to their ſource or ſpring-head; from whence they draw arguments for the ſolution of all the <hi>Phenomena</hi> thereof; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Mariners conſider it only as a certain Stone that draws Iron to it ſelf, having the power of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating its properties to the ſaid Iron; and which, if not hindred (by its own gravity, or any other impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment) will always turn one of its ſides towards the North, and another diametrically oppoſite to the firſt towards the South; which ſufficeth them for the uſe they make on't, in directing their courſes through the Sea, without caring what may be the cauſe of ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40751:5"/>
vertues in the <hi>Magnet.</hi> Either of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent parts of Knowledge being ſeparated from the other, cannot afford a full and ſatisfactory account of a thing: And therefore being about to treat of my Art, I ſhould by conſequence begin with its <hi>Theory,</hi> and diſcourſe of the <hi>Elements, Principles,</hi> and firſt <hi>Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the <hi>Teeth;</hi> which make the Subject thereof, unfolding the reaſons of their conſtitution and frame, and how they come to have ſeveral Roots, and to grow above the Gums; with what ever elſe may be the cauſe of their ſpecifical being; and thence paſs to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. But ſome Conſiderations obliging me to defer treating of the former <hi>Part,</hi> or <hi>Theorick,</hi> till a better opportunity, I deſign only to lay down in this Paper ſome of the moſt principal <hi>Points</hi> relating to the other; namely, the Practical part of my <hi>Profeſſion.</hi> In doing which, although it would be enough for us to ſpeak of things, as in the ſtate wherein we find them: yet for the ſatisfaction of the Reader, and out of a real deſire to ſerve him; we ſhall not deſtitute our Diſcourſe of ſuch Reaſons as are neceſſary for the well underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what we ſhall ſay. So that although this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate will be imperfect, as wanting many things, yet what it ſhall contain, will be as uſeful and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous as if it were accompanied with all the reſt. However, according to the method we have preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed our ſelves here, we are to proceed next to the conſideration of the Structure, and conſtitution or nature of the Tooth.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Analyſing</hi> the Tooth, its ſubſtance is not found to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40751:5"/>
be uniform every where, but manifeſtly diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able into two different ſorts of make: one of them being harder, whiter, and of a finer texture; and the other ſofter, more obſcure, and of a courſer compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. The firſt makes up the head of the Tooth, or that part of it that ſtands out naked above the Gums<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the other its ſtump, or that part on't which is hidden within the ſaid Gums. The expoſed part of the Tooth conſiſts alſo of two different Parts: To wit, its ſtony Cover or Caſe, and its inward ſubſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the firſt is as it were an hard <hi>Perioſteum,</hi> that inveſts the head of the Tooth on all ſides, lying on it much after the ſame manner that Enamel does upon Gold, or any other thing. This natural Enamel which I call the gloſs of the Tooth, is of a far harder, whiter, more denſe and lucid nature than the inward ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance lying under it: which for its ſeveral uſes may properly be compared to the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> or Scarf-skin, for like unto this it is bloodleſs, and altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of ſenſe, ſerving to cover and defend the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of the Veſſels, contained within the inward ſubſtance, from external injuries, and to render the Tooth more beautiful and ſtrong. It has pores for the perſpiration of the excrements of the Tooth, which pores are not always of the ſame figure, nor magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but vary almoſt in every body. The ſaid gloſs or ſtony ſubſtance is likewiſe very various in point of thickneſs: from which differences, do ariſe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of its colour in ſeveral men.</p>
               <p>The inward part of the head of the Tooth, though
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40751:6"/>
inferior to its cover or gloſs in brightneſs and ſolidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet its ſubſtance is nevertheleſs much more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, and clearer than that of the ſtump: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains two ſeveral ſorts of pores, or ſmall channels, both of a conical figure, having their <hi>Baſes</hi> in the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave ſuperficies</hi> of the Tooth, and their <hi>Apexes</hi> in the <hi>convex ſuperficies</hi> of the inward ſubſtance, immediately under its glaſſy integument. Through ſome of which channels the blood is carried by many and very ſmall <hi>Arterial</hi> Sprigs, from the middle of the Tooth to its extremity: and through the others the ſame blood is ſent back again from the ſaid extremity towards its middle, by ſome <hi>capillary</hi> veins, as ſhall be ſaid here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>As to the root or ſtump of the Tooth, it is the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, moſt ſoft, and porous portion of its whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and yet is cloſer and harder than any other bone of the body, having alſo two ſorts of channels, but of different ſituation from one another: for ſome of them have their Baſes (like thoſe above deſcribed) towards the cavity of the Tooth, and contain the branches of the Artery, that carry the blood quite through the ſubſtance of the Tooth, to the Gums, as ſhall be explained in its place; but the others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to any of thoſe already mentioned, have their Baſes towards the external ſuperficies of the Tooth; the uſe of which laſt conduits, is to tranſmit to the Gums the blood that is returned to the heart from the <hi>membrane</hi> that inveſts the cavity of the Tooth. This rooty part of the Tooth conſiſts in the ſmall Teeth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40751:6"/>
of a ſingle body, and in the big ones is divided into two, three, or four branches, called roots or fangs: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the middle of each of theſe fangs, there is a little channel that goes up to the head of the Tooth, where they are united together, and make but a ſingle ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, whereinto are carried the veſſels of the Tooth, paſſing firſt through the hollowneſs of the ſtumps. Every Tooth has its particular cell or ſocket within the <hi>Mandible,</hi> diſtinct from all the reſt (by a thin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the jaw-bone paſſing between the Teeth, from one ſide of the ſaid bone to the other) wherein moſt of its ſtump is comprehended, the reſt being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed about with the Gums.</p>

For the better underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, we ſhall take notice, that as our body is ſo made by nature, that it waſts continually by the disſipation of ſome Particles, ſeparating themſelves from its Maſs, without intermisſion; (tranſpiring for the moſt part through the pores of the skin) and that if theſe particles (which being divided from the whole, become <hi>Excrementitious)</hi> are kept too long within the body, (by reaſon of the <hi>Opilation</hi> of the ſaid pores) it cauſes Fevors, and great diſorders in our blood, and vital as well as animal Functions: So likewiſe from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40751:7"/>
the ſubſtance of the Teeth are emitted certain <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums</hi> through their pores, the tranſpiration of which being hindred, (by the obſtruction of thoſe inviſible paſſages) the Teeth become liable to all thoſe infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties hereafter to be mentioned.</p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of the Tooth being rigid and inflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible, it cannot be <hi>Opilated</hi> by contraction, or aſtriction: as the skin uſually is but only by the intruſion of ſome extraneous matter into its pores, or the incruſtation of ſome ſlimy ſtuff upon its ſuperficies; which is done when we eat any thing of a glutinous nature, for then ſome of its moſt viſcous parts do ſtick, and cleave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Teeth;</hi> and by the mixture of ſome tartarious particles coming from the Lungs, the heat of the mouth, and a certain petrifick juice diſtilling into the mouth, out of the <hi>Salival Ducts,</hi> is turned into a ſtone-like ſubſtance, commonly called the ſcales or ſcurf of the <hi>Teeth:</hi> theſe ſcales grow thicker and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er continually, and if let alone, will cover the <hi>Teeth</hi> all over, except juſt at the top were they grind one againſt another.</p>
               <p>Having thus taken notice of the production of thoſe ſcales, let us now conſider of what ill conſequences they may be to the <hi>Teeth.</hi> The firſt whereof is the <hi>Opilation</hi> of their pores, from whence proceed all the reſt: for by that the exit of thoſe <hi>Excrementitious</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles before mentitioned being hindred, it cauſes them to ſtagnate within the body of the <hi>Tooth,</hi> and there corrupting, do corrode it by degrees; beginning firſt by the alteration of its colour from white to yellow,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40751:7"/>
and from yellow to black; and then follows the real decay of its ſubſtance, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſaid humor is not only deſtructive to the <hi>Teeth,</hi> but extends alſo its malignity to the Gums; ſome of its particles being ſubtil enough (after a due <hi>fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)</hi> to paſs through the ſcales, and thence ſliding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Gums and the <hi>Teeth,</hi> they eat clear away the ligaments that tye them together, dividing them one from another to the very jaw-bone: which is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved by the <hi>excoriation</hi> and rawneſs of the Gums, and their being ſo tender and looſe from the <hi>Teeth</hi> where ever ſuch ſcales are found; and eſpecially if they be grown to a conſiderable thickneſs.</p>
               <p>It happens ſometimes that the uſual paſſages of this corrupted humor being ſtopt by the ſcales, (when they are hard, and cloſe enough) is thereby repercuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and made to take its courſe towards the middle of the <hi>Tooth,</hi> diſcharging it ſelf therein between the <hi>Concave ſuperſicies</hi> of the <hi>Tooth,</hi> and the <hi>Tunicle</hi> inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame; where it occaſions very great pains, and at laſt by its fretting, and corroſive quality, gnaws and conſumes quite away the ſaid <hi>membrane,</hi> as alſo the veſſels of the <hi>Tooth;</hi> and then paſſing out of the ſaid <hi>Tooth,</hi> it diffuſes it ſelf through the <hi>Alveolus</hi> or ſocket, where exerting its dangerous faculty, it deſtroys utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whatever cauſes any <hi>connexion</hi> between the <hi>Teeth,</hi> the jaw-bone and the Gums, as the <hi>Perioſteum,</hi> &amp;c. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the <hi>Teeth</hi> do conſequently fall out for the moſt part ſound, and unaltered, except only in their colour, (which becomes yellowiſh) by reaſon that the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40751:8"/>
aforeſaid <hi>Excrementitious</hi> Humour being at firſt diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted another way, did not ſtay long enough under the ſcales to occaſion in them a greater detriment: All which incommodities to obviate, keep only your Teeth clean from ſcurf, or any foulneſs; and if they be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready clean, you need but to preſerve them as they are; but if not, get them to be made ſo by ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt in that Function; for otherwiſe if you employ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body that is unskilful in it, you may chance to find the Remedy worſe than the Diſeaſe; by reaſon that not knowing the dangers attending ſuch an Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he may commit a great many and pernicious Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, as the breaking of the <hi>Film</hi> that unites the Gums to the Teeth, the taking away of the gloſs of the Teeth, &amp;c. Soon after which, the Tooth will loſe its natural luſtre, and become yellowiſh, ſubject to ake, and at laſt wholly periſh away, the Gums being looſe and broken, will likewiſe decay, and fall away from the Teeth, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Your Teeth being once clean, you may preſerve them with this compoſition; Take <hi>Magiſtery of Pearls, Powder of Coral,</hi> and <hi>Dragons-Blood,</hi> of each equal quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and as much <hi>Red-Roſe-water</hi> as will incorporate them together; and make the Compound of a mean conſiſtence, between hard and ſoft. I have to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a very excellent <hi>Dentifrice,</hi> which being uſed only once a week will keep the <hi>Teeth</hi> clean and white; and by the conſtant uſing of it, fetch up their colour, if loſt; (tho in a conſiderable meaſure) this is the ſame that in my <hi>Bills</hi> (to keep my Maſters term, tho improper,

               </head>
               <p>HAving in the former Section conſidered the <hi>Teeth,</hi> as at the beginning of their decay, in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as tho they ſuffer ſome light change in their accidents, yet their ſubſtance, form and proportion remaining ſtill the ſame, is only called alteration; that is, in a ſtate wherein indeed they are invironed, and aſſaulted by their greateſt enemies, but yet in a capacity of being reſcued and preſerved from their harms. But now we ſhall conſider them as overcome by all thoſe threatning evils, and really corrupted; in which caſe, all that can be done, is to prevent their total ruine.</p>
               <p>And as there are ſome not ſo far gone, but that they may ſtill do good ſervice, if timely helped, we are to uſe our utmoſt indeavours to do it; which to effect, we ſhall in the firſt place clear their outſide from all foulneſs, and then with a proper Inſtrument ſcrape off whatever is rotten within, waſhing them very well afterwards with ſome convenient liquid, to ſcour and ſmooth away what the Inſtrument may leave behind: and then if the Tooth be ſo hollow that it may be ſtopt, it muſt be fill'd up with ſuch ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients as are neither corroſive, nor ill taſted, and of a conſiſtence firm enough to be uſed in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40751:9"/>
as the <hi>Teeth</hi> are, and to keep from waſting for a conſiderable time; but if the <hi>Tooth</hi> rots every way equally, ſo that there is no cavity left, wherein any thing can keep faſt, it muſt only be kept clean, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care after every meal to pick out any meat that may get into it, and then waſh it very well with fair water; for if you neglect ſo to do, the corruption of the rotten <hi>Tooth</hi> will fall upon the others, and ſo infect all the reſt.</p>
               <p>With theſe precautions, I would adviſe every one to keep his <hi>Teeth</hi> as long as he can, although they were rotten to the very Gums, provided only they do not ake, by reaſon that their ſtumps filling up their ſock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, ſerve (like ſo many wedges) to keep the others ſtreight and firm in their places; but if they are very bad, and withal ſubject to ake, it is better to have them out, leſt they ſhould occaſion an ill habit in the Gums, that might be hurtful to the ſound ones.</p>
               <p>The Drawing out of <hi>Teeth</hi> is practiſed by a great many, but perhaps underſtood but of very few; and I am ſure that there is a great deal more danger in the Drawing of a <hi>Tooth,</hi> (eſpecially out of the lower Jaw, than moſt people are commonly aware of. It is an Operation that requires to be performed with great care and circumſpection, and not ſo raſhly as it is commonly done.</p>
               <p>But as the greateſt difficulty of this Buſineſs lies in underſtanding the make, and application of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments that are imploy'd about the Drawing of <hi>Teeth;</hi> I ſhall (for the benefit of <hi>Practitioners,</hi> as well

                  <p>THe Conſtruction, and uſual ſhape of the <hi>Polican,</hi> is a thing ſo well known by every body, that it wou'd be needleſs to inſiſt at all upon it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without loſing time in ſuch ſuperfluous Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we ſhall here take notice of ſome other things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the ſaid Inſtrument, more material and uſeful: as the due proportion that its parts ought to have, conſidered in themſelves, and in reſpect of each other.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place then, (ſuppoſing that you know the ſtuff wherewithal it muſt be made, which ought to be a tough ſteel, or ſteel and iron together) let the tree of the <hi>Polican</hi> be about four inches long, and ſo perforated, that the diſtance betwixt the centre of the hole (wherein goes the pin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon which are faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the two branches) and one of the extremities, be a line greater than the other. Let one of the two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be two lines longer than the other; let alſo each claw be three lines long. And finally, let the diſtance between the bolſter, or ſemicircle of the longeſt ſide of the tree, be two lines. And you will have four di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances between the claws and the bolſters, which is ſufficient to draw all ſorts of <hi>Teeth.</hi> For with the firſt, which is of two lines, you may draw the <hi>Inciſores<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:40751:10"/>
With the ſecond, of three lines, you may draw the <hi>Ganini.</hi> With the third, of four lines, the <hi>Double</hi> and <hi>Treble Teeth.</hi> And with the fourth, of five lines, the <hi>Quadruple</hi> ones.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>Polican</hi> being thus made, if you have a mind to uſe it, you muſt ſo apply the Claw to the inſide of the <hi>Tooth</hi> you intend to pull out, that its branch may ſtand exactly upon the middle of the ſaid <hi>Tooth,</hi> gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaning your Bolſter upon the next to it, the better to take your meaſures; and then draw the <hi>Tooth</hi> out. But take heed you do not draw <hi>obliquely,</hi> but in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect line from the <hi>Tooth</hi> outwardly; for in drawing laterally, you might chance ſo to force the <hi>Tooth</hi> to be drawn, upon the next to it, that you wou'd draw them both together, or at leaſt looſen very much the ſound one, and put a far greater force upon the other in drawing it, than is neceſſary. Which wou'd occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion an infinitely greater pain to the <hi>Patient,</hi> than if you had done it rightly.</p>
                  <p>Thus much have I thought fit to tell you concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature and uſe of the <hi>Polican;</hi> which if you obſerve punctually, you need never fear the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well of any <hi>Tooth.</hi> As for the reſt of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments now in uſe, with ſeveral others of my own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, I ſhall give you the particular Deſcription, and uſe of every one of them in the next Impreſſion of this Diſcourſe; if you think this worthy of your acceptance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <head>SECT. IV. Of the Reſtauration of the Teeth.</head>
               <p>WHen our decay'd <hi>Teeth</hi> are ſo far gone before we think of any Remedy for their preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that whatever we can do, proves but fruitleſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that notwithſtanding all our beſt indeavours, they periſh, and rot quite away; or that ſome into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable pain has made us to draw them; we are not yet to deſpair, and eſteem our ſelves <hi>toothleſs</hi> for all the reſt of our life: the loſs indeed is great, but not irreparable; there is ſtill ſome help for it, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral want may be ſupplied artificially, and herein Art imitates Nature ſo <hi>naifly,</hi> that when the <hi>ſuccedaneous</hi> Teeth (if I may ſo ſpeak) are well ſet in, they cannot be diſtinguiſhed from the natural ones, (neither in colour, firmneſs, nor proportion) but by them that know of it. Being thus exactly fitted to their place, they will keep the next to them, and by conſequence all the reſt of that Jaw abundantly firmer and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than they would otherwiſe be.</p>
               <p>The Advantages that may be attributed to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial <hi>Teeth,</hi> are many; as that they keep the others faſt, as we ſaid juſt now, that they are of a great orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and help pronounciation extremely, &amp;c. But all that is with a <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that they be well made, and according to the beſt Art; for otherwiſe they might prove quite contrary.</p>
               <p>Beſides this Artificial way of repairing the loſs of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40751:11"/>
                  <hi>Teeth,</hi> there is another that may be called Natural; which is done by taking out the rotten <hi>Teeth</hi> or ſtumps, and putting in their places ſome ſound ones, drawn immediately after out of ſome poor body's head: which thing (tho difficult) I know to be feaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough, not only by my own reaſon that tells me ſo, but by experience it ſelf, as (to ſay no more at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) may be inſtanced in the caſe of a certain Lady, who thinking to have <hi>two Teeth</hi> growing one on the top of another, came one day to my Maſter to have one of them Drawn: my Maſter told her that they were not two diſtinct <hi>Teeth,</hi> but only a double one; but the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being not ſatisfied with this, deſired him to take out the <hi>Tooth</hi> ſhe had told him of, let it be what it would. The <hi>Tooth</hi> being drawn out, and proving as my Maſter had ſaid, it was quickly ſet again into the Jaw; and with the uſe of ſome convenient and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Remedies, became in few weeks to be as firm again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as any of the reſt.</p>
               <p>And yet although the event of this particular had not proved ſo proſperous as it did; its ill ſucceſs would not deſtroy in me the poſſibility of ſuch a tranſplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or <hi>Inoculation</hi> of <hi>Teeth:</hi> (if I may be permitted to uſe ſuch terms) that was not the only motive I had to believe it; and I have not inſerted the Story of it here as an Argument to prove invincibly what I ſay, but only as a proper Example to render probable to others what I know to be true. However, I do not like that method of drawing <hi>Teeth</hi> out of ſome folks heads, to put them into others, both for its being too
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40751:11"/>
inhumane, and attended with too many difficulties; and then neither could this be called the reſtaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Teeth,</hi> ſince the reparation of one, is the ruine of another; it is only robbing of <hi>Peter</hi> to pay <hi>Paul.</hi> But if inſtead of humane <hi>Teeth,</hi> there is uſe made of thoſe of ſome <hi>Brutes,</hi> as <hi>Dogs, Sheep,</hi> &amp;c. In ſuch caſe I do not only approve of it as lawful and facile, but do alſo eſteem it as very profitable and advantageous; only care is to be had, that the thing be undertaken, and carried on by one that at leaſt knows ſomething of <hi>Anatomy,</hi> and has a right ſenſe of the thing to be done, being furniſhed with whatever is neceſſary in an Operation of that nature.</p>
               <p>And that (if my Opinion may be any wiſe ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in ſuch an Attempt) I may contribute ſomething towards the improvement of ſo uſeful an Invention; I think one is, to proceed in it ſomewhat after this manner. Firſt, I would chuſe an Animal whoſe <hi>Teeth</hi> ſhould come neareſt to thoſe of the <hi>Patient;</hi> as a <hi>Dog,</hi> a <hi>Sheep,</hi> a <hi>Goat,</hi> or a <hi>Baboon,</hi> &amp;c. and having tied his legs together, I would faſten his head in ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place, ſo that he might not ſtir in the leaſt, and by ſome proper means keep his mouth open as long as I ſhould have occaſion: that done, I would open the Gums round about the <hi>Tooth</hi> to be taken out of his head, not only to the very Jaw-bone, but as far between the ſaid Bone and the Tooth, as the fineſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument could go, leaving a very little portion of the Gums about it; and then having uſed the ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, in dividing the Patients Tooth from the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40751:12"/>
Gums, and the Jaw-bone, I would draw it forth, and put immediately in its place that of of the Brute; faſtning it very well and ſtreight between the other Teeth: and then with the uſe of ſuitable Remedies, I do not queſtion in the leaſt but that it would unite to the Gums and Jaw-bone, and in a little time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as faſt as any of the others: which performance might properly be termed the natural Reſtauration, or <hi>Renovation</hi> of Humane Teeth.</p>

               <head>SECT. V. Of the <hi>Tooth-ake,</hi> Looſeneſs of the <hi>Teeth,</hi> and decay of the <hi>Gums;</hi> with their Remedies.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Tooth-Ake</hi> is occaſioned many and very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ways, but that I may render what I have to ſay upon it, as perſpicuous and intelligible as I can; I think it very convenient we ſhould take a ſpecial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the veſſels that come into the Tooth, and of their reſpective Functions. The firſt and chiefeſt whereof is an Artery, whoſe Office is to bring dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly from the heart that hot and ſpirituous blood, out of which (although it is not the general Opinion) the Tooth is at firſt made, (as well as the reſt of the whole body) and ever after preſerved and repaired by the ſupply of nouriſhment, and vital principles it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords continually: To this effect the whole Artery divides it ſelf into an infinity of ſmall branches, which being diſſeminated throughout the whole ſubſtance of the Tooth, diſtribute to each part as much of their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40751:12"/>
blood as is neceſſary to make up the inceſſant loſs they are ſubject to; and the reſt is returned through innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable hair-like veins into the great ones, and thence to the heart again, but in two different manners: for the ſuperfluous part of that portion of the blood, that is carried by the <hi>Capillary</hi> Arteries to that part of the Tooth ſtanding above the Gums, is ſent back again through ſome <hi>Capillary</hi> veins towards the middle of the Tooth; where uniting together, they make but a ſingle channel; and this is it we commonly call the vein of the Tooth, which we ſhall here take for its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond veſſel. But the remainder of the blood, that goes to the relief of that part of the Tooth that is within the Gums, paſſing quite through the ſubſtance of the Tooth, is carried by the <hi>Capillary</hi> veins to the veins of the Gums, Checks, and Lips; and hence it is that whatever pain is at any time occaſioned in any of thoſe parts, (either by bruiſe, exceſſive heat, or cold, &amp;c.) comes to be ſoon after communicated to the Teeth.</p>
               <p>The Third and Laſt Veſſel of the Teeth is a Nerve, one of the extremities whereof is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded through the <hi>Membrane</hi> that inveſts the cavity of the Tooth, and that, that contains its Veſſels; and the other is rooted in the Brain, from whence it takes its <hi>Origine,</hi> and where the Animal <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> being elaborated, are thence ſent by the Nerves to all the parts of the body, to adminiſter ſenſe, and the cauſe of motion to them, &amp;c. although in ſome, (as the Teeth) the faculty of motion is not exerciſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:40751:13"/>
From this conſideration of the Veſſels of the Tooth, we may gather the following reaſons of its Dolour; As firſt, that if either through the too great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or ebulition of the blood, the Artery is ſo dilated and ſwoln, that it fills up the hole at the end of the ſtumps where it enters the <hi>Tooth,</hi> and conſequently ſo compreſſes the vein going out the ſame way, that the circulation of the <hi>Blood</hi> is thereby hindred; the continual flowing in of the <hi>blood</hi> will extremely puff up, and diſtend the <hi>membrane</hi> that contains the veſſels, and conſequently cauſe a great pain in the <hi>Tooth,</hi> which will laſt till either the <hi>preternatural</hi> ſtate of the <hi>Blood</hi> be changed, or that the <hi>Arteriols</hi> which we have ſaid to paſs quite through the rooty part of the <hi>Tooth</hi> be ſo ſtretched and widened, that by them the <hi>Blood</hi> may be diſcharged into the Gums, Cheeks and Lips; where it will then cauſe a ſwelling, greater or leſſer, according to the quantity of the ſuperfluous <hi>Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if at the beginning of this diſorder, when the Vein is firſt impeded in its <hi>Function,</hi> the motion of the <hi>Blood</hi> is ſo rapid, and its influx into the Tooth ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous, that before it can make its way through the ſmall <hi>Arterial</hi> Twigs into the Gums, it does extremely extend the coats of the <hi>Artery,</hi> the <hi>Interſtices</hi> between their <hi>Fibres</hi> will thereby become wide enough to give paſſage to ſome of the thinneſt parts of the <hi>Blood;</hi> which gathering at the end of the root, between the outſide of the <hi>Artery,</hi> and the common Coat inveſting all the Veſſels, will there putrifie, and cauſe a great and very laſting pain in the Tooth; during which,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40751:13"/>
if the Tooth be drawn, the ſaid gathering will appear at the end of its ſtump like a little Bladder.</p>
               <p>You ſhall know this ſort of <hi>Tooth-Ake</hi> by the high beating of your Pulſe, the fulneſs of the Veins, and an often beating in the affected Tooth; with a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, tho not very extreme pain. And then for the Cure of it, you muſt firſt bleed the Gums, and ſometimes open a Vein in the Arm alſo, and waſh your mouth with <hi>Roſe-water</hi> and <hi>Vinegar,</hi> of each equal quantities mixt together; putting a little Cotton dipt in <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Box</hi> into the Tooth, if it be hollow.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, if that portion of the <hi>Blood,</hi> which is diffuſed through the ſubſtance of the Brain for the production of the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> is ſo depraved, that all the ſifting it receives, through the hidden <hi>meanders,</hi> and receſſes of the Brain cannot clear it from its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities; and that notwithſtanding all the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of Nature it is depoſited into the <hi>ventricles</hi> of the Brain, (tho under another form yet) ſtill impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with its ill qualities: ſuch ſort of <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> being compounded of <hi>Heterogeneous</hi> parts, if not time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcharged of their malignant and offenſive <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles,</hi> (through the uſual <hi>Emunctories)</hi> will either by their fermentation in the <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the Brain, cauſe an Head-ake; or by the <hi>oppilation</hi> of its pores, cauſe a giddineſs; or elſe paſſing out of the Brain into the Nerves, will by their irregular motion, and preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural extention of the coats of the Nerves, and other Tunicles, breed a diſturbance in all the parts they go to; but more particularly in the Teeth, in which they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40751:14"/>
always excite very great pains. For diſcharging the peccant humour, between the <hi>membrane</hi> that inveſts the inſide of the Tooth, and that that incloſes its veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, it occaſions a perpetual torment in them, till it be expelled from thence by <hi>tranſpiration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſecond kind of Tooth-ake will be known by a diſturbance in the head, which precedes it moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly; a ſoreneſs in the joynts, and a certain drouſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and lingring pain all over the body, as if one were inclined to an Ague, with a ſharp and very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive pain in the diſtempered Tooth, which comes by fits, ſoon ceaſing, and often beginning a-new. As for its Cure, it may be effected by <hi>Sternutation,</hi> the <hi>friction</hi> of the <hi>nape</hi> of the Neck with warm clothes, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of <hi>aperitive</hi> Remedies, to open the <hi>pores</hi> of the Tooth: and if it be hollow, you ſhall put in't a drop of <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Camphire,</hi> whereinto has been infuſed ſome <hi>Henbane-root.</hi> Theſe are the two general cauſes of the Tooth-ake; all the reſt proceeding from them, ſome few excepted.</p>
               <p>There is what I had a mind to ſay at this preſent concerning the Tooth-ake. But you muſt note fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that as it is not enough for one that intends to travel a <hi>Countrey</hi> over, to underſtand the <hi>Map</hi> of that <hi>Countrey;</hi> but he muſt alſo inquire often of the people he meets with as he goes on his journey, for the way to ſuch and ſuch a place: ſo although I have given you a true account of the Tooth-ake, and have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered here the right method for the curing of it, yet that Diſeaſe is for the moſt part accompanied with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40751:14"/>
ſeveral circumſtances, that can't be learnt but from <hi>experience</hi> it ſelf. Thus ſometimes the Gums will be <hi>livid,</hi> ſometimes <hi>pale,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>red,</hi> and inflamed. Sometimes the Tooth is looſe, and riſen above the others. And ſometimes its <hi>root</hi> is diſcovered, and bare of fleſh. Sometimes its <hi>rotten,</hi> and otherwhile <hi>ſound,</hi> as to its <hi>ſubſtance.</hi> In fine, ſometimes the pain is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a great <hi>fluxion</hi> of <hi>Rhume,</hi> and ſometimes with a dryneſs of the <hi>mouth,</hi> &amp;c. Each of which <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants</hi> requires a particular conſideration, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Remedies: conſidering always theſe things, with reference to the age, conſtitution and habit of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, it is but rarely, that a <hi>Tooth-ake</hi> is found <hi>ſimple,</hi> or <hi>uncompound:</hi> (as we have ſuppoſed to be, thoſe of which we have treated above) that is, occaſioned by one cauſe only: but it proceeds moſt commonly from ſeveral; and eſpecially if the pain be inveterate, or of a long ſtanding. And then, the <hi>ſymptoms</hi> of this <hi>complicated</hi> Diſeaſe, are mixt in the ſame proportion as their <hi>cauſes;</hi> which renders the Cure much more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, and ſubject to more obſervations. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if any one has a mind to render himſelf perfect in theſe things, he muſt not only follow our method, that directs him to the true <hi>knowledge</hi> of them, but the <hi>dictates</hi> of his own ſenſes alſo; by which he will avoid all the <hi>obſtacles</hi> he may meet with by the way. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all which, people being commonly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to undergo all the trouble attending a <hi>metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Cure,</hi> and withal apt to think, that one does them
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40751:15"/>
no good at all, unleſs he gives them eaſe preſently; I have been forced to abandon the <hi>Art</hi> in my practice, and to invent certain general Remedies; which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs applying with <hi>circumſpection,</hi> and as I think oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion requires, hardly ever fail of producing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended effect: ſometimes in an inſtant, but moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly within leſs than half an hour. True it is, that were it not for my former practice, and long habit in thoſe things, I neither cou'd have, nor expect ſo good a ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>And yet I will not deny, but that the ſaid remedies happen ſometimes to <hi>operate</hi> a great deal ſlower than ordinary. But that comes to paſs by reaſon of ſome unexpected, or unobſerv'd <hi>accidents:</hi> and I think it ought to ſuffice, that the Cure be at laſt performed. Yet this does not ſatisfy every body. If the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy does not immediately Cure ſuch as are <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient</hi> or incapable of reaſoning, they ſtrait condemn it as a thing ineffectual, and altogether void of any <hi>Virtue.</hi> Upon which, believing the Stories of ſome impertinent (tho perhaps well affectioned) friend, they make uſe of ſuch things, as commonly hinder the effect of the Remedy. And if it happens ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that notwithſtanding thoſe impediments, our remedy produces its effect; they never fail of attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting the Cure to their own indeavours.</p>
               <p>However, I muſt ingenuouſly confeſs, that my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies do not take effect always. And that there are ſome ſorts of <hi>Tooth-ake</hi> almoſt incurable, unleſs it be <hi>pulliatively;</hi> and that it ſelf, not without a great
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40751:15"/>
deal of trouble, and a tedious while. The reaſons of which, I ſhall take occaſion to explain ſome other time.</p>
               <p>The looſeneſs of the Teeth, comes moſt commonly from the decay of the Gums, which are ſubject to many infi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mities, proceeding for the moſt part from thoſe things that occaſion the <hi>Tooth-ake,</hi> and putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Teeth; for ſometimes there will be ſuch an affluence of <hi>blood</hi> from the <hi>Teeth</hi> into the Gums, that their veins being not able to contain it, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon broken; ſhedding the <hi>blood</hi> between the Gums and the <hi>Teeth:</hi> where gathering together, it corrupts, rotting away all the fleſh from about the <hi>Teeth:</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles the <hi>excrementitious</hi> humour, that <hi>exſudates</hi> out of the <hi>Teeth,</hi> falling upon the Gums, eats them away by degrees, &amp;c. But above all other things, the ſcales, and foulneſs of the <hi>Teeth</hi> are very prejudicial to them. All which infirmities to avoid, you need but to keep your Teeth and Gums neat and clean from any foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whatſoever; as has been already ſaid in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Sections: preventing any preternatural colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Blood,</hi> or any other humours within the Gums. But if the miſchief is already done, that is, if your <hi>Teeth</hi> be really looſe, and your <hi>Gums</hi> waſted, you muſt have recourſe for their recovery to one well verſed in thoſe things. For to preſcribe you here any form of Remedies, would be to no purpoſe, ſince the ſame thing cannot be equally good in all caſes, and that without the perfect knowledge of the cauſe of the Diſeaſe, and a right method in applying ſuitable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, (which commonly is underſtood only by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40751:16"/>
Practitioners in thoſe concerns) it is imposſible ever to perform the Cure of any Diſtemper.</p>
               <p>Yet, that you may not think me remiſs in any thing belonging to my Profesſion, that may concern your welfare; and by reaſon that you may chance to find your ſelves in a place where there will be no <hi>Artiſt</hi> to help you; I will here communicate to you a general Remedy againſt the decay of the Gums, and looſeneſs of the <hi>Teeth;</hi> which I am ſure, if you uſe carefully, will often anſwer your expectations: At leaſt it will be ſuch, that it ſhall always do you ſome good, and never any harm. But I muſt tell you before-hand, that if your body be <hi>Scorbutick,</hi> and full of ill humours, you muſt firſt be <hi>Blooded,</hi> and <hi>Purg'd,</hi> according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of a good <hi>Phyſitian:</hi> and then you may uſe the ſaid Remedy as followeth.</p>
               <p>Take of <hi>Maſtick, Myrrh, Pine-Apple, Dragons-blood,</hi> in drops, all reduced into Powder, of each equal quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, red <hi>Coral</hi> prepared, flowers of <hi>Pomgranats,</hi> of each double the quantity of the other <hi>Ingredients;</hi> and ſteep them all in a proportionable quantity of <hi>Spring-water</hi> upon warm <hi>Embers,</hi> for the ſpace of a natural day; and then <hi>filtrate</hi> the <hi>Infuſion</hi> through a woollen-cloth, and keep it cloſe in ſome convenient veſſel. And when you have a mind to uſe it, you ſhall take two or three ſpoonfuls on't a day, keeping it in your mouth a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour every time: which you muſt continue to do while neceſſity ſhall require it.</p>
               <p>I might have told you at the beginning of this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, where I ſpoke of the veſſels of the Teeth, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40751:16"/>

               <head>SECT. VI. Of Childrens Teeth.</head>
               <p>HAving hitherto ſpoken of the <hi>Teeth</hi> in reference to adult perſons, and ſuch as are paſt childhood: we ſhall explain in this Section, as ſuccinctly, and withal as clearly as we can, what is neceſſary to be known touching their growth, and change in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; a thing of no ſmall conſequence, ſince the life of Infants is therein ſo often concern'd.</p>
               <p>The Child being born, remains <hi>Toothleſs,</hi> till he is about five or ſix Months old: at which time his two foremoſt Teeth in each Jaw begin to appear, without keeping any conſtant order of Precedence: ſometimes thoſe above coming out firſt, and ſometimes thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. After them follow all the reſt ſuccesſively in both <hi>Mandibles:</hi> ſo next to theſe come the four other <hi>Inciſores,</hi> the four <hi>Canin</hi> or <hi>Dog-Teeth,</hi> and the firſt eight <hi>Molares,</hi> (which are properly the double <hi>Teeth)</hi> and then come the four biggeſt <hi>Teeth</hi> of all, which may be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40751:17"/>
called <hi>Quadruple Teeth,</hi> as being about three times big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the ſmall ones: and after that the eight laſt <hi>Teeth</hi> do follow; which in reſpect to the <hi>Inciſores</hi> may be termed treble <hi>Teeth.</hi> But theſe treble ones uſually vary very much in time of growth, for it is but rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they all come forth in the ſame year, the four laſt of them ſeldom coming out before the one or two and twentieth year of our age; for which reaſon ſuch <hi>Teeth</hi> are called by ſome, <hi>Teeth</hi> of <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> becauſe that by that time, we ſhould have a full uſe of our rational <hi>Faculty,</hi> though God knows how often it proves to be true.</p>
               <p>The eight <hi>Inciſores,</hi> and the four <hi>Dog-Teeth</hi> come the firſt year; the eight double <hi>Teeth</hi> the ſecond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> year; and the four <hi>Quadruples,</hi> with the four firſt <hi>Treble</hi> ones, the third. During the time of their eruption, and eſpecially when the four <hi>Quadruple</hi> ones break forth out of their Sockets, children are ſubject to Fevers, and great alterations, which weakens them extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and often puts an end to their days; which comes to paſs moſt commonly, for want of help to facilitate their iſſue out of the Gums.</p>
               <p>And as I look upon the knowledge of Childrens <hi>Teeth,</hi> as a ſubject properly belonging to my Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; ſo I think my ſelf oblig'd to amend, amplifie, and render it as conducive to the preſervation of the life, and health of Children, and to the preventing of all thoſe Infirmities wherewith they are afflicted, (upon the account of the firſt coming, and ſhedding of their <hi>Teeth)</hi> as my weak indeavours can make it.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40751:17"/>
And therefore I will to that end deliver here in few words, what reaſon and experience have taught me concerning the ſame; Proceeding thus,</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, I would adviſe ſuch as may be concerned in this Affair, to take a ſpecial care in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving when the Child's <hi>Teeth</hi> begin to trouble him: which (beſides his frowardneſs, and exceſſive crying) may be known by his <hi>ſalivation</hi> or drivelling (as Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are wont to ſtile it,) and the inflammation and ſwelling of his Gums; and as ſoon as you perceive it to be ſo, you are to waſh his mouth now and then with the following mixture: <hi>Take</hi> ſeven or eight as new <hi>Figs</hi> as you can get, and boyl them in a pint or more of <hi>Whey,</hi> till they grow very ſoft, and then ſqueeze the <hi>Whey,</hi> and as much of the ſubſtance of the <hi>Figs</hi> as you can through a cloth; of which liquor take half a pint; of Honey of Roſes, and Syrup of Violets, of each half an ounce; and three or four ſpoonfuls of <hi>Plantain-water:</hi> mix all together, and keep it cloſe in a Bottel. The beſt way to uſe it, is with a ſtick of Liquoriſh beaten at one end into ſmall threads like a Comb-bruſh, or little Broom, with which, being dipt in ſome of the ſaid Liquor, you ſhall waſh and rub the Childs Gums, (eſpecially where they are tumified) at leaſt five or ſix times a day, continuing ſo to do, till you perceive the Gums to grow white above the <hi>Tooth:</hi> (which is a ſign of great pain in that part, and that the young <hi>Tooth</hi> will in a little time break through the Gums) and then take a <hi>Lancet,</hi> or a very ſharp <hi>Pen-knife,</hi> and divide the white place, cutting it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40751:18"/>
down to the head of the ſubjacent <hi>Tooth,</hi> with two <hi>Inciſions</hi> croſſing one another at the centre of the white ſpot, continuing to uſe the mixture as is aforeſaid, till the <hi>Tooth</hi> appears above the Gums; obſerving to uſe the ſame method at the coming out of every <hi>Tooth,</hi> which you may know by the foregoing tokens.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Teeth</hi> being all come out (except only ſuch as remain latent within the Jaw, till about the two and twentieth year of ones age) they keep firm and ſtrong till the child is a matter of ſix or ſeven years old, and then moſt of them grow looſe, and a while after are caſt clear out. The <hi>treble Teeth</hi> never change, the <hi>Quadruples</hi> very rarely, but the <hi>Inciſores,</hi> the <hi>Dog-Teeth,</hi> and the double ones always do; ſometimes whole, (and then the <hi>ſecond Teeth,</hi> or thoſe that are to ſucceed them, are a long time before they grow up again;) but moſt commonly their head only comes off, the other part remaining ſtill for the making up of the next Tooth; like unto the firſt production of a Vegetable Seed, or tender Sprig of a young Plant; for as the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of this being withered in the <hi>Winter</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the rigorous cold of that Seaſon, drops off in the next Spring: (by reaſon that its texture being yet looſe, and leſs firm, the pores or ſap carrying veſſels, are over much dilated by the great affluence of the <hi>nutritive</hi> juice, and ſo give admittance to ſome indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and groſſer <hi>particles</hi> than is convenient for the nouriſhment of the Vegetable: which <hi>particles</hi> being irregular, and unactive, their motion is ſoon ſtopt; when-as a great cold intervening, compreſſes a little
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40751:18"/>
the young Plant round about, ſo that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal'd, and become fixt in their <hi>Ducts,</hi> or leading pipes, whereby that part being deprived of its due nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fades away, and dries up,) and is ſucceeded by a new Sprout ſhooting out of the ſtump, or remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part. So likewiſe the young <hi>Teeth</hi> coming into the cold air, when they are yet tender, and leſs ſolid: thoſe of them that are more ſuſceptible of alteration, and more expoſed to the inclemency of the weather; (as muſt be thoſe before, which by reaſon of their ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſituation, cannot but be more ſubject to <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious</hi> accidents,) are thereby chill'd and repreſſed, and their parts thruſt near one another, and driven back towards their centre, from whence the ſubſtance of the <hi>Tooth</hi> becoming cloſer, and the intervals between its parts narrower, and interrupted in ſeveral places, by the irregular motion of ſome of the minuteſt of thoſe parts, (which by reaſon of their unſtableneſs, and fluxibility, being diſpoſed to advance and obey the action of external Agents more than the others, do move diſorderly, and ſpoil the ſtructure of the reſt:) the ſmall Veins and Arteries therein diſperſed, will become ſo extremely compreſſed, that the bloud they contain (which in Children is moſt commonly groſs and impure, as is apparent by their ſtupidity, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſcabs; as well as by that Feveriſh diſpoſition they are always inclined to; which argues a great diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity between the parts of their bloud,) is thereby ſtopt in its courſe, and detained in them; where the groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its parts, and their incumbring figures will
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40751:19"/>
ſoon diſpoſe them to reſt, and remain intangled and coagulated together.</p>
               <p>If you chance to reflect upon what I ſay, when I aſcribe the great agitation of Childrens Bloud, and its being quiet and fixt in their Teeth, to the ſame cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> its foulneſs, and the incongruity of its parts; you will perhaps be as angry with me, as the <hi>Satyr</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Traveller of the <hi>Fables,</hi> for his blowing hot and cold with the ſame breath. But if you conſider it a little more attentively, you ſhall find that this, as well as the ſaid <hi>Apologue,</hi> may eaſily be reconciled with Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the Bloud coming from the live part of the Tooth, to enter the other; and being hindred thereof by the narrowneſs of the paſſages, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the condenſed bloud, is upon that neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily determined to imploy the force of its motion round about, againſt the parts lying immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the dead portion of the Tooth, and that which is alive; the which it conſequently looſens by degrees, and at laſt breaks them all aſunder; ſeparating thus the live body of the Tooth quite from its dead head; and the ſpace left between them permitting the <hi>trunk</hi> to grow, it ſhoots a new head; which riſing above the Gums, thruſts out the old one, becoming a perfect Tooth in its room.</p>
               <p>But if in the mean while, through the too great adherence of the dead part to the Gums, the other is depreſſed, or retarded from growing, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is detained under the former too long; ſome
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40751:19"/>
of the broken <hi>particles</hi> remaining between them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will corrode, and eat holes in the new head of the Tooth, and ſo it comes out already periſhed: which to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, the firſt Teeth muſt be drawn out as ſoon as they appear any thing looſe.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it happens ſometimes, that the new head of the Tooth is nouriſhed, and increaſes ſo faſt, that being obſtructed by the too great connexion of the old one, to the adjacent parts, from advancing in its right courſe; it turns aſide, and makes its way through either the inſide, or outſide of the Gums; and ſo it grows biaſſing, and out of rank. This defect is remedied by drawing out the ſuperfluous Tooth, and the uſe of ſome convenient means to bring the new Tooth into its place; which is very eaſy to do, if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken at firſt, but otherwiſe a great deal more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult; and eſpecially if the two next Teeth are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached ſo near one another, that it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained between them, without being leſſened, or the others put further off from each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That in drawing out the old, or ſucking Tooth, a great care is to be taken not to hurt the new one, lying under it.</p>

of our Diſcourſe ſhall reſpect both men and children; for it will not only teach how to haſten the growth of Childrens ſecond Teeth, when it happens to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd, or retarded too long; but alſo how to <hi>Accelerate</hi> the coming out of thoſe in Men, that are called Teeth of Wiſdom.

                  </hi> calls the <hi>Seminal Root,</hi> and <hi>Trunck</hi> of a Plant in <hi>Embryo)</hi> whereby they are impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Extricate</hi> themſelves out of their <hi>Integuments,</hi> and <hi>Parenchyma;</hi> and begin to <hi>vegetate,</hi> and grow like a Plant.</p>
               <p>But the Seed being buried deep in a cold, cloggy earth; will, by the ſtubborn <hi>Coheſion,</hi> and lumpiſhneſs of the ſaid earth, be kept from <hi>dilating</hi> it ſelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently from receiving thoſe <hi>particles</hi> that are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether neceſſary for its <hi>vivifying,</hi> and <hi>augmentation.</hi> From whence it follows, that its growth (if not hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by Art) will be check'd, and obſtructed till the heat of the Sun has opened the ground, and ſet its <hi>particles</hi> in ſuch motion as they ought to be, to enter the Seed, and <hi>protrude</hi> the earth upwards.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe Childrens Gums, being yet tender, ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and looſe, and withal prepar'd, as we have taught heretofore in its place, their firſt Teeth come out, and grow very eaſily; as alſo do their ſecond, if in ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the firſt, their heads only come off; for the others do grow up ſo ſoon, that the Gums have hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any time to cloſe up again. But if the ſucking-Teeth do ſhed root and all, the matter out of which the next (which I call <hi>Novel-Teeth)</hi> are to be made, will not only be a conſiderable time in diſpoſing it ſelf into the requiſite form, but when the firſt linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are drawn, and Nature has accompliſhed her firſt work, the Gums will be re-united together, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40751:21"/>
grown ſo hard by that time, that their reſiſtance will oppoſe it ſelf to the growth of theſe Teeth, till a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger nouriſhment produces more and hotter Bloud, and a greater quantity of <hi>Animal Spirits;</hi> by which the Gums being made hotter, and more ſpungy, and the <hi>nutritive</hi> juice increaſed, the iſſue of the ſaid Teeth will then be <hi>facilitated,</hi> and their growth perfected.</p>
               <p>To the conſideration of theſe <hi>Novel-Teeth,</hi> may part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be referred that of the laſt <hi>treble</hi> ones, or <hi>dentes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientiae.</hi> It's true, theſe are ſtay'd a great deal longer under the Gums than the others; but alſo they have more cauſes that impede their growth. For, beſides that, the Gums are more ſinewy, and <hi>membranous</hi> about them than any where elſe, and therefore much more difficult to <hi>penetrate:</hi> That part of the Jaw-bone that contains them, is likewiſe much thicker, and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than any other; and conſequently, harder to be divided by the included Teeth; which being inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making their way through it, are forced to ſtay therein till ſuch time that Nature having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected our growth, the <hi>bloud</hi> becomes hotter, ſtronger, and its <hi>energy</hi> more powerful by the firmneſs of the Heart, (which is the Sun of our <hi>Microcoſm,</hi> or little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>world) and other principal parts, and increaſe of thoſe <hi>particles</hi> that were wont to be imployed in making up, and augmenting the body; moſt of which remain then in the maſs of the <hi>Bloud:</hi> whereby the ſaid <hi>bloud,</hi> being able to ſurmount the reſiſtance of the Jaw and Gums, forces the ſaid Teeth to come out of their cells, and grow up.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:40751:21"/>
To the efficacy of this new ſtrength of the <hi>Bloud</hi> upon the arrival of Nature to its higheſt <hi>Period,</hi> may be attributed the cauſes of thoſe alterations that uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally happen in mens bodies about that time: many looking pale, and being troubled with divers infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties till then, of which they are afterwards delivered. But leaving off Digreſſions, let us return to our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>We have already obſerved, that the <hi>Novel-Teeth</hi> in Children, and <hi>Dentes Supientiae</hi> in Men, cou'd not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to their perfection, nor therefore become ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to us without a long time, and a great <hi>Effort</hi> of Nature. It remains now, that (purſuant to our deſign, as we have declar'd it at the beginning of this Section) we indeavor to find out ſome means, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may remedy thoſe defects; in <hi>facilitating</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's work, and rendring thoſe <hi>tardy Teeth</hi> above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, ſerviceable to us as ſoon as we can. And as I find none more proper and expeditious, than the <hi>Rarifaction,</hi> and <hi>Dilatation</hi> of the Gums, ſo that they may loſe their greateſt ſtubbornneſs, and become more yielding to the <hi>Teeth:</hi> I conclude that all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lies in knowing how ſuch an effect can be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: which (after a due conſideration) I think may be performed after this manner.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, there is need of an Inſtrument made of Gold, or Silver, about a foot long, as big as a Tobacco-pipe, and like a <hi>Syringe;</hi> being ſo bored, that a perfectly <hi>Cilindrical embolus,</hi> or ſucker, may fill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly nine inches of its <hi>Cavity;</hi> the reſt being made a good
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40751:22"/>
deal ſmaller, and bow'd like the Blowing-pipe of <hi>Watch-makers;</hi> which ought to end into an head re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the cup of an <hi>Acorn;</hi> and ſo contriv'd, that it may imbrace the Gums exactly. Your <hi>Inſtrument</hi> being ready, if you have a mind to perform the <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> you muſt in the next place (concerning the <hi>Dentes Sapientiae)</hi> tie all the <hi>Teeth</hi> together, (which may be done without any trouble) ſo that the two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of them may draw the laſt of all towards the fore-part of the <hi>mouth.</hi> By this the included Teeth will be freed from being <hi>compreſſed</hi> between the others, and the extremity of the Jaw-bone. And then the Gums being prepar'd by <hi>Emollients,</hi> and <hi>relaxing</hi> things, apply the end of your <hi>Syringe</hi> cloſe upon the Gums, under which the imperfect Tooth lies; and then draw the <hi>Embolus,</hi> and the top of the Gums will follow, and riſe within the little <hi>Acorn-cup-like</hi> end of the Pipe, as the fleſh uſually doth under <hi>Cupping-Glaſses.</hi> Keep it a while ſo, and then take away the <hi>Syringe,</hi> and <hi>ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie</hi> that part of the Gums that was drawn within the Pipe, in ſeveral places; <hi>reiterating</hi> the ſame <hi>Operation</hi> twice a day, for about a fortnight, omitting only the <hi>Scarification,</hi> which is to be uſed the firſt time only. By this means it appears probable to me, that the Gums yielding, the force of the <hi>Blood</hi> will compel the <hi>fibres</hi> or <hi>minute</hi> parts of the imperfect Tooth, to advance according to their natural order, and ſituation; and ſo cauſe the ſaid Tooth to grow.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Novel-Teeth,</hi> you ſhall follow the ſame method, and uſe the ſame means in <hi>facilitating</hi> their
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40751:22"/>
coming out, that you have done to the others; omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting only the tying of the Teeth, which would be <hi>ſuperfluous</hi> here.</p>
               <p>Note, that every thing is not capable of the ſame perfection, and that as there is no rule without ſome exception; ſo when I have aſſerted ſuch and ſuch things to be improvable to ſuch a degree, it is to be underſtood for the moſt part, and in general; not denying but that it may happen otherwiſe in ſome particular caſes: but I ſhall always deal candidly with every body, never undertaking any thing but what I ſhall be able to do according to agreement. And if any one will be pleaſed to come to my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he may have my Advice (concerning any thing that belongs to my Profeſſion) <hi>gratis</hi> at any time.</p>

            <head>A Phyſical Diſcourſe WHEREIN The Reaſons of the Beating of the PULSE, <hi>or</hi> Pulſation <hi>of the</hi> Arteries; <hi>Together with thoſe of the</hi> Circulation <hi>of the</hi> Bloud, <hi>are</hi> Mechanically <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd: Which was never done before.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe <hi>Beating of the Pulſe</hi> being one of thoſe <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena,</hi> that deſerve mans conſideration the beſt, it has excited the moſt Learned in all Ages to ſearch out what might be the cauſe of it.</p>
            <p>The beſt <hi>Phyſitians</hi> and greateſt <hi>Philoſophers</hi> of former times, being ignorant of the <hi>Circulation</hi> of the <hi>Bloud,</hi> did aſcribe it to their occult qualities, and unknown powers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen,</hi> an Eminent <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> ſearching the natural cauſe of the <hi>Beating of the Pulſe,</hi> thought upon the making of that famous Experiment of his; by which, having put a Quill into an <hi>Artery,</hi> and tied the <hi>Artery</hi> upon it, he found that the ſaid <hi>Artery</hi> ceaſed from beating betwixt the ligature and the extremity, tho it continued ſtill beating betwixt the ſame ligature and the heart: And then ſeeing alſo, that the <hi>Artery</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:40751:24"/>
being untied from about the Quill, the <hi>Pulſe</hi> would immediately paſs beyond the place where the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had been made, and beat all along the <hi>Artery;</hi> altho the capacity of the Quill remained ſtill the ſame, he concluded, that the <hi>Pulſe</hi> was cauſed by a <hi>Pulſiſick</hi> faculty reſiding in the coats of the <hi>Artery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> a Modern and moſt Learned Philoſopher, attributed the ſaid effect, to the <hi>Pulſifick</hi> Faculty of the heart; which, in his opinion, communicates it ſelf to the <hi>Arteries.</hi> Both which opinions (altho propos'd by extraordinary men, yet) are ſo inconſiderable, that they need no refutation.</p>
            <p>The moſt Learned and moſt Profound <hi>Carteſius</hi> was of opinion, that the <hi>Beating of the Pulſe</hi> proceeded from the motion of the <hi>Bloud,</hi> which coming out of the leſt <hi>Ventricle</hi> of the Heart into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> in a tumultuous manner, extends it ſelf forcibly, and thereby drives all the maſs of the <hi>Bloud,</hi> from the heart to the heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, according to the <hi>Circulation</hi> of the Bloud. After which this great Man (who would always give natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and intelligible reaſons for every thing, as he has done for moſt;) coming (at the inſtigation of a <hi>Phyſitian</hi> of <hi>Louvaine)</hi> to examine <hi>Galen</hi>'s Experiment, he attributed the ceſſation of the <hi>Pulſe,</hi> that happens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ligature, to the narrowneſs of the paſſage of the <hi>Bloud</hi> through the Quill; which <hi>Bloud,</hi> according to the principles of the Philotopher, coming out of the ſaid Quill into a wider ſpace, cannot communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate its action to the ſides of the <hi>Artery,</hi> but is diſpoſed to imploy the force of its motion forwards, according to the length of the <hi>Artery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:40751:24"/>
But the ſaid <hi>Phyſitian</hi> alledging againſt this, that if one takes an <hi>Artery</hi> without Quill, or any <hi>Inciſion,</hi> and ties its ſides ſo cloſe together, that there be left a far ſmaller paſſage for the Bloud in that place, than in the Quill; the <hi>Artery</hi> will nevertheleſs continue ſtill to <hi>Beat</hi> on both ſides of the ligature, as it did before: (the contrary of which wou'd neceſſarily follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it were ſo, that the ſtraitneſs of the paſſage of the Bloud did occaſion the loſs of the <hi>Pulſe) Carteſius</hi> was here forced to recede ſomewhat from his former <hi>Sentiment,</hi> and to confeſs, that the motion of the <hi>Arteries</hi> depends partly upon the free continuation of their coats; which totally overthrows his opinion. For, let the power of the ſaid continuation be what it will; ſuppoſing, as the Philoſopher did, that its action may be ſtopt by the compreſſion of the ſides of the <hi>Artery:</hi> It is certain, that altho the Quill in the <hi>Artery</hi> were of equal, or, if you will, greater capacity than the <hi>Artery;</hi> yet if the ſaid <hi>Artery</hi> were tied upon it, the <hi>Pulſe</hi> would, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that, ceaſe below the ligature. But <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſius</hi> ſaid, that ſuch a Quill as that we were ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of juſt now, being in an <hi>Artery</hi> either tied, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied; wou'd never hinder any part of the <hi>Artery</hi> from <hi>Beating:</hi> And therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Lower</hi> ſays, after many Diſquiſitions on this Subject, that the knowledge of thoſe things was left to God alone.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> aſcribes the <hi>Beating of the Pulſe</hi> to the contraction of the <hi>circular Fibres</hi> of the <hi>muſcular</hi> coat of the <hi>Artery:</hi> But it is abſurd to think ſo; for its impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40751:25"/>
to imagine that thoſe <hi>Fibres</hi> cou'd contract them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their own accord; neither does the Doctor give any reaſon for what he ſays. Beſides, he's incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with himſelf, when he aſcribes the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the circular <hi>Fibres</hi> of the <hi>muſcular</hi> coat of the veins; which are notwithſtanding wholly deſtitute of any <hi>Pulſation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>All which conſidering, and how theſe and other great men had (through the difficulty of the thing, and not out of any inſufficiency in them) fallen into ſo groſs and ſo erroneous opinions concerning the Point in Queſtion; I concluded, that it was as good as imposſible ever to ſolve the difficulty. Yet, recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting my ſelf, and ſeeing that the ſaid Effect muſt have a cauſe, whatever it be, which probably cannot reſide any where elſe, but either in the Heart, Bloud, or coats of the <hi>Artery;</hi> or finally, in them all together; I made a reſolution to examine carefully each one of theſe things ſeparately, as posſibly containing alone the cauſe ſought after; and then all together, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing posſibly Coadjutors in the <hi>production</hi> of the known Effect. And after as exact an Inquiry into the matter as I am capable of, my Reaſons (which wou'd be too tedious to tell you now) perſwade me, that all the Myſtery conſiſts in the three following things.</p>
            <p>The Firſt is, the Structure of the <hi>Artery;</hi> which is made up of four <hi>Coats.</hi> (We ſhall examine in another place how they are generated at firſt) The firſt of them, which contains the <hi>Bloud</hi> immediately, ſeems to be <hi>nervous,</hi> and made of ſtrait <hi>Fibres;</hi> which take
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40751:25"/>
their <hi>Origine</hi> from the heart; or rather are a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of thoſe that immediately inveſt the <hi>cavity</hi> of the heart. As ſoon as they are arriv'd at the <hi>orifice</hi> of the heart, they rank themſelves by one another; form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a certain <hi>Cartilagineous</hi> Ring; from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of which, they run almoſt parallel along the <hi>Artery;</hi> but yet with ſuch an inclination towards one another, that going from the heart to the extreme parts, they form a kind of <hi>Cone;</hi> (for that we may render our Diſcourſe more intelligible; we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider here one of the trunks of the great <hi>Artery,</hi> (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the aſcending one,) as a continued right <hi>Conical Pipe,</hi> abſtracting from all its diviſions and branches; to every one of which may eaſily be apply'd, what we are going to ſay of one of them,) a little below the <hi>Apex</hi> of which, thoſe <hi>Fibres</hi> unite themſelves together; and do compoſe a little <hi>tendinous</hi> ring, called <hi>Anaſtomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis:</hi> to which is affix'd the extremity of the <hi>vena cava:</hi> which vein we ſhall ſuppoſe here to be a ſingle <hi>coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> channel, or pipe, diſpoſed, as we have taken the <hi>Artery</hi> to be. Within this <hi>Anaſtomoſis</hi> there is a little <hi>Valve</hi> ſo diſpos'd, that it permits the bloud to paſs from the <hi>Artery</hi> into the vein, but hinders it from returning back again from the vein into the <hi>Artery.</hi> Between every one of thoſe <hi>nervous Fibres,</hi> there is a thin <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane</hi> that joyns them together; (as the skin in a Gooſe's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot ties its toes to one another,) which permits the ſaid <hi>Fibres</hi> to open, and go further from one another, when the <hi>Artery</hi> is dilated: And which do continually increaſe in breath, as they go from the <hi>Anaſtomoſis</hi> to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40751:26"/>
the <hi>baſis</hi> of the <hi>Artery:</hi> ſo that they become ſo conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous near the heart, that Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> took them for ſome large fleſhy <hi>Fibres;</hi> to which he asſign'd the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of ſhortning the <hi>Artery,</hi> in order to promote the circulation of the Bloud. The ſecond coat is the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,</hi> and the third the <hi>Glandulous:</hi> but the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe middle coats, being not neceſſary to our preſent purpoſe, we ſhall ſpeak of them another time. As to the fourth, or outmoſt Coat, it is that which we have moſt need to take notice of here; as being the principal Inſtrument of the <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole</hi> of the <hi>Artery.</hi> This Coat is made up of two orders, or ranks of <hi>ſpiral Fibres;</hi> which proceed from the <hi>oblique Fibres</hi> of the heart; from whence they go twiſting and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves about the body of the <hi>Artery,</hi> as <hi>Ivy</hi> does about Trees; ſome running upon it from the left to the right, and the others from the right to the left; interſecting thus one another <hi>obliquely,</hi> as they go from the heart to the <hi>anaſtomoſis;</hi> whereby they form a ſort of Net, or Sieve-like-woof upon the outſide of the <hi>Artery.</hi> At their coming out of the heart, they are knitted together by a <hi>cartilagineous</hi> ſubſtance, that incompaſſes the root of the <hi>Artery</hi> round about, as an iron-ring does the end of a handle: from the circumference of which <hi>cartilagineous</hi> Ring, they run <hi>Helix-wiſe</hi> upon the ſuperficies of the <hi>artery:</hi> at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of which, being arriv'd, they inſert themſelves into the <hi>tendinous</hi> ſmall ring, or <hi>anaſtomoſis.</hi> Theſe <hi>ſpiral Fibres</hi> are tied ſo looſely on the body of the <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> and ſo ſlightly between themſelves, at the places
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40751:26"/>
where they <hi>interſect</hi> one another, that they may run very eaſily to and fro upon the <hi>artery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing conducive to the production of thoſe ſtated turns of <hi>Syſtole's</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole's</hi> of the <hi>artery,</hi> is, that the bloud contains a certain ſubtil matter, or vital ſpirit, which can move it ſelf, and paſs between its parts very eaſily. And in fine, that the bloud coming out of the heart (where it acquires an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme agitation) into the <hi>arteria magna,</hi> expands it ſelf with great violence, and ſtrongly dilates that part of the ſaid <hi>artery</hi> that lies contiguous to the heart, (forcing in the ſame time the bloud to advance from the heart towards the extremity,) whereby the <hi>ſpiral Fibres</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſarily drawn towards the dilating place, do compreſs the <hi>artery</hi> round about all along, &amp; ſo ſqueeze the ſubtil matter, from between the parts of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed bloud, into that which is not; forcing it thus to paſs from the extremity towards the heart, which makes the ebbing or <hi>ſyſtole</hi> of the <hi>artery.</hi> And then the <hi>ſpiral Fibres</hi> having been extended violently, and on a ſudden, upon the <hi>dilatation</hi> of the <hi>artery,</hi> do (by the <hi>Elaſtick</hi> faculty of ſome of their parts) come back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and reſtitute themſelves into their former ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſtate; forcing thereby the ſubtil matter to fly through the bloud, from the dilated place of the great <hi>Artery,</hi> towards the extremity of the <hi>capillary</hi> ones, &amp;c. which makes the flowing or <hi>Diaſtole</hi> of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</hi>

               <head>THE EXPLICATION.</head>
               <p>WE have already ſuppoſed the <hi>Artery</hi> to be of a right <hi>Conical</hi> figure; let us further, for greater evidence, imagine it to be mentally divided into four parts of equal capacity: ſo that as much as the firſt ſhall exceed the ſecond in bredth, the ſecond will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the firſt in length, &amp;c. Let beſides, the places of the ſuppos'd diviſions be marked with ſeveral letters, as A, B, C, and let A, denote the firſt diviſion; (proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the heart to the extremity;) B, the ſecond; and C, the third: let us alſo mark the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the <hi>Cylindrical artery,</hi> which is inſerted into the <hi>baſis</hi> of the heart, by X; and its <hi>capillary</hi> end inſerted into the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the <hi>annular anaſtomoſis,</hi> by Y.</p>
               <p>And now, ſuppoſe that a certain portion of bloud, as a dram for example, paſſes out of the heart into the <hi>aorta,</hi> where it ſwells, and dilates it ſelf very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably, (by reaſon of a very intenſe degree of heat, it acquires in the <hi>ventricles</hi> of the heart; and of its being mixed therein with a certain leaven, or <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative</hi> juice, (it being the reſidue of that portion of bloud, that had paſt immediately before through the heart,) which neceſſarily cauſes a great commotion and ſtrife amongſt its parts;) it muſt follow according to true Philoſophy, that the ſaid portion of bloud coming out of the heart, does in the ſame time thruſt the bloud already in the <hi>artery,</hi> forwards, and dilates that part of the <hi>artery</hi> that lies contiguous to the heart.

It thruſts the bloud, I ſay, towards the extremity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that it muſt occupy a ſpace in the <hi>artery</hi> equal to its natural bulk, neither greater nor ſmaller; by reaſon that a like quantity of the bloud to that, that comes out of the heart into the <hi>artery,</hi> is poured out of the vein into the heart; ſo that there is only room left in the vein to admit juſt as much bloud, as comes out of the heart at each <hi>Diaſtole.</hi> And if we ſuppoſe the ſpace X A, to contain a dram of bloud, (whether more, or leſs, makes no matter here) as we have alſo ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that the ſame quantity comes out of the heart at every <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> (or <hi>Syſtole,</hi> as ſome would have it) it is an invincible truth, that this bloud coming out of the heart, muſt exactly occupy the ſpace X A; and that therefore, it thruſts in the ſame time, the bloud that occupied it before, into the ſpace A B; that in A B, into the ſpace B C; that in the ſpace B C, into the ſpace C Y; and that in C Y, into the <hi>capillary</hi> end of the vein, &amp;c. And altho (according to our <hi>Hypotheſis)</hi> the paſſage from the <hi>artery</hi> into the vein be much ſmaller, than that of the heart into the <hi>artery;</hi> yet if the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bloud through the <hi>anaſtomoſis,</hi> is to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bloud at the <hi>orifice</hi> of the heart, as the <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> of the heart is to the <hi>anaſtomoſis;</hi> that is, as X is to Y, (as it may eaſily be ſo, altho it is naturally otherwiſe: the reſt of the <hi>anaſtomoſes,</hi> from which we have abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted here, being together at leaſt as capacious, as the <hi>orifice</hi> of the heart,) it is plain, that a dram of bloud will as ſoon paſs from the <hi>artery</hi> into the vein, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall from the heart into the <hi>artery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:40751:28"/>
And as the bloud coming out of the heart into the great <hi>artery,</hi> cannot posſibly occupy a greater ſpace, than ſuch as is adequate to its volume in a condenſed ſtate; and that nevertheleſs it dilates it ſelf, it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily extend and dilate X A, the part of the <hi>artery</hi> that contains it, as much beyond its natural tone, or reach, as the rarefaction of the bloud increaſes its vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume; which cannot come to paſs, but theſe two things muſt neceſſarily follow. Firſt, that when the bloud dilates it ſelf, it leaves ſome intervals between its parts; which intervals (becauſe there is no <hi>vacuum</hi> in nature) muſt in the ſame time be filled up with ſome other fluid matter: (which ought to be thinner than the bloud; for otherwiſe it cou'd not paſs between its parts.) And as this ſubtil matter can't come from the heart, becauſe that then it's empty; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides its <hi>orifice</hi> is ſhut cloſe by its three <hi>valves;</hi> it can neither come through the coats of the <hi>artery,</hi> by reaſon of their thickneſs, and cloſe texture; neither is there any ſuch matter about them. It remains then only, that it muſt come from the bloud contained in the <hi>artery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that the <hi>ſpiral Fibres</hi> muſt be drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the dilated place, and the reſt of the <hi>artery</hi> made as much narrower than ordinary, as X A, becomes wider than it uſes to be. Whereby the <hi>artery</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed round about, the vital ſpirit is ſqueezed from between the compreſſed parts of the bloud, and forced to advance towards the dilated place; in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that as much of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> as is neceſſary to fill
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40751:28"/>
up the ſpaces left between the parts of the dilated bloud, is ſent thither from between the parts of that, which is compreſſed; the remnant of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> being equally diſtributed through the reſt of the <hi>artery;</hi> ſo that if every one of the four parts, or diviſions of the <hi>artery,</hi> contains a certain quantity of vital <hi>ſpirit,</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into three parts, and that three of thoſe parts, do paſs from A B, into X A, two of them will in the ſame inſtant paſs from B C, into A B; and one from C Y, into B C; in which action conſiſts the ebbing, or <hi>ſyſtole</hi> of the <hi>artery.</hi> And as a rope, (or more ſenſibly, a gut-ſtring) which is fixed to any place, being pulled with a jerk, will draw back again him that drew it at firſt; ſo likewiſe the <hi>ſpiral Fibres</hi> being extended vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, and on a ſudden, upon the <hi>dilatation</hi> of the <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> do come back again <hi>inſtantaneouſly,</hi> (by reaſon that ſome of the parts of each <hi>Fibre,</hi> being ſtrongly thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted towards its middle, and ſomewhat bent from its circumference towards its centre, do preſently ſpring back again, extending themſelves according to the bredth of the <hi>Fibre;</hi> whereby the ſaid <hi>Fibre</hi> is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily as much ſhortned, as it had been ſtretch'd before) and reſtitute themſelves into their former ſituation &amp; <hi>tone;</hi> (which they are facilitated to do by the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of that extraordinary agitation of the bloud; which it communicates in an inſtant to the yielding ſides of the <hi>artery)</hi> forcing thereby three parts of the vital <hi>ſpirit,</hi> or ſubtil matter, to repaſs from X A, to A B; and the two parts, that were already in A B, to paſs into B C; from whence another will paſs into C Y, &amp;c.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40751:29"/>
which makes the flowing, or <hi>Diaſtole</hi> of the <hi>artery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I foreſee an Objection, that ſome may make againſt what we have ſaid, that that portion of the bloud, that comes out of the heart in its <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> is dilated, and yet occupies no more of the <hi>artery,</hi> than if it were condenſed; only that part of the <hi>artery</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it, is a little more extended than the reſt: for, they will ſay, this ſuppoſes, that both the <hi>artery</hi> and the vein are always full of bloud; being certain, that if the bloud, in coming out of the heart into the great <hi>artery,</hi> did find there any empty ſpace, where it might expand it ſelf freely, it would ſtart forwards into it, and then it wou'd not dilate the <hi>artery,</hi> nor by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence draw the <hi>ſpiral Fibres;</hi> and therefore there wou'd neither be <hi>Syſtole</hi> nor <hi>Diaſtole</hi> in the <hi>artery:</hi> But it is moſt certain, they will continue, that men have ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſs bloud in their bodies: and that if a man has, for example, fifteen oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of bloud drawn, it will follow; that there being a vacuity in the <hi>Sanguiducts,</hi> till the ſame quantity of bloud be regenerated a-new, the <hi>Beating of the Pulſe</hi> muſt alſo ceaſe till then; which being contradicted by daily experience, they will conclude, that the motion of the <hi>ſpiral Fibres,</hi> with whatever elſe we have taught concerning the <hi>Beating of the Pulſe,</hi> is altogether <hi>chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical.</hi> To which I anſwer in few words, that for the <hi>Beating of the Pulſe,</hi> and Circulation of the Bloud, it matters not at all, whether or no, the <hi>artery</hi> and vein be quite full of bloud; ſince that as the bloud decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in them, the muſcles of the limbs, and other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40751:29"/>
parts, do proportionably compreſs them round about; ſo that their internal ſuperficies touches the bloud continually every way; which has the ſame effect, as if the <hi>artery</hi> and vein were exactly full of bloud: for the bloud coming out of the heart, and finding as much difficulty in lifting up the adjacent parts, as to drive on the bloud of the <hi>artery</hi> and vein, when they are full on't; it's forced to keep the ſame order and method in that caſe, as it does in this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning its dilatation and place in the <hi>artery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, theſe being the true and genuine reaſons of the <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> and <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the <hi>arteries,</hi> it's very eaſy thereby to explain all the <hi>Phenomena</hi> relating to <hi>Galen</hi>'s experiment. For the Quill being put into the <hi>artery,</hi> and left there without being tied, the <hi>artery</hi> will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs beat ſtill above and below the Quill, as it did before; becauſe that the <hi>ſpiral Fibres</hi> can ſtill play to and fro from one end of the <hi>artery</hi> to the other, without impediment. But if you bind the ſides of the <hi>artery</hi> upon the Quill, the motion of the ſame <hi>ſpiral Fibres</hi> will be intercopted by the <hi>ligature;</hi> ſo that it muſt neceſſarily follow, (by the foregoing reaſons,) that the <hi>artery</hi> being not alternatively compreſſed, and dilated betwixt the ſaid <hi>ligature</hi> and the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the <hi>Pulſe</hi> muſt alſo ceaſe in that part of the ſaid <hi>artery,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Many things may eaſily be explained by this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, tho impoſſible to be interpreted any otherwiſe; which therefore become as many proofs of its verity: as namely, the difference which is between the <hi>arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:40751:30"/>
and venal bloud. For (having demonſtrated above, that when the bloud advances in the great <hi>artery</hi> from the heart towards the <hi>anaſtomoſis,</hi> and from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the vein, the vital <hi>ſpirit</hi> goes in the very ſame time from the <hi>anaſtomoſis</hi> towards the heart; whereby the ſaid <hi>ſpirit</hi> is neceſſarily kept within the <hi>artery;)</hi> it is certain, that this diſparity proceeds from the want of <hi>ſpirit</hi> in the venal to keep its parts in agitation; which abounding in the <hi>arterial,</hi> keeps it in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual effervency, &amp;c. I cou'd add many other things to authorize what we have ſaid concerning the <hi>Beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Pulſe,</hi> and <hi>Circulation</hi> of the Bloud: but I hope this will ſuffice to rational men, and ſuch as are of a <hi>Mechanical Genius.</hi> As for thoſe that attribute all things to final cauſes, and have recourſe upon every occaſion, to the deſigns and intentions of Nature; (as when they ſay, that the Eye-brows are made to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sweat from falling into the eyes, &amp;c.) if, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that we can do, they remain ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to our reaſons, it matters not much; and, in my opinion, ſuch perſons had a great deal better ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Aſtrology;</hi> or, if they are big with devotion, go and comment upon <hi>Job,</hi> or Paraphraſe ſome <hi>Pſalms,</hi> than meddle with <hi>Phyſical</hi> matters.</p>
