            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the Supreme <hi>Wiſdome, Intereſt,</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> who is an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Being, to <hi>underſtand,</hi> &amp; <hi>adhere</hi> unto his <hi>laſt End,</hi> and whatever <hi>means</hi> conduce thereto: This is ſtiled, Luke 19. 42. <hi>To know the things that belong unto our peace.</hi> And the ſupreme end of our Great <hi>Lord,</hi> in eſpouſing <hi>Human Nature,</hi> was, to acquaint Sinners with the things that belong to <hi>their peace,</hi> and bring them into an immediate <hi>Capacitie</hi> for the <hi>Fruition</hi> of them. Is it not then the higheſt piece of <hi>Folie,</hi> and <hi>Madneſſe,</hi> for rational Creatures, to ſhut their Eyes, and Hearts againſt that, which is their ſupreme Happineſſe? Is there ſo much <hi>Beautie</hi> in the Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Sin? So much <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in the
<pb facs="tcp:34711:3"/>
Chains and Fetters of Satan? So much <hi>Libertie</hi> in the Vaſſalage, and Bondage of Luſts? So much <hi>Content</hi> in the embraces of an heart-diſtracting World? So much <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>eaſe</hi> in the ſtings, and troubles of a tormented Conſcience? So much life in the death of Sin, and Hel torments, as to make a rational ſoul amorous of, and in love with them? If not, how comes it to paſſe, that men mind not more <hi>the things that belong unto their peace?</hi> Was it ever known that any, but <hi>mad</hi> men, would take delight to ſee their own heart-bloud guſh out? Would any but <hi>blind fools</hi> ſpurne at food, the moſt delicious, ſatisfying food, when offered to their famiſhed ſouls? May we not count ſuch <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched Sots,</hi> who plot, and contrive, by al means poſſible, to ruine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? And yet, Lo! is not this the Caſe of al ſuch, who wil not <hi>know,</hi> and <hi>embrace</hi> the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto their peace, when offered to them? Alas! What a world of ſuch mad, and blind fools are there? Yea, how many great Profeſſors, yea
<pb facs="tcp:34711:3"/>
how many Churches, fal under this black brand of Folie and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Was not this <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s ſin and folie, for which ſhe has paid ſo dear, for 1600 years? And has <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> been alone in this ſin? Has not <hi>England</hi> alſo dranke very deep of this venimous, intoxicating Cup? And what may we expect but <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>'s prodigious <hi>Ruines,</hi> unleſſe we al make haſte, <hi>to know and embrace the things that belong unto our peace, before they are hid from our eyes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The deſigne therefore of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Diſcourſe, is to awaken, and provoke <hi>ſecure Unbelievers,</hi> and <hi>ſlumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Profeſſors, deeply to conſider, and chearfully to embrace <hi>Evangelic</hi> offers of <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> before it be too late. And our <hi>Firſt Book</hi> is wholly ſpent in the explication of our Lords dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lamentation, <hi>Luke</hi> 19, 41. over Jeruſalems <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Ruines.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we have endeavored to explicate, What were <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Church-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting <hi>Sins,</hi> and <hi>Ruines,</hi> which our Lord here laments; in order to a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi> of, and <hi>Lamentation</hi> over our
<pb facs="tcp:34711:4"/>
own Sins, and approching Ruines, if not prevented by a timous Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and cloſing with <hi>the things of our peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe <hi>Jeruſalem's</hi> main Sin was <hi>Infidelitie,</hi> this therefore is the chief ſubject of what follows <hi>Book</hi> 2. Wherein we have endeavored to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the black and prodigious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> in the ſeveral parts thereof; and that in oppoſition to <hi>Faith,</hi> whereof it is a <hi>Privation.</hi> Wherein we have alſo opened the <hi>Nature,</hi> and main eſſential Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of Faith: which indeed compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the chief <hi>vitals</hi> of Chriſtianitie; and therefore requires our moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>Attention,</hi> and curious <hi>Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next great and <hi>commun Head</hi> to be explicated is the <hi>Cauſes of Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:</hi> which wil open to us, what a great <hi>Myſterie of Iniquitie</hi> lies at the Root of Unbelief. Hence we are to procede to its <hi>Aggravations,</hi> which wil diſcover to us the monſtrous <hi>Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of this ſin. And thence follows the ſevere <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> and Vengeance,
<pb facs="tcp:34711:4"/>
which the righteous God inflicteth for this Sin of Infidelitie. Theſe things wil, if Providence favor, and aſſiſt our deſires, be the ſubject of ſeveral Diſcourſes. Only, that I might not at preſent wholly fruſtrate the Readers expectations, I have in the <hi>Corollaries,</hi> and <hi>Uſes</hi> of the <hi>Second Book</hi> given ſome Hints and Intimations of the chief Particulars, which I intend to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of under the following Heads. As for the <hi>Forme</hi> of the Diſcourſe, I thinke I may with Sinceritie ſay, I have endeavored to ſuit it to my <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> I would hate ſinful <hi>Affectation</hi> of <hi>Words,</hi> or <hi>Things,</hi> merely to pleaſe itching curious ſpirits, as much as Hel. Yet if any words occur that may give <hi>luſtre</hi> and <hi>efficace</hi> to the Truths diſcourſed of, I cannot thinke myſelf obliged to reject them, becauſe not ſo vulgar, as other words leſſe proper are. Only, if thou meet with any word beyond thy capacitie to apprehend, remember that the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing word uſually explains the ſame.</p>

               <p>As for the <hi>Contexture,</hi> or coherence of our <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of the words.</note> Text, with the precedent diſcourſe, it deſerves a particular <hi>Remarque,</hi> as it lies couched in the firſt particle, <hi>And;</hi> as alſo in that following expreſſion, <hi>when he was come near:</hi> which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently connecteth this hiſtorie with what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes. Our Evangeliſt had hitherto declared with what joyous <hi>Acclamations,</hi> and <hi>Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations,</hi> the vulgar Jews welcomed their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed <hi>Meſſias;</hi> How chearfully they <hi>recogniſed</hi> him as their ſoverain Lord, and King; What

loud <hi>Hoſanna's,</hi> and <hi>Pſalmes</hi> of praiſe they ſang unto him: He now procedes to expound, with what a <hi>triſte</hi> and penſive minde; with what a <hi>bleeding</hi> and <hi>melted Heart;</hi> with what a mournful and <hi>weeping</hi> countenance Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them. They <hi>rejoice</hi> in their new-found <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and King; but he <hi>weeps</hi> over them: They ſeem to <hi>Inſtal</hi> him, and lift him on his Throne; but he with tears laments their <hi>final <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, Contumacie,</hi> and <hi>Ruine</hi> not far off. This ſeems to be the natural <hi>connexion</hi> of the words, as it wil further appear by what follows.</p>
               <p>As for the explication of the words, we ſhal <note place="margin">The Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> be as brief as our mater wil permit.</p>
               <p>That firſt <hi>particle</hi>

                  <hi>copulatively,</hi> as it connects the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with what precedes: and ſo it deſcribes to us a conſiderable <hi>Circumſtance,</hi> of this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, namely the <hi>Time</hi> of Chriſt's Lamentation over Jeruſalem; which was immediately after their ſolemne <hi>Acclamations</hi> of joy, and <hi>Hoſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's</hi> to him, as their <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it follows, <hi>When he was come near.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">When he was come near.</note> This gives us another great circumſtance of Chriſts Lamentation; and that is the <hi>place;</hi> which was the <hi>Mount of Olives;</hi> from whence Chriſt, being now in his deſcent, had a direct, and ful <hi>proſpect</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> offered to his eye; which, amidſt al the peoples joyous Salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo far pierced, and affected his heart, as it brake forth into this doleful Lamentation. It is natural to the ſpirit of a man to break forth into a paſſion of grief, at the approche, and view of any grievous and diſpleaſing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34711:11"/>
And that which makes this place the more remarquable is, that here it was that <hi>David,</hi> the Type of Chriſt, bewailed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of his ſon <hi>Abſolon;</hi> as 2 Sam. 15. 30. <hi>And David went up by the aſcent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>David,</hi> at every aſcent, poured out a quantitie of tears, in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the contumacie of his natural ſon <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolon;</hi> ſo Chriſt, the celeſtial <hi>David,</hi> at every deſcent, ſends forth many tears, in bewailing the <hi>contumacie</hi> of his <hi>federal</hi> ſons, of Jeruſalem. And that which yet further aggravates this circumſtance of place is, that (which Chriſt foreſaw) on this very mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> where Chriſt now laments the ſin and ruines of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> in their firſt ſiege againſt this Citie, began to pitch their tents, as <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> in his 6 Book of the <hi>Jewiſh war,</hi> Chap. 9. obſerves. So that wel might our bleſſed Lord make this place the ſeat of his Lamentation, which he foreſaw would be the firſt ſeat of their National ruine. But it follows:</p>

thereof. Certainly nothing ordinary came from Chriſt: his commun words, and actions were not ordinary: much leſſe may we conceive his tears, which ſo rarely dropt from him, to be of an ordinary tincture, and <hi>origine.</hi> No, they were the <hi>Tears of God,</hi> and therefore muſt have much of <hi>Divinitie</hi> in them, both as to their <hi>Riſe, Mater, End, Occaſion,</hi> &amp;c. They were <hi>wiſe, judicious Tears,</hi> not <hi>fooliſh,</hi> as ours uſually are: They were <hi>ſpontaneous</hi> and <hi>free,</hi> not forced, and ſtrained, as ours oft are: They were not <hi>ſullen</hi> and <hi>pettiſh</hi> tears, as ours; but <hi>meek,</hi> the tears of <hi>the Lamb of God:</hi> They were not <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> and private <hi>tears;</hi> but <hi>generous,</hi> and <hi>public,</hi> for National ſin, and miſerie. Theſe Tears were <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> not <hi>carnal; regular</hi> not <hi>inordinate:</hi> they had not ſo much of <hi>paſſion,</hi> as of <hi>compaſſion,</hi> and commiſeration in them: Our tender-hearted Lord ſeems to forget his own <hi>Paſſion,</hi> which was near, whiles his bowels rolled with <hi>Compaſſions,</hi> towards an impenitent ingrateful Citie. They are the tears, of an affectionate <hi>Phyſician,</hi> bleeding over the wounds of his ſelf-murdering Patient; of a gracious, generous Prince, bewailing the wilful Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his dying Subjects. In ſhort, theſe Tears are very <hi>Amorous, precious,</hi> and <hi>efficacious; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting</hi> weary and heavy-laden ſinners to accept of reſt; <hi>forewarning</hi> the obſtinate and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their danger; <hi>inſtructing</hi> the <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>weak</hi> in their dutie, of believing on him; <hi>encouraging</hi> the ſcrupulous and douting ſoul, to come unto him, and finally, <hi>interceding</hi> for ſuch as belonged to the Election of Grace,

moſt of them, with the reſt of their brethren, as thoſe in whom he fulwel ſaw (by the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient eye of his Divinitie) there was not any one dram of ſaving faith or love towards him.

               </p>
               <p>What is grief, but the <hi>emotion</hi> or rolling of the bowels at the preſence of ſome grievous object? and the nearer the object is to us, either by <hi>Natural, Civil,</hi> or, <hi>Religious</hi> bonds, the greater wil our grief be, at the approche thereof. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was allied to Chriſt by the moſt intimate, and eſſential bonds both of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and <hi>Religion:</hi> he was borne of a Jewiſh Womb, educated in the Jewiſh Land, the crowned King of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> which was a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Citie, allied to him by al manner of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Religious obligations; and therefore approching near it, his bowels melt and turne within him, to think, that this Citie, ſo near and dear unto him, ſhould not underſtand, or embrace <hi>the things that appertain to her peace;</hi> but on the contrarie, be at this very very time meditating and contriving his death, and her own ruine. But this wil come under further conſideration in what follows.</p>

O! what wonders of ſuperlative love, and condeſcendent pitie are here? Who would ever queſtion the affectionate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſuch a compaſſionate Redemer? How comes it to paſſe that the bleſſed Lord, ſhould borrow human eyes to behold and pitie ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and yet they want an eye of faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their Savior?

As ſin was the firſt evil, ſo alſo the <hi>firſt moral cauſe</hi> of al other evils: Now a bad cauſe is worſe than its effects: as a good cauſe is more noble, and perfect than its effects. It was Sin that opened the dore, and let in al other evils into the world, and therefore it muſt needs be the worſt evil. (3.) Sin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains

By which it is moſt evident, that ſin is in it ſelf the worſt evil and Hel.</p>
               <p>Hence it naturally follows, That the firſt great <hi>Object,</hi> or <hi>Mater</hi> of our bleſſed Lords La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, was <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s ſins; which were her <hi>worſt evil,</hi> and the main cauſe of al her other evils.

Great Unbelief brings great, and ſwift ruine to the moſt glorious Churches, if Repentance follow not. When Chriſt comes with Offers and Acts of Grace towards his Church, then for her to deſpiſe his word, turne her back on al his gracious offers, Yea, trample on them, this expoſeth the moſt flouriſhing Churches to <hi>ſudden,</hi> and <hi>inevitable</hi> Deſtruction.

               <p>Oh! what a world of miſerie hath Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief brought on many flouriſhing Churches? When a profeſſing people reject the Goſpel of Chriſt, is it not juſt with Chriſt to reject them? What a Hel of plagues, both ſpiritual and

temporal, doth a deſpiſed Goſpel bring on Profeſſors? how oft doth Chriſt cut off his own covenant-people from promiſſed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected mercies for their unbelief? what ſore jugements doth unbelief expoſe men unto? Whence ſprang that deluge of confuſion, and <hi>Barbariſme,</hi> which drowned the Eaſterne Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but from their contemt of the Goſpel?

But this wil be the ſubject of our following diſcourſe.</p>

This Temple is Gods reſting place for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132. 14. Wherefore we are moſt confident, that the faithful God, wil, for his own Temple ſake, conſerve our Countrie, and we his worſhipers.</q> Which ever way we take the words, it comes much to one; and clearly diſcovers to us the fond preſumtions, and fooliſh ſelf-flatteries of this people, grounded on their commun Church-privileges. And therefore this holy Prophet puts this their groundleſſe preſumtion, as a main ingredient into his Lamentations over the Ruines of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> So <hi>Lament.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Thy prophets have ſeen vain and fooliſh things for</hi>

That which we read, <hi>cauſes of Baniſhment,</hi> is in the original, <gap reason="foreign">

This the Prophet

ſadly laments. And was it not thus alſo in our bleſſed Lords days? Is not this one chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient of his Lamentation over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that, <hi>ſhe did not know, in that her day, the things which did belong unto her peace?</hi> What doth that import? Surely, in part, thus much; ſhe flattered herſelf into a fools paradiſe, of being <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and thence under the <hi>Meſſias</hi>'s Wing; and this her ſelf-flatterie was the greateſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle and bar to her cloſing with him, the true <hi>Savior,</hi> and alone foundation of her peace. Thus much alſo our Lord declares, <hi>John</hi> 8. 39, 44. where he endeavors, to beat them out of their fond preſumtion, and groundleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, of being <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed; whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they were, as he tels them, <hi>v.</hi> 44. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devil,</hi> and near to ruine. And certainly this is mater of ſad lamentation, to ſee perſons or churches, lift up to Heaven in their own preſumtuous conceits, and yet dropping down to Hel in realitie: ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent preſumtions, if not cured by <hi>medicinal Grace,</hi> bring inevitable ruine, to the moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Churches.

                  <hi>of my holy mountain.</hi> It ſeems there were a people who did much pride themſelves, and grew very haughtie, by reaſon of the holy Mountain, which was a viſible Symbol, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Gods preſence: ay, but God promiſeth, in evangelic days, to cure this <hi>tumor</hi> and <hi>Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie.</hi> As it is with ſingle perſons, ſo with whole Churches; there are ſome ſins of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, which God connives at, and wil paſſe over, upon a general Repentance; but this ſin of <hi>ſpiritual pride,</hi> is of ſuch a deep tincture, malignitie, and antipathie againſt God, as that, if it be not timely repented of, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from, 'twil prove the <hi>Gangrene,</hi> and bane of the moſt flouriſhing Churches. There is no ſin ſo oppoſite to our receiving Grace from Chriſt, as <hi>ſpiritual pride:</hi> Oh! What a burden is this to Chriſt, that they who <hi>are nothing, have nothing, can do nothing</hi> of themſelves, ſhould be proud of what they have received from him? As they who are moſt abaſed in themſelves, are moſt exalted by God, and neareſt to him; ſo they who moſt exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are moſt abaſed by, and eſtranged from God, Luke 18. 14. <hi>For every one that exalteth himſelf ſhal be abaſed: and he that humbleth himſelf ſhal be exalted.</hi> Pride, it is the cancer of parts, the moth of privileges, the ruſt of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, the poiſon of duties, the ſting of croſſes, the reproche of Profeſſors. None ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored, and enriched with grace and comfort by Chriſt, as humble ſouls, and Churches; but <hi>he reſiſteth the proud,</hi> Jam. 4. 6. and Pſal. 138. 6. <hi>God knoweth the proud afar off: i. e,</hi> God knows

him as an enemie, and loves not to come near him. God has an old grudge againſt ſpiritual pride, as one of his moſt ancient inveterate enemies, borne in Heaven, in the boſome of Angels, and therefore reſiſts it moſt.

The ſleeping Devil doth more miſchief in the Church of Chriſt, than the roaring Devil. To ſleep in Satans lap, is much worſe than to rore in <hi>Egypts,</hi> or <hi>Babylons</hi> furnace. While <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſleeps, her jugement ſleepeth not: her carnal ſecuritie determines in dreadful awakenings: How eaſily doth ſhe fal into the <hi>Romans</hi> hands; yea, into the fire of Divine wrath, while ſhe is aſleep in her ſin?

And may not, in like manner, ſmal tentations bring ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine to the moſt flouriſhing Churches, when aſleep, on the bed of carnal ſecuritie?

                  <hi>Ruine,</hi> we now procede to the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive</hi> cauſe thereof; which was chiefly the <hi>wrath</hi> of a ſin-revenging, jelous God. As ſin was the fuel, ſo Divine wrath was the fire which conſumed <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And this was another great, and moving object, which drew this ſad Lamentation from our gracious Lord. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was now in a proſperous, tranquil, or quiet ſtate: Oh! how beautiful and goodly was her Temple to the eyes of Beholders? Do not Chriſts Diſciples cry out, Mark 13. 1. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>

                  <hi>that ſhal not be thrown down.</hi> Our omniſcient Lord ſaw divine Wrath ſmoking againſt <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and this made him to weep over it, whiles others gloried in its beautie. Our poor ſhallow apprehenſions contemplate <hi>Cauſes</hi> in their <hi>Effects;</hi> but Chriſts omniſcient eye ſaw the <hi>Effect</hi> in its <hi>Cauſes;</hi> and therefore laments over it, as being actually preſent to him. And ah! What doleful mater of Lamentation is here; to ſee the dreadful fire of Divine wrath flame forth againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the place of Gods gracious Redſience? A ſpiritual heart can ſee al the plagues and curſes of Hel wrapt up in Divine wrath. A carnal heart can apprehend and feel the effects of Gods wrath, eſpecially ſuch as are more viſible and ſenſible; as the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <hi>Peſtilence, London</hi>'s prodigious <hi>Flames,</hi> or the like: Ay, but how few are there who take notice of that <hi>Divine wrath,</hi> which <hi>animateth</hi> and feedeth all thoſe National judgements? Where is that ſoul, or at leaſt how rare is he to be found, who laments the fiery indignation and wrath of God, which ſpirits al Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruines? But this was the poſture of our tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Saviors ſpirit: the great thing he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wails was the <hi>wrath</hi> of God, which hung, by a ſmal thread, over <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> This was the ſword which pierced his heart, and made his eyes guſh forth with tears.

Luke 19. 44. <hi>And ſhal lay thee even with the ground, and ſhal not leave in thee one ſtone upon another.</hi> This ſeems an <hi>hyperbolic</hi> expreſſion, denoting extreme deſtruction.

Such were the miſerble ruines of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> here foretold. And oh! what a ſad contemplation was this to our dear Lord? how did it make his heart to bleed, as his eye to weep. They who have ſeen <hi>London</hi> buried in its own aſhes, cannot but remember what a ſad ſpectacle this is. Ah! who would not lament at ſuch a ſight?</p>
               <p n="3">(3.)

Oh! what a bleeding contemplation <note place="margin">1. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawment of the means of Grace.</note> was it to our gracious Lord, to view that diſmal breach, which Divine wrath was about to make on <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> Church-ſtate? To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that now al the great things that did belong to her peace, were to be as a <hi>ſealed book, altogether hid from her eyes:</hi> ah! how doth this pierce, and wound the heart of her <hi>Meſſias?</hi> That ſhe, who had been dignified and adorned with ſuch rich marques of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favor, beyond al Nations in the world, ſhould now be diveſted and ſtript naked of al: what an heart-breaking was this to her graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord? Did not this conſideration fil <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> heart with ſad lamentations over old <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem?</hi> Lam. 1. 4. <hi>The ways of Sion do mourne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none do come to the ſolemn feaſts,</hi> &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The withdrawment, not only of the <note place="margin">2. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawment of gracious Influences.</note> 
                  <hi>means,</hi> and <hi>Symbols</hi> of Grace, but alſo of al gracious <hi>Influences</hi> from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> afforded further mater of ſore Lamentation unto her Lord. It is a dreadful curſe to want al ſpecial Means and Tokens of Grace: but yet, if in the want of theſe the Lord vouchſafeth his Grace to improve commun means of Grace,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34711:33"/>
or particular deprivements of ſpecial means, this is no ſmal divine Benediction: But, alas! our Lord foreſaw it would be quite otherwiſe with <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> ſhe was like to be deprived, not only of al ſpecial means of Grace; but alſo of Grace it ſelf, without which ſhe could not improve commun means, or her particular deprivements of ſpecial means: and, oh! how greatly doth this afflict her compaſſionate Lord? A Chriſtian, though he be ſometimes deprived of the means of Grace, yet the Lord gives him grace to improve thoſe very deprive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in order to his humiliation, ſpiritual povertie, hunger and thirſt after the means, and a more complete life of faith, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on Chriſt. And thus his deprivements of the means of Grace, become a means of Grace unto him: his want of Ordinances is, as ſanctified by Grace, a great Ordinance to him. Ay, but was it thus with <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> No; ſhe was not only to be deprived of al means, and Symbols of Grace; but alſo of Grace it ſelf, without which ſhe could not make any improvement of theſe withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or be humbled under them. This <hi>Paul</hi> ſadly laments, 2 Cor. 3. 14. <hi>For 'til this day remaineth the ſame veil untaken away, in the reading of the old Teſtament.</hi> He ſpeaks of the veil on the hearts of the unbelieving Jews.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Another ſpiritual jugement, which <note place="margin">3. <hi>A ſpirit of ſlumber.</hi>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34711:33"/>
So Rom. 11. 8. <hi>God hath given them the ſpirit of ſlumber.</hi> And this indeed was the curſe of Curſes; the Plague of Plagues; the Hel of Hels; which contains in it al manner of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual jugements; as being left to the plague of their own hearts, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 38. being given up to the enchantments of a bewitching world; having al commun mercies and providences curſed to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 9, 10. being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up to Satan, <hi>the god of this world,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But of theſe in their proper place.</p>

What an admirable, yea infinite Perfection doth this give to theſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34711:34"/>
Tears, that they flow from the <hi>Divinitie?</hi> What! doth the Son of God, who is eternally bleſſed, in the beatific <hi>Viſion</hi> and <hi>Fruition</hi> of his own Glorie, drop tears; and that over an ingrateful, contumacious, rebellious Citie? Oh! Who could ever have imagined, that this could be, had we not <hi>ocular</hi> and <hi>evident</hi> demonſtration thereof? Surely theſe Tears muſt be no vulgar, commun tears, which have ſo much of the Divinitie in them. Oh! What precious tears were theſe, that dropt from God-man? What ſweet and delicious wine were theſe tears to the Angels that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Theſe tears of the Son of God were <note place="margin">2. Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</note>

                  <note place="margin">3. Sponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and free.</note> or voluntary and free; not <hi>forced,</hi> and ſtrained, as ours frequently are. Oh! how naturally did this <hi>holy water</hi> flow from that ſacred fountain, Chriſt's eyes? What
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34711:34"/>
bleedings of heart, what inward compaſſions were the main ſpring of this ſacred paſſion, vented by his eyes? Chriſts tears had a divine Fountain in the heart, by which they were fed and maintained: they were as the ſweat of an anguiſhed, troubled ſpirit; as the bloud of an heart lively ſtruck with the ſenſe of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalems</hi> coming miſerie.</p>

how many great Profeſſors make themſelves guilty of National, or other-mens ſins, by not lamenting over them?

Yea, may not the great want of Mourning, and Humiliation for other mens ſins, give too many great Profeſſors cauſe to ſuſpect, that they never truely mourned, or were humbled for their own ſins? For he that mournes for his own ſins as he ought, mourns chiefly for the diſhonor that comes to God thereby: Now if this be the <hi>principal Motive</hi> of our mourning for ſin, then we ſhal mourn for the diſhonor that comes to God by other mens ſins, as wel as by our own. But the <hi>bottome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſon</hi> why ſome Profeſſors mourne for their own ſins, and not for other mens ſins, is <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love:</hi> they think their own ſins wil draw juge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on themſelves, and therefore they mourne for them, thereby to avert Gods wrath from themſelves: Whereas true godly ſorrow is chiefly afflicted for the offence given to God: It is grieved, not ſo much becauſe ſelf, as becauſe Chriſt is grieved.

in its womb: As his <hi>Promiſſes,</hi> ſo his <hi>Threats</hi> are omnipotent: and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> found, by dreadful experience, this Threat fulfilled to a Tittle. Yea, to this very day ſhe lies under the dreadful arreſt of this Threat. The <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces,</hi> and Threats of men, even of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of men, are oft but ſmoke and wind: they threaten and ſtorme much; ſpeak big words; but alas! how little can they do?

                  <hi>Chriſt is very real, ſerious, and pathetic in al his offers of Grace unto ſinners.</hi> Every word of the Goſpel is but a chariot, that conveighs Chriſts heart to Sinners: If ever he be in good earneſt, it is in his evangelic Invitations. His Bowels are never more warme, and rolling; his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections never more bleeding, than in inviting and drawing Sinners to himſelf.

What ſacred, and ſweet Importunitie did he uſe, to perſuade, and prevail upon her, in that her day, to accept of the things that did belong unto her peace? But alas! ſhe would not; ſhe rejects al his gracious offers, 'til at laſt her day was expired. And oh! how much doth this aggravate her ſin?

The Sin-revenging God is nothing but wrath, and everlaſting burnings out of Chriſt. But he that hath Chriſt, hath peace with God, and with al the creation beſides. Nothing can

hurt him, who is under the wing of Chriſt, the Prince of peace. Al peace of conſcience, which is collected either from holy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or from evangelic <hi>Promiſſes,</hi> or from the ſenſe of Gods love, or any other way, is al reſolved into Chriſt, as the proper ſource, and ſpring thereof.

ſhe voluntarily inflicts on herſelf? She wil not ſee the things that belong unto her peace; and therefore ſaith Chriſt, ſhe ſhal not ſee them, they ſhal be <hi>hid</hi> from her eyes.

               <p>For the more ful Reſolution of this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we ſhal conſider Unbelief (1.) with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to its <hi>Object.</hi> (2.) In regard to its <hi>Act.</hi> 1. The <hi>Object</hi> of Unbelief is here expreſſed, <note place="margin">What the things that belong to our peace are.</note> under this comprehenſive notion, <hi>The things that belong unto thy peace:</hi> Theſe are (as we before intimated) either (1.) <hi>Complexe</hi> and <hi>Notional:</hi> or (2.) <hi>Simple</hi> and <hi>Real.</hi> The <hi>Complexe,</hi> or <hi>Notional Things that belong unto our peace,</hi> are al thoſe divine <hi>Axiomes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes, Canons,</hi> or <hi>Notions,</hi> loged in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, which any way conduce to our peace.

               <p>Firſt, we ſhal begin with the <hi>Notional, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, General things that belong unto our peace,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The firſt part of Unbelief in reſpect</note> of its object, is, <hi>Not to aſsent to the Word of God.</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:34711:60"/>
which are the <hi>ſacred Scriptures,</hi> or Word of God in the <hi>General;</hi> which <hi>not to know,</hi> or, <hi>truely aſſent</hi> unto, is the original, and no ſmal part of <hi>

The Scriptures are the <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> the Glaſſe wherein his glorious perfections ſhine: neither can there the leaſt ray of true Religion ſhine on lapſed man, but what is reflected from this celeſtial <hi>Miroir</hi> of the Divine wil. The <hi>Splendor</hi> of Divine Majeſtie is but as an inexplicable <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth,</hi> unleſſe we are conducted thereinto by this thread of ſacred Scriptures. God is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34711:61"/>
nothing to us, but what he teſtifies of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>God is nothing,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tyndal, but his Law and his promiſſes,</hi> i. e, <hi>That which he bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thee to do, and believe, and hope; and to imagine any other thing of God, is groſſe, and damnable Idolatrie.</hi> The Sacred Word is the <hi>Spirits Schole,</hi> in which he teacheth al the things that belong to our peace: ſo that we may be contentedly ignorant of what is not here taught.</p>
               <p>Hence it is apparent, that one main, and fundamental part of Unbelief conſiſts in not yielding a <hi>real, firme, diſtinct, certain, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate, deep,</hi> and <hi>practic Aſſent</hi> to the ſacred Scriptures. And oh! what an <hi>Epidemic,</hi> Univerſal ſin is this, even in the profeſſing world? How many are there, among the croud of knowing Profeſſors, who never gave an <hi>explicite, actual, chearful, ſpiritual,</hi> and <hi>ſtedfaſt</hi> Aſſent to the Word of God, and its ſacred Autoritie? Are not the moſt of Profeſſors extreme partial in their credence, or belief, of the divine Scriptures? Do not they pick and chooſe, what may correſpend moſt with their <hi>Luſts,</hi> or <hi>carnal Intereſts?</hi> This word that pleaſeth them they can believe, but that word which diſguſts them they cannot aſſent unto: Do not many, in their proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie disbelieve the <hi>Threats,</hi> and in their <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie</hi> the Promiſſes? And what is this, but not to know the things that belong to their peace? For he that doth disbelieve any one part of Scripture, may he not be juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to disbelieve the whole? Is not the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34711:61"/>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Autoritie</hi> of a part, the ſame with the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Autoritie</hi> of the whole word? Wherefore, doth not he who rejects a part, alſo reject the Autoritie of the whole? Its true, al Scriptures are not alike <hi>Fundamental,</hi> or equally neceſſary to ſalvation; yet may we not juſtly conclude, that al are equally neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be believed, if we conſider their <hi>origine</hi> and <hi>Autoritie;</hi> as they are al inſpired by the Spirit of God, and clothed with <hi>Indelible Characters</hi> of Divine Majeſtie? O then! how many knowing Profeſſors are in this point guiltie, of not knowing the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to their peace? How few are there that yield a <hi>rooted,</hi> welgrounded, <hi>operative</hi> Aſſent to the whole Word of God; who have an ear to hear, <hi>wherever,</hi> and <hi>whenever</hi> God hath a mouth to ſpeak? O that Profeſſors would ſeriouſly ruminate on this, <hi>That ſo far as they disbelieve the Truth, Certaintie, and Autoritie of any one word of God; ſo far they disbelieve, or know not the things that belong to their peace.</hi> And whence is it, that many Profeſſors are ſo averſe from aſſenting to the whole Word of God? Is it not from the prevalence of ſome luſt in their hearts, which turnes them ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly another way? They disbelieve ſome Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and why? Is it not becauſe they lie not level with their luſts? Oh! what a deep <hi>Myſterie of Iniquitie</hi> is this disbelief of the Scriptures, as loged in ſome carnal hearts?

and weaken mens Aſſent to the ſacred Scriptures? And doth he not hereby create, in many ſincere Believers, much unbelief, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the things that belong to their peace?

The <hi>Promiſſes</hi> of the Goſpel are the <hi>Element</hi> in which Faith <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>moves:</hi> they are the <hi>Air,</hi> which Faith ſucks in, and breaths forth: they are the food, on which Faith ſeeds. There is no diet ſo <hi>natural,</hi> ſo <hi>delicious,</hi> ſo <hi>reſtaurative,</hi> ſo <hi>corroborative,</hi> or <hi>ſtrengthening,</hi> ſo <hi>nutritive,</hi> ſo <hi>ſatisfying</hi> as the promiſſes <hi>ſpirited</hi> by Free Grace: Faith
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34711:62"/>
reliſheth no food like this. Faith never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth herſelf ſo ſecurely, never ſleeps ſo ſweetly, as when ſhe doth lean her head on the boſome of ſome promiſſe: If ſhe hath but a promiſſe to caſt Anchor on, ſhe can ride con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently in the greateſt ſtormes; and laugh at al the proud waves, that beat againſt her. Now this being the temper and ſpirit of Faith, hence it neceſſarily follows, That not to aſſent to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and the <hi>Promiſſes</hi> which lie wrapt up therein, takes in much of the <hi>vital ſpirit</hi> of Unbelief. This wil be more evident if we conſider, the chief <hi>material</hi> parts of the Covenant of Grace, and the evil aſpect which Unbelief caſts thereon.</p>
               <p>The Covenant of Grace contains in it; <note place="margin">The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace contains.</note> (1.) <hi>Maters of Grace.</hi> (2.) <hi>Maters of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> (3.) <hi>Maters of coming Glorie:</hi> Now in al theſe regards Unbelief may be ſaid, <hi>Not to know the things that bolong to our peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Covenant of Grace contains in it <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Maters of Grace.</note> 
                  <hi>of Grace.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> tels us what we are by Nature; but the <hi>Goſpel</hi> tels us what we are, or may be by Grace: The Law diſcovers to us our ſin and miſerie, but the Goſpel diſcovers our remedie; and ſo opens a dore to Faith: Yea, the Goſpel doth not only declare to us the <hi>Objects</hi> and <hi>Maters</hi> we are to believe, but alſo furniſheth us with many gracious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, and <hi>incentives</hi> to believe: yea further, the Goſpel doth not only afford us <hi>maters</hi> and <hi>motives</hi> of Faith; but alſo it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a ſanctified Inſtrument in the hand of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34711:63"/>
the Spirit to conveigh Faith, and al other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to us. For it is an infallible Maxime in Theologie, that <hi>Evangelic</hi> Promiſſes of Grace, on ſuch, or ſuch conditions, without Grace to performe thoſe conditions, are as little avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to beget faith, as the law is. Thus we ſee how ful of gracious <hi>Maters, Motives,</hi> and <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers</hi> the Covenant of Grace is. But yet the more fully to <hi>anatomiſe</hi> the Bowels of Unbelief, as to <hi>Maters of Grace</hi> offered in the Covenant, we ſhal a little, though but curſorily, touch on thoſe offers of Grace, which the Covenant makes, with their <hi>Proprieties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The offers of Grace made in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, <note place="margin">Unbelief queſtions the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the offers of Grace.</note> or Covenant of Grace, are very <hi>Real,</hi> and <hi>Cordial:</hi> There is never a line, no nor a word of the Goſpel, but it carries Chriſts heart wrapt up in it: Every promiſſe is a <hi>love-letter</hi> ſent by Chriſt, to aſſure the ſinner, how affectionate his heart is ſet towards him: There is not an expreſſion that drops from the mouth of Chriſt, but is ful of bleeding Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Every promiſſe gives the ſinner a good Law-right to Grace, provided that he accept of it when offered: If Chriſt be <hi>real</hi> in any thing, he is ſo in the offers of Grace to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. But now Unbelief looks on al theſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of Grace, as mere <hi>Romances, Fables,</hi> or fine-ſpun ſtories. This was the caſe of the unbelieving Jews, as <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, Rom. 10. 15. <hi>How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Goſpel of peace, and bring</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 10, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>glad tidings of good things!</hi> Oh! what good News is here? who would not chearfully aſſent
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34711:63"/>
to ſuch glad tidings of peace? Is there any ſo ſotiſh, as to refuſe ſuch good things? Yes, addes <hi>Paul,</hi> v. 16. <hi>But they have not al obeyed the Goſpel: For Eſaias ſaith, Lord who hath believed our report?</hi> As if he had ſaid: <q>True, we preach the great truths of Goſpel-peace unto ſinners; but alas! how few have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, or aſſented to the truth of the Goſpel? Do not the moſt of men look on theſe things as too good news to be true? Where is the man, that really aſſents to the <hi>Realitie</hi> of theſe Glad-tidings? May we not then juſtly crie out with <hi>Eſaias, Who hath believed our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port?</hi>
                  </q> Thus Unbelief cals in queſtion the <hi>Realitie</hi> of Evangelic offers of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The offers of Grace in the Goſpel are <note place="margin">Unbelief queſtions the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Covenant.</note> very <hi>Gratuitous</hi> and <hi>Free:</hi> and this draws on Faith freely to cloſe therewith: For faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>federal Inſtrument</hi> influenced, and acted by the Covenant, the more it apprehends the freedome of the Covenant, the more freely it wil embrace the ſame. Now the Covenant inſtructs Faith fully in this point: It teacheth us, that the Grace of the Covenant expects no foundation in us, no <hi>Condignitie,</hi> no <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruitie,</hi> no <hi>moral Capacitie,</hi> or <hi>Condition</hi> in us, but what itſelf intends to confer. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant informes us, that Free-grace is moved by nothing without it ſelf; that it gives, becauſe it wil give, or becauſe it hath given: That the <hi>poorer</hi> we are, the more willing he is to inrich us; the <hi>nakeder</hi> we are, the more ready Chriſt is to clothe us: Yea, the Covenant aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, that Chriſt intends much good for
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:34711:64"/>
them, who intend no good to him, nor yet to themſelves; yea, to ſuch as intend evil to him, and to their own ſouls, even for <hi>ſuch rebellious ſouls</hi> he intends gifts and Grace, as Pſal. 68. 18. <hi>Thou haſt received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious alſo, that the Lord God might dwel among them.</hi> Now this freedome of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the Grace of God offered therein, gives a mighty foundation, and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to build upon: For the great obſtacle and bar to Faith is this, <hi>that we are not fit for Chriſt:</hi> This is one of Unbeliefs greateſt pleas, againſt cloſing with the good things of the Covenant: What? may poor <hi>I</hi> preſume to believe? <hi>I,</hi> who am ſo unworthy? <hi>I,</hi> who have ſo long ſpurned at Chriſt, and al the things that belong to my peace? <hi>I,</hi> who have ſo oft broken with Chriſt, plaid faſt and looſe with him? What? may <hi>I</hi> preſume, that Chriſt wil have any regard to me; <hi>poor,</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, backſliding, rebellious me? Oh! how can this be? What a preſumtion would it be in me, to caſt an eye towards Chriſt, and the good things that belong unto my peace? Thus Unbelief <hi>oppoſeth,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>demurs</hi> at the freedome of the Covenant and its Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Another proprietie of the Covenant is <note place="margin">Unbelief ſtrikes at the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſalitie of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants offers.</note> the <hi>

It ſets no bars or rails
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:34711:64"/>
about the throne of Grace? but gives free Admiſſion to al, that wil come for mercie, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. The Covenant excludes none, but ſuch as exclude themſelves by Unbelief: and why ſhould ſinners exclude themſelves, before God excludes them? But alas! this is the <hi>il-humor</hi> of Unbelief, becauſe it cannot ſee the ſinners Name in particular written on the Covenant, therefore it queſtions al the grounds of Faith. Oh! ſaith the unbelieving ſinner, here are rich offers indeed; but, alas! I, what am I the better for al this? May ſuch a wretch as I come to Chriſt, to be embraced in his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred armes? What? I, who am in ſuch a naſtie pickle; ſo polluted with ſin? Oh! I may not, I cannot believe that ſuch an hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſinner as I, ſhal find Chriſts armes open to receive me. Thus Unbelief queſtions the <hi>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſalitie</hi> of Chriſts offer, and puts a bar to its own mercies; whereas the Goſpel puts none; but ſaies, <hi>John</hi> 7. 37. <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come to me and drink,</hi> and Rev. 22. 17. <hi>Whoever wil,</hi> &amp;c. There lies no <hi>Reſtriction,</hi> or bar on the Covenants part: al the <hi>Reſtriction</hi> and bar is in mens wils. Wilful Unbelief is the only bar.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Unbelief ſets limits to the <hi>Plenitude</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Unbelief limits the Riches of Grace.</note> and <hi>Richeſſe</hi> of Grace, held forth in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. We find the <hi>Richeſſe</hi> of Grace in the Covenant expreſſed under the <hi>Symbol</hi> of a ſumtuous feaſt, Mat. 22. 4. <hi>Tel them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed; and althings are ready: come unto the mariage.</hi> Here we ſee
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34711:65"/>
what a bountiful Lord ſinners have to deal with: how much his infinite Grace excedes al our ſins. Now what reception is given to ſuch a magnificent rich Treat? That follows v. 5. <hi>But they made light of it, and went their way, one to his farme, and another to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe,</hi> &amp;c. Oh! what monſtrous unbelief, and ingratitude is here? O! what infinite Treaſures of Grace are there wrapt up in the Covenant? How much do thoſe Treaſures of mercie and goodneſſe, loged in the heart of Chriſt, excede al the treaſures of ſin, loged in the hearts of poor ſinful <hi>we?</hi> Is Chriſt ſuch a liberal Savior for ſinners? And ſhal they be aſhamed, or afraid to beg at the dore of ſuch a liberal Savior? Was not this the very end why God gave the Law, That Sin might appear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding ſinful; to the intent that Grace might appear exceding gracious, Ro. 7. 13? So Ro. 5. 20. <hi>Moreover the Law entred, that the offence might</hi>

                  <hi>abound.</hi> As if he had ſaid: This is the very reaſon, why God delivered the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> in ſuch a terrible manner, that ſo thereby men might behold, as by a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Glaſſe, the proper <hi>Dimenſions,</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> of their ſins: Ay, but what was Gods end in making Sin thus to abound? why, that follows, <hi>But when ſin abounded, Grace did much more abound:</hi> Here ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> lay Gods bottome-deſigne, in permitting ſin thus to <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,</hi> that thereby Grace might <hi>ſuperabound;</hi> yea, that at that very time, when ſin ſo much abounded, Grace might ſuperabound; at that very time, when we appeared to be ſo great

Thus Mercie in God is more <hi>merciful,</hi> than ſin in us can be <hi>ſinful.</hi> And oh! what a foundation and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for faith is here?

Men are ready to confide in thoſe who are ſufficient and faithful; ſpecially if they have their Bond: But yet Unbelievers dare not truſt the Faithful, Alſufficient God, albeit they have his Bond, or Covenant, and that confirmed by oath.

And the reaſon is moſt evident, even from the commun nature of al Aſſent; which requires ſome A'dequation or Agreament betwixt the Object, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie: Now what proportion is there betwixt a natural mind, and ſupernatural Truths.? Are not Divine Myſteries above the reach of a human Underſtanding, unleſſe the Spirit of God come and clothe it with a divine Light?

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to any perſon, makes us very credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, or apt to receive his report: Love makes our Aſſent quick and chearful: it puts the beſt interpretation upon whatever is ſpoken: and if there be but an <hi>half-promiſſe,</hi> or a word hinted, that may be for encouragement, the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34711:79"/>
lover is apt to applie it to himſelf, and improve it. Thus every word of God is an infallible oracle, to ſuch as have a pious affection for him. Thus <hi>David</hi> deſcribes his faith, by his delight in the ſtatutes of God, Pſal. 119. 16. <hi>I wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light my ſelf in thy ſtatutes.</hi> The original im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 16.</note>

If the Law be ſo delightful to a Believer, becauſe he ſees therein, as in a Glaſſe, al the ſpots of his ſoul; Oh! how delightſome then is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to him, which diſcovers the face of God, and Chriſt to him; yea, and transformes his heart into the ſame glorious Image? Hence it appears, that if our Aſſent to the Reports of the Goſpel be not <hi>affectionate</hi> and <hi>chearful,</hi> it is not ſaving. The Devils <hi>believe and tremble;</hi> but becauſe they do not gladly aſſent, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their faith is not ſaving. So eſſential is an affectionate inclination to divine Aſſent. Whence it naturally follows, that ſuch as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford only a forced <hi>aſſent</hi> to evangelic Truths, do really <hi>diſſent</hi> from them: ſuch an intimate connexion is there between <hi>Divine Aſſent,</hi> and pious <hi>Affection.</hi>

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:34711:86"/>
They are unwilling to grant what they can hardly denie. This Chriſt cals being ſlow of heart to believe, Luke 24. 25. <hi>O fools and ſlow of heart to believe al that the Prophets have ſpoken.</hi> This is the firſt part of faith in the wil, to juſtifie, recogniſe, or approve that Aſſent which is wrought in the jugement touching Chriſt: And when Chriſt has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Wils approbation and conſent, he ſoon gains its affiance, or confidence. As a carnal heart, that approves of the offers of ſin, is ſoon overcome by it: So an awakened heart, when once it comes to approve the offers of Chriſt, and the Aſſent made thereto by the mind, how ſoon is it induced to yield its conſent to Chriſt? But oh! here lies the root of Unbelief, the wil doth not fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and allow, of what the mind is oft forced to aſſent unto.

Again ver. 61. <hi>And another alſo ſaid, Lord, I wil follow thee: but let me firſt go bid them farewel, which are at home at my houſe.</hi> Thus awakened ſinners put off Chriſt, as <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> did <hi>Paul,</hi> with delays: If Chriſt wil but wait a while their leiſure, wel and good; they are then content to eſpouſe him for their Lord: but at preſent, they have no leiſure, becauſe they have no heart, to cloſe with Chriſt. Yea, is there not much of this <hi>dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie humor</hi> in many wounded ſouls, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit they are not yet humbled enough, and therefore not meet to go to Chriſt? Whereas indeed there is no ſuch way to get an humble ſpirit, as to come to Chriſt for it. Certainly, al ſuch delays argue much unwillingnes to believe: A <hi>Wil</hi> for hereafter only, is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Nil:</hi> An election for the <hi>future,</hi> is no better than a preſent <hi>Reprobation:</hi> If you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent only for <hi>hereafter,</hi> you at <hi>preſent</hi> reject Chriſt. So long as you defer to do, what you know you ought to do, ſo long you wil not do it. Yea, what are theſe delays to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Chriſt, but a more ſlie rejection of him? May not Chriſt juſtly eſtime your delay to embrace him, a refuſal of him? Are not ſuch <hi>put offs</hi> a kind of denial? When Chriſt wooes thee long, by many ſweet <hi>Inſpirations,</hi> both of <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> for thee to ſtifle al theſe good motions, by continued delayes, doth not this argue a mightie unwilling heart to believe?

believing, receive Grace for Grace? Is not Grace both in <hi>being,</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> the effect of Faith in Chriſt? Do not thy ſins greaten much by delays to believe? Are not thy debts to Juſtice multiplied by not believing? The longer thou forbeareſt to believe, wil not thy heart be the more averſe, and backward to believe? Peradventure thou conceiteſt Chriſt wil not receive thee, if thou comeſt to him: ay, but whence ſprings this prejudicate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, but from the unwillingnes of thine own heart to receive Chriſt? Has not Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf to be more willing to receive thee, than thou canſt be to come unto him; as 'tis evident from the Parable of the <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> Luke 16. 22-28? Are not al thine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt believing preſently, but the <hi>forgeries,</hi> and <hi>figments</hi> of thine unwilling heart? Remember, there is as great hazard in thy loitering delays, as in down-right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of Chriſt: For, albeit thy delays may be painted over with ſome apparent colours of humilitie, and fears leſt thy faith would be <hi>preſumtion,</hi> yet Chriſt is as effectually oppoſed, and excluded thereby, as by manifeſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.

Surely this, albeit it be good in its kind, yet 'tis but a <hi>commun Motive,</hi> and therefore no firme Foundation for the reception of Chriſt. He that wil receive Chriſt as he ought, muſt take him, not only to eaſe conſcience of the burden of guilt, but alſo to eaſe his heart of the Burden of luſt.

Chriſt, al our faith is but mere fancie. So many degrees as we have of a bended wil to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt; ſo many degrees we have of ſaving Faith.

And herein therefore lies the Soveraintie of effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Grace, in bending the Wil, to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with Chriſt: Til the bent of the Wil be purged from Idols, and opened to Chriſt, he never enters into, or inhabits any ſoul.

So that they who give not Chriſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Bent of their Wil, give him not that place which is due unto him; and therefore ſuch may not expect his companie. May it be imagined that the Lord of Glorie wil take up his logement in that ſoul, where baſe naſty luſts have the ſame, or better room than he? Is this, even among men, counted good Reception, to entertain a perſon of honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition, in ſome out-loge, or in the ſame place with the Swine? And do not a world of great Profeſſors thus receive Chriſt? How many are there, who loge Chriſt only in ſome out-Affections; in ſome faint, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Deſires? or, if ſome others are more civil to him, and afford him ſome room in their more inward Affections; yet is he not ſtil loged with the ſwine? have not ſome baſe luſts as good, if not a better room in the heart

than Chriſt? Surely this is not to receive Chriſt: He that has not a ſtronger wil for Chriſt than for ſin, is really unwilling for Chriſt, but willing for ſin. If the heart be bent for luſt, it is unbent for Chriſt: He that is only in a faint meſure willing to receive Chriſt, is <hi>habitually</hi> unwilling: ſuch as are not prevalently reſolved for Chriſt, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valently reſolved for ſin; and ſo <hi>conſequently,</hi> and <hi>virtually</hi> unreſolved for Chriſt.

And oh! how many terrified ſouls do, with ſuch an involuntarie, forced Wil, receive Chriſt? They ſee no beautie, or worth in Chriſt; only they make uſe of him to ſerve a turne, to quench the flames of Divine wrath in conſcience; and when that is done they lay him aſide again, as an uſeleſſe ſervant: What is ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing choice of Chriſt, but a more courtly rejection of him?

extremities, and perplexities of conſcience, with ſuch an involuntary Wil, how ſoon do they lay him aſide, when the ſtorme is over? Was not this the very caſe of the unbelieving Jews, even from their infant-ſtate in the Wildernes? So Pſal. 78. 34. <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him, and they returned,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 68. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>and inquired early after God.</hi> When God awakened their conſciences, by terrible juge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; Oh! how early do they inquire after their <hi>Meſſias?</hi> what chearful Reception do they ſeem to give unto him? Ay, but this was but a terrified, affrightned wil; they did but flatter him with good words: their heart was not right, as it follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 36, 37. A <hi>forced wil,</hi> is but a falſe <hi>lying</hi> wil; it is no <hi>real Wil,</hi> but <hi>Nil.</hi> When there is nothing on the Wil but mere <hi>compulſive</hi> terrors, it never gives a fiducial reception to Chriſt: Til the wil be in faith, it's never ſaving. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of ſin, <hi>ſeconded</hi> by legal Terrors, may compel ſome to believe; but if there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not a <hi>Spirit of Adoption</hi> and libertie, that faith proves only <hi>legal,</hi> and <hi>temporary.</hi> We find a good character of evangelic faith in <hi>Zacheus</hi>'s reception of Chriſt, Luke 19. 6. <note place="margin">Luk. 19. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>And he made haſte, and came down, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him joyfully:</hi> His wil was in his faith: he received Chriſt, and would not for a world, but receive him: He believed, and would not but believe: His heart was in the work: it was his joy and delight to entertain Chriſt, not only in his houſe, but in his heart alſo. But is it thus with al that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:34711:96"/>
to receive Chriſt? Are there not many who receive Chriſt, under <hi>dolors</hi> and rackings of conſcience, who yet have no liking to him; yea, who would gladly ſhift themſelves of him, were their troubles of conſcience once wel over? Do not the hearts of ſuch ſecretly draw back from Chriſt; yea entertain an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate, old grudge againſt him, while they ſeem willing to draw near to him, and make uſe of him in their extremitie? Have not ſuch ſoon enough of Chriſt? are they not ſoon weary of him, and therefore turne him off again, aſſoon as he hath ſerved their turne? Do they not ſecretly wiſh that they might be ſaved by their own doings, rather than by believing in Chriſt? Its true, they, in a ſort, receive Chriſt; but how is it? Is it not as a wounded captive receives his enemie with fair words, to ſave his life; whiles yet he hates him in his heart, and is grieved, that he ſhould need his enemies favor? Surely this is not to receive Chriſt gladly: For to ſuch it is a burden to be beholding to Chriſt for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: They had rather be ſaved any other way than by Chriſt: Oh how glad would they be, if God would but accept of their own goods works, inſtead of Chriſts merits: whereas a true Believer would to chooſe, be ſaved by Chriſts merits, rather than by his own: he is abundantly ſatisfied in Chriſt, and the way of Salvation by him: his wil doth electively hug and embrace Chriſt, as his beſt friend. Thus <hi>Zacheus received Chriſt joyfully.</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:34711:96"/>
Its true, many ſincere Believers, at firſt, whiles under a <hi>Spirit of Bondage,</hi> have only a <hi>terrified, affrightned</hi> wil: yea, after they have received a <hi>Spirit of Adoption,</hi> and Chriſt, by ſaving Faith, how much of an <hi>unwilling heart</hi> do they find mixed with their faith? What <hi>legal, ſelfiſh</hi> regards have they oft towards Chriſt? Ay, but this is the <hi>diſtemper,</hi> and therefore the <hi>burden</hi> of their ſouls: They are never better pleaſed, than when their wils are moſt <hi>chearful, ſpiritual,</hi> and <hi>forward</hi> in cloſing with Chriſt: How greatly do they approve of, and delight in the way of ſalvation by Chriſt? What contentement, and pleaſure do they take in believing? How much rather had they have their Grace, peace, and comfort in Chriſts keeping, than in their own? But is it thus with Unbelievers, ſuch as receive Chriſt only with a <hi>terrified, legal Wil?</hi> Is it not a burden to them, that they ſhould be driven to ſuch ſtreights, as that none but Chriſt can relieve them? Is there not a ſecret diſpleaſure, and diſlike againſt Chriſt, even while they are forced, by reaſon of their extremities, to make uſe of him? Would they not be glad to be eaſed of Chriſt, were their conſciences eaſed of their trouble? Such is the temper of a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified wil.

                  <hi>they ſtick together, that they cannot be ſundred.</hi> Such ought to be the <hi>inviolable</hi> adherence of the ſoul to Chriſt. So Act. 11. 23. <hi>Barnabas</hi> exhorts them, <hi>with ful purpoſe of heart to cleave unto the Lord.</hi> Faith is a mighty <hi>adheſive</hi> and <hi>tenacious</hi> Grace: it adheres to Chriſt as the <hi>Needle</hi> to the <hi>Loadſtone:</hi> yea, it follows hard after Chriſt, though he may ſeem to run from the ſoul; yea, to turne againſt it as an enemie. Thus <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 8. <hi>My ſoul followeth hard after thee.</hi> Chriſt had deſerted him, but <note place="margin">Pſal 63. 8.</note> he could not deſert, or leave Chriſt: his ſoul cleaves faſt to Chriſt, albeit Chriſt ſeems to ſhake off his ſoul: for ſo <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> ſignifies; and ſo it is rendred by ſome, <hi>My ſoul adheres to thee.</hi> Such is the temper of Faith. But now Unbelief is alwaies drawing back from Chriſt: Though it may, under a ſtorme, ſhelter it ſelf under Chriſts wing, and give him ſome forced reception; yet it ſoon has enough of Chriſt; and therefore cares not how ſoon it be rid of him, when its turne is ſerved. This backſliding temper of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is wel expreſſed, Hebr. 3. 12. <hi>Take heed,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb, 3. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>brethren, leſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</hi> An unbelieving heart is a backſliding heart: Unbelief is one of the greateſt cowards in the world: every ſhadow of danger makes it draw back from Chriſt. Whereas true faith is ful of Maſculine, undaunted courage: it can follow Chriſt through a ſea of bloud:
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:34711:98"/>
yea, it dares not let go its confidence in Chriſt, though he ſeem to ſhake the ſoul over the flames of Hel, or drag it through the lake of fire. The weakeſt believer, at his greateſt ſtraits, keeps his <hi>Reverſion</hi> of Chriſt: Though Chriſts Divine <hi>Suavities,</hi> and ſpiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations forſake him, yet he doth not <hi>totally</hi> forſake Chriſt, nor yet his dutie: He may fal into ſin, and fal backward unto backſliding, yet he dares not lie in his <hi>fals:</hi> His ſoul is rooted in Chriſt, and the Covenant; and therefore never dies: The ſpirit of Chriſt abides in him, and that cauſeth him to abide in Chriſt, <hi>radically,</hi> and <hi>habitually,</hi> even under the moſt ſevere Winter of Tentation. So it <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 14.</note> followes ver. 14. <hi>For we are made partakers of Chriſt, if we hold the beginning of our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſtedfaſt unto the end.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, rendred here <hi>Confidence,</hi> ſignifies, in its primary notion, a firme <hi>baſis,</hi> or <hi>foundation;</hi> a <hi>ſubſiſtence,</hi> and <hi>ſubſtance.</hi> Faith gives a firme <hi>foundation, ſubſiſtence,</hi> and <hi>ſtabilitie</hi> to the ſoul; ſo that it keeps ſtedfaſt in adhering unto Chriſt, even in the moſt unſtedfaſt times. But now Unbelief has no <hi>foundation,</hi> and therefore no <hi>ſubſiſtence:</hi> It is ſtable in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Inſtabilitie. Oh! how fluctuating, ſtaggering, unſtedfaſt is the unbelieving heart, even in the moſt ſtedfaſt times? How apt is it to draw back from Chriſt, on the leaſt apparence of difficultie? Unbelievers do, as the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> 2 Sam. 5. 21. forſake their <hi>God,</hi> when their God forſakes them. And this drawing back is ſo eſſential, and natural
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:34711:98"/>
to Unbelief, as that they are reciprocally uſed one for the other. So Heb. 10. 38. <hi>Now the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 38, 39.</note> 
                  <hi>juſt ſhal live by faith: but if any man draw back,</hi> i. e, believes not in, or adheres not to me. Thus again ver. 39. <hi>But we are not of them that draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe, to the ſaving of the ſoul.</hi> Where <hi>drawing back</hi> is oppoſed to believing, and ſo expreſſive of Unbelief, its moſt natural <hi>genius</hi> and diſpoſition; which is to <hi>draw back</hi> from Chriſt. Now this <hi>drawing back</hi> of Unbelief has a double Object; (1.) God in Chriſt, the ſupreme end, and object of faith: and (2.) Divine <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> and <hi>Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which are the <hi>Means,</hi> in and by which Faith adheres to God in Chriſt. This later, ſeems chiefly (though not excluſively) intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this place; as it appears by the whole ſcope of the precedent diſcourſe; wherein the Author gives the <hi>Hebrews</hi> a ſtrict Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, <hi>To beware how they did forſake the aſſembling of themſelves together, as the manner of ſome was,</hi> to avoid perſecution, <hi>v.</hi> 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that to draw back from the Inſtitutions, and Ordinances of Chriſt, is here, as it may juſtly be interpreted, a drawing back from Chriſt. And this is grounded on a great Maxime in Nature, which teacheth us, <hi>That he who forſakes the means, forſakes the end.</hi> For he that firmely wils, and adheres to an end, doth alſo firmely wil, and adhere to the means, which have an intimate, and eſſential connexion therewith. Yea, the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult the means we undertake for Chriſt are,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:34711:99"/>
the firmer is our adherence to him, as our End. Whence it is evident, that ſo far as any ſoul forſakes the Inſtitutions, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt, ſo far he forſakes Chriſt: Withdrawment from the means of Grace, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Chriſt, is a withdrawment from himſelf: and herein much of the ſpirit of Unbelief diſcovers itſelf and its maligne influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. This was the great iniquitie of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Iſraelites, as we find them cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſed, Hoſ. 11. 7. <hi>And my people are bent to back-ſliding from me.</hi> Their backſliding <note place="margin">Hoſ. 7. 11.</note> lay, chiefly, in forſaking the Inſtitutions and Appointments of God, and giving up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Idolatrie, and ſuperſtitious Worſhip. This alſo was their ſin, in the Wilderneſſe, as it appears, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 37. <hi>For their heart was not right with me, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 78. 37</note> 
                  <hi>Covenant.</hi> Albeit they had engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Chriſt, by <hi>a ſolemne League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;</hi> yet what a <hi>crooked, perverſe, lying</hi> heart was there in them? How unſtedfaſt were they in his Covenant? how did they play <hi>off</hi> and <hi>on, faſt</hi> and <hi>looſe, to</hi> and <hi>fro, up</hi> and <hi>down</hi> with Chriſt? Such is the nature of Unbelief: whereas our bleſſed Lord inſtructs us Luke 9. 62. <hi>That no man having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdome of God, i. e,</hi> He that doth not perſevere in adhering to Chriſt, never truely believed on him: A <hi>temporary faith</hi> is no better than real Unbelief: That faith was never real, which is not laſting. <note place="margin">4 Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Diſtruſt.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Another branch of Unbelief conſiſts in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:34711:99"/>
Diffidence and <hi>Diſtruſt,</hi> as it is oppoſed to the <hi>Recumbence</hi> of faith. Faith is the moſt <hi>paſſive</hi> Grace: it can do or ſuffer nothing without Chriſt: and therefore its force, and ſtrength conſiſts in <hi>Recumbence</hi> on Chriſt. Faith never knows better days, than when it goes moſt out of it ſelf, and reſts on Chriſt. Hence we find the Nature of Faith oft deſcribed, by its <hi>Recumbence:</hi> So Pſal. 37. 5. <hi>Commit thy way</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>unto the Lord; truſt alſo in him, and he ſhal bring it to paſſe. Commit,</hi>

So Pſal. 22. 8. <hi>He truſted on the Lord:</hi> or according to the <hi>Hebr.</hi> He rolled (himſelf, or his burdens) on the Lord. It ſeems to be a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> borrowed from <hi>Porters,</hi> who <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onerate,</hi> or <hi>unlode</hi> their Burden on ſome place fit to receive it. Faith rols off al the ſinners burdens, whether of <hi>Guilt,</hi> or <hi>Filth,</hi> or <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> or <hi>Duties,</hi> or <hi>Civil concernes</hi> on Chriſt. Thus the Spouſe is deſcribed Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. 8. 5. <hi>Who is this that cometh up from the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 8. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Wilderneſſe, leaning on her Beloved?</hi> Faith is a <hi>Recumbent</hi> Grace: when it cannot honor Chriſt, as it would, by <hi>Obedience,</hi> yet then it honors him by <hi>Dependence:</hi> it fetcheth al from Chriſt, and ſo gives al glorie to him: Yea, the more Grace it receives from Chriſt, the more ſenſe it has of its need of Chriſt: The more it acts for Chriſt, the more it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives itſelf obliged to Chriſt. Though it doth never ſo much for Chriſt, yet it dares not truſt in any thing it <hi>doth</hi> or <hi>hath;</hi> but
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:34711:100"/>
wholly in Chriſt. Such a mere <hi>paſſive, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, Recumbent</hi> thing is faith; as we find it deſcribed, Iſai. 10. 20. <hi>Let him truſt in the Lord, and ſtay upon his God.</hi> Though the Believer may, by Stormes of Tentation, be now and then beaten off from Chriſt his <hi>Rock</hi> and <hi>Centre;</hi> yet he comes on again, and caſts <hi>Anchor</hi> afreſh on Chriſt: He counts not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſafe, til his heart fixe here: al his <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions</hi> and <hi>Aſſaults</hi> do but bring him to a more abſolute, and complete Recumbence on Chriſt: His faith finds no ſure bottome but here: It counts itſelf ſecure no where, but on <hi>Omnipotence.</hi> Yea, the ſtronger Faith is, the ſtronger uſually is its recumbence on, and confidence in Chriſt. And this, in al deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, keepeth the Believer from ſinking, in that he ſwims by faith on the Covenant, and in recumbence on Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But now it is quite contrary with Unbelief: How natural is it to corrupt Nature to truſt in, and depend upon its own forces? Yea, are not Divine <hi>Aſſiſtances,</hi> and <hi>Influences</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed by unbelief, unto carnal confidence? Oh! What an abſolute <hi>Independence,</hi> and <hi>Self-ſufficience</hi> doth Unbelief affect? How fain would every Unbeliever <hi>Deifie</hi> himſelf, by making himſelf the firſt <hi>principle</hi> of his Dependence, and Truſt? Was not this the ſin of our firſt Parents, to affect a <hi>ſelf-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience;</hi> that ſo they might derive from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, what they ought, by a natural Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to derive from God? And do not al their lapſed ſeed naturally follow their ſteps
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:34711:100"/>
herein? As fallen man affects to ſeek him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as his <hi>laſt end;</hi> ſo doth he not ſtrongly deſire to depend on himſelf, as his <hi>firſt cauſe,</hi> and ſupreme <hi>efficient?</hi> And if the Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cannot find a ſufficience in himſelf to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on; then how doth he hunt, and ſeek out among the creatures, for ſome bottome to recumbe, and fixe upon? So Hoſ. 5. 13. <hi>When Ephraim ſaw his ſickneſſe, and Judah ſaw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, and ſent to king Jareb.</hi> Iſrael had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther go any where, for relief, than unto God. How natural is it to Unbelievers, to truſt in any ſorry <hi>Idol-God,</hi> of their own making, rather than in the God, that made Heaven and Earth? How unable are Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to truſt God, in the <hi>want</hi> of althings? But how much leſſe are they able to truſt him, in the <hi>fulneſſe of althings?</hi> Doth not mens depending ſo much on themſelves, or the creature, argue their little, if any dependence on Chriſt?

When Chriſt enters into any ſoul, he expects, that every proud imagination, every high thought ſtoop unto him: That the whole ſoul bow before him, and adore his ſoverain wil and pleaſure. Thus Job 1. 20. <hi>Then Job aroſe,]</hi> This notes <note place="margin">Job. 1. 20.</note> his <hi>ſpeed, courage,</hi> and <hi>reſolution</hi> in complying with the divine Wil. <hi>[And rent his mantle and ſhaved his head,]</hi> theſe were Symbols, or

tokens of great ſorrow, and humiliation under the hand of God. Faith doth not deſtroy natural affections; but it <hi>regulates</hi> and <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualiſeth</hi> them. When the hand of God is on us, our hand ſhould be on our hearts, in order to a deep ſenſe, and humiliation under Gods viſitation.

(1.) A ſenſe of Gods hand in this viſitation. (2.) An <hi>Adoration</hi> of, or bowing before the Divine wil as moſt righteous. (3.) A ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the preſent iſſues of the divine Wil. In ſhort, it implies a melting or diſſolving of his Wil into the Divine wil, as moſt holy and beſt.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:34711:104"/>
So that a fretful, murmuring ſpirit is quite oppoſite to that ſilence and obedience, which faith implies: What is faith, but a free and chearful reſignation of al concernes to God; with a complete ſubjection to his Soverain Wil, Grace, and Spirit for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of al? Faith <hi>ſubjugates,</hi> and captivates our wiſdome, to divine Wiſdome; our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to the divine Law; our whole heart and life, to the divine Wil, either <hi>preceptive,</hi> or <hi>providential.</hi> A Believer, as ſuch, lives no longer, than he lives in the divine Wil and Grace: and no thing is ſo fit a ſubject for ſuch a Divine life, as a broken heart: and what ſo effectually breaks the heart as faith in Chriſt? Oh! what <hi>meekneſſe</hi> is there in faith? How <hi>ſilent</hi> is it? How <hi>flexible</hi> to the Divine Wil? Certainly the lower the wil lies in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and ſubmiſſion to God, the higher faith riſeth: The higheſt faith is that which lies loweſt in ſubjection to the foot of God. Such was <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, Iſai. 41. 2. <hi>Called him to his foot.</hi> Faith yields up it ſelf to Chriſt, to be acted as he pleaſeth; to do or ſuffer as he thinks fit: it leaves the ſoul with Chriſt, to be wrought upon as he ſeems good. So <hi>Paul</hi> Act. 9. 6. <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Paul</hi> makes Chriſt maſter of his wil, and al: he is content to be wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by Chriſts Soverain wil and Spirit. Whence faith is compared to a Mariage-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; whereby the wife gives over, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes al right to her husband: So the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gives up himſelf to Chriſt, that he may
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:34711:104"/>
be his. Hence the more reſiſtance there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Wil and Grace of Chriſt, the more Unbelief: An unbelieving wil is an inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wil: its mighty ſtiffe and hard.

Is the poor ſinner laden, and pinched with the guilt of ſin? O then! how doth faith applie thereto a Plaiſter of Chriſts bloud? Doth ſome powerful luſt, or tentation aſſault the ſoul? then faith goeth to Chriſt for fortifying, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborating Grace? Is the Believer called to any difficult piece of ſervice, either <hi>active</hi> or <hi>paſſive,</hi> for Chriſt? then Faith applies to itſelf
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:34711:105"/>
the Divine aſſiſtance and direction of Chriſts Spirit. Thus it receiveth out of Chriſts <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Grace for Grace,</hi> Joh. 1. 16. But now unbelief is altogether unacquainted with this Divine Art, of appropriating, and applying the Grace of Chriſt: It doth want, not only <hi>legs,</hi> or an <hi>active</hi> power to go to Chriſt; but alſo <hi>hands,</hi> or a <hi>paſſive</hi> power to receive from Chriſt. Oh! what a prodigiouſly proud begger is Unbelief, in that it ſcornes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an Almes from Chriſt? What! not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Grace when offered?

Ay, but Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief removes al theſe far from the ſoul: it ſays, in the language of thoſe ſecure ſinners, 2 Pet. 3. 4. <hi>Where is the promiſſe of his coming? do not althings continue as they were?</hi> Unbelief is poſſeſt with a kind of <hi>ſleeping</hi> Devil: it dreams of nothing but building Tabernacles here: What a ſtranger is it to eternitie, and the concernes thereof? If the ſecure ſinner be now and then a little awakened, and ſtartled at the apprehenſions of future jugement; how reſtleſſe is Unbelief, til it has got the ſoul aſleep again?

Oh! what a torment is it to the Unbeliever, to lie under awakened apprehenſions, expectations of, and approches towards future jugement? What would he give, if eternitie were buried in oblivion? There is nothing in the world that the Unbelievers heart is more alienated from, and averſe to, than the ſecond coming of Chriſt. Faith breeds a great expectation
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:34711:106"/>
of longing for, and has leaning unto that great day: But oh! how doth Unbelief en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to choke and ſtifle al awakened appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions thereof? And if the ſpirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage worke any lively ſenſe and convictions of that terrible day, what dreadful ſtormes and tempeſts of legal fear doth unbelief raiſe in the ſoul, whereby it is indiſpoſed, and hindered from any effectual endeavors, and preparations for that day?</p>
               <p>And oh! how commun is this piece of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie? Did not our great Lord foretel, that it ſhould be the main ſin of theſe laſt days, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 8.

And is not the difference between ſaving light and commun, as great, as that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the light of the Sun and of a candle? Is there not a vaſt difference between the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of the Holy one, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 20. which Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have, and the commun notions of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers?

But how bright and diſtinct are the Believers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, proceding from the <hi>Light of life,</hi> Jo. 8. 12? Is not the Unbelievers candel-light mere dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if compared with that <hi>intuitive</hi> real ſight of things inviſible, which the Believer enjoys, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1? Oh! how <hi>ſuperficial,</hi> and <hi>fleeting</hi> are al the Unbelievers Notions? But how ſolid and deep are the Believers concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſpiritual Myſteries? The Believer has a divine Inſtinct, and ſpiritual ſagacitie, as to the good things of his peace: but alas! what is al the unbelievers knowlege thereof, but a mere natural Notion, or commun hearſay, or forced conviction?

                  <hi>but the ſaving faith of believers ariſeth from ſelf-jelouſie, and ſelf-denial.</hi> How apt is ſelf-love to frame a faith of its own, ſuch a faith as wil eaſily correſpond with its luſts? Is it not the grand deſigne of Self-love, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is predominant, to come to Chriſt on its own feet of carnal confidence? But how much doth the ſelf-denying Believer abjure himſelf, and al his own ſelf-ſufficiences to win Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7, 8? Spiritual povertie is the next capacitie to ſaving Faith: the more ſenſible the humbled ſoul is of his own needs, the more ready is he to go to Chriſt. But is it thus with Unbelievers? Do they not ſeek in themſelves what they ſhould ſeek in Chriſt? And when they have found any imperfect good in themſelves, how much do they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumb and reſt on it, as the main bottome of their confidence?

Thus men baptiſe their carnal preſumtions into the name of faith.

And are not ſuch preſumtuous conceits, or rather deceits, the main ſpring of moſt mens commun faith? But is it not quite otherwiſe with the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever? Doth not his faith ſpring mainly from ſelf-jelouſie? Its true, he can juſtifie God and Chriſt, though it be in his own ruine; But oh! how much doth he condemne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf day by day? He can be indulgent to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but is he not very ſevere againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Is not every one nearer to Chriſt than he in his own apprehenſions? Oh! what ſelf-accuſations, and ſelf-condemnations doth he, or ought he to paſſe on himſelf every day? And are not theſe his ſelf-jelouſies, and ſelf-jugements a great ſpring of his faith in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31?</p>

A legal faith, ariſing from a ſpirit of Bondage, may worke dreadful terrors, but never ſolid peace of conſcience: It brings
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:34711:111"/>
men under a legal Covenant, but cannot keep men ſtedfaſt therein, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 8, 10, 37, 57. It workes in men legal preparations for Chriſt, but it cannot worke a thorow converſion to him: It divorceth the heart in part from ſin; but marries it to the Law, not to Chriſt: It plows up the fallow ground, but cannot ſow the ſeed of Grace. It makes a deep wound in Conſcience, but cannot heal it: It may drive men into deſpair, but it cannot, of itſelf, drive to Chriſt: It may reſtrain from ſin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain to dutie, but it gives no ſtrength for, or love to dutie: It may kil, but it cannot make alive: It may rend, but it cannot melt the heart: It may make ſin bitter, but it cannot make Chriſt ſweet: It may be an Advocate for the Law, but not for Chriſt. Such is the commun faith of Unbelievers. But now the evangelic faith of Believers, ariſing from a Spirit of Adoption, doth not only kil, but alſo make alive in the bloud of Chriſt: It doth not only divorce the heart from ſin, ſelf, and the Law; but alſo eſpouſeth it to Chriſt: It improves al legal preparations in order to an evangelic cloſure with Chriſt: It workes godly ſorrow for ſin, not only that it may be pardoned, but becauſe it is pardoned: It is not only compelled to dutie by legal motives; but alſo allured thereto by evangelic <hi>perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives:</hi> It doth much for Chriſt, and yet reſts on nothing but Chriſt: It workes not only evangelic Actions, but alſo evangelic Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and <hi>Diſpoſitions:</hi> It urgeth the Law
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:34711:112"/>
much, but on Evangelic grounds, and deſignes: It deſtroies not Moralitie, but perfects it: It frees men not from dutie, but in and for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Such are the different poſtures of a <hi>legal,</hi> and <hi>evangelic</hi> Faith.</p>

                  <hi>the Wil towards Chriſt, and al other good things that belong unto its peace; but commun faith affords Chriſt, and al thoſe good things only ſome imperfect deſires.</hi> The true Believer makes a free, and complete <hi>Acceptation</hi> of Chriſt, and <hi>Reſignation</hi> of al unto him: He takes the <hi>whole</hi> of Chriſt, and gives Chriſt the <hi>whole</hi> of his heart: He goes to Chriſt with a <hi>pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> or fulneſſe of wil, and receives from Chriſt a <hi>plenitude</hi> of Grace, <hi>John</hi> 1. 16. He is ſo <hi>amorous</hi> of the good things that belong unto his peace, that he can part with althings for them; yea his wil is carried with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent propenſion towards them, as the <hi>Iron</hi> to the <hi>Load-ſtone.</hi> But is it thus with the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer? Doth he not ever adde ſomething to Chriſt, or take ſomething from Chriſt? Alas! what is his commun <hi>faith,</hi> but a mere faint <hi>velleitie,</hi> a <hi>languid</hi> imperfect deſire after the good things that belong unto his peace? How unable is he to go to Chriſt, with a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of wil? How little is he allured, or raviſhed with the incomparable Beauties of Chriſt? perhaps he has ſome good liking to the good things of his peace; but oh! what a violent luſt has he after other things? He may have ſome <hi>evanid</hi> or dying wiſhes after the divine life; but oh! what a peremtorie
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:34711:112"/>

What is it that fortifies the heart ſo much in its adherence to Idols, and falſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of truſt? What makes mens wils ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions againſt Chriſt, yea deſtroyeth obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in the principal root thereof? Are not al theſe the fruits of Unbelief? Oh! What a lazy, ſlothful, remiſſe, and ſoftnatured thing is Unbelief, as to al that is good? And yet how vigorous and active is it in, and for
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:34711:119"/>
the production of al ſin? Yea, is not Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief virtually al ſin? Doth it not breed, preſerve, foment, incourage, actuate, and ſpirit al ſin? Whence procede the great errors of mens minds, hearts, and lives but from Infidelitie? How comes it to paſſe that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are ſo haſty in ſnatching at preſent goods, but ſo ſlow-hearted and backward in cloſing with the good things of their peace? Surely it is from Unbelief. Whence ſpring mens confuſions, and diſtractions of heart in times of trouble, but from their Unbelief? Whence alſo ſprings al that formalitie, and deadneſſe in duties, but from Unbelief? Is not this alſo the cauſe of mens hypocriſie both in heart and life? Oh! what a world of irregular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant paſſions doth Unbelief worke in mens hearts? What makes the ſenſual world ſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious in adhering to ſenſible good, but their Unbelief, as to good things hoped for? May not then every ſin deſervedly cal Unbelief, father? Is not this ſin of Infidelitie to be found at the end of every ſin? Whence ſpring the main exorbitances, and diſtempers of mens hearts and lives, but from Infidelitie? Men diſcourſe variouſly what was the firſt ſin by which <hi>Adam</hi> fel; but have we not much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, that Unbelief was <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin, which opened the dore to al ſin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie? For had not <hi>Adam</hi> disbelieved the Word of God, which threatned him in the day that he did eat of the forbidden fruit he ſhould die, he had not believed Satan. And as Unbelief at firſt opened the dore to al ſin,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:34711:120"/>
ſo doth it not ſtil hearten, and improve al ſin? Yea, is it not the prodigious womb of al ſin? Yea, has it not more of ſin than any, or al other ſins? Its true, ſcandalous ſins have more of <hi>Infamie;</hi> but has not Infidelitie more of <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,</hi> and guilt in it? Is not that the greateſt ſin, which is againſt the greateſt Laws, and Obligations? And is not Infidelitie againſt the greateſt Obligations that ever were, even a Covenant of Grace; which makes ſuch free, ſuch ful, ſuch rich, ſuch ſuitable, ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, ſuch importunate, ſuch heart-ſatisfying offers of Grace? And can there be a greater law, than the Mediators evangelic law; which is compoſed of ſuch ſweet alluring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and promiſſes? and yet lo! how doth Unbelief oppoſe the royal Law of Chriſt? Oh! what a world of rebellion lies wrapt up in the bowels of Infidelitie? How doth it ſcorne, reject, yea ſpurne at bowels of evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelic Love, and Grace? Yea, is it not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely oppoſite to al the principles of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? Is there not alſo abundance of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie in Infidelitie? Can there be a worſe Idol than ſelf idoliſed? And doth not every Unbeliever idoliſe his own carnal wiſdome, his proud wil, his commun gifts, his ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficience, his legal Righteouſneſſes, and ſeeming good duties? Is not the Unbelievers ſelf-dependence the worſt piece of Idolatrie? Doth not every Unbeliever by depending on himſelf, as his firſt principle, and laſt end, make himſelf his God? Again is there not an Hel of Blaſphemie in Infidelitie? Doth not
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:34711:120"/>
every Unbeliever, by his ſecret, or open mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs againſt God raiſe many black lies, and ſcandals on God? Yea, what are the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers diſcontents againſt God, but, in the Scriptures account, a <hi>curſing</hi> of God, as <hi>Job</hi> 1. 11, 22? Laſtly is there not a world of <hi>Atheiſme</hi> in al <hi>Infidelitie?</hi> Doth not Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, at one ſtroke, take away the Scriptures, God, and Chriſt, and al the good things of our peace? As the Unbeliever doth by his ſelf-dependence <hi>deifie</hi> himſelf, ſo doth he not alſo by the ſame undeifie the true God? Thus we ſee what a prodigious monſtrous ſin Unbelief is.</p>

Has the Unbeliever any thing to object againſt Chriſt, for not healing his wounded ſoul, ſeing he wilfully rejects the Medicinal Grace, and Bloud of Chriſt, which are the only remedies for his healing? If ſinners wil juſtifie their unbelief, which is ſo much condemned by God, is it not juſt with God to condemne them for it? So long as Unbelievers deſpiſe Goſpel-love, and Mercie, is it not juſt that Goſpel-vengeance take hold of them? What more equitable than that ſuch periſh in their ſins, who reſiſt al the ſweet attractives and allurements of Grace, by which Chriſt endeavors to draw them out
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:34711:121"/>
of ſin and miſerie? Doth not Infidelitie diſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and make void al Ordinances, and means of Salvation? Who then can be blamed, but the Unbeliever, for his own damnation? Is not Infidelitie the higheſt <hi>Treaſon</hi> againſt Heaven? Can then any puniſhment be too ſevere for it? Doth not Unbelief, as has been intimated, darken al the glorious Attributes of God? Is not the wiſdome of God eſtimed mere folie by it? Doth it not rebel againſt the Soveraintie of God, by placing the ſinners wil above it? Doth it not make the Faithfulneſſe of God unfaithful; Yea, give the lie to it, by queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning the truth of his Promiſſes, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 10? Oh! how warme, how large, how tender, how rolling are the Bowels of Free-grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſinners? But doth not Unbelief ſpurne at thoſe bowels, by ſhutting the heart againſt them? Is not the Omnipotence of God <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,</hi> yea counted mere Impotence by Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40. 27, 28, 29?

Is it not then moſt righteous, that the great God, who is thus injured, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed by Infidelitie, ſhould revenge his own quarrel thereon? Again, how doth Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <hi>ſlander, reproche,</hi> and undermine Chriſt, the great Mediator of Life and Salvation? Is not Chriſt the greateſt <hi>Inſtitute</hi> and Ordinance of God? Is he not appointed by God as the alone Savior of Mankind? And yet, lo! how do Unbelievers reproche and oppoſe him? Is not Chriſt greatly undervalued, when his gracious offers are rejected? Can we abuſe
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:34711:121"/>
Chriſt more, than by oppoſing the good things offered by him? Is it not a bloudy crime to meet Chriſt's Grace with reſiſtance? Oh! what an Hel of Iniquity lies in this ſin of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, in that it is a <hi>deſpiſing</hi> of Chriſt's bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drawing Love? Is any ſin a greater burden, and pain to Chriſt than Infidelitie? Is he not hereby <hi>wearied,</hi> Eſa. 7. 13? Yea, is not Chriſt greatly <hi>mocqued,</hi> and <hi>ſlandered</hi> by Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief? Yea, doth not Infidelitie <hi>rob</hi> Chriſt of al his Mediatorie Offices, and Perfections? Yea, is it not the ſoreſt <hi>Crucifixion</hi> of Chriſt? Did not <hi>Judas,</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> pierce Chriſt more ſorely by their Unbelief, than by their acts of betraying, and condemning him? Now if Infidelitie be ſo injurious to Chriſt, is it not juſt with him to vindicate ſuch injuries? Yea, indeed, What are al the Unbelievers jugements and torments, but ſuch as he <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively,</hi> and <hi>voluntarily</hi> draws upon himſelf? Are any Evangelic Unbelievers damned, but ſuch as <hi>wilfully</hi> elect Death before Life? Do not al they that reject Chriſt, <hi>electively</hi> embrace Death, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 36? And has the Unbeliever any reaſon to complain againſt God for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of him, ſeing he is unwilling to be ſaved?

Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if Sinners were but wel acquainted with that Myſterie of Iniquitie, that is wrapt
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:34711:122"/>
up in the bowels of Infidelitie; and how pernicious this ſin is to their ſouls, were it poſſible that they could pleaſe themſelves in it as they do? Alas! Can we imagine, that Unbelievers would ſit down ſo quietly under the chains &amp; fetters of their unbelief, were they but in a ſerious manner apprehenſive of it? But ah! here lies the great damning ſin, and miſerie of the Unbelieving World, men are not deeply and feelingly ſenſible of the burden, and ſtings of an unbelieving heart. How few are there, who obſerve and mourn under the ſecret veins of Infidelitie, that loge in their hearts? Where is that ſoul that lamentes, day by day, his want of <hi>a particular, ſupernatural, ſpiritual, diſtinct, certain, firme, evangelic, ful, prevalent, affective, effective,</hi> and <hi>transformative Aſſent</hi> to <hi>the good things that belong to his peace?</hi> Do not many great Profeſſors ſeem to aſſent to the Myſteries of the Goſpel, but yet really diſſent from, or, at leaſt not live up to them? Have not many the name of Believers, who yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver felt the virtue, and efficace of faith? Do not many pretend to a kindneſſe for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who yet ſecretly hate him in their hearts? How few, yea very few, among the croud of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Believers, live under the <hi>vital power</hi> of Faith? May we not, without breach of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, judge thoſe to be under the power of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, who were never truly ſenſible of the power of it? Is not Infidelitie, as it has been ſhown, the greateſt ſin, and therefore ought to have the greateſt ſenſe? What is the main and firſt worke of the Spirit of Bondage but
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:34711:123"/>
to convince the unbelieving world of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, as <hi>John</hi> 16. 9? And can men be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of it, unleſſe they ſtudie, and obſerve the nature and workings of it? Why is it that the moſt of men do account Infidelitie ſo ſmal a ſin, but becauſe they never inquired into its black ugly Nature and Aggravations? How comes it to paſſe, that many take part with their Unbelief, but becauſe they are not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, what a miſchievous pernicious thing it is? Alas! Did men ſtudie, and believe what an hainous ſin Infidelitie is, how would they abominate and loath it? What ſpeed would they make to be rid of it? Yea, why is it that Believers themſelves are ſo much under the prevalence of Unbelief, but becauſe they have not that ſenſe of its indwelling, and prevalence, which they ought to have? Did Believers meditate much of, and mourne under the evils of an unbelieving heart, ſurely they would not be ſo much troubled with it as they are. Oh! What a rare thing is it for Believers to have a quick ſenſe of Unbelief? What better argument and marque can we have of a ſound Believer, than a daily ſenſe of, and humiliation for Unbelief? Yea, is it not a good ſigne of much growth in Faith and other Graces, to be inwardly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, and troubled for the remains of Infidelitie dwelling in us? Do not the beſt and moſt improved Chriſtians uſually complain moſt of this ſin? Oh! What an inviſible, ſlie, and ſubtile ſin is Infidelitie? How long doth it lie lurking in the ſoul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:34711:123"/>
it be obſerved? Doth it not, like ſome cunning Politicians, animate and encourage every ſin, yet concele itſelf in al its actings?

Oh! how much of Infidelitie might we find in every ſin, were we but wel-skilled in the nature, and workings of it? But, alas! what <hi>Myſteries</hi> and <hi>Riddles</hi> are Unbelievers to themſelves? How unacquainted are they with the ſpiritual, cunning, and ſubtile turnings and windings of their unbelieving hearts? Is it not then the great concerne of al, to be greatly intent on the ſtudie of, and inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the <hi>Nature, Operations,</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of Unbelief?</p>
               <p>But above althings we ſhould much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template, <note place="margin">Studie the Cauſes of Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> and inquire into the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie.

So in like manner may we not repute him among the moſt underſtanding Believers, who is beſt skilled in diſcerning the Cauſes of Unbelief? Surely althings are beſt known in and by their Cauſes: O then! if thou wilt underſtand the black nature of Infidelitie, ſtudie and inquire narrowly into its Cauſes: Inquire into that <hi>Soverain, venimous,</hi> black <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> which <note place="margin">1 Spiritual darkneſſe.</note> dwels in Conſcience, and makes al the good things of thy peace to diſappear.

Oh! what an efficacious influence hath the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Conſcience, on the darkneſſe of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie? Studie alſo how much <hi>carnal reaſon</hi> doth promote Infidelitie. What more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <note place="margin">2. Carnal Reaſon.</note> to Faith than carnal reaſon? When men endeavor to meſure the <hi>Promiſſes,</hi> or <hi>Providences;</hi> the Words, or Workes of God by carnal wiſdome; what black jealouſies, and ſuſpicions of Gods love, care, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe procede thence? How is the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers heart filled with black ugly prejudices againſt Chriſt, and al the offers of his Grace? The leſſe of carnal reaſon, there is mixed with Faith, the more pure it is. Again ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how much <hi>carnal Securitie</hi> doth foment, <note place="margin">3.

When men conſider not the things that belong to their peace, how can they underſtand, or believe them? What made the old World ſo much disbelieve the approching Deluge of Gods wrath, but their wretched ſecuritie? Its true, Unbelief is oft the cauſe of carnal ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, but is it not alſo as oft the effect of it? Is not the Securitie of the wiſe and fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gms, made a cauſe of their Infidelitie, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> 25. 5? Is not faith maintained by an inward, tender, feeling ſenſe; and Unbelief by the want of ſuch a ſenſe? Further, take <note place="margin">4.

Could any ſober mind imagine, that a thing ſo deformed, and pernicious, ſhould ſeem ſo amiable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable in the eyes of men? Was it ever known, that the Leper was amorous of his Scabs; or the Begger in love with his Rags; or the Priſoner with his Fetters; or the wounded Perſon with his bleeding Wounds? How then comes it to paſſe, that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world is ſo much amorous of, and deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Infidelitie; which is the worſt leproſie, povertie, deformitie, and miſerie, that the Soul partakes of? Yea, how comes it to paſſe, that Believers themſelves have ſuch reliques and remains of Unbelief in them; and that in ſuch days as theſe are, wherein Evangelic <hi>Light, Love,</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> ſo much abound? Hath not our bleſſed Lord taken al the courſes and means that may be, to cure men of their Infidelitie? As to the encouragements and motives to believe, doth he not ſhew himſelf as kind as kind may be? Has he not given al manner of warrants, yea commands for men to believe? Doth not the Covenant of Grace give as good law-right, as may be, for al that wil to come and embrace the good things that belong to their peace? Are not the <hi>offers</hi> of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:34711:125"/>
the Covenant <hi>general, free, abundant,</hi> and moſt <hi>affectionate?</hi> Is not Chriſt more willing to ſave, than ſinners are to be ſaved? As to <hi>means,</hi> what can God do more, than he has, in ſaying, <hi>Here is my Son, my Spirit, my Goſpel, and al the good things of My peace; take al, and welcome?</hi> And are not the <hi>termes</hi> on which al theſe good things are offered, moſt eaſie to any that is but really willing to be happy? Yea, are not the means vouchſafed by God, to cure our Infidelitie in theſe light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome days, much greater, than in former days? whence then is it, that men continue in their Infidelitie, and that with ſo much delight? Has Chriſt condeſcended ſo low in the offers of his Grace, and do ſinners ſtill perſiſt in their rejecting, or not improving ſuch rich and gracious offers? Oh! What mater of ſad contemplation, and Lamentation is here? How ought every eye to weep apart, and every heart to bleed <hi>apart,</hi> for <hi>perſonal, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic, Eccleſiaſtic,</hi> and <hi>National</hi> Infidelitie? Alas! how true, too true, is that prediction of our Omniſcient Lord, touching theſe laſt days, Luke 18. 8. <hi>Nevertheleſſe when the Son of Man cometh, ſhal he find faith on the earth?</hi> Who knows how near this coming of the <hi>Son of Man may be?</hi> May we not conjecture, that ſome great coming of the Son of Man cannot be far off, becauſe faith is ſo much departed from the earth? Was there ever, ſince the coming of our Lord in the fleſh, more light, and yet more <hi>Atheiſme</hi> in the world? Is not the disbelief of the main Articles of our faith,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:34711:126"/>
the only faith and belief that is to be found among ſome? Are not al the great <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi> and <hi>vitals</hi> of faith ſtruck at by ſome, who would count it an high affront to be judged Unbelievers? Yea, to come nearer home, have we not cauſe to fear, that many, who paſſe for ſhining Believers, wil one day appear to be rotten-hearted Unbelievers? Yea, to leave others to their ſupreme Judge, have we not al cauſe to lay our hands on our hearts, and condemne our ſelves of much Infidelitie? If thou art not ſenſible of much Unbelief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling in thee, is it not a ſad Symtome, that thou haſt nothing, or at beſt, but very little of true Faith in thy heart? May we not ſafely ſay, That he never truely mourned for any ſin, who never mourned for Infidelitie, which is at the end of every Sin? Oh! what lamentable ruines has Unbelief brought on many flouriſhing Churches? And may we expect to be exemted from the like ſtrokes of Divine juſtice, unleſſe we lament, and mourn over our Unbelief, which deſerves the ſame? Take theſe Motives to provoke thine heart to a deep Lamentation and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation for thine own, and other mens unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. (1) Unbelief is, as has been ſaid, the greateſt Sin, and therefore ought to worke in us the greateſt ſenſe and humiliation. (2) If thine heart be not deeply humbled for thine Unbelief, thou wilt ſoon be overcome by it. (3) The more thy ſoul is melted under the ſenſe of Unbelief, the more evangelic and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual it is. What better marque is there of a ſpiritual, yea of a believing heart, than a
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:34711:126"/>
deep ſenſe of, and humiliation for Unbelief? It is a great proof of our Faith, yea, of an eminence in Faith, to mourne greatly under Unbelief. (4) A little unbelief in Believers is much worſe than much unbelief in others; becauſe Believers have greater <hi>Obligations, Encouragements, Aſſiſtances,</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> to believe. (5) Not to be humbled for the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of others, whether Churches, or State, is to partake with them in their ſin; and ſo to expoſe our ſelves to their approching juge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, at leaſt temporal.</p>

Yea, is he not more willing to receive Sinners, than they are to come unto him? or, are the flames of Hel more elegible, than the joys of Heaven?

Alas! how is it poſſible that Salvation itſelf ſhould ſave ſuch, ſo long as they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſpurne at the offers of Salvation?

Have not thoſe <note place="margin">2. The ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of reaſon.</note> that believe moſt, the deepeſt, and ſoundeſt reaſons? Who is the wiſer man, The Believer that adheres to the <hi>Firſt truth and chiefeſt good;</hi> or the Unbeliever, who rejects the ſame, and adheres to Idols of time? How doth Faith corroborate, and fortifie the Wil in what is <note place="margin">3. The fortifying of the Wil and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</note> good, by uniting of it to Chriſt, and the Divine wil? What a ſweet harmonie, and order doth it inſpire into the Affections? How doth it make the Believer to fear God under ſmiles, love him under frowns, hope in him under difficulties, wait for his returne under deſertions? Yea, when our affections are under the greateſt diſorder and confuſion,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:34711:133"/>
doth not Faith oft draw peace and order out of it? Is not Faith both <hi>food</hi> and <hi>phyſic?</hi> Doth it not as wel feed Grace, as purge out ſin? Whence ſpringeth the Chriſtians union with <note place="margin">4. Union with Chriſt.</note> Chriſt, but from Faith? Could Chriſt and Sinners ever come together, unleſſe Faith did unite them? Can things contrarie be united, but by ſome efficacious bond of Union? Was it ever known that there was a mariage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the living and the dead? How then comes it to paſſe that the dead Sinner is eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a living Chriſt? Is not this happy match, the alone miraculous effect of Faith, wrought by the Spirit of God? And hence doth not Faith make God thine, as ſurely as <note place="margin">5. Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> thou art thine own? And Faith having united the perſon to Chriſt, doth it not thence, by Grace derived from him, purifie the nature alſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9? And doth not Faith hence worke a miraculous change in the whole diſpoſition of the ſoul, and converſation? And as the member is naturally ſubject to the head, ſo doth not Faith ſubject the whole ſoul to Chriſt? Whence alſo doth not the Believer entirely give up himſelf to Chriſt, as Chriſt gives up himſelf to the Believer? Oh! how <note place="margin">6. Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Chriſt.</note> doth the believing Soul follow after, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to Chriſt, by ineffable groans, and acts of Faith, though Chriſt may ſometimes ſeem to depart from him? How inquiſitive is Faith to underſtand al the virtues of Chriſt, and to receive from him Grace for Grace? What a violence is it to Faith to <hi>live, act, breath, ſpeak</hi> and <hi>walke</hi> out of Chriſt? What
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:34711:134"/>
is it that keeps the heart, as a chaſt Virgin for Chriſt, but Faith? Hence alſo Faith gives the ſoul ſolid peace in and with God: and oh! <note place="margin">7. Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in Chriſt.</note> How ſatisfying is this peace, which Faith gives? What child-like confidence, and boldneſſe enſues hereon? And thence, how much is the ſoul ſatiated in communion with Chriſt, ſo far as Faith prevails? What ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and delicious ſuavities doth the believing Soul, at times, receive from Chriſt? What an <hi>active</hi> application is there on Chriſts part towards the Believer; and <hi>paſſive</hi> application on the Believers part towards Chriſt? How much is Faith delighted in trading with Heaven and Chriſt? Is not this the main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of Faith to enjoy Chriſt, to live and die in him? What is it that gives the ſoul an abode in Chriſt, and Chriſt in the ſoul, but Faith, as <hi>John</hi> 15. 5? Oh! What ſtrong deſires, and thirſts after Chriſt doth Faith worke in the ſoul? Doth it not make the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and preſence of Chriſt, the meſure of bitter and ſweet, of good and evil? What more efficacious to draw forth every Grace in <note place="margin">8. The exerciſe of Grace.</note> its exercice than Faith? Unbelief is the ſpring of ſpiritual ſloath and lazineſſe; but oh! how vigorous, and active is Faith? There is no Grace, or Dutie but it is made eaſy by Faith: How eaſy is the worke of Humiliation made by Faith: What makes divine Love more ſpriteful, and vigorous than Faith? Yea, is not the whole of Chriſtianitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the bowels of Faith? Is there any Grace required to the Divine life, which Faith
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:34711:134"/>
cannot ſupplie us with? Yea, Faith is ſo good a <hi>Chymiſt,</hi> as that it can extract riches out of <note place="margin">8. Al Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual goods.</note> povertie, ſtrength out of weakneſſe, glorie out of ſhame, peace out of trouble, Grace out of ſin, life out of death, ſomething out of nothing. Oh! how miraculous are the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Faith? It makes a man able to do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, an yet it makes him ſee he is nothing, and can do nothing: It makes a man content with any thing that God gives, and yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied 'til he can enjoy althings in their fountain.</p>
               <p>Again, If we conſider Faith in its <hi>parallel Antitheſis,</hi> or oppoſition to Infidelitie, we <note place="margin">The oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt faith and Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</note> ſhal then ſee more fully the excellent qualities of it, as alſo the miſchievous Influences of Infidelitie. (1.) Faith breeds jealouſie of our ſelves, but confidence in God; it reckons it cannot believe God too much, nor ſelf too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. But oh! What ſelf-confidence, &amp; jelouſie of God doth Infidelitie produce? How much doth it truſt ſelf; and thence how little can it truſt in God? What mutual Influences, and Reciprocations are there between ſelf-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and jelouſies of God? (2) Faith keepeth the heart cloſe to God, his Word, and Ordinances; and ſo keepeth God cloſe to the heart: It follows Chriſt in ways of Dependence, Adherence, Subjection, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and Conformitie; and ſo Chriſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it in ways of gracious Communications, Conſolations, Manifeſtations, and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But is it thus with Unbelief? Doth it not depart from God, his Word, and Ways?
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:34711:135"/>
And thence doth not God depart from the Unbeliever? (3.) Faith prepares for, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens in, and ſweetens every Dutie: It ſets <hi>Prayer</hi> on foot, <hi>Meditation</hi> on the wing, and drawes forth the <hi>Attention,</hi> and <hi>Intention</hi> of the Soul in hearing and reading of the Word. But oh! How doth Infidelitie hinder, deaden, and embitter the Soul in al gracious exercices? How doth it clip the wings of Meditation, ſtifle and choke the breathings of Prayer, <hi>&amp; c?</hi> (4.) Faith fixeth and eſtabliſheth the heart, by knitting of it to Chriſt, who is an immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Rock. But oh! What a mutable, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable, inconſtant thing is Infidelitie? How doth it make the heart to ſtagger, and reel, by dividing and taking it off from God, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 7. 9? (5.) Faith makes a livelyhood out of Divine <hi>Promiſſes, Engagements, Relations,</hi> and <hi>Influences:</hi> It ſucks ſweetneſſe out of Promiſſes, and ſo is nouriſhed by them: It feeds on Divine Relations, and Influences, and ſo finds a livelihood in the greateſt famine of ſpiritual injoyments: It is long-handed, and reacheth to Heaven for ſupplies, when al means below fail. But oh! how ſhort-handed is Infidelitie? It's true, it has a long hand to reach forth to the Creature; yea, ſometimes to Hel; but it has no hand to reach after Chriſt, or his Promiſſe: how doth it ſuffer the poor hungry ſoul to ſtarve amidſt al evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelic Promiſſes and Dainties? Whereas Faith takes the Soul by the hand, and leades it from one Promiſſe to another, from one Attribute to another, and ſo ſuckes gracious Influences
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:34711:135"/>
from al, as it need requires. (6.) Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers the whole Soul to God; and thence althings elſe are conquered to the Soul: It ſubjects the heart to Chriſt, and ſo makes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things ſubject to it. But Infidelitie captivates the heart to luſt, and thence it becomes capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to every thing elſe. Oh! What a vaſſal is the unbeliever to every baſe luſt, Yea to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? (7.) Faith fortifies the Soul againſt al the Blandiſſements, Allurements, and eye-pleaſing Delights of this lower world: It blaſteth al the fair promiſſes of created good, by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding of them. But alas! how ſoon is Unbelief entangled, and overcome by every inveiglement, and ſnare of ſinful pleaſures? It can fortifie the heart againſt nothing, but the convictions, and good motions of the Spirit. Faith is the ſhield of the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to repel al the <hi>poiſoned</hi> darts of the World and Satan; but Infidelitie is the ſhield of the old man, to repel al the <hi>Convictions</hi> of the Spirit, darted into the Sinners Conſcience. (8.) Faith prepares the heart for, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth it under every difficultie, frown, and afflictive croſſe: It prepares for the worſt times, yet hopes for, and expects the beſt: It takes out the ſting and poiſon of every croſſe; and infuſeth into it a medicinal, healing vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. But can Infidelitie do ſuch marvels? doth it not unfit us for every difficultie, and then betray us into the hands of it? Faith never leaves us at a loſſe; it clotheth the mind with a divine light, whereby it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to ſee, and paſſe thorough al dangers.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:34711:136"/>
But oh! How doth Unbelief darken the eye of the Soul; and ſo create black viſions of carnal fear, and heart-rending troubles? Difficulties and diſtreſſes are the element of Faith; but how unable is Infidelitie to live, or breath in ſuch a ſharpe Air? (9.) Faith opens the dore to promiſſed Mercies and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances: It keeps the condition of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, and ſo keeps the ſoul under the bleſſing of the Promiſſe. But is this in the power of Infidelitie? Doth it not rather put a bar to promiſſed Mercies; as <hi>Num.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 19? Yea, doth it not open a dore to al the threats and curſes of the Law? Yea, doth it not bind the Unbeliever faſt under a ſentence of condemnation, as <hi>John</hi> 3.36? Whereas Faith on the contrary ſtops the mouth of al legal Threats and Curſes, and locks the ſoul faſt under a ſtate of Salvation, <hi>John</hi> 6. 47. (10.) Faith improves Mercies received, and ſo makes way for more: It giveth God the honor of his Mercies, and man a ſanctified and comfortable uſe of them. But can In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie thus improve Mercies? Doth it not rather, by its murmurs, and miſimprovments, deſtroy former Mercies, and ſo hinder future? Was not this the temper of the unbelieving Jews in the Wilderneſſe, as we find it deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 11—40? Oh! how doth Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief rob God of al the Glorie, and ſo man of al the comfort, and right uſe of Mercies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? How unthankeful, how diſcontented is the Unbeliever under Mercies received; and thence unfit to receive more? Whereas
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:34711:136"/>
the Believer is content under the want of Mercies, and thence fit to receive them: He can truſt God with his ſoul, and al other Mercies; and thence God truſts him with Mercies needful. But the Unbeliever, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the receipt of former Mercies, cannot truſt God for the future; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God wil not truſt him with any ſpecial marque of Love and Mercie.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuchlike being the admirable Qualities of Saving Faith, how much doth it concerne al to labor, with al poſſible vigor and activitie, after this ſo noble and uſeful a Grace? Art thou an Unbeliever? Oh! how much then doth it concerne thee to labor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Faith, that ſo thou mayeſt partake of theſe admirable Privileges and Advantages, which hereby thou wilt be inveſted with? Art thou a new Convert, and Beginner in Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? Oh then! how much doth it concerne thee, to get much Faith, that ſo thou mayſt be ſtrong? Art thou ſtrong, and wel grown in Grace? and art thou not then engaged to act Faith much, that ſo thou mayſt continue ſtrong, and grow more ſtrong in Grace? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! What canſt thou do or ſuffer without Faith? How much art thou beneath the leaſt dutie or ſuffering farther than thou art acted by Faith? And oh! be ſure thy faith be of the right make and ſtampe: Dread being deluded with a falſe, or commun faith, more than Hel. Make a curious inquiſition into the <hi>Nature, Cauſes,</hi> and <hi>Workings</hi> of thy faith: ſee that it be <hi>wel-grounded,</hi> and <hi>duely</hi>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:34711:137"/>
                  <hi>qualified.</hi> This advice doth more nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne young Converts, whoſe eternal welbeing depends chiefly on the right conſtitution of their Faith at firſt Converſion. For if thy Faith in its firſt framing be naught, thine heart and life wil never be good: Thou mayſt build a beautiful and goodly ſtructure of Profeſſion on a common faith; but let me tel thee, a ſtorme of Tentation wil come, and waſh al away: If thy Profeſſion be bottomed only on a Commun faith, it is begun in Hypocriſie, and wil end in Apoſtaſie. O that men would be wiſe before it be too late, and endeavor <hi>To know the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to their peace, before they be hid from their eyes.</hi>
