            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Sons and Daughters of men,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TRue it is, that we are accounted of
all Beasts to be the most intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
and of best discourse. And
therefore, at my first coming over,
I was sorry to meet with such an
affront as one of your Country-men, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of <hi>Reynard the Fox,</hi> has put upon our
Kinde, in shutting us out of that most honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42840:3"/>
Assembly of Speaking and Preaching-Beasts:
whether he thought us too big, and
that we should have taken up too much room in
that Reverend Convention, or for what other
reason, I know not. But I shall let that pass, it
not being for a stranger and a Captive to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with the multitude. It may be thought,
that because among you generally the most
bulkie are the greatest Sots, therefore we should
be the dullest of all Creatures. But to shew
the contrary, I thought it fitting to deliver my
self in this short Speech, to let you know some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of our Nature and Conditions.</p>
            <p>As for my Father and my Mother, if I should
call the one a <hi>great Bear,</hi> and the other a <hi>foul
great Sow,</hi> 'tis no more than what I hear, by
Report, is vulgarly attributed among you to
many of your own Parents. I hope you will
not from hence put me to prove an Elephant
to be either a <hi>Bear</hi> or a <hi>Sow:</hi> for I am a poor
<hi>Beast,</hi> and no <hi>Logician.</hi> Yet why I may not
call an Elephant a <hi>Bear</hi> or a <hi>Sow,</hi> as well as
you call one another <hi>Bears</hi> and <hi>Sows,</hi> I know
no reason to the contrary. However, as great
a Bear as my Sire was, he was <hi>Elephant in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi>
to the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> and has carried his
Imperial Master full many a time, with great
commendation of his care, and management of
his behaviour.</p>
            <p>I was taken young from my Parents, being
sold to satisfie the Covetousness of my Keepers,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42840:3"/>
of which there are many such in the Courts of
great Princes, pretending me to be a Bastard,
and none of the right Race; though I have
been told, that my Sire and Dam were as honest
Elephants as any in our Country. Or if they
had their failings, I hope they be the better
excus'd, as living among the numerous temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of an Emperour's Family. It was my
hard fate however to loose my Education;
which I have heard many of you never repent,
nor minde the loss of.</p>
            <p>How I came here, truly, my most worthy
friends, I cannot tell: you may be certain, it
was not out of any desire to travel, being so
young; nor is it possible for me to improve my
travels, being carried from place to place in the
dark, and never permitted to see your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
I remember I came by Sea, which has
made me in this shabbie condition wherein you
see me: for my Clothes are very bad; and if
your Country be cold, as I fear it is, when I
shall have better I know not. But let my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
look to that; for if I die, I know what will
become of them. This I'll say for your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-men,
that all the while I was on Ship board,
no men in the world could have been more civil
to an Elephant than they were: I wanted for
nothing, either as to my Lodging, Diet, or
Attendance; but if at any time I seemed to
be sick, their care and sorrow was then so great
for me, that I began to think my self some E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42840:4"/>
Deitie: And truly I thank um, their
care has been great for me ever since. But
now I think on't, why should I give um so much
thanks? for I finde it has been altogether for
their own ends: 'twas to sell me, and make mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of me. Indeed I cannot blame um; for they
say, you English people are the most given to
staring, and throw away your money upon
strange Sights, of any people in the world:
And I perceive you have more kindness than
ordinary for us, by the great number of <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
and Castles</hi> which I finde in your Signes.
Truly now ye talk of Castles, I wish I had a
Castle upon my back, for I begin to feel it cold
already.</p>
            <p>But my most worthy Friends, though I am
sold, and am a Captive, I would not have
you believe that I think the worse of my self
for all that. Believe me, I have been bought
and sold twice; And as I have been <hi>far fetcht,</hi>
so I have been <hi>dear bought.</hi> And now I must
tell ye, that if you yourselves were to be sold
to your worth, there's not one in a hundred
of ye all would be valued at the fortieth part
of what I have been sold for. For you your
selves, if to be sold to the Plantations, where
you will yield the best market, are not worth
above ten Pound a man: And for your Wives,
by your own reckonings, as you your selves
have sold um at half Crowns a piece, Fourteen
thousand seven Hundred of um will but just
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42840:4"/>
equal my sum of Two thousand Pounds. So
that one <hi>Indian</hi> Elephant is worth Fourteen
thousand <hi>English</hi> married Women. And
therefore though I am here expos'd among ye
as a publick Spectacle, what care I for that?
my back is broad enough to bear your Jears;
and as long as I eat and drink well, which is
no more than what you look after, give me
leave to tell ye, I am not a little proud of the
value which they have set upon me.</p>
            <p>And now, my dear Brother, I mean Thee
the great Beast called the Rabble, I have only
one word to thee. I know thou art as great a
Beast as my self, and that our Natures are
both alike; for when we are mad, we are hard
to be tam'd; there is nothing will govern us
but an Iron Hook thrust into my Pole, and an
Iron Hook thrust into thy Nostrils; yet thou
seest at other times how tame and gentle we
are. And truly, Brother, take this from me,
that I never finde my self better at ease, than
when I am obedient to my Keepers.</p>
            <p>One thing I had almost forgot, most worthy
friends: They say; you have a Show in this
Town. Pray let my Masters know, that if my
service may be accepted, I shall be very ready,
with their leave, to serve ye all; and for your
more particular delight, to carry a Castle and
a Giant upon my back for that day: only I
desire you that you will be pleased to forbear
throwing of Squibs if I am there, for I cannot
endure the smell of Gun-powder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:42840:5"/>
One thing more I beg of you, that you
would desire my Master to send word by the
next <hi>East-India</hi> ship, that my Sire and my
Dam may understand my condition, and not
shorten their days for my absence. Or if I die
before that, that for the good service I have
and may do um, they would re-convey my
Bones into my own native Country, seeing the
Expence of that will be nothing so much as
their bringing hither.</p>
