         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Benefit, That We cannot but with our
Humbleſt Duty, acknowledge your Garcious Reception
of it; However as your Great Wiſdom, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

eſpecially by the late <hi>Horrid Conſpiracy,</hi> when, not only
our Loyal apprehenſions for your Majeſties Danger, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

            <head>The fore-going Dedication Humbly offered
to <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> having diſcovered the
Intention of this Undertaking; it remains
now to ſatisfy all Reaſonable Scruples
which have been raiſed concerning the
Wholeſomeneſs and Cheapneſs of <hi>Water</hi>
thus Prepared.</head>
            <head type="sub">The <hi>Queries</hi> and <hi>Anſwers</hi> follow.</head>
            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>IF this</hi> Water <hi>can be made in ſufficient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to ſerve the Uſes of any Ship at</hi> Sea?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> About Ninety Gallons may be
Prepared in every Twenty Four Hours by an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of 33 Inches Diameter, which will ſtand under
the Deck of any Ship; and it's computed that leſs than 3
Quarts is a good Allowance for any man in that time:
And if a large Ship, wherein there are many men abroad,
ſhould require more Water, then two or more of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
may be had upon Reaſonable Terms, and
one man may attend ſeveral of them.</p>
            <p>Queſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. <hi>In caſe the Operation be by</hi> Fire, <hi>it may require
a Skilful</hi> Chymiſt, <hi>or one known in ſuch Operations to be
on Board every Ship, who will require great Wages?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49364:5"/>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> There will be no occaſion for any ſuch perſon,
for any Sea-man may be Inſtructed in an Hour or two
to Prepare this Water.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>It's probable that the</hi> Engine <hi>may be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
out of Order, and being ſo at</hi> Sea <hi>where Artificers
and Tools are wanting to Repair it, there muſt neceſſarily
follow want of</hi> Water, <hi>which will be of Ill Conſequence?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This <hi>Engine</hi> is of ſuch Contrivance, that it's
never likely to be out of Order.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Can this</hi> Engine <hi>be of uſe in Stormy-weather?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Since a ſufficient quantity of Freſh-water may be
ſo eaſily had by this <hi>Engine,</hi> the Mariners will be Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to make a good Proviſion of it before-hand; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
'tis not to be doubted but it will anſwer the worſt
Accidents of the greateſt Storms, and have its Effect
ſufficiently in the worſt Weather, eſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that in ſuch deſperate Extremities men muſt be
content with ſmaller Allowances.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 5, <hi>The Operation being by</hi> Fire <hi>it may endanger
the Ship, and the Smoak be very offenſive?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The <hi>Engine</hi> may eaſily be placed in any Ship
without danger of <hi>Fire,</hi> or offence of Smoak.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 6. <hi>Will not the Charge of this Inſtrument and the
Materials belonging to it be very great?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is difficult to make exact Anſwer to this, but
an Inſtrument of the largeſt Size, with all the Materials
belonging to it, will not amount to above Sixteen
Pound at moſt, and may laſt many years, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49364:5"/>
to the Rates of Ships they may be proportion'd
both in Bulk and Price.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 7. <hi>Will not the Fewel be very Chargeable, and
take up much Room in the Ship?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Operation is cauſed by ſo little <hi>Fire,</hi> that
it will be very Cheap, and the Proviſion need not be
great, nor the trouble of Stowing it in a Ship.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 8. <hi>Will not the Ingredients take up much Room,
and be very Chargeable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> A Veſſel leſs than a Barrel may contain enough
of the Ingredients to carry a Ship to the <hi>Indies</hi> and back
again; and the Ingredients for one hundred Gallons of
this <hi>Sea-Water</hi> will not amount to above Fourteen
Pence at moſt.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 9. <hi>Admitting this Preparation of Water may be
made, and in ſufficient quantities, it may be doubted whether
it be whole ſome?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Famous Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> having written Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
of this Subject, had not the leaſt thought that the
Sea-water after it had been Diſs-ſalted, without any
Noxious addition, was Unwholeſome, and it neither
now is, nor ever was really doubted whether it were
Wholeſome: However, becauſe invidious perſons, who
are no well-wiſhers to Ingenious Deſigns, may poſſibly
raiſe Scruples, the Gentlemen who are concerned in this
Grant, have purpoſely to give Publick Satisfaction, ſent
a large quantity of this Water to Doctor <hi>King,</hi> a very
Ingenious Phyſician, who is a Member of the <hi>Colledge,</hi>
and of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> who finds.

ſuch as inquire concerning the healthfulneſs of this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Their Opinion being in this particular, the more

the Brackiſh Waters of the Sea-Coaſt, and the putrifyed

            <p>MUch Stowage will be ſaved, ſo that a Ship of 50

may take in ſeveral Tuns of Goods more than they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
uſed to carry; which will conſiderably advance
the Trade of all Merchants, and be of vaſt profit to
the Maſters or Owners of Ships.</p>
            <p>The Charge of Casks is very conſiderable, eſpecially
when bound with Iron, as all Sea-Casks muſt be; And
by means of this Engine, three fourths of that charge
will be ſaved.</p>
            <p>The tear and wear of Boats often going from Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
and frequent loſs of the Boats and men in Stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
weather, and the opportunity of the Sea-mens being
Drunk on ſhoar; by which many fatal accidents do
happen, (by means of having this Water-Engine) will be
prevented.</p>
            <p>Ships in long Voyages have been forc'd to run many
Leagues from their intended courſe, which much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards
their Voyage, and makes them loſe fair winds,
and maintain more Sea-men at charges of Diet and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
than they have occaſion for; which inconveniences
may be prevented by having water within themſelves.</p>
            <p>Ships are often forc'd to leave their Ankors and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
behind them, by being forced into dangerous
Shoars upon account of taking in Freſh water.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:49364:8"/>
In the <hi>Affrican Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt India</hi> Voyages, great
quantities of Freſh water are neceſſary, which the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are forc'd to put above Deck for want of room,
which is great hindrance to a Ships Sailing, &amp; much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers
&amp; weakens a Ship in caſe of Calms, which often
happen in the narrow Seas, but eſpecially near the Line,
this Inſtrument will be of vaſt Advantage by affording
freſh and wholſom Water, inſtead of that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſom
&amp; offenſive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſſex, Kent,</hi> and all other the Sea Coaſts, that want
wholſome Water, may be eaſily and cheaply ſupplyed
by this means; as alſo <hi>Venice, Amſterdam, Roterdam,</hi>
and all other places that lye near the Sea, and either
want good, or have Brackiſh Water.</p>
            <p>In time of war, whole Navies may be relieved by
this Engine, and opportunity given of making the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
diſcoveries imaginable.</p>
            <p>It is further to be conſidered, that hitherto the richeſt
and ableſt bodied Sea-men have been averſe from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
long Voyages by reaſon of endangering their
healths, and lives, by making uſe of putrified Water,
which inconvenience is not now to be feared there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch uſeful hopes of Freſh Water by the uſe of this

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O give you a ſhort account (ſuitable to the
little time I have to do it in,) of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaction,
which I ſuppoſe muſt have given
the riſe to the mention made of my Name
in the publick <hi>Gazet;</hi> I muſt inform you,
that one of my neareſt Relations, (Captain
<hi>Fitz-gerald,)</hi> and ſome other Worthy Gentlemen, having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
His Majeſty, that They had an Invention for making
<hi>Sea-water,</hi> ſweet and wholſom in great quantity, and with
ſmall Charge, and that I had examin'd, and did approve
the Water ſo prepar'd; His Majeſty was pleas'd with very
Gracious Expreſſions, to command Me to attend Him, with
a further and more particular Information. Having rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
obey'd this Order, and been made acquainted with the
Objections the King thought fit to make againſt the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticableneſs
of the Invention; which, (tho a private Man
had urg'd them,) I ſhould think the moſt Judicious that
have been fram'd againſt it, I Humbly repreſented to him,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49364:9"/>
that I look'd upon this Invention as Comprizing two differing
things; a <hi>Mechanical</hi> part, which related to the Engine
it ſelf, and the uſe of it a Ship-board, and a <hi>Phyſical</hi>
part which concerns the Potableneſs and Wholſomneſs of the
Liquor. About the former of theſe I did not pretend to clear
the Difficulties, eſpecially ſuch ſtrong ones, as His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
had propos'd; but left it to the <hi>Patentees</hi> to give
Him Satisfaction, which they were in a readineſs to offer.
But as to the Wholſomneſs of the prepar'd Water, I had
made ſome Tryals upon that Liquor, which gave me no juſt
grounds of ſuſpecting it to be unwholſome, but ſeveral
motives to believe it well condition'd, and of great uſe to
<hi>Navigators,</hi> and not to them only. And having hereupon
briefly acquainted His Majeſty with the chief Tryals I had
made to examine this <hi>Sweetned Water,</hi> He was pleas'd to
look upon them as Satisfactory, and [vouchſaf<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d on that
occaſion to diſcourſe as a <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> of the Sea and Brackiſh-Waters,
and gave me ſome new, as well inſtructive Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
about them: and in concluſion, diſmis'd the
<hi>Patentees</hi> with a Gracious Promiſe of His Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
and peculiar Favour.</p>
            <p>To this ſhort Narrative it now remains, that I briefly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
the chief things that perſwaded me of the Salubrity of
this Water, whence may be juſtly and eaſily inferr'd, the
Utility the Publick may receive by a cheap and eaſy way of
preparing it.) <hi>Firſt,</hi> then I conſider'd that almoſt all the
Rain-water that falls from the Clouds on the Main Ocean, and
which (except perhaps in very few places in torrid Climates)
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49364:9"/>
is unqueſtionably receiv'd as wholſom, muſt be afforded by
the Sea, and conſequently be but Sea-water free'd from its
Salt (according to the Famous Motto, <hi>Redit Agmine dulci)
Next</hi> I found, (as His Majeſty Himſelf had done,) that
the Liquor was well taſted, and without any ſenſible Brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſhneſs;
and ſo ſome of it continued for between 4 or 5
Months in a large Cryſtal Bottle, that I purpoſely kept
un-ſtopt, and for the moſt part in a <hi>South</hi> Window, where
it neither did, nor probably in a long time, will putrifie, or
ſo much as appear troubled or leſs tranſparent; during
which time it was with Approbation taſted and ſmell'd by
ſeveral Learned Phyſicians of the Famous Colledge of
<hi>London. Thirdly,</hi> I found it laver very well, which
moſt Pump-waters, and many others that have ſome little
(tho' unperceiv'd) common Salt in them, will not do. <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
this Water will boyl Peaſe tender, which amongſt Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
is one of the principal ſigns of good Water. <hi>Fifthly,</hi>
In very good Ballances with an Inſtrument that I purpoſely
caus'd to be made for the nice weighing of Liquors, I
found this Water far leſs heavy than one would expect, for
if it differ'd at all in weight from the like quantity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distil'd
Water, (I ſpeak with an <hi>If,</hi> becauſe it is far more
difficult to be exact in ſuch nice Tryals, than the unpractic'd
will imagine) the difference was not conſiderable, being but 1
part in 400; and that difference is very ſmall in compariſon
of that which <hi>Navigators</hi> and Learned Authors relate to be
obſervable in natural Waters, all of them good and potable:
I might tell you on this occaſion; that the laſt great <hi>Duke
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49364:10"/>
of Tuſcany,</hi> who was an Eminent <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> and the
<hi>Patron</hi> of the Celebrated <hi>Academy</hi> of the <hi>Lyncean Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers</hi>
is affirm'd among other prudent courſes that he
took for his Health, whereof he was very Solicitous to have
conſtantly made uſe of Diſtill'd Water for his own Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And I could add other things favourable enough to
the <hi>Patentees</hi> Water, if Haſte, and perhaps Diſcretion
too, did not oblige me to leave them yet unmention'd, that I
might now have time to ſay ſomewhat of the main thing of
all that convinced me of the <hi>Saltleſſneſs</hi> of the Water I ſpeak
of. I conſider'd then, <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That the thing that was
aim'd at by thoſe Ingenious men, that at differing times,
and in ſeveral Countries have attempted to make Sea-water
Sweet, and the thing that was requir<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d by propoſing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences,
or otherwiſe to Encourage the Makers of ſuch At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
was to Free the Sea-water from the Brackiſhneſs
without any Noxious Additament: ſo that on all ſides it
was taken for granted, that the only thing that kept the
Sea-water from being ſafely Potable, was its Brackiſhneſs.
From which Reflection it was natural for Me to infer a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
very favourable to our prepar'd Water: For having
long ſince written a ſhort Diſcourſe of the <hi>Saltneſs of the
Sea;</hi> I had been Induſtrious to deviſe ways of comparing
Waters in point of Brackiſhneſs. And by theſe I found the
<hi>Patentees</hi> Water to be more free from Common-ſalt, than
Waters that are uſually Drunk here in <hi>London,</hi> of which
I remember I ſhew'd thoſe Gentlemen an Experiment that
ſurpriz'd as well as convinc'd them. And that which more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49364:10"/>
me my ſelf, was a Tryal that I carefully made by a way
which having mention'd, but not yet (for want of opportunity
diſclos'd to His Majeſty, the Reſpect I owe Him forbids me
to impart without His leave: On which account I hope you I
be content to be at preſent aſſur'd, of theſe two Things; One,
that by this way of Tryal, I found, (what poſſibly you will
think ſtrange;) that if there were in Water, ſo much as
one Grain of Salt, in above two Ounces of Water, I could
readily diſcover it. The other, that even by this Critical
<hi>Examen,</hi> I could not detect ſo much as a Thouſandth part
of Salt in Our Prepar'd Water; whereas I found by Tryals
purpoſely and carefully made, that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sea-Water
contain'd a 44, or <hi>45th.</hi> part of good dry Salt; or, which
is all one, that 44 Pints, or near ſo many Pounds of
<hi>Marine</hi> Water, would yield about one Pound of dry Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Salt.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Sir,</hi> you have a ſhort and Art-leſs Account, ſuch
as my haſt will permit, and the nature of the Subject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
of my part in promoting this Profitable Invention;
to which I own my ſelf a great well-wiſher, not out of any
private Intereſt (tho that was obligingly proffer'd me by the
<hi>Patentees,)</hi> but as I think the bringing it into general uſe
may prove a real Service to Mankind, upon the Score of
