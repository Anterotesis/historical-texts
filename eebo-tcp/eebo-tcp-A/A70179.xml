            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are a ſort of
<hi>narrow,</hi> and <hi>confin'd
Spirits,</hi> who account
all Diſcourſes <hi>needleſs,</hi> that
are not for their particular
<hi>purpoſes;</hi> and judge all the
world to be of the <hi>Size,</hi> and
<hi>Genius</hi> of thoſe within the
<hi>Circle</hi> of their Knowledge,
and Acquaintance: ſo that
with a <hi>pert</hi> and <hi>pragmatical
Inſolence,</hi> they cenſure all
the <hi>braver Deſigns,</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices</hi>
that lie beyond their
Ken, as <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb facs="tcp:53430:4"/>
Speculations.</hi> An <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,</hi>
and <hi>proud Injuſtice;</hi>
as if this ſort were the only
perſons, whoſe humour, and
deeds ſhould be conſulted.
And hence it comes to paſs,
that the <hi>greateſt</hi> and <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt</hi>
things that are written,
or ſaid, do alwayes meet with
the moſt general <hi>neglect,</hi> and
<hi>ſcorn;</hi> ſince the <hi>little people</hi>
for whom they were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
are quick to <hi>ſhoot</hi>
their <hi>bolt,</hi> and to condemn
what they do not <hi>underſtand,</hi>
and <hi>becauſe</hi> they <hi>do</hi> not.
Whereas on the other ſide,
thoſe that are able to <hi>judge,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:53430:4"/>
and would <hi>incourage,</hi> are
commonly <hi>reſerv'd</hi> and <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,</hi>
in paſsing judgments;
or, if they ſhould endeavour
to do right to things that are
worthy, they are ſure to be
out-voiced by the <hi>rout</hi> of <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant</hi>
contemners. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon
which accounts I have often
thought, that he that courts
and values <hi>popular</hi> eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
takes not the right way,
if he endeavour at any thing
that is <hi>really excellent;</hi> but
he muſt ſtudy the <hi>little plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities,</hi>
and accomodate
the humour of the <hi>MANY,</hi>
who are <hi>active Miniſters</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:53430:5"/>
                     <hi>Fame;</hi> being <hi>zealous,</hi> and
<hi>loud</hi> in their <hi>applauſes,</hi> as
they are <hi>clamorous</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous</hi>
in their <hi>oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
As for <hi>theſe,</hi> 'tis one of
my chief cares to make my
ſelf as much unconcern'd at
<hi>their cenſures,</hi> as I am at the
<hi>cacklings</hi> of a <hi>Flock</hi> of
<hi>Geeſe,</hi> or at the <hi>eager</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
of thoſe little <hi>ſnarl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Animals, that are <hi>angry</hi>
when I paſs by them. And
(if that may ſignifie any thing
to keep them from troubling
themſelves about the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>CONSIDERATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS</hi>)
I deſire they would
<pb facs="tcp:53430:5"/>
take notice from me, that I
writ not thoſe things for ſuch
as they; and they will do
well to throw up the Book
upon this <hi>Advertiſement,</hi>
except they will ſtay to hear,
That though <hi>Philoſophical</hi>
Diſcourſes to juſtifie the
common belief about <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
are nothing at all to
<hi>them,</hi> or thoſe of <hi>their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;</hi>
yet they are too <hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,</hi>
and <hi>neceſſary</hi> for
our Age, in which <hi>Atheiſm</hi>
is begun in <hi>Sadduciſm.</hi> And
thoſe that dare not bluntly
ſay, There is NO GOD,
content themſelves, (for a
<pb facs="tcp:53430:6"/>
fair <hi>ſtep,</hi> and <hi>Introduction</hi>)
to deny there are <hi>SPIRITS,</hi>
or <hi>WITCHES.</hi> Which
ſort of <hi>Infidels,</hi> though they
are not ordinary among the
<hi>meer vulgar,</hi> yet are they
numerous in a little higher
rank of <hi>underſtandings.</hi> And
thoſe that know any thing of
the world, know, That moſt of
the looſer <hi>Gentry,</hi> and the
little pretenders to <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi>
and <hi>Wit,</hi> are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deriders of the <hi>belief</hi> of
<hi>Witches,</hi> and <hi>Apparitions.</hi>
And were this a ſlight or
meer ſpeculative miſtake, I
ſhould not trouble my ſelf, or
<pb facs="tcp:53430:6"/>
them about it. But I fear
this error hath a <hi>core</hi> in it
that is worſe than <hi>Hereſie:</hi>
And therefore how little
ſoever I care what men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
or teach in matters of
<hi>opinion,</hi> I think I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to be concern'd in an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
that toucheth ſo near
upon the greateſt intereſts of
Religion. And really I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſht
ſometimes to think in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
what a kinde of <hi>Age</hi> we
are fallen, in which ſome of
the <hi>greateſt impieties</hi> are
accounted but <hi>Buggs,</hi> and
<hi>terrible Names, inviſible
Titles,</hi> Piccadillo's or Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera's.
<pb facs="tcp:53430:7"/>
The ſad and greateſt
inſtances, are SACRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEDGE,
REBEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LION,
and VVITCH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRAFT.
For the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
there are a ſort of men
(that are far from being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
enemies to Religion) who,
I do not know whether they
<hi>own</hi> any ſuch vices. VVe
finde no mention of them in
their moſt particular <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,</hi>
nor have I obſerved
them in thoſe Sermons that
have contained the largeſt
<hi>Catalogues</hi> of the <hi>Sins</hi> of
our Age, and Nation.
<hi>'Twere dangerous to ſpeak
<pb facs="tcp:53430:7"/>
of them as ſins, for fear who
ſhould be found guilty.</hi>
But my buſineſs at preſent is
not with <hi>theſe,</hi> but the other,
VVITCHCRAFT, which I
am ſure was a <hi>Sin</hi> of elder
times; and how comes it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
that <hi>this Age,</hi> which
ſo much out-does them in all
<hi>other</hi> kindes of <hi>wickedneſs,</hi>
ſhould be wholly <hi>innocent</hi> in
this? That there <hi>MAY</hi> be
VVITCHES and <hi>Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
in our dayes, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the <hi>Objections</hi> of
the <hi>Modern Sadduce,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
I have made appear in
the <hi>CONSIDERATIONS</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:53430:8"/>
following; in which I did
not primarily intend direct
<hi>proof,</hi> but DEFENCE,
as the Title of the <hi>firſt Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
which is reſtor'd in <hi>this</hi>
mention'd. But I have now
added the evidence of the
<hi>Divine Oracles,</hi> and <hi>two
Relations</hi> of <hi>Fact,</hi> that are
clear and unexceptionable. I
have no humour nor delight
in telling Stories, and do not
publiſh <hi>theſe,</hi> for the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of thoſe that have;
but I record them as <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
for the <hi>confirmation</hi>
of a Truth, which hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
been atteſted by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
<pb facs="tcp:53430:8"/>
of the like evidences in
all places, and times: But
things REMOTE, or <hi>long
paſt,</hi> are either not <hi>believed,</hi>
or <hi>forgotten:</hi> whereas <hi>theſe</hi>
being <hi>freſh,</hi> and <hi>near,</hi> and
attended with all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of <hi>credibility,</hi> it
may be expected, they ſhould
have the more ſucceſs upon
the <hi>obſtinacy</hi> of <hi>Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi>

Witchcraft:
In a LETTER to
Robert Hunt, Eſquire.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE FREQUENT and
<hi>late</hi> dealings you have had in
the <hi>Examination</hi> of <hi>Witches,</hi>
and the regards of one that hath
a very particular honour for you, have
brought you the trouble of ſome CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIDERATIONS
on the Subject.
And though what I have to ſay, be but the
<hi>careleſs</hi> and <hi>haſty</hi> product of a ſitting or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53430:10"/>
two; yet I hope it may afford you ſome,
not unreaſonable, accounts of the odde
<hi>phoenomena</hi> of <hi>Witchcraft</hi> and <hi>Faſcinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and contribute to the DEFENCE
of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>certainty</hi> of matters,
which you <hi>know</hi> by <hi>Experiments</hi> that
could not <hi>deceive;</hi> in ſpite of the <hi>little
exceptions</hi> of thoſe that are reſolved to
believe nothing in affairs of this nature.</p>
                  <p>AND if any thing were to be much
<hi>admired</hi> in an <hi>Age</hi> of <hi>Wonders,</hi> not only
of <hi>Nature</hi> (which is a <hi>conſtant Prodigy</hi>)
but of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Manners;</hi> it would be to
me matter of <hi>Aſtoniſhment,</hi> that <hi>Men,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<hi>witty</hi> and <hi>ingenious,</hi> are fallen
into the conceit that there's <hi>no ſuch thing</hi>
as a <hi>Witch</hi> or <hi>Apparition,</hi> but that theſe
are the <hi>creatures</hi> of <hi>Melancholly</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,</hi>
foſter'd by <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>deſign;</hi>
which, comparing the <hi>confidence</hi> of their
<hi>disbelief</hi> with the <hi>evidence</hi> of the <hi>things
denied,</hi> and the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of their <hi>grounds,</hi>
would almoſt ſuggeſt, that themſelves are
an <hi>argument</hi> of what they <hi>deny;</hi> and that
ſo confident an Opinion could not be held
upon ſuch inducements, but by ſome kind
of <hi>Witchcraft</hi> and <hi>Faſcination</hi> in the <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi>
And perhaps that <hi>evil Spirit,</hi> whoſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53430:10"/>
                     <hi>influences</hi> they will not allow in Actions
aſcribed to ſuch Cauſes, hath a greater
hand and intereſt in their <hi>Propoſition</hi> than
they are aware of. For that <hi>ſubtil</hi> enemy
of Mankinde (ſince <hi>Providence</hi> will not
permit him to miſchief us without our
own <hi>concurrence</hi>) attempts that by <hi>ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem</hi>
and <hi>artifice,</hi> which he could never
effect by <hi>open</hi> wayes of acting; and the
ſucceſs of all <hi>wiles</hi> depending upon their
<hi>ſecrecy</hi> and <hi>concealment,</hi> his <hi>influence</hi> is
never more <hi>dangerous</hi> than when his <hi>agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
is leaſt <hi>ſuſpected.</hi> In order therefore to
the carrying on the <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>hidden deſigns</hi>
he manageth againſt our Happineſs, and
our Souls, he cannot expect to advantage
himſelf more, than by inſinuating a belief,
<hi>That there is no ſuch thing as himſelf,</hi> but
that <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>fancy</hi> make <hi>Devils</hi> now, as
they did <hi>Gods</hi> of old. Nor can he ever
draw the aſſent of men to ſo <hi>dangerous</hi> an
aſſertion, while the <hi>ſtanding ſenſible</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of his <hi>exiſtence</hi> in his practices by
and upon his <hi>inſtruments</hi> are not diſcredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and removed.</p>
                  <p>'Tis doubtleſs therefore the intereſt of
this <hi>Agent</hi> of <hi>darkneſs</hi> to have the world
believe, that the <hi>notion</hi> they have of him
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53430:11"/>
is but a <hi>phantome</hi> and conceit; and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thereunto, That the ſtories of <hi>Witches,
Apparitions,</hi> and indeed every thing that
brings tidings of another world, are but
<hi>melancholick Dreams,</hi> and <hi>pious Romances.</hi>
And when men are arriv'd thus far, to
think there are no <hi>diabolical contracts</hi> or
<hi>apparitions,</hi> their belief that there are ſuch
<hi>Spirits,</hi> reſts only upon their <hi>Faith</hi> and
<hi>Reverence</hi> to the <hi>Divine Oracles,</hi> which
we have little reaſon to apprehend ſo great
in ſuch aſſertors, as to command much
from their aſſent, eſpecially in ſuch things
in which they have <hi>corrupt intereſts</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their <hi>evidence.</hi> So that he that
thinks there is no <hi>Witch,</hi> believes a <hi>Devil
gratis,</hi> or at leaſt upon ſuch inducements
which he is like to finde himſelf diſpoſed
to deny when he pleaſeth. And when
men are arrived to this degree of <hi>diffidence</hi>
and <hi>infidelity,</hi> we are beholden to them
if they believe either <hi>Angel,</hi> or <hi>Spirit, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi>
of the <hi>Body,</hi> or <hi>Immortality</hi> of
<hi>Souls.</hi> Theſe things hang together in a
<hi>Chain</hi> of <hi>connexion,</hi> at leaſt in theſe mens
<hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> and 'tis but an happy chance
if he that hath loſt <hi>one link,</hi> holds another.
So that the vitals of Religion being ſo
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53430:11"/>
much intereſſed in this ſubject, it will not
be impertinent particularly to diſcourſe it.</p>
                  <p>AND in order to the proof that there
have been, and are <hi>unlawful confederacies</hi>
with <hi>evil ſpirits,</hi> by vertue of which the
<hi>helliſh accomplices</hi> perform things above
their natural powers; I muſt premiſe,
that this being <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Fact,</hi> is only ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the evidence of <hi>authority</hi> and
<hi>ſenſe:</hi> And by both theſe, the being of
<hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>diabolical contracts,</hi> is moſt
abundantly confirm'd. All <hi>Hiſtories</hi> are
full of the exploits of thoſe <hi>Inſtruments</hi>
of <hi>darkneſs,</hi> and the <hi>teſtimony</hi> of all <hi>Ages,</hi>
not only of the <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>barbarous,</hi> but of
the moſt <hi>civiliz'd</hi> and <hi>poliſh'd</hi> world,
brings tidings of their ſtrange performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
We have the <hi>atteſtation</hi> of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of eye and ear-witneſſes, and thoſe
not of the eaſily deceivable vulgar only,
but of wiſe and grave diſcerners, and that
when no intereſt could oblige them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
together in a common <hi>Lye:</hi> I ſay,
we have the light of all theſe <hi>circumſtances</hi>
to confirm us in the belief of things done
by perſons of deſpicable power and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
beyond the reach of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Nature;</hi> ſtanding publick <hi>Records</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:53430:12"/>
have been kept of theſe well atteſted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and <hi>Epocha</hi>'s made of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted
events. Laws in many Nations
have been enacted againſt thoſe vile pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes;
<hi>thoſe</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> and our
<hi>own</hi> are <hi>notorious;</hi> ſuch caſes have been
often determined near us, by <hi>wiſe</hi> and
<hi>reverend Judges,</hi> upon clear and
convictive evidence: and thouſands in
our own Nation have ſuffered death for
their <hi>vile compacts</hi> with <hi>apoſtate ſpirits.</hi>
All theſe I might largely prove in their
particular inſtances, but that 'tis not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
ſince thoſe that deny the being of
<hi>Witches,</hi> do it not out of ignorance of
theſe Heads of Argument, of which
probably they have heard a thouſand
times; But from an <hi>apprehenſion</hi> that ſuch
a <hi>belief is abſurd,</hi> and the things <hi>impoſsible.</hi>
And upon theſe preſumptions they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
all demonſtrations of this nature, and
are hardened againſt conviction. And I
think, thoſe that can believe all <hi>Hiſtories</hi>
are <hi>Romances,</hi> that all the <hi>wiſer</hi> world
have agreed together to <hi>juggle</hi> mankinde
into a common belief of <hi>ungrounded fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi>
that the <hi>ſound ſenſes</hi> of <hi>multitudes</hi>
together may deceive them, and <hi>Laws</hi> are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53430:12"/>
built upon <hi>Chymera's</hi>; that the <hi>graveſt</hi>
and <hi>wiſeſt Judges</hi> have been <hi>Murderers,</hi>
and the <hi>ſageſt</hi> perſons <hi>Fools,</hi> or <hi>deſigning
Impoſtors:</hi> I ſay, thoſe that can believe
this <hi>heap</hi> of abſurdities, are either more
<hi>credulous</hi> than thoſe whoſe <hi>credulity</hi> they
reprehend, or elſe have ſome <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
evidence</hi> of their perſwaſion, <hi>viz.
That 'tis abſurd and impoſsible there ſhould
be a Witch or Apparition.</hi> And I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
were thoſe <hi>little appearances</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd,
which men have form'd in their
fancies againſt the belief of ſuch things;
their own <hi>evidence</hi> would make its way to
mens <hi>aſſent,</hi> without any more arguments
than what they know already to enforce it.
There is nothing then neceſſary to be done,
in order to the eſtabliſhing the belief I
would reconcile to mens minds; but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the removal of thoſe <hi>prejudices</hi>
they have received againſt it, the chief of
which I ſhall particularly deal with; and
I begin with that <hi>bold Aſſertion,</hi> That</p>

                        <p>TO WHICH <hi>OBJECTION</hi> I <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi>
(1) If the <hi>notion</hi> of a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
be ſo <hi>abſurd</hi> as is pretended, <hi>that</hi> of a
<hi>God,</hi> and a <hi>Soul diſtinct</hi> from <hi>matter,</hi> and
<hi>immortal,</hi> is likewiſe an <hi>abſurdity.</hi> And
then, that the world was <hi>jumbled</hi> into this
<hi>elegant</hi> and <hi>orderly Fabrick</hi> by <hi>chance;</hi> and
that our <hi>Souls</hi> are only <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>Matter,</hi>
that came together we know not <hi>whence,</hi>
nor <hi>how;</hi> and ſhall again ſhortly be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd</hi>
into thoſe <hi>looſe Atoms</hi> that <hi>compound</hi>
them: That all our <hi>conceptions</hi> are but the
<hi>thruſting</hi> of one part of <hi>matter</hi> againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
and the <hi>Idea</hi>'s of our mindes meer
<hi>blind</hi> and <hi>caſual motions:</hi> Theſe and a
thouſand more the groſſeſt <hi>impoſsibilities</hi>
and <hi>abſurdities</hi> (conſequents of this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
That the notion of a Spirit is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd</hi>)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53430:13"/>
will be <hi>ſad certainties</hi> and <hi>demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
And with ſuch Aſſertors I would
ceaſe to diſcourſe about <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions,</hi>
and addreſs my ſelf to obtain
their aſſent to truths infinitely more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred.</p>
                        <p>AND yet (2) though it ſhould be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, that a <hi>ſubſtance immaterial</hi> is as
much a <hi>contradiction</hi> as they can fancy;
yet why ſhould they not believe that the
<hi>Air</hi> and all the <hi>Regions</hi> above us may have
their <hi>inviſible intellectuall Agents,</hi> of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
like unto our <hi>Souls,</hi> be <hi>that</hi> what it
will; and ſome of them at leaſt as much
<hi>degenerate</hi> as the <hi>vileſt</hi> and moſt <hi>miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi>
among <hi>Men.</hi> This <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> will
be enough to ſecure the <hi>poſsibility</hi> of <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
and <hi>Apparitions:</hi> and that all the <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Stories</hi> of the <hi>Univerſe</hi> are furniſh'd
with <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> 'tis infinitely reaſonable
to conclude from the <hi>analogy</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi>
Since we ſee there is nothing ſo contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible
and vile in the world we reſide in,
but hath its living creatures that dwell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Water,</hi> the <hi>inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Air;</hi> the <hi>Bodies</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> the <hi>fleſh,</hi>
the <hi>skin,</hi> the <hi>entrails;</hi> the <hi>leaves,</hi> the
<hi>roots,</hi> the <hi>ſtalks</hi> of <hi>Vegetables;</hi> yea, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53430:14"/>
all kinde of <hi>Minerals</hi> in the <hi>ſubterraneous
Regions:</hi> I ſay, all theſe have their <hi>proper
Inhabitants;</hi> yea, I ſuppoſe this Rule
may hold in all diſtinct kindes of bodies in
the world, <hi>That they have their peculiar
Animals.</hi> The certainty of which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the improvement of <hi>microſcopical ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations</hi>
will diſcover. From whence
I infer, That ſince this little <hi>ſpot</hi> is ſo <hi>thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
peopled</hi> in every <hi>Atome</hi> of it, 'tis weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to think that all the <hi>vaſt ſpaces</hi> above,
and <hi>hollows</hi> under ground, are <hi>deſert</hi> and
<hi>uninhabited.</hi> And if both the <hi>ſuperiour</hi>
and <hi>lower Continents</hi> of the <hi>Univerſe</hi> have
their inhabitants alſo, 'tis exceedingly <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,</hi>
arguing from the ſame <hi>analogy,</hi>
that they are all of the meer <hi>ſenſible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
but that there are at leaſt ſome of
the <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Intellectual</hi> Orders.
Which ſuppoſed, there is good foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the belief of <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
though the <hi>notion</hi> of a <hi>Spirit</hi> ſhould
prove as <hi>abſurd</hi> and <hi>unphiloſophical,</hi> as I
judge the denyal of it. And ſo this firſt
Objection comes to nothing. I deſcend then
to the ſecond <hi>Prejudice,</hi> which may be
thus formed in behalf of the <hi>Objectors.</hi>

of thoſe <hi>Relations</hi> aſcribed to
<hi>Witches,</hi> which are <hi>ridiculous</hi> and <hi>impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi>
in the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>things;</hi> ſuch are (1)
their <hi>flying</hi> out of <hi>windows,</hi> after they

(2) Their <hi>transformation</hi> into Cats,

<hi>confirmations</hi> are they to me of the <hi>truth</hi>
of thoſe <hi>Relations,</hi> and the <hi>reality</hi> of what

circumſtances being exceeding <hi>unlikely,</hi>
judging by the meaſures of common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
'tis the greater probability they are
not <hi>fictitious;</hi> For the <hi>contrivers</hi> of <hi>Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
uſe to form them as near as they can

endeavouring to make them look as

Romance,</hi> it cannot be ſuppoſed
that all <hi>Travellers</hi> that come into thoſe

There is large <hi>field</hi> in <hi>fiction;</hi> and if all

                           <pb n="13" facs="tcp:53430:15"/>
doubtleſs the firſt <hi>Romancers</hi> would
have framed them more agreeable to the
common doctrine of <hi>Spirits;</hi> at leaſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
theſe <hi>ſuppoſed abſurdities</hi> had been a
thouſand times laugh'd at, people by this
time would have learn'd to correct thoſe
<hi>obnoxious extravagancies;</hi> and though
they have not yet more <hi>veracity</hi> than the
Ages of <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Superſtition,</hi> yet

of <hi>Witches,</hi> and preſumed <hi>impoſsible</hi>
are not aſcribed to their own powers; but
to the Agency of thoſe <hi>wicked Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi>
they imploy: And to affirm that thoſe
<hi>evil ſpirits</hi> cannot do that which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
<hi>impoſsible,</hi> is boldly to ſtint the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Creatures, whoſe natures and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
we know not; and to meaſure the
<hi>world</hi> of <hi>ſpirits</hi> by the <hi>narrow</hi> rules of our
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53430:16"/>
own <hi>impotent beings.</hi> We ſee among our
ſelves the performances of <hi>ſome</hi> out go the
<hi>conceits</hi> and <hi>poſsibilities</hi> of <hi>others;</hi> and we
know many things may be done by the
<hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and <hi>Mechanick Artifice,</hi>
which common heads think <hi>impoſsible</hi> to
be effected by the <hi>honeſt</hi> wayes of <hi>Art</hi> and
<hi>Nature.</hi> And doubtleſs the <hi>ſubtilties</hi> and
<hi>powers</hi> of thoſe <hi>miſchievous Fiends</hi> are
as much beyond the <hi>reach</hi> and <hi>activities</hi>
of the moſt <hi>knowing Agents</hi> among us, as
theirs are beyond the wit and ability of the
moſt <hi>ruſtick</hi> and <hi>illiterate;</hi> So that the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
that any mans reaſon in the world can
amount to in this particular, is only this,
that he cannot <hi>conceive</hi> how ſuch things
can be performed; which only argues the
<hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>imperfection</hi> of our <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
and <hi>apprehenſions,</hi> not the <hi>impoſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
of thoſe performances; and we can
no more from hence form an argument
againſt <hi>them,</hi> than againſt the moſt <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
effects</hi> in <hi>Nature.</hi> We cannot conceive
how the <hi>Foetus</hi> is <hi>form'd</hi> in the <hi>Womb,</hi> nor
as much as how a <hi>Plant</hi> ſprings from the
<hi>Earth</hi> we tread on; we know not how our
<hi>Souls move</hi> the <hi>Body,</hi> nor how theſe <hi>diſtant</hi>
and <hi>extream natures</hi> are <hi>united:</hi> And if
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53430:16"/>
we are <hi>ignorant</hi> of the moſt <hi>obvious</hi> things
about us, and the moſt <hi>conſiderable within</hi>
our ſelves, 'tis then no wonder that we
know not the <hi>conſtitution</hi> and <hi>powers</hi> of the
<hi>Creatures,</hi> to whom we are ſuch ſtrangers.
Briefly then, <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>fact</hi> well proved
ought not to be <hi>denied,</hi> becauſe we cannot
<hi>conceive</hi> how they can be performed. Nor
is it a reaſonable method of inference, firſt
to <hi>preſume</hi> the thing <hi>impoſsible,</hi> and thence
to conclude that the <hi>fact</hi> cannot be <hi>proved.</hi>
On the contrary, we ſhould judge of the
<hi>action</hi> by the <hi>evidence,</hi> and not the <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
by the <hi>meaſures</hi> of our <hi>fancies</hi> about
the <hi>action.</hi> This is proudly to exalt our
own <hi>opinions</hi> above the <hi>cleareſt teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
and moſt <hi>ſenſible demonſtrations</hi> of
<hi>fact:</hi> and ſo to give the <hi>Lye</hi> to all <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi>
rather than diſtruſt the little <hi>conceits</hi>
of our <hi>bold imaginations.</hi> But yet further,</p>
                        <p>(3) I THINK there is nothing in the
<hi>inſtances</hi> mention'd, but what may as well
be accounted for by the Rules of <hi>Reaſon</hi>
and <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> as the ordinary affairs of
<hi>Nature.</hi> For in reſolving <hi>natural Phoeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi>
we can only aſſign the <hi>probable
cauſes,</hi> ſhewing how things <hi>may be,</hi> not
preſuming how they <hi>are.</hi> And in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53430:17"/>
under our <hi>Examen,</hi> we may give
an account how 'tis <hi>poſsible,</hi> and not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,</hi>
that ſuch things (though ſomewhat
varying from the common <hi>rode</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi>)
may be acted. And if our narrow and
contracted mindes can furniſh us with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of the way and manner of
ſuch performances, though perhaps not
the true ones, 'tis an argument that ſuch
things may be effected by creatures, whoſe
powers and knowledge are ſo vaſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
ours. I ſhall endeavour therefore
briefly to ſuggeſt ſome things that may
render the <hi>poſsibility</hi> of theſe performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<hi>conceivable,</hi> in order to the removal
of this <hi>Objection,</hi> that they are <hi>contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
and <hi>impoſsible.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>FOR the <hi>Firſt</hi> then, That the <hi>confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Spirit</hi> ſhould <hi>tranſport</hi> the <hi>Witch</hi>
through the Air to the place of general
<hi>Rendezvous,</hi> there is no difficulty in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it; and if that be true which great
Philoſophers affirm concerning the real
<hi>ſeparability</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> from the <hi>Body</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>death,</hi> there is yet <hi>leſs;</hi> for then 'tis
eaſie to apprehend, that the <hi>Soul,</hi> having
left its groſs and <hi>ſluggiſh Body</hi> behinde it,
and being cloath'd only with its <hi>immediate
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53430:17"/>
vehicle</hi> of <hi>Air,</hi> or more <hi>ſubtile matter,</hi>
may be quickly conducted to any place it
would be at, by thoſe <hi>officious Spirits</hi> that
attend it. And though I adventure to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
nothing concerning the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
of this <hi>ſuppoſition,</hi> yet I muſt needs
ſay, it doth not ſeem to me <hi>unreaſonable.</hi>
And our experience of <hi>Apoplexies, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſies,
Extaſtes,</hi> and the ſtrange things
men report to have ſeen during thoſe <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquiums,</hi>
look <hi>favourably</hi> upon this <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture;</hi>
which ſeems to me to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
no <hi>principle</hi> of <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Philoſophy;</hi>
ſince <hi>Death</hi> conſiſts not ſo much in the
<hi>actual ſeparation</hi> of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> as in
the <hi>indiſpoſition</hi> and <hi>unfitneſs</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi>
for <hi>vital union,</hi> as an excellent Philoſopher
hath made good. On which <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi>
the <hi>Witches anointing</hi> her ſelf before ſhe
takes her flight, may perhaps ſerve to
keep the Body <hi>tenantable,</hi> and in fit <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi>
to receive the <hi>Spirit</hi> at its return.
Theſe things, I ſay, we may conceive,
though I affirm nothing about them; and
there is nothing in ſuch <hi>conceptions</hi> but
what hath been own'd by men of worth
and name, and may ſeem <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable</hi>
enough to thoſe who judge not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53430:18"/>
altogether by the meaſures of the <hi>popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi>
and <hi>cuſtomary opinion.</hi> And there's
a ſaying of a great <hi>Apoſtle</hi> that ſeems to
countenance this <hi>Platonick opinion;</hi>
what is the meaning elſe of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion:
<hi>[Whether in the body or out of
the body I cannot tell]</hi> except the <hi>Soul</hi> may
be <hi>ſeparated</hi> from the <hi>body</hi> without <hi>death;</hi>
which if it be granted <hi>poſsible,</hi> 'tis ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for my purpoſe. And</p>
                        <p>(2.) The <hi>Transformations</hi> of <hi>Witches</hi>
into the <hi>ſhapes</hi> of other <hi>Animals,</hi> upon
the ſame <hi>ſuppoſal</hi> is very <hi>conceivable,</hi> ſince
then 'tis eaſie enough to imagine, that the
<hi>power</hi> of <hi>imagination</hi> may form thoſe <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi>
and <hi>pliable vehicles</hi> into thoſe <hi>ſhapes,</hi>
with more eaſe than the <hi>fancy</hi> of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
can the ſtubborn <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>Foetus</hi>
in the womb, as we ſee it frequently doth
in the inſtances that occur of <hi>Signatures</hi>
and <hi>monſtrous Singularities;</hi> and perhaps
ſometimes the <hi>confederate Spirit</hi> puts <hi>tricks</hi>
upon the <hi>ſenſes</hi> of the <hi>ſpectators,</hi> and
thoſe <hi>ſhapes</hi> are only <hi>illuſions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT then (3.) when they feel the
<hi>hurts</hi> in their <hi>groſs</hi> bodies, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in their <hi>aiery vehicles,</hi> they muſt be
ſuppoſed to have been <hi>really</hi> preſent, at
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53430:18"/>
leaſt in theſe latter; and 'tis no more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to apprehend how the hurts of <hi>thoſe</hi>
ſhould be tranſlated upon their <hi>other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
then how <hi>diſeaſes</hi> ſhould be <hi>inflicted</hi>
by the <hi>imagination,</hi> or how the <hi>fancy</hi> of
the <hi>Mother</hi> ſhould wound the <hi>Foetus,</hi> as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
credible relations do atteſt.</p>
                        <p>AND (4.) for their <hi>raiſing ſtorms</hi> and
<hi>tempeſts,</hi> they do it not, be ſure, by their
<hi>own,</hi> but by the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> of the
<hi>Air,</hi> their <hi>friend</hi> and <hi>allie;</hi> and the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi>
that are enjoyn'd them, are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
nothing elſe but <hi>entertainments</hi> for
their <hi>imaginations,</hi> and are likely deſign'd
to perſwade them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>they do</hi> theſe ſtrange
things <hi>themſelves.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AND (laſtly) for their being <hi>ſuck'd</hi> by
the <hi>Familiar,</hi> I ſay (1) we know ſo little
of the nature of <hi>Doemons</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> that
'tis no wonder we cannot certainly divine
the reaſon of ſo ſtrange an action. And
yet (2) we may conjecture at ſome things
that may render it leſs <hi>improbable.</hi> For
ſome have thought that the <hi>Genii</hi> (whom
both the <hi>Platonical</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
thought <hi>embodied</hi>) are recreated by the
<hi>reeks</hi> and <hi>vapours</hi> of <hi>humane blood,</hi> and
the <hi>ſpirits</hi> that derive from them. Which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53430:19"/>
ſuppoſal (if we grant them bodies) is not
unlikely, every thing being <hi>refreſh'd</hi> and
<hi>nouriſh'd</hi> by its like. And that they are
not perfectly <hi>abſtract</hi> from all <hi>body</hi> and
<hi>matter,</hi> beſides the reverence we owe to
the wiſeſt antiquity, there are ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
arguments I could alledge to
render it exceeding probable. Which
things ſuppoſed, the <hi>Devil's ſucking</hi> the
<hi>Sorcereſs</hi> is no great wonder, nor difficult
to be accounted for. Or perhaps (3) this
may be only a <hi>diabolical Sacrament</hi> and
<hi>Ceremony</hi> to confirm the <hi>helliſh covenant.</hi>
To which I added, (4) That which to me
ſeems moſt <hi>probable,</hi> viz That the <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar</hi>
doth not only <hi>ſuck</hi> the <hi>Witch,</hi> but in
the action infuſeth ſome <hi>poiſonous ferment</hi>
into her, which gives her <hi>imagination</hi> and
<hi>ſpirits</hi> a <hi>magical tincture,</hi> whereby they
become <hi>miſchievouſly influential:</hi> and the
word <hi>venefica</hi> intimates ſome ſuch matter.
Now that the <hi>imagination</hi> hath a mighty
power in <hi>operation,</hi> is ſeen in the juſt now
mention'd <hi>Signatures</hi> and <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> that it
cauſeth; and that the <hi>fancy</hi> is <hi>modified</hi> by
the <hi>qualities</hi> of the <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>ſpirits,</hi> is too
evident to need proof: which things ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
'tis plain to conceive that the <hi>evil
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53430:19"/>
ſpirit</hi> having <hi>breath'd</hi> ſome <hi>vile vapour</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Witch,</hi> it may <hi>taint</hi> her
<hi>blood</hi> and <hi>ſpirits</hi> with a <hi>noxious quality,</hi> by
which her <hi>infected imagination,</hi> heightned
by <hi>melancholly,</hi> and this <hi>worſe cauſe,</hi> may
do much hurt upon <hi>bodies</hi> that are impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
by ſuch <hi>influences.</hi> And 'tis very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that this <hi>ferment</hi> diſpoſeth the <hi>imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the <hi>Sorcereſs</hi> to cauſe the mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, or <hi>ſeparation</hi> of the <hi>ſoul</hi> from
the <hi>body,</hi> and may perhaps keep the <hi>body</hi> in
fit temper for <hi>its re-entry;</hi> as alſo it may
facilitate <hi>transformation,</hi> which, it may
be, could not be effected by <hi>ordinary</hi> and
<hi>unaſsiſted imagination.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus we ſee 'tis not ſo deſperate to
form an apprehenſion of the manner of
theſe odde performances; and though
they are not done the way I have deſcrib'd,
yet what I have ſaid may help us to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of the poſſibility, which ſufficeth for
my purpoſe. And though the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi>
I have gone upon will ſeem as unlikely to
ſome, as the things they attempt to explain
are to others, yet I muſt deſire their leave
to ſuggeſt, that moſt things ſeem <hi>unlikely</hi>
(eſpecially to the <hi>conceited</hi> and <hi>opiniona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>)
at firſt <hi>propoſal;</hi> and many great
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53430:20"/>
                           <hi>truths</hi> are <hi>ſtrange</hi> and <hi>improbable,</hi> till <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi>
and <hi>acquaintance</hi> have reconciled
them to our fancies. And I'le preſume to
adde on this occaſion, (though I love not
to be <hi>confident</hi> in <hi>affirming</hi>) that there is
none of the <hi>Platonical ſuppoſals</hi> I have

againſt the being of <hi>Witches,</hi>
which is, That 'tis very improbable that the

ſhould be at the beck of a poor <hi>Hag,</hi> and
have ſo little to do, as to attend the errands
of the <hi>impotent luſts</hi> of a <hi>ſilly old woman.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="response">
                        <p>TO WHICH I might anſwer, (1)
That 'tis much more <hi>improbable</hi> that
all the <hi>world</hi> ſhould be <hi>deceiv'd</hi> in <hi>matters</hi>
of <hi>fact;</hi> and circumſtances of the cleareſt

evidence and conviction; than that the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi>
who is <hi>wicked,</hi> ſhould be alſo <hi>unwiſe;</hi>
and that he that perſwades all his ſubjects
and accomplices out of their wits, ſhould
himſelf act like his own temptations and
perſwaſions. In brief, there is nothing
more ſtrange in this objection, than that
<hi>wickedneſs</hi> is <hi>baſeneſs</hi> and <hi>ſervility,</hi> and
that the <hi>Devil</hi> is at leaſure to ſerve thoſe

that the <hi>Devil</hi> ſhould have the liberty of

And to this conjecture I'le adventure to
ſubjoyn another, which alſo hath its <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
viz.</hi> (3) That 'tis not impoſſible

conſtitution and nature, and none of thoſe
that were once of the higheſt <hi>Hierarchy,</hi>
now degenerated into the ſpirits we call
<hi>Devils.</hi> And for my part I muſt confeſs,
that I think the common <hi>diviſion</hi> of <hi>ſpirits</hi>
much too <hi>general;</hi> conceiving it likely
there may be as great a <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual</hi>

there is of <hi>Animals</hi> in the <hi>viſible:</hi> and
that all the <hi>ſuperiour,</hi> yea, and <hi>inferiour</hi>

we are all under, and the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard</hi>
we run of being eternally miſerable
and undone; theſe, I ſay, are things that
can hardly be made <hi>conſiſtent</hi> with that
<hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> that we are ſure hath
<hi>made,</hi> and <hi>mingled</hi> it ſelf with all things.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53430:22"/>
And yet we believe there is a <hi>beauty</hi> and
<hi>harmony,</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> in that <hi>Providence,</hi>
though we cannot <hi>unriddle</hi> it in <hi>particular
inſtances;</hi> nor, by reaſon of our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and imperfection, clear it from <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
appearances;</hi> and conſequently,
we ought not to deny the being of <hi>Witches</hi>
and <hi>Apparitions,</hi> becauſe they will create
us ſome difficulties in our <hi>notions</hi> of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi>
But to come more cloſe, (2)
Thoſe that believe that <hi>Infants</hi> are <hi>Heirs</hi>
of <hi>Hell,</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Devil</hi> as ſoon
as they are <hi>diſcloſed</hi> to the world, cannot
certainly offer ſuch an objection; for
what is a little <hi>trifling pain</hi> of a moment,
to thoſe <hi>eternal tortures,</hi> to which, if they
<hi>die as ſoon</hi> as they are <hi>born,</hi> according to
the tenour of this Doctrine, they are <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly
expoſed?</hi> But however the caſe
ſtands as to <hi>that,</hi> 'tis certain, (3) That
<hi>Providence</hi> hath, not ſecur'd them from
other <hi>violences</hi> they are obnoxious to, from
<hi>cruelty</hi> and <hi>accident;</hi> and yet we accuſe <hi>It</hi>
not when a whole Townful of <hi>Innocents</hi>
fall a <hi>Victim</hi> to the <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>ferity</hi> of <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
executioners</hi> in <hi>wars</hi> and <hi>Maſſacres.</hi>
To which I adde (4) That 'tis likely the
<hi>miſchief</hi> is not ſo often done by the <hi>evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53430:23"/>
immediately,</hi> but by the <hi>malignant</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of the <hi>Sorcereſs,</hi> whoſe <hi>power</hi> of
hurting conſiſts in the fore-mention'd <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
which is <hi>infuſed</hi> into her by the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar.</hi>
So that I am apt to think there
may be a <hi>power</hi> of <hi>real faſcination</hi> in the
<hi>Witches eyes</hi> and <hi>imagination,</hi> by which for
the moſt part ſhe acts upon <hi>tender</hi> bodies.
<hi>Neſcio quis teneros oculus</hi>—For the
<hi>peſtilential ſpirits</hi> being darted by a <hi>ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
and <hi>vigorous imagination</hi> from the <hi>eye,</hi>
and meeting with <hi>thoſe</hi> that are <hi>weak</hi> and
<hi>paſsive</hi> in the bodies which they enter,
will not fail to <hi>infect</hi> them with a <hi>noxious
quality,</hi> that makes <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>ſtrange
alterations</hi> in the perſon invaded by this
<hi>poyſonous influence:</hi> which way of acting
by <hi>ſubtil</hi> and <hi>inviſible inſtruments,</hi> is <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi>
and <hi>familiar</hi> in all natural <hi>efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
And 'tis now paſt queſtion, that <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
for the moſt part acts by <hi>ſubtil ſtreams</hi>
and <hi>aporhaea's</hi> of <hi>minute particles,</hi> which
paſs from one body to another. Or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
that be, this kinde of <hi>agency</hi> is as <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable</hi>
as any of thoſe <hi>qualities ignorance</hi>
hath call'd <hi>ſympathy</hi> and <hi>antipathy,</hi> the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality</hi>
of which we <hi>doubt</hi> not, though the
<hi>manner</hi> of <hi>action</hi> be <hi>unknown.</hi> Yea, the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53430:23"/>
thing I ſpeak of is as eaſie to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
as how <hi>infection</hi> ſhould paſs in
certain <hi>tenuious ſtreams</hi> through the <hi>air</hi>
from one houſe to another; or, as how
the <hi>biting</hi> of a <hi>mad Dog</hi> ſhould fill all the
<hi>blood</hi> and <hi>ſpirits</hi> with a <hi>venomous</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign
ferment;</hi> the application of the <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
doing the ſame in our caſe, as <hi>that</hi> of
<hi>contact</hi> doth in <hi>this.</hi> Yea, ſome kindes of
<hi>faſcination</hi> are perform'd in this groſſer and
more ſenſible way, as by <hi>ſtriking,</hi> giving
<hi>Apples,</hi> and the like, by which the <hi>conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
quality</hi> may be tranſmitted, as we ſee
<hi>diſeaſes</hi> often are by the <hi>touch.</hi> Now in
this way of conjecture, a good account
may be given why <hi>Witches</hi> are moſt <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful</hi>
upon <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>timorous</hi> perſons,
<hi>viz.</hi> becauſe their <hi>ſpirits</hi> and <hi>imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
being <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>paſsive,</hi> are not able
to reſiſt the <hi>fatal invaſion;</hi> whereas men
of <hi>bold</hi> mindes, who have plenty of <hi>ſtrong</hi>
and <hi>vigorous ſpirits</hi> are ſecure from the
<hi>contagion,</hi> as in <hi>peſtilential Airs clean</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are not ſo liable to infection as are
other tempers. Thus then we ſee 'tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough, that very often the <hi>Sorcereſs</hi> her
ſelf doth the <hi>miſchief;</hi> and we know, <hi>de
facto,</hi> that <hi>Providence</hi> doth not alwayes
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53430:24"/>
ſecure us from one anothers <hi>injuries.</hi> And
yet I muſt confeſs, that many times alſo
the evil <hi>ſpirit</hi> is the <hi>miſchievous Agent;</hi>

But yet (2) though we acknowledge their

are leſs frequent in this kind of miſchief,

whereas did they ordinarily perſecute men

and <hi>malice</hi> of thoſe <hi>evil ſpirits;</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this account we may ſuppoſe that <hi>Laws</hi>

there is in their <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> but in order

forbid <hi>plunder,</hi> not out of <hi>love</hi> to their

And hence (3) we may ſuppoſe a
<hi>Law</hi> of <hi>permiſsion</hi> to hurt us at the inſtance
of the <hi>Sorcereſs,</hi> may well ſtand with the
<hi>polity</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> ſince by gratifying the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

'tis clear to thoſe that believe the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of

that the <hi>Devil</hi> is a name for a <hi>Body

in as much <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>place</hi> and <hi>ſtate,</hi> as

over us (the deſire of <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
being largely ſpread through the

whole <hi>circumference</hi> of <hi>degenerated nature,</hi>
eſpecially among thoſe, whoſe <hi>pride</hi> was
their <hi>original tranſgreſsion</hi>) every one of
theſe then deſires to get him Vaſſals to pay

to gratifie which deſire, 'tis like
enough to be provided and allowed by the
<hi>conſtitution</hi> of their <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
that every <hi>wicked ſpirit</hi> ſhall have
thoſe Souls as his <hi>property,</hi> and <hi>particular
ſervants</hi> and <hi>attendants,</hi> whom he can
<hi>catch</hi> in ſuch <hi>compacts;</hi> as thoſe <hi>wild Beaſts</hi>

of the Law our <hi>own;</hi> and thoſe
Slaves that a man hath <hi>purchas'd,</hi> are his

the more <hi>miſchievous Tempter</hi> ſtudies

                        <p>TO WHICH, among other things
that might be ſuggeſted, I return, (1)
That we are never liable to be ſo betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and abuſed, till by our <hi>vile diſpoſitions</hi>
and <hi>tendencies</hi> we have forfeited the <hi>tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary</hi>
care and <hi>overſight</hi> of the better Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
which, though generally they are
our <hi>guard</hi> and <hi>defence</hi> againſt the malice
and violence of <hi>evil Angels,</hi> yet it may
well enough be thought that ſometimes
they may take their leave of ſuch as are
ſwallowed up by <hi>malice, envy,</hi> and <hi>deſire</hi>
of <hi>revenge,</hi> qualities moſt contrary to
their <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> and leave them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the <hi>invaſion</hi> and <hi>ſollicitations</hi> of
thoſe <hi>wicked Spirits,</hi> to whom ſuch <hi>hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Attributes</hi> make them very <hi>ſuitable.</hi>
And if there be particular <hi>guardian</hi> Angels,
as 'tis not abſurd to fancy, it may then well
be ſuppoſed, that no man is obnoxious to
thoſe projects and attempts, but only ſuch
whoſe <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>miſchievous natures</hi> have
driven from them their <hi>protecting Genius.</hi>
And againſt this <hi>dereliction</hi> to the power
of <hi>evil ſpirits,</hi> 'tis likely enough what
ſome affirm, that the <hi>Royal Pſalmiſt</hi> directs
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53430:32"/>
that Prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> LXXI. ix, x. <hi>Caſt me
not off in the time of old age, forſake me
not when my ſtrength faileth.</hi> For—<hi>They
that keep my ſoul</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>,
as the <hi>LXX</hi> and the <hi>Vulgar Latin, Qui
cuſtodiunt animam meam] they take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
together, ſaying, God hath forſaken him,
perſecute him and take him, for there is
none to deliver him.</hi> But I adde, (2) That
'tis very improbable, that the ſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are, will not eaſily permit <hi>palpable
intercourſes</hi> between the <hi>bad Genii</hi> and <hi>our
nature,</hi> ſince 'tis like enough that their
own Laws and Government do not allow
their frequent excurſions into this world.
Or, it may with as great probability be
ſuppoſed, that 'tis a very hard and painful
thing for them, to force their <hi>thin</hi> and <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuious</hi>
bodies into a <hi>viſible conſiſtence,</hi> and
ſuch ſhapes as are neceſſary for their <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns</hi>
in their <hi>correſpondencies</hi> with <hi>Witches.</hi>
For in this action their bodies muſt needs
be exceedingly <hi>compreſs'd,</hi> which cannot
be well ſuppoſed without a painful ſenſe.
And this is perhaps a reaſon why there are
ſo <hi>few Apparitions,</hi> and why <hi>appearing
ſpirits</hi> are commonly in ſuch haſte to be
gone, <hi>viz.</hi> that they may be deliver'd from
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53430:33"/>
the <hi>unnatural preſſure</hi> of their <hi>tender ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicles,</hi>
which I confeſs holds more, in the
<hi>apparitions</hi> of <hi>good</hi> than of <hi>evil Spirits;</hi>
moſt Relations of this kinde, deſcribing
their diſcoveries of themſelves, as very
<hi>tranſient,</hi> (though for thoſe the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
records, there may be peculiar rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why they are not <hi>ſo</hi>) whereas the
<hi>wicked ones</hi> are not altogether ſo <hi>quick</hi> and
<hi>haſty</hi> in their <hi>Viſits:</hi> The reaſon of which
probably is, the great <hi>ſubtilty</hi> and <hi>tenuity</hi>
of the bodies of the former, which will
require far greater degrees of <hi>compreſsion,</hi>
and conſequently of <hi>pain,</hi> to make them
<hi>viſible;</hi> whereas the latter, are more <hi>foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent</hi>
and <hi>groſs,</hi> and ſo nearer allyed to
<hi>palpable conſiſtencies,</hi> and more eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceable
to <hi>appearance</hi> and <hi>viſibility.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AT this turn, Sir, you may perceive
that I have again made uſe of the <hi>Platonick
Hypotheſis, That Spirits are embodied,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which indeed a great part of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
is grounded: And therefore I hold
my ſelf obliged to a ſhort account of that
ſuppoſal. It ſeems then to me very <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable</hi>
from the Nature of <hi>Senſe,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy</hi>
of <hi>Nature.</hi> For (1.) We perceive
in our ſelves, that all <hi>Senſe</hi> is caus'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53430:33"/>
by <hi>motion</hi> made in <hi>matter;</hi> and
when thoſe <hi>motions</hi> which convey <hi>ſenſible
impreſsions</hi> to the <hi>Brain,</hi> the <hi>Seat</hi> of <hi>Senſe,</hi>
are intercepted, Senſe is loſt: So that, if
we ſuppoſe <hi>Spirits</hi> perfectly to be <hi>disjoyn'd</hi>
from all <hi>matter,</hi> 'tis not conceivable how
they can have the ſenſe of any thing; For
how <hi>material Objects</hi> ſhould any way be
perceiv'd, or felt without <hi>vital union</hi> with
<hi>matter,</hi> 'tis not poſſible to imagine. Nor
doth it (2.) ſeem ſuitable to the <hi>Analogy</hi>
of <hi>Nature,</hi> which uſeth not to make <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitious
leaps</hi> from one thing to another,
but uſually proceeds by <hi>orderly ſteps</hi> and
<hi>gradations:</hi> whereas were there no <hi>order</hi>
of <hi>Beings</hi> between <hi>us,</hi> who are ſo deeply
plunged into the groſſeſt matter, and pure
unbodied Spirits, 'twere a mighty <hi>jump</hi>
in Nature. Since then the greateſt part
of the world conſiſts of the <hi>finer</hi> portions
of matter, and our own Souls are <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
united</hi> unto <hi>theſe,</hi> 'tis infinitely
probable to conjecture, that the nearer
orders of Spirits are <hi>vitally joyn'd</hi> to ſuch
<hi>Bodies.</hi> And ſo <hi>Nature</hi> by <hi>Degrees</hi> aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtill by the more <hi>refin'd</hi> and <hi>ſubtile</hi>
matter, gets at laſt to the pure <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> or
<hi>immaterial minds,</hi> which the <hi>Platoniſts</hi>
                           <pb n="50" facs="tcp:53430:34"/>
made the <hi>higheſt Order</hi> of <hi>created Beings.</hi>
But of this I have diſcourſed elſewhere,
and have ſaid thus much of it at preſent,
becauſe it will enable me to adde another
Reaſon of the <hi>unfrequency</hi> of <hi>Apparitions</hi>
and <hi>Compacts,</hi> viz.</p>
                        <p>(3.) BECAUSE 'tis very likely, that
<hi>theſe Regions</hi> are very <hi>unſuitable,</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion'd</hi>
to the <hi>frame</hi> and <hi>temper</hi> of
their <hi>Senſes</hi> and <hi>Bodies;</hi> ſo that perhaps,
the <hi>Courſer Spirits</hi> can no more bear the
<hi>Air</hi> of our World, than <hi>Bats</hi> and <hi>Owls</hi>
can the brighteſt beams of Day. Nor can
the <hi>Purer</hi> and <hi>Better</hi> any more endure the
<hi>noyſom ſteams,</hi> and <hi>poyſonous reeks</hi> of
this <hi>Dunghil Earth,</hi> than the <hi>Delicate</hi> can
bear a confinement in <hi>naſty Dungeons,</hi>
and the foul <hi>ſquallid Caverns</hi> of uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Darkneſs. So that 'tis no more
wonder, that the better Spirits no oftner
appear, than that men are not more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in the <hi>Dark Hollows</hi> under ground.
Nor is't any more ſtrange that <hi>evil Spirits</hi>
ſo rarely viſit us, than that <hi>Fiſhes</hi> do not
ordinarily fly in the Air, as 'tis ſaid one
ſort of them doth; or that we ſee not
the Batt daily fluttering in the beams of
the Sun. And now by the help of what I

reaching from Heaven to Earth, is
generally acknowledg'd; but that <hi>this</hi>
ſuppoſeth all things to be order'd by the
<hi>immediate influence,</hi> and <hi>interpoſal</hi> of the
<hi>Supreme Deity,</hi> is not very <hi>Philoſophical</hi>
to ſuppoſe; ſince if we judge by the
<hi>Analogy</hi> of the <hi>Natural World,</hi> all things
we ſee are carried on by the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of
<hi>Second Cauſes,</hi> and <hi>intermediate Agents.</hi>
And it doth not ſeem ſo <hi>Magnificent</hi> and
<hi>Becoming</hi> an apprehenſion of the <hi>Supreme
Numen,</hi> to fancy His <hi>immediate Hand</hi>
in every <hi>trivial</hi> Management. But 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
likely to conjecture, that much of
the <hi>Government</hi> of us, and our Affairs,
is committed to the <hi>better Spirits,</hi> with a
due <hi>ſubordination</hi> and <hi>ſubſerviency</hi> to the
Will of the chief <hi>Rector</hi> of the <hi>Univerſe.</hi>
And 'tis not abſurd to believe, that there
is a <hi>Government</hi> runs from <hi>Higheſt</hi> to <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,</hi>
the <hi>better</hi> and more <hi>perfect</hi> orders of
Being, ſtill ruling the <hi>inferiour</hi> and <hi>leſs
perfect.</hi> So that ſome one would fancy
that perhaps the <hi>Angels</hi> may manage <hi>us,</hi>
as we do the <hi>Creatures</hi> that God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
have placed under our <hi>Empire</hi> and
<hi>Dominion.</hi> But however that is, That
<hi>God</hi> rules the lower World by the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry</hi>
                           <pb n="53" facs="tcp:53430:35"/>

be granted, the good Spirits have not ſo
little to do with us, and our matters, as
is generally believed. And perhaps it
would not be abſurd, if we referr'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the <hi>ſtrange thwarts,</hi> and <hi>unexpected
events,</hi> the <hi>diſappointments</hi> and <hi>lucky co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidences</hi>

without any conceivable <hi>motive</hi> to allure
it, and the <hi>general neglect</hi> of others more
<hi>deſerving,</hi> whoſe <hi>worth</hi> is not <hi>acknowledg'd,</hi>
I ſay, theſe and ſuch like <hi>odde</hi> things, may
with the greateſt probability be reſolv'd
into the <hi>Conduct</hi> and <hi>Menages</hi> of thoſe <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible

govern our affairs.</p>
                        <p>BUT if they ſo far concern themſelves
in our matters, how is it that they <hi>appear</hi>
not to maintain a <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>confeſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence</hi>
with ſome of the <hi>better Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi>

for the</hi> unfrequency <hi>of</hi> Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<hi>and I</hi> now adde <hi>what I intend for
another return to the main Objection,</hi> viz.</p>
                        <p>(2.) THAT the <hi>apparition</hi> of <hi>good</hi>
Spirits is not <hi>needful</hi> for the Deſigns of the
better world, whatever ſuch may be for
the intereſt of the other. For we have
had the <hi>Appearance</hi> and <hi>Cohabitation</hi> of
the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> we have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the
<hi>Prophets,</hi> and the continued <hi>influence</hi> of
the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>greateſt Arguments</hi> to
ſtrengthen <hi>Faith,</hi> the moſt <hi>powerful
Motives</hi> to excite our <hi>Love,</hi> and the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53430:37"/>
Encouragements</hi> to quicken and raiſe
our <hi>deſires</hi> and <hi>hopes,</hi> any of which are
more than the <hi>apparition</hi> of an <hi>Angel;</hi>
which would indeed be a great <hi>gratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of the <hi>Animal Life,</hi> but 'twould ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our <hi>Faith</hi> leſs noble and leſs generous,
were it frequently ſo aſſiſted: <hi>Bleſſed are
they that believe, and yet have not ſeen.</hi>
Beſides which, the <hi>good Angels</hi> have no
ſuch <hi>ends</hi> to proſecute, as the gaining any
Vaſſals to ſerve them, they being <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
Spirits</hi> for our <hi>good,</hi> and no <hi>ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigners</hi>
for a <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>inſolent Dominion</hi>
over us. And it may be perhaps not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently
added, That <hi>they</hi> are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<hi>evil Spirits</hi> that <hi>appear,</hi> as is, I
know not well upon what grounds, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
imagined; but that the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>detections</hi> of <hi>Murders, latent Treaſures,
falſified</hi> and <hi>unfulfill'd Bequeſts,</hi> which are
ſometimes made by <hi>Apparitions,</hi> may be
the courteous Diſcoveries of the better,
and more benign <hi>Genii.</hi> Yea, 'tis not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,
that thoſe <hi>Warnings</hi> that the world
ſometimes hath of approaching <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
and <hi>Calamities</hi> by <hi>Prodigies,</hi> and
ſundry <hi>odde Phoenomena,</hi> are the <hi>kind In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations</hi>
of ſome of the Inhabitants of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53430:37"/>
the upper world. Thus, was <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
forewarned before its ſacking by <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
by thoſe <hi>Aiery Horſemen</hi> that were
ſeen through all the City, for almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
dayes together, 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> V. ii, iii. And
the other <hi>Prodigious Portents</hi> that fore-ran
its Deſtruction by <hi>Titus:</hi> which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
becauſe they are <hi>notorious inſtances.</hi>
And though, for mine own part, I ſcorn
the <hi>ordinary Tales of Prodigies,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from <hi>ſuperſtitious fears,</hi> and <hi>unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance</hi>
with <hi>Nature,</hi> and have been
uſed to bad purpoſes by the <hi>Zealous</hi> and
the <hi>Ignorant;</hi> Yet I think that the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that are brought by a late very inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Author, to conclude againſt ſuch
Warnings and Predictions in the whole
kinde, are <hi>ſhort</hi> and <hi>inconſequent,</hi> and
built upon too narrow <hi>Hypotheſeis.</hi> For if
it be ſuppoſed, that there is a ſort of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
over us, and about us, who can give a
probable gueſs at the more <hi>remarkable fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turities,</hi>
I know not why it may not be
conjectured, that the kindneſs they have
for us, and the appetite of fore-telling
ſtrange things, and the putting the world
upon expectation, which we finde is very
grateful to our own Natures; may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53430:38"/>
                           <hi>them</hi> alſo to give us ſome general
notice of thoſe uncommon Events which
they foreſee. And I yet perceive no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
we have to fancy, that whatever is
done in this kinde, muſt needs be either
<hi>immediately</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> or from the
<hi>Angels,</hi> by <hi>extraordinary commiſsion</hi> and
<hi>appointment.</hi> But it ſeems to me not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
to believe, that <hi>thoſe officious
Spirits</hi> that overſee our affairs, perceiving
ſome <hi>mighty and ſad alterations</hi> at hand,
in which their <hi>Charge</hi> is much concerned,
cannot chuſe, by reaſon of their <hi>affection</hi>
to us, but give us ſome <hi>ſeaſonable hints</hi> of
thoſe <hi>approaching Calamities;</hi> to which
alſo their natural deſire to <hi>foretell ſtrange
things</hi> to come, may contribute to incline
them. And by this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> the <hi>faireſt
probabilities,</hi> and <hi>ſtrongeſt ratiocinations</hi>
againſt <hi>Prodigies,</hi> may be made unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable.
But this only by the way. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the next objection, which may
be made to ſpeak thus.</p>

world ſhall be <hi>rent,</hi> and the <hi>Sun darkened</hi>
at his <hi>Funeral:</hi> If he ſhall, within the

of his <hi>Reſurrection:</hi> If he ſhall after

be deceived in a matter of <hi>clear ſenſe,</hi> and
<hi>aſcend</hi> in Glory in the preſence of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſht

if ſuch a One as this ſhould prove a <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
Impoſtor,</hi> and Providence ſhould
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53430:41"/>
permit him to be ſo credited and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged;
What poſſibility were there then
for us to be aſſured, that we are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<hi>deceived?</hi> yea, that our very Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
were not given us only to delude

is, <hi>That there is no God that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the earth;</hi> and the beſt, and moſt

given up to the Government of the Devil.</hi>
But if there be a <hi>Providence</hi> that ſupervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
us, (as nothing is more certain) doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
it will never ſuffer poor helpleſs Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to be <hi>inevitably deceived,</hi> by the <hi>craft</hi>

take ſuch care, that the <hi>works</hi>
wrought by <hi>Divine Power</hi> for the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of <hi>Divine Truth,</hi> ſhall have ſuch

though wicked Spirits may perform ſome

what makes it <hi>incurable;</hi> and there is no

and a <hi>vigorous Endeavour: For all things
are poſſible to him that believeth.</hi> So that,
<hi>that</hi> which makes a Sin <hi>incurable,</hi> muſt be
ſomewhat that makes <hi>Faith impoſsible,</hi> and
obſtructs all means of Conviction. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the finding <hi>which,</hi> we muſt conſider
the wayes and methods the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
hath taken, for the begetting <hi>Faith,</hi>
and <hi>cure</hi> of <hi>Infidelity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> which it attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted,

of antient times, who, by the <hi>excellency</hi>
of their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of their
<hi>Miracles,</hi> and the <hi>holineſs</hi> of their <hi>Lives,</hi>
endeavoured the conviction and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a ſtubborn and unbelieving World.
But though <hi>Few believed their report,</hi> and
men would not be prevail'd on by what
they <hi>did,</hi> or what they <hi>ſaid,</hi> yet their <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity</hi>
was not hitherto <hi>incurable,</hi> becauſe
further <hi>means</hi> were provided in the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry</hi>
of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> whoſe Life was
more <hi>ſevere,</hi> whoſe Doctrines were more
plain, preſſing and particular; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'twas poſſible that He might have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.
Yea, and where He failed, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53430:43"/>
could not open mens hearts and their eyes,
the Effect was ſtill in <hi>poſsibility,</hi> and <hi>it</hi>
might be expected from <hi>Him</hi> that came
after, to whom the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>John</hi>
were but the <hi>Twilight</hi> and the <hi>Dawn.</hi> And
though <hi>His miraculous Birth,</hi> the <hi>Song</hi> of
<hi>Angels,</hi> the <hi>Journey</hi> of the <hi>Wiſe Men</hi> of
the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and the <hi>correſpondence</hi> of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies,</hi>
with the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of the <hi>firſt
appearance</hi> of the <hi>Wonderful Infant:</hi> I
ſay, though theſe had not been taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, yet was there a further proviſion
made for the <hi>cure</hi> of <hi>Infidelity,</hi> in his <hi>aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
Wiſdom,</hi> and moſt <hi>excellent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines;</hi>
For, <hi>He ſpake as never Man did.</hi>
And when <hi>Theſe</hi> were deſpiſed and negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
yet there were other <hi>means</hi> towards
<hi>Conviction,</hi> and <hi>Cure</hi> of <hi>Unbelief,</hi> in thoſe
mighty <hi>Works</hi> that bore Teſtimony of
<hi>Him,</hi> and wore the evident marks of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power</hi> in their foreheads. But when
after all, theſe <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>unqueſtionable
Miracles</hi> which were wrought by the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi> and had eminently his <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription</hi>
on them, ſhall be aſcribed to the
<hi>Agency</hi> of <hi>evil Spirits,</hi> and <hi>Diabolical
Compact,</hi> as they were by the <hi>malicious</hi>
and <hi>ſpightful Phariſees</hi> in the <hi>periods</hi> above-mentioned;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53430:43"/>
when thoſe <hi>great</hi> and <hi>laſt
Teſtimonies</hi> againſt <hi>Infidelity,</hi> ſhall be ſaid
to be but the <hi>Tricks</hi> of <hi>Sorcery,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotment</hi>

For <hi>Miracles</hi> are God's <hi>Seal,</hi> and the great
and laſt evidence of the truth of any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
And though, while <hi>theſe</hi> are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

a <hi>poſsibility</hi> of <hi>perſwaſion;</hi> yet, when

of the <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by the

                           <pb n="70" facs="tcp:53430:44"/>
THIS account, as 'tis clear and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
in it ſelf, ſo it is plainly lodg'd in
the mention'd Diſcourſe of our Saviour.
And thoſe that ſpeak other things about it,
ſeem to me to talk at random, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
without Book. But to leave them to
the fondneſs of their own conceits, I think
it now time to draw up to a Concluſion of
the whole.</p>
                        <p>THEREFORE briefly, Sir, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
in theſe Papers, which my reſpect
and your concernment in the ſubject have
made <hi>yours,</hi> to remove the main prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
I could think of, againſt the exiſtence
of <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Apparitions:</hi> and I'm ſure
I have ſuggeſted much more againſt what
I defend, than ever I heard or ſaw in any
that oppoſed it; whoſe Diſcourſes, for
the moſt part, have ſeemed to me inſpired
by a <hi>lofty ſcorn</hi> of <hi>common</hi> belief, and ſome
<hi>trivial Notions</hi> of <hi>Vulgar Philoſophy.</hi> And
in deſpiſing the <hi>Common Faith</hi> about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Fact,</hi> and fondly adhering to <hi>it</hi> in
things of <hi>Speculation,</hi> they very groſly
and abſurdly miſtake: For in things of
<hi>Fact,</hi> the <hi>People</hi> are as much to be believ'd,
as the moſt <hi>ſubtile Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culators;</hi>
ſince here, <hi>Senſe</hi> is the Judge.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53430:44"/>
But in matters of <hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>Theory, They</hi>
are not at all to be heeded, becauſe <hi>Reaſon</hi>
is to be Judge of <hi>theſe,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> they know
not how to uſe. And yet thus it is with
thoſe <hi>wiſe</hi> Philoſophers, that will deny the
<hi>plain</hi> evidence of the <hi>Senſes</hi> of Mankinde,
becauſe they cannot reconcile <hi>appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
with the fond Crotchets of a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
which they lighted on in the <hi>High-way</hi>
by <hi>chance,</hi> and will adhere to at <hi>adventure.</hi>
So that I profeſs, for mine own part, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet heard any of the confident De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimers
againſt <hi>Witchcraft</hi> and <hi>Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
ſpeak any thing that might move a
mind, in any degree inſtructed in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
kinds of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of
<hi>things.</hi> And for the <hi>Objections</hi> I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
they are moſt of them ſuch as roſe
out of mine own thoughts, which I obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to conſider what was poſſible to be
ſaid upon this <hi>o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>caſion.</hi> For though I have
examined <hi>Scot's Diſcovery,</hi> fancying that
there I ſhould finde the <hi>ſtrong reaſons</hi> of
<hi>mens</hi> diſ-belief in this matter; yet I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
I met not with the leaſt ſuggeſtion in
all that <hi>Farrago,</hi> but what it had been ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
for me to have gone about to <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:</hi>
For the Author doth little but tell
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53430:45"/>
                           <hi>odde Tales,</hi> and <hi>ſilly Legends,</hi> which he
confutes and laughs at, and pretends <hi>this</hi> to
be a <hi>Confutation</hi> of the Being of <hi>Witches</hi>
and <hi>Apparitions:</hi> In all which, His <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings</hi>
are <hi>trifling</hi> and <hi>Childeſh;</hi> and when
He ventures at <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> He is little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than <hi>abſurd:</hi> So that 'twill be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to me, if any but <hi>Boyes</hi> and <hi>Buffoons</hi>
imbibe any <hi>Prejudices</hi> againſt a Belief ſo
infinitely Confirmed, from the <hi>Looſe</hi> and
<hi>Impotent Suggeſtions</hi> of ſo weak a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſer.</p>
                        <p>But however obſerving two things, in
that <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> that would pretend to be
more then ordinary <hi>Reaſons,</hi> I ſhall do them
the civility to examine them. It is ſaid
then,</p>
                        <p>(1.) That the <hi>Goſpel is ſilent,</hi> as to the
<hi>being</hi> of <hi>WITCHES;</hi> and 'tis not likely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
if there were <hi>ſuch,</hi> but that our <hi>Saviour</hi>
or his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had given intimations of
their exiſtence. The other is.</p>
                        <p>(2.) <hi>Miracles are ceaſed,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>prodigious</hi> things aſcribed to
<hi>WITCHCRAFT</hi> are ſuppoſed
<hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Impoſtures.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>FOR ANSWER to the FIRST in
order, I conſider (1.) That though the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53430:45"/>
                           <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be <hi>ſilent</hi> in the Buſineſs of <hi>Witches,</hi>
and <hi>Compacts,</hi> yet the <hi>Records</hi> of the <hi>Old</hi>
have a frequent mention of them. The
<hi>Law, Exod.</hi> XXII. xviii. againſt permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>them to live</hi> (which I mention'd in
the beginning) is <hi>famous.</hi> And we have
another remarkable <hi>prohibition</hi> of <hi>them,
Deut.</hi> XVIII. x, xi. <hi>There ſhall not be
found among you any one, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
his ſon or his daughter paſs through
the Fire, or that uſeth Divination, or
an Obſerver of Times, or an Enchanter,
or a WITCH, or a Charmer, or a Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with Familiar Spirits, or a Wizard, or
a Necromancer.</hi> Now this accumulation
of Names, (ſome of which are of the
ſame ſenſe and import) is a plain indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that the <hi>HEBREW WITCH</hi> was one
that practiſed by <hi>compact</hi> with <hi>evil ſpirits.</hi>
And many of the ſame expreſſions are
put together in the charge againſt <hi>Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
II <hi>Chron.</hi> XXXIII. <hi>viz.</hi> That he
<hi>cauſed his Children to paſs through the Fire,
obſerved Times, uſed Inchantments,</hi> and
<hi>WITCHCRAFT,</hi> and dealt with
<hi>Familiar Spirits,</hi> and with <hi>WIZARDS.</hi> So
that though the <hi>original</hi> word which we
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53430:46"/>
render <hi>WITCH</hi> and <hi>WITCH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRAFT</hi>
ſhould, as our Sadduces
urge, ſignifie only a <hi>CHEAT</hi> and a
<hi>POYSONER;</hi> yet thoſe others mention'd,
plainly enough ſpeak the <hi>thing,</hi> and I have
given an account in the former <hi>Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
how a <hi>WITCH</hi> in the common no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is a <hi>Poyſoner.</hi> But why meer <hi>poyſoning</hi>
ſhould have a diſtinct <hi>Law</hi> againſt it, and
not be concluded under the general one
againſt <hi>Murder;</hi> why meer <hi>Legerdemain,</hi>
and <hi>Cheating</hi> ſhould be ſo ſeverely animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
on, as to be reckon'd with <hi>Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
converſe</hi> with <hi>Devils,</hi> and <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
practiſes:</hi> I believe the <hi>denyer</hi> of
<hi>WITCHES</hi> will finde it hard to give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
To which I may adde ſome other
paſſages of Scripture that yield ſufficient
evidence in the caſe. The Nations are
forbid to hearken to the <hi>Diviners, Dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Inchanters,</hi> and <hi>Sorcerers,</hi> Jer. XXVII.
ix. The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> are deeply threatned
for their <hi>Sorceries,</hi> and <hi>Inchantments, Iſa.</hi>
XLVII. ix. And we read that <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi>
call'd the <hi>Magicians, Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers,
Sorcerers,</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> to tell
his <hi>Dream.</hi> All which, 'tis like enough,
did <hi>cheat</hi> and <hi>delude</hi> by their <hi>predictions;</hi>
                           <pb n="75" facs="tcp:53430:46"/>
but that <hi>they</hi> did not <hi>confederate,</hi> and
<hi>tranſact</hi> with <hi>evil Spirits,</hi> is an aſſertion
without a reaſon, contrary to the expreſs
Letter, and to what was generally believed
in thoſe times.</p>
                        <p>And the <hi>ſtory</hi> of the <hi>WITCH</hi> of <hi>EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOR,</hi>
1 Sam. <hi>XXVIII.</hi> is a remarkable
<hi>demonſtration</hi> of the <hi>main</hi> concluſion,
which will appear when we have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and removed the <hi>fancy,</hi> and <hi>gloſſes</hi> of
our <hi>Author</hi> about it, in his <hi>DISCOVERY,</hi>
where to avoid this evidence, he affirms,
<hi>This WITCH</hi> to be but a <hi>Cozener,</hi> and
the whole <hi>tranſaction</hi> a <hi>Cheat</hi> and <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,</hi>
managed by <hi>her ſelf,</hi> and a <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate.</hi>
And in order to the perſwading
<hi>this,</hi> he tells a fine <hi>Tale,</hi> viz. That ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from <hi>Saul</hi> into her <hi>Cloſet,</hi> 
                           <q>Where
doubtleſs, ſayes he, ſhe had a <hi>Familiar,</hi>
ſome <hi>lewd crafty Prieſt,</hi> and made <hi>Saul</hi>
ſtand at the <hi>Door</hi> like a <hi>Fool,</hi> to hear the
<hi>Cozening</hi> Anſwers. He ſaith, ſhe there
uſed the ordinary words of <hi>Conjuration,</hi>
and after them, <hi>Samuel appears,</hi> whom
he affirms to be no other than either the
<hi>Witch</hi> her ſelf, or her <hi>Confederate.</hi>
                           </q> By
this pretty <hi>knack</hi> and <hi>contrivance</hi> he thinks
he hath diſabled the <hi>Relation</hi> from ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53430:47"/>
to our purpoſe. But the <hi>DISCO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERER</hi>
might have conſider'd, that all
this is an <hi>Invention,</hi> and <hi>without Book.</hi>
For there is no mention of the <hi>Witches
Cloſet,</hi> or her <hi>retiring</hi> into another Room,
or her <hi>Confederate,</hi> or her <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration:</hi>
I ſay nothing of all this, is as
much as intimated in the <hi>Hiſtory;</hi> and if
we may take this <hi>large liberty</hi> in the <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation</hi>
of <hi>Scripture,</hi> there is ſcarce a
<hi>ſtory</hi> in the <hi>Bible,</hi> but may be made a <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy,</hi>
and <hi>Impoſture,</hi> or any thing that we
pleaſe. Nor is this fancy of his only <hi>arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,</hi>
but indeed contrary to the <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi>
of the <hi>Text.</hi> For it ſayes, <hi>Saul
perceived it was Samuel,</hi> and <hi>bowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
and <hi>this Samuel truly</hi> foretold his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
<hi>Fate,</hi> viz. that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be
deliver'd with <hi>Him</hi> into the hands of the
<hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and that on the morrow <hi>He,</hi>
and his <hi>Sons</hi> ſhould be in the <hi>ſtate</hi> of the
<hi>Dead,</hi> which doubtleſs is meant by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
that <hi>[they ſhould be with Him]</hi>

the <hi>Cozener</hi> and her <hi>confederate</hi> foretell,
if there were nothing in it <hi>extraordinary</hi>

great diſpute among <hi>Interpreters,</hi> whether
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53430:47"/>
the <hi>real Samuel</hi> was <hi>raiſed,</hi> or the <hi>Devil</hi>
in his likeneſs? Moſt later Writers ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it to have been an <hi>evil Spirit,</hi>
upon the ſuppoſition that <hi>good</hi> and
<hi>happy</hi> ſouls can never return hither from
their <hi>coeleſtial</hi> abodes, and they are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
at the beck, and call of an impious
Hagg. But then thoſe of the other <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ty</hi> of the words that were
ſpoke, and the <hi>ſeaſonable reproof</hi> given to
<hi>deſpairing Saul</hi> are <hi>indications</hi> ſufficient
that they come not from Hell; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
they think the <hi>Propheſie</hi> of <hi>circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
very <hi>accidental</hi> to be an argument,
that it was not utter'd by any of the <hi>infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
predictors.</hi> And for the <hi>ſuppoſal</hi> that
is the ground of <hi>that interpretation,</hi> 'tis
judged exceedingly <hi>precarious;</hi> for <hi>who
ſaith</hi> that <hi>happy</hi> departed <hi>ſouls</hi> were never
employed in any <hi>miniſtries</hi> here below?
And thoſe diſſenters are ready to ask a
reaſon, why <hi>they</hi> may not be ſent in meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to <hi>Earth,</hi> as well as <hi>thoſe</hi> of the <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical</hi>
Order? They are nearer <hi>allyed</hi> to our
<hi>Natures,</hi> and upon that account more <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately
concern'd</hi> in our affairs; and the
example of <hi>returning Lazarus</hi> is evidence
of the thing <hi>de facto.</hi> Beſides which, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53430:48"/>
it was the <hi>real Samuel</hi> they think made
probable by the opinion of <hi>Jeſus Syrac,</hi>
Eccleſ. XLVI. xix, xx. who ſaith of him,
That <hi>after his death he propheſied and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the King his end:</hi> which alſo is <hi>likely</hi>
from the circumſtance of the womans
<hi>aſtoniſhment,</hi> and <hi>crying</hi> out when ſhe
ſaw him, intimating her <hi>ſurprize,</hi> in that
the power of God had over-ruled her
<hi>inchantments,</hi> and ſent another than ſhe
expected. And they conceive there is no
more incongruity in ſuppoſing God ſhould
ſend <hi>Samuel</hi> to rebuke <hi>Saul</hi> for this his laſt
folly, and to predict his inſtant ruine, than
in his interpoſing <hi>Elias</hi> to the meſſengers of
<hi>Ahazias</hi> when he ſent to <hi>Beelzebub.</hi> Now
if it were the <hi>real Samuel,</hi> as the Letter
expreſſeth, (and the obvious ſenſe is to be
followed when there is no cogent reaſon to
decline it) he was not <hi>raiſed</hi> by the <hi>power</hi>
of the <hi>Witches Inchantments,</hi> but came on
that occaſion in a <hi>Divine Errand.</hi> But
yet attempts and endeavours to raiſe her
<hi>Familiar Spirit</hi> (though at that time over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled)
are arguments that it had been her
cuſtom to do <hi>ſo.</hi> Or if it were as the other
ſide concludes, the <hi>Devil</hi> in the <hi>ſhape</hi> of
<hi>Samuel,</hi> her <hi>Diabolical Confederacy</hi> is yet
more <hi>palpable.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="79" facs="tcp:53430:48"/>
By all this it is evident, that there were
<hi>WITCHES</hi> in ancient times under the
<hi>Diſpenſation</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and that there
were ſuch in the <hi>Times</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> alſo,
will not be much more difficult to make
good. I had a late occaſion to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
about this, in a Letter to a perſon of
the higheſt honour, from which I ſhall now
borrow ſome things to my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                        <p>I ſay then (2.) That there were <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts</hi>
with <hi>evil Spirits</hi> in <hi>thoſe times</hi> alſo,
is methinks intimated ſtrongly in that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Jews</hi> concerning our <hi>Saviour,
That he caſt out Devils by Beelzebub;</hi> in
his return to which, he denies not the <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi>
or <hi>poſsibility</hi> of the <hi>thing</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
but clears himſelf by an appeal to the
actions of their own children, whom they
would not task ſo ſeverely. And I cannot
very well underſtand why thoſe times
ſhould be priviledg'd from <hi>VVITCH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRAFT,</hi>
and <hi>Diabolical compacts,</hi> more
than they were from <hi>Poſſeſsions,</hi> which we
know were then more <hi>frequent</hi> (for ought
appears to the contrary) than ever they
were <hi>before</hi> or <hi>ſince.</hi> But beſides this,
There are intimations plain enough in the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53430:49"/>
                           <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Writings of the being of <hi>Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>

adde this more general conſideration.</p>
                        <p>(3.) That though the <hi>New Teſtament</hi>

no, not of thoſe, whereby the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation</hi>
of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> might have been
much <hi>advanced, viz.</hi> the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and the <hi>Magnet;</hi> and yet no one uſeth
his <hi>ſilence</hi> in theſe inſtances as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt the being of things, which
are <hi>evident objects</hi> of <hi>ſenſe.</hi> I confeſs, the
omiſſion of ſome of theſe <hi>particulars</hi> is
pretty ſtrange, and unaccountable, and
concludes our <hi>ignorance</hi> of the <hi>reaſons,</hi>
and <hi>menages</hi> of <hi>Providence;</hi> but I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<hi>nothing elſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus Sir, to the FIRST. But the other
pretence alſo muſt be examined.</p>
                        <p>(2) <hi>[Miracles are ceaſt, therefore the
preſumed actions of Witchcraft are tales,
and illuſions.]</hi> To make a due return to
<hi>this,</hi> we muſt conſider a great and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
<hi>Problem,</hi> which is, <hi>what is a real Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle?</hi>
And for anſwer to this weighty
Queſtion, I think,</p>
                        <p>(1.) That it is not the <hi>ſtrangeneſs,</hi> or
<hi>unaccountableneſs</hi> of the <hi>thing done</hi> ſimply,
from whence we are to conclude a <hi>Miracle.</hi>
For then, we are <hi>ſo</hi> to account of all the
<hi>Magnalia</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and all the <hi>myſteries</hi>
                           <pb n="82" facs="tcp:53430:50"/>
of thoſe <hi>honeſt</hi> Arts, which we do not
underſtand. Nor, (2) is this the <hi>Criterion</hi>
of a <hi>Miracle</hi> that 'tis concluded beyond all
<hi>natural powers;</hi> for we are ignorant of the
<hi>extent,</hi> and <hi>bounds</hi> of <hi>Natures ſphere,</hi> and
<hi>poſsibilities:</hi> And if this were the <hi>chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,</hi>
and <hi>eſſential mark</hi> of a <hi>Miracle,</hi> we
could not know what was <hi>ſo;</hi> except we
could determine the <hi>extent</hi> of <hi>natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalities,</hi>
and fix their <hi>bounds,</hi> and be able
to ſay to <hi>Nature, Hitherto canſt Thou go,
and no further.</hi> And he that makes this his
meaſure whereby to judge a <hi>Miracle,</hi> is
himſelf the <hi>greateſt Miracle</hi> of <hi>knowledge,</hi>
or <hi>immodeſty.</hi> Beſides, though an effect
may tranſcend <hi>really</hi> all the <hi>powers</hi> of
<hi>meer nature,</hi> yet there is a <hi>world</hi> of <hi>ſpirits</hi>
that muſt be taken into our account. And as
to them alſo, I ſay, (3) Every thing is not
a <hi>Miracle</hi> that is done by <hi>Agents ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi>
There is no doubt but that <hi>Evil ſpirits</hi>
can make <hi>wonderful combinations</hi> of <hi>natural
cauſes,</hi> and perhaps perform many things
<hi>immediately</hi> which are <hi>prodigious,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the <hi>longeſt line</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> But yet
<hi>Theſe</hi> are not therefore to be called <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;</hi>
for, <hi>They are SACRED WONDERS,
and ſuppoſe the POWER to be DIVINE.</hi>
                           <pb n="83" facs="tcp:53430:50"/>
But how ſhall the <hi>power</hi> be <hi>known</hi> to be
<hi>ſo,</hi> when we ſo little underſtand the <hi>capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,</hi>
and <hi>extent</hi> of the abilities of <hi>lower
Agents?</hi> The Anſwer to this <hi>Queſtion</hi> will
diſcover the <hi>Criterion</hi> of <hi>Miracles,</hi> which
muſt be ſuppoſed to have all the former
particulars; (They are <hi>unaccountable beyond
the powers of meer nature,</hi> and <hi>done by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
ſupernatural</hi>) and to theſe muſt be
ſuperadded. (4.) That they have <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
circumſtances</hi> that ſpeak them of a
<hi>Divine original.</hi> Their <hi>mediate Authors</hi>
declare them to <hi>be ſo,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> are alwayes
perſons of <hi>Simplicity, Truth,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,
void</hi> of <hi>Ambition,</hi> and all <hi>ſecular Deſigns.</hi>
They ſeldom uſe <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> or <hi>natural
Applications,</hi> and yet ſurmount all the
<hi>activities</hi> of <hi>known nature.</hi> They work
thoſe wonders, not to raiſe <hi>admiration,</hi> or
out of the <hi>vanity</hi> to be <hi>talk't</hi> of, but to <hi>ſeal</hi>
and <hi>confirm</hi> ſome <hi>divine Doctrine,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion,</hi>
in which the <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi>
of the world is concern'd. I ſay, by ſuch
<hi>circumſtances</hi> as <hi>theſe, wonderful</hi> actions
are <hi>known</hi> to be from a <hi>Divine</hi> cauſe, and
<hi>that makes,</hi> and <hi>diſtinguiſheth</hi> a <hi>Miracle.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And thus I am prepared for an <hi>anſwer</hi>
to the <hi>Objection,</hi> to which I make this
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53430:51"/>
brief return, That though WITCHES
by their <hi>Confederate Spirit</hi> do thoſe <hi>odde,</hi>
and <hi>aſtoniſhing</hi> things we believe of them,
yet are they no <hi>Miracles,</hi> there being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
enough from the <hi>badneſs</hi> of their
<hi>lives,</hi> and the <hi>ridiculous ceremonies</hi> of
their <hi>performances,</hi> from their <hi>malice</hi> and
<hi>miſchievous deſigns,</hi> that the <hi>POWER</hi> that
works, and the end for which thoſe things
are done, is not <hi>Divine,</hi> but <hi>Diabolical.</hi>
And by <hi>ſingular providence</hi> they are not
ordinarily permitted, as much as to <hi>pretend</hi>
to any <hi>new ſacred Diſcoveries</hi> in matters
of <hi>Religion,</hi> or to act any thing for <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi>
of <hi>Doctrinal Impoſtures.</hi> So that
whether <hi>Miracles</hi> are <hi>ceaſed,</hi> or not, <hi>theſe</hi>
are <hi>none.</hi> And that ſuch <hi>Miracles</hi> as are
only <hi>ſtrange,</hi> and <hi>unaccountable</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
above the common <hi>methods</hi> of <hi>art</hi>
or <hi>nature</hi> are not <hi>ceas'd,</hi> we have a late
great evidence in the famous <hi>GREATRAK;</hi>
concerning whom it will not be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to adde the following <hi>account</hi> which I
had in a <hi>Letter</hi> from the Reverend Dr. <hi>R.</hi>
Dean of <hi>C.</hi> a perſon of great <hi>veracity,</hi>
and a <hi>Philoſopher.</hi> This learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
then is pleaſed thus to write.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>The great diſcourſe now at the <hi>Coffee</hi>-Houſes,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53430:51"/>
and every where, is about Mr.
<hi>G.</hi> the famous <hi>Iriſh Stroker,</hi> concerning
whom it is like you expect an account
from me; He undergoes various cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
here, ſome take him to be a <hi>Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi>
and ſome an <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> but others
again <hi>adore</hi> him as an <hi>Apoſtle.</hi> I confeſs
I think the man is free from all <hi>deſign,</hi> of
a very <hi>agreeable</hi> converſation, not addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to any <hi>Vice,</hi> nor to any <hi>Sect,</hi> or <hi>Party,</hi>
but is, I believe, a <hi>ſincere Proteſtant.</hi> I
was three weeks together with him at my
<hi>Lord Conwayes,</hi> and ſaw him, I think, lay
his hands upon a thouſand perſons; and
<hi>really</hi> there is ſome thing in it more then
<hi>ordinary;</hi> but I am convinc'd it is not
<hi>miraculous.</hi> I have ſeen <hi>pains</hi> ſtrangely
fly before his hand till he hath chaſed
them out of the body, <hi>dimneſs cleared,</hi>
and <hi>deafneſs</hi> cured by his <hi>touch;</hi> twenty
perſons at ſeveral times in <hi>Fits</hi> of the
<hi>Falling Sickneſs,</hi> were in two or three
minutes brought to themſelves, ſo as to
tell where their pain was, and then he
hath purſued it till he hath driven it out
at ſome extream part; <hi>Running Sores</hi>
of the <hi>Kings Evil</hi> dryed up, and <hi>Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels</hi>
brought to a <hi>Suppuration</hi> by his hand,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53430:52"/>
                              <hi>grievous Sores</hi> of many months date, in
few dayes <hi>healed, Obſtructions,</hi> and <hi>Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings
removed, Cancerous Knots</hi> in the
breaſt <hi>diſſolved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>But yet I have many reaſons to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
me, that nothing of all this is <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous;</hi>
He pretends not to give <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
to any <hi>Doctrine,</hi> the manner of his
<hi>operation</hi> ſpeaks it to be <hi>natural,</hi> the <hi>cure</hi>
ſeldom ſucceeds without <hi>reiterated
touches,</hi> his <hi>Patients</hi> often <hi>relapſe,</hi> he <hi>fails
frequently,</hi> he can do nothing where there
is any <hi>Decay</hi> in nature, and <hi>many Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi>
are not at all obedient to his <hi>touch.</hi>
So that I confeſs, I refer all his vertue to
his <hi>particular temper</hi> and <hi>complexion,</hi> and
I take his <hi>pirits</hi> to be a kinde of <hi>Elixir,</hi>
and <hi>univerſal Ferment,</hi> and that he cures
(as Dr. <hi>M.</hi> expreſſeth it) by a <hi>ſanative
Contagion.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
                        <p>This Sir, was the <hi>Firſt Account</hi> of the
<hi>Healer,</hi> I had from that Reverend Perſon,
which with me ſignifies more, then the <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations</hi>
of multitudes of <hi>ordinary Repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi>
and no doubt but it will do ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
with all that know that excellent mans
ſingular <hi>integrity</hi> and <hi>judgment.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this, upon my inquiry into ſome other
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53430:52"/>
particulars about this matter, I received
theſe further Informations.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>As for Mr. <hi>G.</hi> what opinion he hath of
his <hi>own Gift,</hi> and how he came to know
it? I anſwer, He hath a different appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of it from <hi>yours,</hi> and <hi>mine,</hi> and
certainly believing it to be an <hi>immediate
Gift</hi> from heaven; and 'tis no wonder,
for he is <hi>no Philoſopher.</hi> And you will
wonder leſs, when you hear <hi>how</hi> he came
to <hi>know</hi> it, as I have often received it
from his own mouth. About three or four
years ago he had a ſtrong <hi>impulſe</hi> upon his
<hi>ſpirit,</hi> that continually perſued him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he was about, at his <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
alone,</hi> or in <hi>company,</hi> that ſpake
to him by this <hi>inward ſuggeſtion [I have
given thee the gift of curing the Evil.]</hi>
This <hi>ſuggeſtion</hi> was ſo <hi>importunate,</hi> that
he complained to his Wife, That he
thought he was haunted: She appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
it as an <hi>extravagancy</hi> of <hi>Fancy,</hi>
but he told her he believed there was
more in it, and was reſolved to try. He
did not long want opportunity. There
was a neighbour of his grievouſly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with the <hi>Kings-Evil,</hi> He ſtroked her,
and the effect ſucceeded. And for about a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53430:53"/>
twelve-month together he pretended to
cure no other Diſtemper. But then the
<hi>Ague</hi> being very rife in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
the ſame <hi>Impulſe</hi> after the ſame
manner ſpoke within him, <hi>[I have given
thee the gift of curing the Ague;]</hi> and
meeting with perſons in their <hi>Fits,</hi> and
taking them by the hand, or laying his
hand upon their Breaſts, the <hi>Ague</hi> left
them. About half a year after the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
<hi>Impulſe</hi> became more <hi>general,</hi>
and ſuggeſted to him <hi>[I have given thee
the gift of Healing:]</hi> and then he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
all Diſeaſes <hi>indifferently.</hi> And
though he ſaw ſtrange effects, yet he
doubted whether the cauſe were any
vertue that came from him, or the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
fancy: To convince him of his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity,</hi>
as he lay one night in bed, one
of his hands was ſtruck <hi>dead,</hi> and the
uſual <hi>Impulſe</hi> ſuggeſted to him to make

he did, ſtroking it with his other hand,

This is his <hi>Relation,</hi> and I believe
there is ſo much ſincerity in the perſon,
that he tells no more than what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves

that it is but like <hi>Dreams</hi> that are uſually

Perhaps ſome may think it more

I have now at length put the moſt of thoſe
particulars I could obtain, into your hands;
which I had ſooner done, but that I have
been in a long expectation of <hi>additional</hi>
circumſtances, which Mr. <hi>Mompeſſon</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
me. But his occaſions it ſeems have
hindered the performance; and <hi>mine</hi> by
reaſon of the diſtance of our abodes, would
not permit <hi>perſonal ſolicitations,</hi> which
poſſibly might have expedited the matter.
To which I might adde, My Lord, that
a perſon intimately concerned in it, was
unwilling Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſhould meddle any more
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53430:57"/>
with Relations, leſt thereby the <hi>troubleſome

my expectations of the deſired <hi>Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionals.
That</hi> which I had from the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
himſelf, I now ſend your Lordſhip
in the ſubſequent <hi>Relation,</hi> which you may
pleaſe to take as follows.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="discourse">
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:53430:57"/>
                  <p>MASTER <hi>JOHN MOMPESSON</hi>
of <hi>Tedworth</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> being
about the middle of <hi>March,</hi> in the year
1661. at a neighbouring Town, called
<hi>Ludgarſhal,</hi> heard a <hi>Drum</hi> beat there, and
being concerned as a <hi>Commiſsion Officer</hi> in
the <hi>Militia,</hi> he enquired of the <hi>Bayliffe</hi>
of the Town, at whoſe Houſe he then
was, what it meant. The Bayliffe told him,
that they had for ſome dayes been troubled
by that <hi>Idle Drummer,</hi> who demanded mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of the Conſtable by vertue of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
paſs, which he thought was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit.
Upon this Information Maſter
<hi>Mompeſſon</hi> ſent for the fellow, and ask't
him, by what <hi>Authority</hi> he went up and
down the Countrey in that manner, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
money, and keeping a clutter
with his <hi>Drum?</hi> The <hi>Drummer</hi> anſwered,
he had good <hi>Authority,</hi> and produced his
paſs, with a warrant under the hands of
Sir <hi>William Cawly,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Ayliffe</hi> of
<hi>Gretexham.</hi> Theſe papers diſcover'd the
knavery, for Mr. <hi>Mompeſſon</hi> knowing thoſe
Gentlemens hands, found that his paſs,
and warrant were <hi>forgeries;</hi> and upon
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53430:58"/>
the diſcovery, commanded the <hi>vagrant</hi> to
put off his <hi>Drum,</hi> and charged the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
to carry him to the next <hi>Juſtice</hi> of
<hi>Peace,</hi> to puniſh him according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
of his <hi>Inſolence</hi> and <hi>Roguery.</hi> The fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
then confeſt the <hi>cheat,</hi> and begg'd
earneſtly for his <hi>Drum.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Mom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſſon</hi>
told him, that if he underſtood from
Collonel <hi>Ayliffe,</hi> whoſe <hi>Drummer</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be, that he had been an honeſt
man, he ſhould have it again; but that in
the interim he would ſecure it. So he left
the <hi>Drum</hi> with the Bayliffe, and the <hi>Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
in the Conſtables hands; who it
ſeems <hi>after,</hi> upon intreaty, let him go.</p>
                  <p>About the midſt of <hi>April</hi> following,
when Mr. <hi>M.</hi> was preparing for a Journey
to <hi>London,</hi> the Bayliffe ſent the <hi>Drum</hi> to
his houſe; and being returned, his Wife
told him, that they had been much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
in the night by <hi>Thieves,</hi> in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and that the Houſe had like to have
been broken up. He had not been at home
above three nights, when the ſame noiſe
returned that had diſturbed his Family
when he was abroad: It was a very great
<hi>knocking</hi> at his Doors, and the out-ſides of
his Houſe. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> aroſe, and with a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53430:58"/>
brace of Piſtols in his hands, went up and
down, ſearching for the cauſe of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance.
He open'd the door, where the
great knocking was, and preſently the
noiſe was at another: he opened that alſo,
and went forth, rounding his Houſe, but
could diſcover nothing; only he ſtill heard
a ſtrange noiſe, and hollow ſound; but
could not perceive what was the occaſion
of it. When he was returned to his Bed,
the noiſe was a <hi>thumping</hi> and <hi>Drumming</hi>
on the top of his Houſe, which continued
a good ſpace, and then by degrees went
off into the Air.</p>
                  <p>After this <hi>It</hi> would come 5 nights to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and abſent it ſelf 3. knocking ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hard on the out-ſides of the Houſe,
which is, moſt of it of Board. This <hi>It</hi>
did conſtantly as they were going to ſleep,
either early or late. After a months racket
without, <hi>It</hi> came into the room where the
<hi>Drum</hi> lay, where it would be 4 or 5 nights
in 7, making great hollow ſounds, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
ſhaking the Beds and Windows. <hi>It</hi>
would come within half an hour after they
were in Bed, and ſtay almoſt two. The
ſign of its approach was an <hi>hurling</hi> in the
Air over the Houſe; and at its receſs they
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53430:59"/>
ſhould hear a <hi>Drum</hi> beat, like the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of a Guard. It continued in this
Room for the ſpace of two months; the
Gentleman himſelf lying there to obſerve
<hi>It:</hi> and though it was very troubleſome in
the fore-part of the night, yet after two
hours diſturbance, it would deſiſt and
leave all in quietneſs: At which time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the Laws of the <hi>Black Society</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
its preſence at the general <hi>Rendezvous</hi>
elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Gentleman's Wife
was brought to Bed; the noiſe came a
little that night ſhe was in Travail, but
then forbore for three weeks till ſhe had
recover'd ſtrength. After this <hi>civil ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
it returned in a <hi>ruder</hi> manner than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
applying wholly to the younger
Children; whoſe Bedſteads it would beat
with that violence, that all preſent would
expect, when they would fall in pieces.
Thoſe that laid their hands upon them,
could feel no blows, but perceived them
to ſhake exceedingly. It would for an
hour together beat, what they call
ROUNDHEADS and CUCKOLDS—the
TATTOO, and ſeveral other Points
of Warre, and that as dexterouſly as
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53430:59"/>
any Drummer. After which it would get
under the Bed, and ſcratch there as if it
had Iron Tallons. It would lift the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
up in their Beds, follow them from
one room to another, and for a while ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to none particularly but them.</p>
                  <p>There was a Cockloft in the Houſe
which had been obſerved hitherto to be
untroubled; thither they removed their
children, putting them to bed while it was
fair day: and yet they were no ſooner co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
but the <hi>unwelcome Viſitant</hi> was
come, and played his Tricks as before.</p>
                  <p>On the 5th. of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1662. it kept
a mighty noiſe, and one of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Servants obſerving two Boards in
the Childrens room that ſeemed to move,
he bid it give him one of them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
the Board came within a yard of
him. The Fellow added, <hi>Nay, let me have
it in my hand:</hi> upon which it was ſhuft
quite home. The man thruſt it back, and
the <hi>Daemon</hi> returned it to him, and ſo from
one to another at leaſt 20 times together,
till the Gentleman forbad his Servant ſuch
<hi>Familiarities.</hi> That morning it left a <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous
ſmell</hi> behind it, very <hi>diſpleaſant,</hi> and
<hi>offenſive;</hi> which poſſibly, <hi>My Lord,</hi> ſome
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53430:60"/>
would conjecture to be a ſmack of the <hi>bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous</hi>
matter brought from the <hi>mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
vaults,</hi> to which we may ſuppoſe the
<hi>vehicles</hi> of thoſe <hi>impure Spirits</hi> to be near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
allyed. At night the Miniſter of the
place, one Mr. <hi>Cragge,</hi> and many of the
Neighbours came to the Houſe, and went
to prayer at the Childrens Bed-ſide, where
at that time <hi>It</hi> was very troubleſome, and
loud. During the time of <hi>Prayer</hi> it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
into the Cockloft, but the Service be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ended, it returned; and in the ſight
and preſence of the company, the <hi>Chairs</hi>
walked about the Room, the Childrens
Shooes were thrown over their heads, and
every looſe thing moved about the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
Alſo a Bed-ſtaffe was thrown at the
<hi>Miniſter,</hi> which hit him on the Leg, but ſo
favourably, that a lock of Wooll could
not have fallen more ſoftly. And a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
more was obſerv'd, <hi>viz.</hi> that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in the leaſt roul'd, nor mov'd from
the place where it lighted.</p>
                  <p>The Gentleman perceiving that <hi>It</hi> ſo
much perſecuted the little Children, lodg'd
them out at a Neighbours Houſe, and took
his eldeſt Daughter, who was about 10
years of Age, into his own Chamber,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53430:60"/>
where <hi>It</hi> had not been in a month before.
But no ſooner was ſhe in Bed, but the
troubleſome Gueſt was with her, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
his unquiet viſits for the ſpace of
three weeks, during which time it would
beat the <hi>Drum,</hi> and exactly anſwer any
Tune that was knock't, or call'd for. The
Houſe where the Gentleman had lodged
his Children being full of Strangers, he
was forced to take them home again; and
becauſe they had never obſerved any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
in the Parlor, he laid them there,
where alſo their old Viſitant found them;
but at this time troubled them no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than by plucking them by the hair,
and night-cloathes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It</hi> would ſometimes lift up the Servants
with their Beds, and lay them down again
gently without any more prejudice, than the
fright of being carried to the <hi>Drummers</hi>
Quarters. And at other times it would
lie like a great weight upon their Feet.</p>
                  <p>'Twas obſerved, that when the noiſe
was loudeſt, and came with the moſt <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,</hi>
and <hi>ſurprizing violence,</hi> yet no Dog
would move. The knocking was oft ſo
boyſterous and rude, that it hath been
heard at a conſiderable diſtance in the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53430:61"/>
Fields, and awakened the Neighbours in
the Village, none of which live very near
this houſe.</p>
                  <p>About the latter end of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1662.
The <hi>Drummings</hi> were leſs frequent, and
the noiſe the <hi>Fiend</hi> made, was a <hi>gingling</hi>
as it had been of money; occaſioned, as
'twas thought, by ſome diſcourſe of an
antient Gentlewoman, Mother to Mr. <hi>M.</hi>
(who was one day ſaying to a Neighbour
that talked of <hi>Fairies leaving money,</hi> That
ſhe ſhould like it well, if it would leave
them ſome to make amends for the trouble
it made them) for that night there was a
great <hi>chinking</hi> of money all the houſe
over; but he that roſe earlieſt next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
was ne're a groat the richer. After
this it deſiſted from its <hi>ruder noiſes,</hi> and
imployed it ſelf about little <hi>apiſh</hi> Tricks,
and leſs troubleſome <hi>Caprichio's.</hi> On <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas-Eve,</hi>
an hour before day, one of the
little Boyes ariſing out of his Bed, was
hit on a ſore place in his Heel, by the latch
of the Door, which the <hi>waggiſh Daemon</hi>
had pluckt out and thrown at him. The
Pin that faſtned it was ſo ſmall, that 'twas
for the credit of his <hi>Opticks,</hi> that he pick't
it out without Candle light. The night af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53430:61"/>
                     <hi>Chriſtmas-Day It</hi> threw all the old
Gentlewomans Cloaths about the Room,
and hid her <hi>Bible</hi> in the Aſhes. In ſuch
<hi>impertinent ludricous fegaries,</hi> it was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.
And ſuch paſſages are to me conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
intimations that the <hi>Imps</hi> of
<hi>Witches,</hi> and other troubleſome <hi>appearing
Spirits,</hi> are not alwayes <hi>Devils,</hi> as I have
diſcours 't in my <hi>Conſiderations</hi> about <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After <hi>this</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> was very <hi>troubleſome</hi>
to a Servant of Mr. <hi>Mompeſſons,</hi> who was
a ſtout Fellow, and of ſober converſation.
In the Relation of whoſe <hi>vexations,</hi> I beg
your Lordſhips leave to be a little leſs ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn.
This gameſter then had the <hi>hardineſs</hi>
to lye within during the greateſt diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.
His Maſter permitted him to give
this proof of his Courage, and lodg'd him
in the next room to his own. There was
<hi>John engariſon'd,</hi> and provided for the
aſſault with a <hi>truſty</hi> Sword, and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
of War. And for ſome time there
was ſcarce a night paſt, without ſome
doubty action and encounter, in which the
ſucceſs was various. One while <hi>John</hi>'s
bag and baggage would be in the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<hi>power, Doublet</hi> and <hi>Breeches</hi> ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53430:62"/>
and his <hi>Shooes</hi> raiſed in <hi>rebellion</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him; and then <hi>luſty John</hi> by <hi>Dint</hi>
of Weapon recovers all again, ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the <hi>inſurrection</hi> of his <hi>Shooes,</hi> and
holds his own in ſpight of <hi>Satan,</hi> and the
<hi>Drummer.</hi> And for the moſt part our
Combatant came off with honour and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
except when his enemy out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watch'd
and ſurprized him, and then he's
made a priſoner, bound hand and foot,
and at the mercy of the <hi>Goblin;</hi> till he
hath got the opportunity of recovering his
<hi>Diabolical Blade,</hi> and then our Champion
is in good plight again. Sometimes the
Scuffle was ſo <hi>great</hi> and <hi>loud,</hi> that Mr. <hi>M.</hi>
himſelf was fain to come in to <hi>John's</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
which he took in very ill part, as
a diſtruſt of his courage; as if he were
not ſingly able to deal with the <hi>Devil,</hi> who
is a very <hi>Coward,</hi> and fights with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
of a <hi>Chain</hi> at his <hi>Heels.</hi> After
theſe contraſts, Sir <hi>Tho. Bennet</hi>'s Son whoſe
workman the <hi>Drummer</hi> had ſometimes
been, came to the houſe, and told Mr. <hi>M.</hi>
ſome words that he had ſpoken, which it
ſeems was not well reſented; for as ſoon
as they were in bed, the <hi>Drum</hi> came with
a mighty <hi>rattle:</hi> the Gentleman aroſe and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53430:62"/>
call'd his man to him, who lay with <hi>John;</hi>
and no ſooner was Mr. <hi>Bennets</hi> Servant
gone, but there came a ruſhing noiſe as if
it had been a Gentlewoman in Silk, to
<hi>Johns</hi> bed-ſide. Our <hi>Champion</hi> takes the
<hi>Alarm,</hi> and catches at his <hi>Sword</hi> to aſſault
the <hi>Lady,</hi> contrary to all the rules of
<hi>Knight errantry.</hi> 'Twas with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
and tugging that he got it into his
poſſeſſion: for it ſeems the <hi>Aiery Damoſel</hi>
was not willing to be courted with <hi>John's
Cutting Complements:</hi> But being poſſeſt
of that <hi>dreadful Blade,</hi> the <hi>Amazon</hi> of the
<hi>Aire</hi> withdrew her ſelf from the danger of
his provoked ire, and left the Champion
to admire the effects of his courage. But
enough of <hi>plaiſance</hi> upon the occaſion of
<hi>John's Chivalry,</hi> and <hi>Encounters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By ſeveral inſtances it hath been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
that this <hi>Spirit</hi> was <hi>afraid</hi> of a <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,</hi>
or at leaſt pretended to be ſo; for
when they uſed a <hi>Sword,</hi> it alwayes cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
avoided. And of this my Lord, I
have given an account elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>About the beginning of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1662.
They were wont to hear a <hi>ſinging</hi> in the
<hi>Chimney,</hi> before <hi>It</hi> came down. And one
night about this time, Lights were ſeen in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53430:63"/>
the Houſe; one of which came into Mr.
<hi>Mompeſſons</hi> Chamber, which ſeemed <hi>blue</hi>
and <hi>glimmering,</hi> and cauſed a great ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in their eyes that ſaw it. An intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that this <hi>Daemon</hi> had its <hi>vehicle</hi> from
the <hi>bituminous Mines</hi> of the <hi>lower Regions.</hi>
After the light, ſomething was heard com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the Stairs, as if it had been ſome
one without Shooes. The light was alſo
4 or 5 times ſeen in the Childrens Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and the Maids confidently affirm,
that the doors were at leaſt ten times open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſhut in their ſight. They heard a
noiſe at the ſame time when the Doors
were opened, as if half a dozen had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
in together. After which ſome were
heard to walk about the room, and one
ruſled as if it had been in Silk. The like
Mr. <hi>M.</hi> himſelf once heard.</p>
                  <p>During the time of the knocking, when
many were preſent, a Gentleman of the
company ſaid, <hi>Satan,</hi> If the <hi>Drummer</hi>
ſet thee a work, give three knocks and no
more, which it did very diſtinctly, and
ſtopt. Then the Gentleman knockt, to ſee
if it would anſwer him as it was wont, but
it remained quiet. He further tryed it the
ſame way, bidding it, for confirmatton,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53430:63"/>
if it were the <hi>Drummer,</hi> to give 5 knocks
and no more that night, which it did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
and was ſilent all the night af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This was done in the preſence of Sir
<hi>Tho. Chamberlain</hi> of <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
others.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> morning, <hi>Jan.</hi> 10. an
hour before day the <hi>Drum</hi> was beaten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the out-ſides of Mr. <hi>Mompeſſons</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
from whence it went to the other
end of the Houſe, where ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Strangers, lay, playing at their door,
and without, 4 or 5 ſeveral Tunes, and ſo
went off into the Air.</p>
                  <p>The next night a Smith of the Village
lying with <hi>John,</hi> they heard a noiſe in the
room, as if one had been ſhooing of a
Horſe there; and ſomewhat came as it
were with a pair of <hi>Pincers,</hi> and ſnipt at
the Smiths Noſe moſt part of the Night,</p>
                  <p>One morning Mr. <hi>Mompeſſon</hi> riſing
early to go a Journey, heard a great noiſe
below, where the Children lay, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
down with a Piſtol in his hand, heard
this voice, <hi>A Witch, a Witch,</hi> as they had
alſo heard it once before; but upon his
entrance all was quiet. Having one night
played ſome little pranks at Mr. <hi>Mompeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53430:64"/>
Beds feet, it went into another Bed,
where lay one of his Daughters, where
<hi>It</hi> paſſed from ſide to ſide, and lifted
her up as it went under her. At that
time there were three kindes of noiſes
in the Bed. They endeavoured to thruſt at
<hi>It</hi> with a <hi>Sword,</hi> but it very carefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
them, ſtill skipping under the
Childe, when they were ready to thruſt.
The night after <hi>It</hi> came <hi>panting,</hi> like a
Dog out of breath; upon which one
took a Bedſtaff to knock, which was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of her hand, and thrown away.
Upon this company came up, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
the room was filled with a <hi>bloomy
noiſome</hi> ſmell, and was very <hi>hot,</hi> though
without Fire, and in midſt of a very <hi>ſharp</hi>
and <hi>ſevere</hi> Winter. <hi>It</hi> continued in the
Bed, panting, and ſcratching and hour and
half, and then went into the next Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where it knockt a little, and ſeemed
to rattle a chain. Thus it did for two or
three nights together.</p>
                  <p>After this the old Gentlewomans Bible
was found in the Aſhes open, the paper
ſide being downwards. Mr. <hi>Mompeſson</hi>
took it up, and obſerved that it lay open at
the third Chapter of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> in which there
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53430:64"/>
mention is of the <hi>unclean ſpirits falling
down before our Saviour;</hi> of his <hi>giving
power to the 12 to caſt out Devils,</hi> and of
the <hi>Scribes</hi> opinion, that he <hi>caſt them out
through Beelzebub.</hi> The next night they
ſtrewed aſhes over the Chamber, to ſee
what <hi>impreſsions</hi> it would leave. And in
the morning, found in one place the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
of a great <hi>Claw,</hi> in another of a
leſſer; ſome Letters in another, which
they could make nothing of; beſides many
<hi>Circles</hi> and <hi>Scratches</hi> in the Aſhes: all
which I ſuppoſe were <hi>ludicrous</hi> devices,
by which the <hi>ſportful Daemon</hi> made <hi>paſtime</hi>
with humane <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Credulity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About this time, as I formerly told your
Lordſhip, my curioſity drew me to the
Houſe, to be a witneſs of ſome of thoſe
ſtrange paſſages. It had ceas't from its
pranks of <hi>Drumming,</hi> and <hi>ruder noiſes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I came; but moſt of the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
circumſtances before related,
were confirmed to me there by ſeveral of
the Neighbours together, who had been
preſent at them. At that time it uſed
to haunt the Children; I heard it
ſcratch very loudly and diſtinctly in their
Bed, behinde the Boulſter. I thruſt in my
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53430:65"/>
hand to the place where the noiſe ſeemed
to be, upon which <hi>It</hi> withdrew to another
part of the Bed; and upon the taking out
of my hand, it returned as before. I had
heard of its imitating noiſes, and therefore
made the trial, by ſcratching certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
times upon the Sheet, as 5. and
7. and 10. which <hi>It</hi> did alſo, and ſtill ſtopt
at my number. After a while <hi>It</hi> went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the midſt of the Bed under the Children,
and there <hi>panted</hi> like a Dog, very loudly.
I put my hand upon the place, and felt the
Bed bear up againſt it, as if ſomething had
thruſt it up; but by graſping, could feel no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Feathers: and there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
under it. The motion <hi>It</hi> cauſed by
this <hi>panting</hi> was ſo ſtrong, that it ſhook the
Room, and Windows. It continued thus
for more than half an hour, while I ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and as long after. I was certain there
could be no <hi>fallacy</hi> nor <hi>deceit</hi> in theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
which I critically examined; and
I am ſure there was nothing of <hi>fear,</hi> or
<hi>imagination</hi> in the caſe; for I was no
more concern'd than I am at the Writing
this Relation.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed with Mr. <hi>Mompeſson</hi>'s
own particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:53430:65"/>
There came one morning a light into
the Childrens Chamber, and the voice,
crying, <hi>A Witch, a Witch,</hi> for at leaſt an
hundred times together. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſeeing
at a time ſome Wood move that was in
the Chimney, when no one was near, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
a Piſtol into it; after which they
found ſeveral drops of Blood on the
Hearth, and in divers places of the Stairs.</p>
                  <p>There was a ſeeming <hi>calm</hi> in the Houſe
for 2 or 3 nights after the diſcharge of the
<hi>Piſtol;</hi> but then it came again, applying
<hi>It</hi> ſelf to a little childe, newly taken from
Nurſe; which It ſo perſecuted, that It
would not let the poor Infant reſt for two
nights together, nor ſuffer a Candle in the
Room, but would carry them away light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up the <hi>Chimney,</hi> or throw them under
the Bed. It ſo ſcared this Childe, by leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon it, that for ſome hours it could
not be recovered out of the fright. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they were enforced again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remove
the Children out of the Houſe.
The next night after they were gone, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
about midnight came up the Stairs,
and knock't at Mr. <hi>Mompeſſon</hi>'s door; but
he lying ſtill, <hi>It</hi> went up another pair of
Stairs, to his man's Chamber, to whom <hi>It</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:53430:66"/>
appeared, ſtanding at his Beds foot. The
exact ſhape and proportion he could not
diſcover; but ſaw a great body, with two
<hi>red</hi> and <hi>glaring</hi> eyes, which for ſome time
were fixt ſteddily upon him, and at length
diſappeared.</p>
                  <p>Another night Strangers being preſent,
<hi>It</hi> purr'd in the Children's Bed like a <hi>Cat;</hi>
and at that time the Cloaths and Children
were lift up from the Bed, and 6. men
could not keep them down. Upon this
they removed them thence, intending to
have ript up the Bed. But they were no
ſooner laid in another, but this ſecond
Bed was more troubled than the former.
It continued thus 4. hours, and ſo beat the
Childrens Legs againſt the Beds-Poſts,
that they were forced to ariſe, and ſit up
all night. After this it would empty
Chamber-pots into their Beds, and ſtrew
them with Aſhes; and that though they
were never ſo carefully watch't. It put a
long piked Iron into Mr. <hi>Mompeſſon</hi>'s Bed,
and into his Mothers a naked Knife up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.
It would fill porrengers with Aſhes,
throw every thing about, and keep a noiſe
all day.</p>
                  <p>About the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> 1663. a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53430:66"/>
Gentleman that lay in the houſe had all his
money turn'd black in his Pockets. And
Mr. <hi>Mompeſſon,</hi> one morning coming into
his Stable, found the Horſe he was wont
to ride, on the ground, with one of his
hinder Legs in his mouth, and ſo faſtned
there, that 'twas difficult work for ſeveral
men, with a Leaver, to get it out. After
this there were ſome other remarkable
things; but my <hi>account</hi> goes no farther:
Only Mr. <hi>Mompeſſon</hi> told me, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the houſe was ſeveral nights beſet
with 7. or 8. in the ſhape of men, who
as ſoon as a Gun was diſcharged, would
ſhufflle away together into an Arbour.</p>
                  <p>THE DRUMMER was tryed at the
<hi>Aſsize</hi> at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> for ſome petty Fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
he had committed; and there theſe
paſſages alſo were produc'd, and urg'd.
He was condemn'd to the <hi>Iſlands,</hi> and
was accordingly ſent away: but I know
not how, made a ſhift to come back again.
And 'tis obſervable, that during all the
time of his reſtraint, and abſence, the
Houſe was in quiet; but as ſoon as ever
he came back, the diſturbance alſo return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
He had been a Souldier under <hi>CROM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WEL,</hi>
and uſed to talk much of gallant
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53430:67"/>
Books he had of an odde Fellow's, who
was counted a <hi>Wizard.</hi> And upon this
occaſion I'le mention to your Lordſhip a
paſſage, which I had not from Mr. <hi>Mom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſſon;</hi>
but yet is not irrelative.</p>
                  <p>A Gentleman, who was with me at the
Houſe, being in company with one who
practiſeth <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and pretends to <hi>ſtrange</hi>
matters, was telling the Doctor this <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
The <hi>Phyſician</hi> told him, he was ſure
'twas nothing but a <hi>Rendezvous</hi> of
<hi>Witches,</hi> and that for an hundred pounds
he would undertake to clear the houſe
from all diſturbance. In conſequence of
which diſcourſe he talk'd many high
things; and having got my friend alone in
another Room apart from the company,
ſaid, he would ſhew him he could do
ſomething more than ordinary, and askt
him who he deſired to <hi>ſee.</hi> The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
had no great confidence in his talk, but
yet he preſſing that he would name ſome
one, ſaid, He deſired to ſee no one ſo
much as his Wife. Upon this the Doctor
took up a Glaſs that was in the room, and
ſetting it down again, bid him look in it,
which he did; and profeſſeth that he ſaw
the perfect <hi>Image</hi> of his <hi>Wife:</hi> which is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53430:67"/>
the more ſtrange, in that this perſon was
an abſolute ſtranger to her. This my Lord,
my friend averr'd to mee for a certainty;
and he is one in whoſe word I can repoſe,
being a man very ſober, and intelligent.
I underſtand ſince, that this Doctor hath
the name of a very odde perſon among his
Neighbours; and not only among the
credulous, and eaſie vulgar, but even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoſe of more ſenſe and judgment.</p>
                  <p>THUS MY LORD, I have given
your Honour the ſumme of the <hi>Relation,</hi>
which I extracted from Mr. <hi>Mompeſſon</hi>'s
own Letters. The ſame particulars alſo
he writ to the Doctor of the Chair in
<hi>Oxford.</hi> He is a Gentleman of whoſe <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity</hi>
in this account I know not the leaſt
ground of ſuſpicion, he being neither <hi>vain,</hi>
nor <hi>credulous;</hi> but a <hi>diſcreet, ſagacious,</hi>
and <hi>manly</hi> perſon. You know, my <hi>Lord,</hi>
the credit of <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>fact</hi> depends much
upon the conſideration of the <hi>Relators;</hi>
and if <hi>They</hi> cannot be <hi>deceived</hi> themſelves,
nor ſuppoſed any wayes intereſſed to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi>
upon others, we <hi>may,</hi> and we <hi>ought</hi>
to acquieſce in their <hi>reports:</hi> For upon
theſe circumſtances all <hi>humane Faith</hi> is
grounded, and <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53430:68"/>
of any proof beſides, but <hi>that</hi> of
<hi>immediate ſenſible Evidence.</hi> Now this
Gentleman cannot be thought <hi>ignorant
himſelf</hi> of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>certainty</hi> of
what he relates, it having been done in
his <hi>Family,</hi> and himſelf a <hi>Witneſs,</hi> and
that not of a little circumſtance, or two,
but of a hundred; not for once, or twice
only, but for the ſpace of ſome years; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which time he was a <hi>concerned,</hi> and
<hi>inquiſitive</hi> obſerver. So that it cannot with
any ſhew of reaſon be ſuppoſed that any
of his Servants abuſed him, ſince in all
that time he muſt needs have <hi>detected</hi> the
<hi>deceit:</hi> and what intereſt could any of his
Family have had (if it had been poſſible to
have managed it without diſcovery) to
continue ſo <hi>long,</hi> ſo <hi>troubleſome,</hi> and ſo
<hi>injurious</hi> a <hi>fallacy.</hi> Nor can it with any
thing of more <hi>probability</hi> be imagined,
that his own <hi>melancholly</hi> deluded him;
ſince (beſides that, he is no <hi>craſie</hi> or <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native</hi>
perſon) that humour could not
have been ſo laſting and <hi>pertinacious:</hi> or
if it were ſo in him, can we think he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
his whole Family, and thoſe Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of his Neighbours and Others, that
think themſelves as well aſſured of thoſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53430:68"/>
actions, of which they were Witneſſes,
as himſelf? Theſe are <hi>wilde Suppoſals,</hi> and
not like to tempt any but thoſe whoſe
<hi>Wills</hi> are their <hi>Reaſons.</hi> The <hi>main Relator</hi>
then <hi>knew himſelf,</hi> whether what he ſaid
was <hi>True,</hi> and whether thoſe things which
were acted in his Houſe were <hi>Juggles,</hi> and
contrived <hi>Impoſtures,</hi> or <hi>extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities.</hi>
And if ſo, What Intereſt could
he ſerve in maintaining ſuch a <hi>cheat,</hi> if it
were one, and he knew it to be ſo?</p>
                  <p>He ſuffered by it in his <hi>Name,</hi> in his
<hi>Eſtate,</hi> in his <hi>Affairs,</hi> and in the general
<hi>Peace</hi> of his <hi>Family.</hi> Thoſe that believ'd
not any thing of <hi>Spirits,</hi> or <hi>Witchcraft</hi> in
thoſe <hi>Tranſactions,</hi> (which were not a
few) took him for an <hi>Impoſtor.</hi> Thoſe
that <hi>did,</hi> many of them judg'd the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of ſuch an extraordinary evil, to
be the <hi>Judgment</hi> of God upon him, for
ſome <hi>notorious impiety.</hi> Thus his <hi>Name</hi>
was continually expoſed to <hi>Cenſure,</hi> and
his <hi>Eſtate</hi> ſuffered by the concourſe of
people from all parts to his houſe, whom
he could not diſmiſs without the <hi>Civility</hi>
of an Entertainment. And beſides this,
he was hindered, and diverted from the
proſecution of his Affairs, and he could
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53430:69"/>
hardly get, or retain any in his Service.
To which, if I adde the continual <hi>hurry</hi>
that his Family was in; the <hi>affrights,
vexations,</hi> and <hi>toſsings</hi> up and down of
his Children, and the <hi>Watchings</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance</hi>
of his whole Houſe; in all
which himſelf muſt needs be the moſt
concerned perſon. I ſay, the putting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
of theſe Circumſtances will be
evidence enough, that he could have no
intereſt in deſigning to put a cheat upon
the world, in which he would moſt of
all have injured, and abuſed himſelf. Or,
if he ſhould have deſigned and managed
ſo <hi>incredible,</hi> ſo <hi>unprofitable</hi> an Impoſture,
'tis ſtrange he ſhould trouble himſelf ſo
long in actuating an <hi>abuſive Artifice,</hi> only
to <hi>deceive,</hi> and to be talk't of. And 'tis
yet more ſo, that none of thoſe numerous
<hi>inquiſitive</hi> perſons, that came thither pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
to <hi>Criticiſe,</hi> and examine the truth
of thoſe matters, could make any <hi>Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries.</hi>
Eſpecially ſince many came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
againſt the <hi>belief</hi> of ſuch things in
<hi>general,</hi> and others reſolved before-hand
againſt the belief of <hi>this;</hi> and all were
permitted all poſſible freedom of <hi>ſearch</hi>
and <hi>inquiry:</hi> And after things were
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53430:69"/>
weighed and examined, ſeveral that were
prejudicated enough before, went away
ſtrongly convicted. To which I adde,
That there are divers <hi>particulars</hi> in the
<hi>Story,</hi> in which no <hi>abuſe</hi> or <hi>deceit</hi> could
have been practiſed; as the <hi>motion</hi> of
<hi>Boards</hi> and <hi>Chairs</hi> of themſelves, the <hi>beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of a <hi>Drum</hi> in the midſt of a <hi>Room,</hi> and
in the <hi>Air,</hi> when nothing was to be ſeen;
the <hi>heat</hi> that fill'd a whole Room without
<hi>Fire</hi> in exceſſive cold Weather: The
<hi>Scratching</hi> and <hi>Panting</hi> where nothing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
could be ſuſpected for the cauſe;
and ſeveral others ſuch like: All which
have numbers of ſober and unintereſſed
perſons to atteſt them.</p>
                  <p>'TIS true my Lord, that when the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
the King ſent were there, the Houſe
was <hi>quiet,</hi> and nothing heard, or ſeen
that night. And this was <hi>confidently,</hi> and
with <hi>triumph</hi> reported by many as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the <hi>untruth</hi> of the <hi>Story.</hi> But
certainly 'twas but <hi>poor Logick</hi> to conclude
in <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> from a <hi>ſingle Negative,</hi>
and <hi>ſuch a one</hi> againſt <hi>numerous Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;</hi>
and to inferr that a thing was never
done, becauſe omitted at ſuch a ſeaſon;
and that <hi>no body</hi> ever <hi>ſaw,</hi> what <hi>this man,</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:53430:70"/>
or <hi>that</hi> did not. By the ſame rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
I may ſay, that there were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any Robbers upon <hi>Salisbury Plains,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I have often travelled over them, and
never met any of thoſe <hi>ſorts</hi> of <hi>Violence;</hi>
and the French-man inferred well, that
ſaid, <hi>There was no Sun in</hi> England, <hi>becauſe
he was 6 Weeks here, and never ſaw it.</hi>
This my Lord, is the common Argument
of thoſe that deny the <hi>being</hi> of <hi>Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
They have travel'd all times of the
night, and never ſaw any thing <hi>worſe</hi> than
<hi>themſelves;</hi> and <hi>it may be ſo:</hi> Therefore
Spirits and Apparitions are <hi>Bugs</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures.</hi>
But why do not ſuch Arguers
conclude, that there was never a <hi>Cut-Purſe</hi>
on <hi>Ludgate-Hill,</hi> becauſe they have paſt
that way a hundred times, and were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
met with by any of thoſe <hi>nimble pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioners.</hi>
Certainly, he that denyes <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions</hi>
upon the confidence of this <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,</hi>
againſt the vaſt <hi>heap</hi> of <hi>poſitive
Aſſurances,</hi> is <hi>credulous,</hi> if he believe
there was ever any <hi>High-way-man</hi> in the
world, if he himſelf was never rob'd.
And the <hi>Tryals</hi> of <hi>Aſs<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

caſe, than in that of <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
which have the very ſame evidence.
But for the particular of the quiet of Mr.
<hi>Mompeſſon</hi>'s Houſe, while the <hi>Courtiers</hi>
were there, it may be remembred, and
conſidered, that the <hi>Diſturbances</hi> were not
alwayes <hi>conſtant,</hi> but <hi>interrupted</hi> by <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals</hi>
of <hi>Ceſſation,</hi> ſometimes for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
dayes, and ſometimes for weeks, as
is mention'd in the Relation; ſome paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of which, that record thoſe Ceſſations,
were I am ſure written in Mr. <hi>Mompeſſon</hi>'s
Letters, before thoſe Gentlemen had been
at <hi>Tedworth.</hi> So that its omitting at that
time 'tis like was meerly <hi>accidental;</hi> or
poſſibly the <hi>malicious Spirit</hi> was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to give ſo <hi>publick</hi> a <hi>teſtimony</hi> of <hi>Its
being,</hi> and <hi>troubleſome incurſions,</hi> for the
convincing thoſe, he had rather ſhould
continue in the <hi>disbelief</hi> of his <hi>exiſtence:</hi>
but however it were, this circumſtance
will afford but a very ſlender <hi>inference</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>credit</hi> of the <hi>Story,</hi> except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoſe who are willing to take any
thing for an <hi>Argument</hi> againſt things they
have an intereſt not to acknowledge. There
are other exceptions made againſt the
Truth of this Relation, and Dr. <hi>H. More</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:53430:71"/>
ſent me an account of ſome particulars
that were <hi>objected</hi> at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to which
I have anſwered in a Letter to him, and
have ſent it your Lordſhip in company
with this.</p>
                  <p>THUS, my <hi>Lord,</hi> I have given your
Honour the ſum of this Affair; and I
have taken notice of, and recorded the
<hi>particulars</hi> of the <hi>Relation,</hi> not to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<hi>curioſity,</hi> or feed the <hi>humour</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in <hi>wonders,</hi> which are but <hi>mean</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
and unbecoming one that pretends
to any thing that is <hi>generous.</hi> But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
it as a great evidence againſt <hi>Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm,</hi>
the Diſeaſe of our Age. And
though thoſe paſſages are not ſo <hi>dreadful,
tragical,</hi> and <hi>amazing,</hi> as there are ſome
related in Stories of this kinde; yet are
they never the leſs <hi>probable,</hi> or <hi>true,</hi> for
being leſs <hi>prodigious,</hi> and <hi>aſtoniſhing.</hi> And
they are ſtrange enough to prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the <hi>effects</hi> of ſome <hi>inviſible extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Agent,</hi> and to demonſtrate, that
there are <hi>SPIRITS</hi> that ſometimes ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
intermeddle in our Affairs. And I
think they do it with as many clear cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of evidence as any thing that is
extant. For theſe things were not done
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53430:71"/>
                     <hi>long ago,</hi> or at <hi>far diſtance,</hi> in an <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
Age, or among a <hi>barbarous people;</hi>
they were not ſeen only by 2 or 3 of the
<hi>melancholick,</hi> and <hi>Superſtitious,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by thoſe that made them ſerve the
advantage, and intereſt of a <hi>Faction.</hi>
They were not the paſſages of a <hi>day,</hi> or
<hi>night,</hi> nor the <hi>vaniſhing glances</hi> of an

<hi>near,</hi> and <hi>late, publick, frequent,</hi> and of
<hi>years continuance;</hi> witneſſed by <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes</hi>
of <hi>competent,</hi> and <hi>unbiaſt</hi> Atteſtors,
and <hi>acted</hi> in a <hi>ſearching</hi> and <hi>incredulous</hi>

of a <hi>modeſt,</hi> and <hi>capable reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Relation, my Lord, you perceive
proves the being of <hi>SPIRITS</hi> and <hi>AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PARITIONS,</hi>
but not ſo directly that of
<hi>WITCHES</hi> and <hi>Diabolick Contracts;</hi> and
therefore, while I am about it, I ſhall adde
the other <hi>NARRATIVE</hi> which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
your Honour, and which I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> who took
the <hi>Examination</hi> upon <hi>Oath:</hi> 'Tis the ſame
Gentleman to whom I directed my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
about <hi>WITCHCRAFT,</hi> and a very
<hi>judicious, ſearching,</hi> and <hi>ſagacious</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
He was pleaſed to give me his own
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53430:72"/>
Copy of the <hi>Examination;</hi> the ſum of
which is in the following <hi>Relation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>ON SUNDAY, 15. of <hi>Nov.</hi> 1657.
about three of the Clock in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon,
<hi>Rich, Jones,</hi> then a <hi>ſprightly
youth,</hi> about 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> years old, Son of <hi>Henry
Jones</hi> of <hi>Shepton Mallet,</hi> in this County
of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> being in his Fathers Houſe
alone, and perceiving one looking in at
the Window, went to the door, where
one <hi>Jane Brooks</hi> of the ſame Town (but
then by <hi>name</hi> unknown to this Boy) came
to him. She deſired him to give her a piece
of cloſe Bread, and gave him an <hi>Apple.</hi>
After which ſhe alſo ſtroked him down on
the right ſide, ſhook him by the hand,
and ſo bid him good night. The Youth
returned into the houſe, where he had
been left well when his Father, and one
<hi>Gibſon</hi> went from him: but at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
which was within an hour, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about,
they found him ill, and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his right ſide, in which the pain
continued the moſt part of that night:
and on Monday following in the evening,
the Boy roaſted the Apple he had of <hi>Jane
Brooks;</hi> aud having eaten about half of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53430:72"/>
it, was extreamly ill, and ſometimes
ſpeechleſs; but being recovered, he told
his Father, that a Woman of the Town
on the Sunday before, had given him <hi>that
Apple,</hi> and that ſhe ſtroked him on the
ſide, as above. He ſaid he knew not her
Name, but <hi>ſhould</hi> her perſon, if he ſaw
her. Vpon this <hi>Jones</hi> was adviſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
the Women of <hi>Shepton</hi> to come to
his houſe, upon the occaſion of his Son's
illneſs; and the Child told him, that in
caſe the Woman ſhould come in, when
he was in his Fit, if he were not able to
ſpeak, he would give him an intimation
by a Jogg, and deſired that his Father
would then lead him through the Room;
for he ſaid he would put his hand upon
her, if ſhe were there. After this he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
very ill, many Women came daily
to ſee him: And <hi>Jane Brooks</hi> the Sunday
after, came in with two of her Siſters,
when ſeveral other Women of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
were there.</p>
                  <p>Upon her coming in; the <hi>Boy</hi> was taken
ſo <hi>ill,</hi> that for ſome time he could not <hi>ſee,</hi>
nor <hi>ſpeak;</hi> but having recovered his <hi>ſight,</hi>
he gave his Father that <hi>Item,</hi> and <hi>he</hi> lead
him about the Room. The <hi>Boy</hi> drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53430:73"/>
                     <hi>Jane Brooks,</hi> who was behinde her
two Siſters, among the other Women, and
put his hand upon her; which his Father
perceiving, immediately <hi>ſcratcheth</hi> her
her <hi>Face,</hi> and drew blood from her. The
Youth then preſently cryed out that he
was <hi>well,</hi> and ſo he continued 7. or 8.
dayes. But then meeting with <hi>Alice Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
ſiſter to <hi>Jane Brooks,</hi> who paſſing
by, ſaid to him <hi>[How do you my Honey?]</hi>
he preſently fell ill again. And after <hi>that,</hi>
the ſaid <hi>Coward,</hi> and <hi>Brooks</hi> often appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him: The <hi>Boy</hi> would deſcribe the
<hi>Cloath<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s</hi> and <hi>Habit</hi> they were in at the
time, exactly, as the Conſtable, and others,
have found upon repairing to them;
though <hi>Brooks</hi>'s houſe was at a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from <hi>Jones</hi>'s. This they often try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and alwayes found the Boy <hi>right</hi> in
his <hi>Deſcriptions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On a certain Sunday about Noon, the
<hi>Childe</hi> being in a Room with his <hi>Father,</hi>
and one <hi>Gibſon,</hi> and in his <hi>Fit,</hi> He on the
ſudden called out, that he ſaw <hi>Jane Brooks</hi>
on the <hi>Wall,</hi> and <hi>pointed</hi> to the place,
where immediately <hi>Gibſon ſtruck</hi> with a
<hi>Knife;</hi> upon which the Boy cryed out,
<hi>[O Father, Coz.</hi> Gibſon <hi>hath cut</hi> Jane
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53430:73"/>
Brooks<hi>'s hand, and 'tis Bloody.]</hi> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and <hi>Gibſon</hi> immediately repaired
to the Conſtable, a diſcreet perſon, and
acquainting him with what had paſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
him to go with them to <hi>Jane Brooks</hi>
Houſe, which he did. They found her
ſitting in her Room on a ſtool with one
hand over the other. The Conſtable ask'd
her how ſhe did? ſhe anſwered, <hi>not well.</hi>
He ask'd again, why ſhe ſate with one
hand over the other? ſhe replyed, <hi>She
was wont to do ſo.</hi> He enquired if any
thing were amiſs with her hand? her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
was, <hi>It was well enough.</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
deſired he might ſee the hand that
was under; which ſhe being unwilling
to ſhew him, he drew it out, and found
it <hi>bloody,</hi> according to what the <hi>Boy</hi> had
ſaid. Being ask't how it came ſo, ſhe ſaid,
<hi>'Twas ſcratched with a great Pin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the 8. of <hi>December,</hi> 1657. the <hi>Boy,
Jane Brooks,</hi> and <hi>Alice Coward,</hi> appeared
at <hi>Caſtle Cary,</hi> before the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Hunt,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cary.</hi> The <hi>Boy</hi> having
begun to give his <hi>Teſtimony</hi> upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in of the two Women, and their
<hi>looking</hi> on him, was inſtantly taken <hi>ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi>
and ſo remained till the Women
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53430:74"/>
were removed out of the Room, and then
in a ſhort time, upon examination, he gave
a full relation of the mentioned parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p>On the 11. of <hi>January</hi> following, the
<hi>Boy</hi> was again examined by the ſame <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices</hi>
at <hi>Shepton Mallet,</hi> and upon the ſight
of <hi>Jane Brooks</hi> was again taken <hi>ſpeechleſs,</hi>
but was <hi>not ſo</hi> afterwards, when <hi>Alice
Coward</hi> came into the room to him.</p>
                  <p>On the next appearance at <hi>Shepton,</hi>
which was on the 17. of <hi>February,</hi> there
were preſent many <hi>Gentlemen, Miniſters,</hi>
and others: The <hi>Boy</hi> fell into his <hi>Fit</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſight of <hi>Jane Brooks,</hi> and lay in a
man's Arms like a <hi>dead</hi> perſon: the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
was then willed to lay her hand on
him, which ſhe <hi>did,</hi> and he thereupon
<hi>ſtarted,</hi> and <hi>ſprang</hi> out in a very ſtrange
and unuſual manner. One of the Juſtices
to prevent all poſſibilities of <hi>Legerdemain,</hi>
cauſed <hi>Gibſon,</hi> and the reſt to ſtand <hi>off</hi>
from the <hi>Boy,</hi> and then <hi>that Juſtice</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
held him. The youth being blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded,
the Juſtice call'd as if <hi>Brooks</hi>
ſhould touch him, but winked to others
to do it, which two or three ſucceſſively
did; but the <hi>Boy</hi> appeared not concern'd.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53430:74"/>
The <hi>Juſtice</hi> then call'd on the <hi>Father</hi> to
take him, but had privately before deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
one Mr. <hi>Geoffery Strode</hi> to bring <hi>Jane
Brooks</hi> to touch him, at ſuch time, as he
ſhould call for his Father; which was
done, and the <hi>Boy</hi> immediately <hi>ſprang</hi> out
after a very odde and violent faſhion. He
was after touched by ſeveral perſons, and
moved not; but <hi>Jane Brooks</hi> being again
cauſed to put her hand upon him, he <hi>ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
and ſprang out twice or thrice, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
All this while he remained in his
<hi>Fit,</hi> and ſome time after; and being
then laid, on a Bed in the ſame Room, the
people preſent could not for a long time
<hi>bow</hi> either of his <hi>Arms,</hi> or <hi>Legs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Between the mentioned 15. of <hi>Nov.</hi>
and the 11. of <hi>Jan.</hi> the two <hi>Women</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
often to the <hi>Boy,</hi> their <hi>Hands cold,</hi>
their <hi>Eyes ſtaring,</hi> and their <hi>Lips,</hi> and
<hi>Cheeks looking pale.</hi> In this manner on a
<hi>Thurſday</hi> about noon, the <hi>Boy</hi> being new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laid into his Bed, <hi>Jane Brooks,</hi> and
<hi>Alice Coward appeared</hi> to him, and told
him, that what they had begun, they
could not perform. But if he would ſay
no more of it, they would give him <hi>money,</hi>
and ſo put a <hi>two-pence</hi> into his Pocket. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53430:75"/>
which they took him out of his Bed,
laid him on the ground, and vaniſhed;
and the Boy was found by thoſe that came
next into the Room lying on the floor, as
if he had been <hi>dead.</hi> The two-pence was
ſeen by many, and when it was put into
the <hi>Fire,</hi> and <hi>hot,</hi> the Boy would fall ill;
but as ſoon as it was taken out, and cold,
he would be again as well as before. This
was ſeen and obſerved by a Miniſter, a
diſcreet perſon, when the Boy was in one
Room, and the <hi>two-pence</hi> (without his
knowledge) put into the Fire in another:
and this was divers times tryed in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of ſeveral perſons.</p>
                  <p>Between the 8. of <hi>Decemb.</hi> and the
17. of <hi>Feb.</hi> in the year mention'd, divers
perſons at ſundry times heard in the Boy
a noiſe like the <hi>croaking</hi> of a <hi>Toad,</hi> and a
voice within him, ſaying, <hi>Jane Brooks,
Alice Coward,</hi> twelve times in near a
quarter of an hour. At the ſame time
ſome held a Candle before the Boyes
face, and earneſtly looked on him, but
could not perceive the leaſt motion of his
Tongue, Teeth, or Lips, while the voice
was heard.</p>
                  <p>On the 25. of <hi>Feb.</hi> between two and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53430:75"/>
three in the afternoon, the Boy being at
the Houſe of <hi>Richard Iſles</hi> in <hi>Shepton
Mallet,</hi> went out of the Room into the
Garden; <hi>Iſles</hi> his Wife followed him, and
was within two yards when ſhe ſaw him
riſe up from the ground before her, and
ſo mounted higher and higher, till he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the Air over the Garden Wall, and
was carried ſo above ground more then
300. yards, falling at laſt at one <hi>Jordan</hi>'s
door at <hi>Shepton,</hi> where he was found as
dead for a time. But coming to himſelf,
told <hi>Jordan</hi> that <hi>Jane Brooks</hi> had taken
him up by the Arme out of <hi>Iſles</hi> his
Garden, and carried him in the Air, as
is related.</p>
                  <p>The Boy at ſeveral other times was
gone on the ſuddain, and upon ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, found in another room as dead;
and at ſometimes <hi>ſtrangely hanging</hi> above
ground, his hands being flat againſt a
great Beam in the top of the room, and
all his body two or three foot from
ground. There he hath hung a quarter of
an hour together; and being afterwards
come to himſelf, he told thoſe that found
him, that <hi>Jane Brooks</hi> had carried him to
that place, and held him there. Nine
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53430:76"/>
people at a time ſaw the Boy ſo ſtrangely
hanging by the Beam.</p>
                  <p>From the 15. of <hi>Nov.</hi> to the 10. of
<hi>March</hi> following, he was by reaſon of
his <hi>Fits</hi> much waſted in his body, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirited;
but after that time, being the
day the two Women were ſent to Goal,
he had no more of thoſe Fits.</p>
                  <p>Jane Brooks <hi>was</hi> condemned, <hi>and</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
<hi>at</hi> Charde Aſsiſes, March 26. 1658.</p>
                  <p>THIS, MY LORD, is the ſum of Mr.
<hi>Hunts</hi> NARRATIVE, which concludes
with both the Juſtices atteſtation, thus,</p>
                  <p>The aforeſaid paſſages were ſome of
them ſeen by us, and the reſt, and ſome
other remarkable ones not here ſet down,
were, upon the examination of ſeveral
credible witneſſes, taken upon Oath before
us. Subſcribed, <hi>Rob. Hunt. John Cary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS, I think, my Lord, is good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the being of <hi>Witches;</hi> and if
the <hi>Sadduce</hi> be not ſatisfied with it, I
would fain know, what kinde of <hi>proof</hi>
he would expect? Here are the <hi>teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
of <hi>ſence,</hi> the <hi>Oaths</hi> of ſeveral <hi>credible
Atteſtors,</hi> the <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>deliberate ſcruteny</hi>

                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:53430:76"/>
and the <hi>judgment</hi> of an <hi>Aſſize</hi> upon the
whole. And now the <hi>ſecurity</hi> of all our
<hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi> depends upon no
greater circumſtances of evidence then
<hi>theſe.</hi> If ſuch proof may not be credited,
no <hi>Fact</hi> can be proved, no <hi>wickedneſs</hi> can
be <hi>puniſh'd,</hi> no <hi>right</hi> can be <hi>determined,
Law</hi> is at an end, and <hi>blinde Juſtice</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell where to <hi>ſtrike. All men are lyars,</hi>
and the <hi>Long Sword</hi> muſt ſettle <hi>properties,</hi>
and reſolve all doubts of <hi>Truth,</hi> and
<hi>Claim.</hi> Theſe large morſels, my Lord,
he that denies ſuch <hi>evidences</hi> of <hi>fact</hi> muſt
ſwallow, and then let him tell me by what
<hi>title</hi> he holds any thing he poſſeſſeth? How
proves he his Relation, and conſequently
Succeſſion to the rights of his <hi>preſumed
progenitors?</hi> and 'tis no great matter whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he can or no, ſince when that is done,
how will it appear, that his <hi>Bonds, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails,</hi>
and <hi>Leaſes</hi> are not <hi>Forgeries,</hi> and
<hi>tricks</hi> of <hi>Couſenage?</hi> And how will he clear
his own <hi>Bargains</hi> and <hi>Tranſactions</hi> of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
from being <hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Illuſions?</hi>
Certainly, he that runs upon all theſe
<hi>Rocks,</hi> and layes the train of ſo many <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
abſurdities,</hi> hath ſome mighty winde
that drives him, and ſome huge neceſſity
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53430:77"/>
for his concluſion, and nothing elſe can ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
his aſſertion, <hi>That thoſe things of
Witches are not true;</hi> but this other, <hi>That
they are impoſſible;</hi> and when he hath done
<hi>that,</hi> I'le uſe his arguments to prove all
the world is a great <hi>inchanted Houſe,</hi> and
<hi>Nature</hi> a <hi>grand Impoſture, viz.</hi> that <hi>really</hi>
there are no ſuch things as are repreſented
to our <hi>gull'd</hi> and <hi>abuſed ſences,</hi> but that
all are meer <hi>preſtigious ſhews, and phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Idaeas.</hi> I ſay, my Lord, I'le prove
<hi>this</hi> by the ſame method of arguing that
concludes againſt the <hi>poſsibility</hi> of the
actions of <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> which I know can
proceed but to this inference, <hi>That the
mode of thoſe performances is not perceived;</hi>
from whence, if it be juſt to infer, <hi>that
the things are not;</hi> I'le ſet up for a <hi>Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptick,</hi>
and uſe the argument againſt all the
<hi>objects</hi> of my <hi>ſences;</hi> which I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
ſaid, and proved to be really as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable</hi>
and <hi>unaccountable</hi> as the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſeſt</hi>
matters of <hi>Magick</hi> and <hi>Faſcinations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, my Lord, my Pen runs out to your

                  <head>A LETTER
To the Reverend and Learned
Dr. HENRY MORE,
About the
Drummer
OF
TEDWORTH.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THe ſcrupulous care you take in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
the <hi>Story</hi> of the <hi>Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance</hi>
at <hi>TEDWORTH,</hi> is no more then
becomes a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> and one that is
not willing to be deceived. And without
ſuch a <hi>cautious,</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> enquiry,
you could not anſwer the <hi>murmures,</hi> and
<hi>petty</hi> evaſions of wilful Unbelievers.
Thoſe <hi>objections</hi> you pickt up at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
have the ill fortune to miſcarry in
almoſt every circumſtance; and are in no
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53430:78"/>
likelihood of being believed, but at a great
diſtance. Some of them, I could have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
upon mine own knowledge; and
concerning the reſt, I have made a ſtrict
inquiry of Mr. <hi>Mompeſſon</hi> himſelf, and
others, when I was laſt in thoſe parts;
and upon certain information, I give you
this account.</p>
                  <p>To the (1.) that ſaith, <hi>The Houſe is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and that this is a device to beat down
the value of it.</hi> I anſwer from <hi>his</hi> mouth,
That the <hi>Houſe is his own;</hi> and ſo the
foundation of this ſhift is overturned. The
<hi>ſecond</hi> of thoſe that ſay, <hi>It is a trick to get
money from thoſe that come to ſee the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy,</hi>
hath as little <hi>truth,</hi> but much more
<hi>malice</hi> in the firſt contrivers than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
For this Gentleman being a perſon
of Eſtate, I'me confident ſcorns ſo <hi>baſe,</hi>
and ſo <hi>beggerly</hi> a policy; and is ſo far
from making any advantage by the <hi>Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,</hi>
that <hi>it</hi> hath done him very materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
prejudice in his <hi>Fortunes,</hi> and <hi>Affairs.</hi>
And thoſe ſtrangers that come to ſee the
<hi>Prodigy,</hi> uſe to leave nothing behinde
them, except thanks for the <hi>Civility</hi> of
their <hi>Entertainments.</hi> 'Tis true (3.) as
others ſay, that <hi>the Houſe is boarded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:53430:78"/>
at leaſt a great part of it: But there
are no Cellars (as the objection adds)
ſave only under the <hi>Parlour;</hi> and the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance</hi>
was moſt inother rooms. And
whereas (4) 'tis objected, that <hi>a Knight
that offer'd to go down, could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi>
'Tis anſwer'd me, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
might have gone down, had he
pleas'd; and his Servant did, who made
a careful ſearch, but could finde nothing
that might be a cauſe of the noiſe, which
he affirmed to be above; and that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
not from the <hi>Cellar.</hi> And to diſable
what other <hi>Objectors</hi> ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> (5) <hi>That
there was no Drumming in the midſt of any
Room, but only a ſtriking on the Boards as
it were with a Hammer, in a corner of the
outſides of the Houſe:</hi> I ſay, to null this
<hi>pretence,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mompeſſon</hi> and others aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me, that the noiſe was oft in the <hi>midſt</hi>
of the <hi>Room,</hi> and oft overhead; and he
ſaith that there is ſcarce a <hi>Man,</hi> or <hi>Childe,</hi>
in the Village, but hath heard, and can
witneſs it. And after the firſt moneth it
was almoſt alwayes within. Thus Sir, to
the <hi>Objections</hi> of others which you have
gather'd. And to your <hi>own Quaeries</hi> I make
this return.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:53430:79"/>
Whereas you inquire (1.) <hi>What part
of the Childrens Bed did the Daemon beat,
and what noiſe did it make?</hi> 'Tis anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that it beat againſt the Head and Poſts
of the Bed, and that when hands were
laid on each ſide of them, at thoſe times
they would ſhake as if they would fall in
pieces; but nothing elſe could be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
or felt. The noiſe was like to that of
ſtriking with a Hammer. And then (2.)
To <hi>that,</hi> whether the <hi>Drummers Drum was
ever looked on while it beat; or was it only
in the Dark?</hi> I am aſſured, that <hi>it</hi> was <hi>ſeen</hi>
while the noiſe was made upon it, both by
the light of <hi>Fire,</hi> and <hi>Candle.</hi> (3) To the
<hi>Quaery, What were the Boards that moved,
by what light was their motion ſeen, and by
whom?</hi> Mr. <hi>Mompeſſon anſwers,</hi> They
were ſeen move <hi>forwards,</hi> and <hi>backwards</hi>
in the light of clear day, before the Sun
was ſet, and by a whole houſe full of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
And whereas (4.) you ask, <hi>In what
clearneſs of light were the Chairs ſeen walk
about, and by what Witneſſes?</hi> 'Tis an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
That they were ſeen to do ſo by
Candle-light, and by divers perſons.</p>
                  <p>As to what I was a witneſs of my ſelf,
I adde theſe circumſtances for the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53430:79"/>
of your Quaeries. The <hi>Children</hi>
were in <hi>Bed,</hi> when the <hi>Scratching</hi> and
<hi>panting</hi> was; but I am <hi>ſure</hi> did not contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to thoſe noiſes. I ſaw their hands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Cloathes, during the <hi>Scraping,</hi>
and ſearched the place whence the noiſe
came: To which I might adde, That they
were little, harmleſs, modeſt Girles, that
could not well have been ſuſpected guilty
of the confidence of ſuch a juggle, had it
been poſſible they could have acted in it.
For the <hi>panting,</hi> I am certain there was no
<hi>dog</hi> in the Bed; for I graſpt it with my
hand, and felt it in all parts, eſpecially
there where the original motion was. The
<hi>Bed</hi> alſo was <hi>ſearcht under,</hi> but no <hi>Dog,</hi>
nor any creature elſe could be found there.
The <hi>Floor</hi> I ſaid <hi>ſhook</hi> with the <hi>panting
ſenſibly,</hi> and yet it was as ſtrong and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
an one, as ordinarily is ſeen. But
the <hi>Children</hi> indeed did not ſeem to be
much <hi>concern'd,</hi> having been us'd to <hi>thoſe,</hi>
and <hi>ruder noiſes,</hi> and there was company in
the room to aſſure them.</p>
                  <p>THUS, Sir, I have briefly anſwer'd
others OBJECTIONS, and your
QUAERIES. And becauſe I have an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53430:80"/>
to ſay little more, I'le conſider
(what you know as well as any man alive)
the <hi>Reaſons</hi> men are ſo apt to cavil at this
kinde of <hi>Relations,</hi> and are rather willing
to believe any thing than the truth of ſuch
a <hi>Narrative.</hi> They are chiefly, I think,
an <hi>affected humour</hi> of <hi>Drollery,</hi> and <hi>Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing,</hi>
and a <hi>worſe</hi> cauſe, <hi>ATHEISM.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FOR the <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Subject of <hi>Witches,</hi>
and <hi>Apparitions</hi> is an apt, and ample oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.
And the <hi>cheats</hi> of <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> the
<hi>conceits of Melancholly,</hi> the <hi>credulity</hi> of
<hi>ignorance,</hi> the <hi>tricks</hi> of <hi>Waggery,</hi> the
more <hi>ſolemn vanities</hi> of <hi>Superſtition,</hi> and
the <hi>tales</hi> of <hi>old Women;</hi> theſe are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>topicks</hi> for a <hi>frolick</hi> and <hi>wanton fancy.</hi>
And the deſire the <hi>Humouriſt</hi> hath to be
ſome body, and to have a <hi>name</hi> above
thoſe of common apprehenſion, will be
ſure to actuate the <hi>ſcoffing vein;</hi> in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of which, if he have <hi>quibled luckily,</hi>
and made folks <hi>laugh,</hi> he is encouraged
to take all ſuch occaſions to prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a <hi>WIT,</hi> and to ſhew he had a pretty
way to <hi>play</hi> the <hi>Fool.</hi> And when he hath
<hi>wanton'd</hi> a while, and frolickly toy'd in
his <hi>affected merriments,</hi> his <hi>reaſon</hi> becomes
an obedient ſervant to his <hi>fancy.</hi> He makes
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53430:80"/>
himſelf <hi>believe,</hi> by thoſe <hi>arguments,</hi> that
at firſt were intended only to make him
<hi>laugh,</hi> and in the end, concludes in <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,</hi>
that there is neither <hi>Witch,</hi> nor <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition:</hi>
and 'tis well if he ſtop there.
Now theſe, Sir, are the WITS (if we
will believe them) and their admirers take
every <hi>jeſt</hi> for an <hi>argument,</hi> and a <hi>loud
laugh</hi> upon an idle tale of a <hi>Devil,</hi> or a
<hi>Witch,</hi> for a <hi>demonſtration</hi> of the <hi>non-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence</hi>
of ſuch beings. And thus the <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi>
propagates, and SADDUCISM
is the <hi>Faſhion.</hi> Nor is this all, but by the
ſame method every thing that is <hi>ſacred,</hi> or
<hi>ſerious</hi> hath been expoſed, and both <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
and <hi>Religion</hi> made the objects
of idle, and phantaſtick <hi>buffoonry.</hi> And
muſt we call this WIT Sir? I confeſs
there are few things that urge me to more
<hi>indignation,</hi> than to hear that name which
deſerves to ſignifie <hi>better,</hi> to be ſo <hi>injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi>
apply'd. Certainly WIT is not an
<hi>odde metaphor,</hi> or a <hi>lucky ſimile,</hi> a <hi>wilde
fetch,</hi> or <hi>unexpected inference,</hi> a <hi>mimick</hi>
action, or a <hi>pretty knack</hi> in <hi>telling</hi> of a
<hi>tale.</hi> But <hi>It</hi> is a <hi>faculty</hi> to profound into
the <hi>depth</hi> of things, to finde out their <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
and <hi>Relatives, Conſonances,</hi> and <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreements,</hi>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:53430:81"/>
and to make <hi>fit, uſeful,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obvious
applications</hi> of their reſpective <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi>
and <hi>Dependances;</hi> for which great,
and noble exerciſes of the minde, the
<hi>Droll</hi> is the moſt unfit and incompetent
perſon in the World; and thoſe that on
this account aſſume the prerogative of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the only WITS, are of all men the
moſt incapable of being ſo. For that <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial,</hi>
and <hi>pedling</hi> way of <hi>Fancy,</hi> and <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi>
to which they are addicted, <hi>emaſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi>
their <hi>mindes,</hi> and makes them <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial,
flaſhy,</hi> and <hi>phantaſtical,</hi> by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
them upon <hi>effaemancies,</hi> and little
<hi>apiſh fooleries.</hi> And by theſe <hi>darling en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments</hi>
of a too <hi>fondly indulged</hi> fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
the minde is made incapable of <hi>ſerious</hi>
and <hi>deep reflections,</hi> which give it the
<hi>nobleſt,</hi> and moſt <hi>valuable improvements:</hi>
ſo that I have obſerv'd, that the <hi>Drolling
Humoriſts</hi> are for the moſt part, <hi>remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
defective,</hi> in <hi>cloſe ratiocinations,</hi> and
the <hi>worſt</hi> in the world at <hi>inference;</hi> which
is no wonder, ſince fancy is a <hi>deſultory,</hi>
and <hi>roving faculty;</hi> and when 'tis not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>conduct</hi> of a <hi>ſevere judgment,</hi> not
able to keep it ſelf to a <hi>ſteady,</hi> and <hi>reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
attention;</hi> much leſs, to make <hi>cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53430:81"/>
chains</hi> of <hi>rational Deduction.</hi> So
that 'tis next to impoſſible for ſuch <hi>Wits</hi> as
<hi>theſe,</hi> to arrive to more than a <hi>knack</hi> of
<hi>ſcoffing</hi> at what they <hi>underſtand not.</hi> And
they are under almoſt an <hi>invincible</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
of doing ſo, by every thing that is
too <hi>great</hi> for their <hi>comprehenſion;</hi> for the
humour that acts them is <hi>proud,</hi> and <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming,</hi>
and would not have any thing to
be valu'd, of which it ſelf is <hi>incapable;</hi>
and therefore it <hi>depreciates</hi> all the <hi>nobler</hi>
and more <hi>generous</hi> matters which <hi>It</hi> hath
very great reaſon to deſpair of; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
by a <hi>ridiculous,</hi> and <hi>inſolent ſcorn,</hi>
to lift it ſelf above them. And yet this
<hi>preſumed wit</hi> which raiſeth them to ſuch an
<hi>elevation</hi> in their own <hi>conceit,</hi> is but a
<hi>young</hi> and <hi>boyiſh humour;</hi> and the very
<hi>firſt eſſayes</hi> of <hi>Juvenile Inventions</hi> are in
theſe <hi>exerciſes</hi> of <hi>Fancy,</hi> which the <hi>matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
ſpirit</hi> out-grows. For you know, Sir,
our <hi>ſences</hi> are the firſt powers we <hi>exerciſe,</hi>
and <hi>indulge</hi> in our <hi>greeneſt years:</hi> From
<hi>them,</hi> by degrees our <hi>imaginations grow</hi>
up, and <hi>their</hi> actions, and gratifications
are the pleaſures, and entertainments of
<hi>youth;</hi> which is eaſie to obſerve in the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>flirts, quibbles,</hi> and <hi>tricks</hi> of <hi>Fancy,</hi>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:53430:82"/>
with which the <hi>younger Students</hi> in the
<hi>Univerſities</hi> are ſo much <hi>tickled,</hi> and
<hi>tranſported.</hi> But when <hi>age</hi> and <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ripens</hi> the <hi>Judgment</hi> (which is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of ſloweſt growth) we then ſlight
this <hi>wantonneſs,</hi> and <hi>ioying</hi> of our <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
and apply our ſelves to purſuites that
are more <hi>manly,</hi> and <hi>concerning.</hi> And
when the <hi>Judgment</hi> is come to its full <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,</hi>
and <hi>pitch,</hi> and hath overcome, and
<hi>ſilenc'd</hi> the <hi>futilities</hi> and <hi>prejudices</hi> of
<hi>imagination;</hi> we are <hi>then,</hi> and not <hi>till
then,</hi> grown into <hi>manhood.</hi> And thoſe
that never arrive to <hi>this conſiſtence,</hi> but
ſpend their age in <hi>fooling</hi> with their <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
They are yet <hi>children,</hi> though they
have <hi>gray hairs,</hi> and are ſtill <hi>boyes,</hi> though
paſt their <hi>great climacterical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confeſs, Sir, I am not ſo <hi>cynical,</hi> and
<hi>ſevere,</hi> but that I allow even to the more
<hi>improved genuiſes</hi> their <hi>relaxations</hi> and
pleaſant Intervals, And <hi>ſage Socrates</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſometimes rid the <hi>Boyes Hobby-Horſe.
Fancy</hi> may be permitted its <hi>plaiſance,</hi> and
<hi>in-offenſive raileries,</hi> ſo long as they are
governed by the rules of <hi>vertue,</hi> and a
<hi>prudent Judgment.</hi> And no doubt <hi>God</hi>
himſelf allows all our <hi>powers,</hi> and <hi>faculties</hi>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:53430:82"/>
their <hi>innocent gratifications,</hi> yea, and I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

while it is employed in expoſing <hi>vice,</hi> and
<hi>conceited follies,</hi> to deſerved <hi>ſcorn,</hi> and

looſe,</hi> and <hi>ungoverned,</hi> when it
knows <hi>no bounds,</hi> and obſerves no <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rums,</hi>
but <hi>ſhoots</hi> at <hi>Randome,</hi> and inſolent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
flies at all things that are <hi>auguſt,</hi> and
<hi>venerable;</hi> its <hi>ſallies</hi> are then <hi>vitious,</hi> and
<hi>deteſtable exceſſes;</hi> and thoſe that are of

that is, a better kinde of <hi>Apes,</hi> in
the judgment of the <hi>Wiſe,</hi> though <hi>Wits</hi>
in their own,</p>
                  <p>But Sir, I intimated a greater charge
againſt theſe <hi>quibbling debauches,</hi> (viz.)
that they are the enemies of GOVERN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT
and RELIGION, and ſhall
prove <hi>it,</hi> with this addition, that they
are ſo of all the <hi>better ſorts of KNOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEDGE.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For GOVERNMENT you know Sir,
its <hi>influence</hi> depends much upon the <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
its Rulers have from the people;
and while <hi>They</hi> are <hi>men,</hi> there will be
miſcarriages in <hi>publick affairs,</hi> and <hi>manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:53430:83"/>
of <hi>State;</hi> And if all the <hi>ſlips,</hi> and
<hi>imperfections,</hi> all the <hi>miſtakes</hi> and <hi>faults</hi>
of the <hi>ſupreme Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Rule,</hi> be tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
and aggrevated among the <hi>heard,</hi>
The <hi>Government</hi> will thereby be expoſed
to the <hi>ſcorns</hi> of the <hi>Rabble,</hi> and loſe a
great part of its <hi>force</hi> with its <hi>reverence.</hi>
And in <hi>this</hi> it ſuffers infinitely from the
<hi>drolling phantaſticks,</hi> who blow in the

ſome things that may ſuffice for proof al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
And I adde this obſervation to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it, That among the numerous Youth
I have ſeen bred in a <hi>Great School,</hi> and in
the <hi>Univerſity,</hi> I have noted, that thoſe of
them who were moſt remarkable for <hi>wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſs</hi>
and <hi>jeſting,</hi> ſeldom arrived to any
great <hi>maturities,</hi> or <hi>capacity</hi> for things of

of <hi>Fancy,</hi> and <hi>ſolidity</hi> of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
require <hi>diſpoſitions</hi> of <hi>brain</hi> that are
very <hi>different,</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi> as ſeldom meet in
great degrees, but in ſome very few, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
tempers. But <hi>generally</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53430:84"/>
the <hi>Droll</hi> is very unfit for matters of
<hi>ſublimity</hi> and <hi>ſubſtance:</hi> and therefore (as
I intimated) indeavours by his <hi>ſcoffs</hi> and
<hi>injuries,</hi> to make them appear as much
<hi>below</hi> his <hi>ſerious notice,</hi> as they are <hi>indeed
above</hi> his <hi>reach:</hi> and in this deſign he hath
many great advantages for his abuſes, For
the <hi>pedantry</hi> of <hi>Diſputers</hi> that make a
loud claim to <hi>knowledge;</hi> the <hi>vanity</hi> of the
<hi>extravagant</hi> ſort of <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> the <hi>fond

and <hi>experiment;</hi> the <hi>ſtrangeneſs</hi> of
things that <hi>ſoberer Inquiſitors</hi> declare <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable,</hi>
but have not yet <hi>ſucceeded,</hi> the

thoſe advantages are taken to make the

<hi>ridiculous</hi> and <hi>vain.</hi> And for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of the <hi>phantaſtick,</hi> in his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent</hi>
humour of <hi>injuſtice,</hi> and <hi>abuſe,</hi> there
is a certain <hi>envy</hi> in mankinde againſt thoſe

reaſon of which <hi>ill nature</hi> in the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

This kinde of <hi>Wit</hi> becomes the
moſt <hi>peſtilent</hi> enemy to <hi>knowledge,</hi> and
its improvements, eſpecially to <hi>philoſophick
wiſdom.</hi> For <hi>Philoſophy</hi> can ſhame, and
diſable all the <hi>reaſons</hi> that can be urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it; but <hi>jeſts,</hi> and <hi>loud laughter</hi> are
not to be <hi>confuted:</hi> and yet <hi>theſe</hi> are of
more force to degrade a thing in the eſteem
of ſome ſort of Spirits, than the moſt <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
demonſtrations:</hi> and the miſchief of
it is, that theſe <hi>Quibblers</hi> and <hi>Buffoons</hi> that
have ſome <hi>little</hi> ſcraps of <hi>Learning</hi> matcht
with a <hi>great</hi> proportion of <hi>Confidence,</hi> have

gains credit to their <hi>inſolencies,</hi> and <hi>abuſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, Sir, I perceive my zeal againſt
thoſe pedlars of Wit hath tranſported me
to your trouble, I therefore make an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brupt
return to my other reaſon men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
of mens disbelief of the being of
<hi>Witches,</hi> and <hi>Apparitions,</hi> and that is,</p>
                  <p>(2.) <hi>ATHEISM;</hi> the <hi>Folly</hi> of which
<hi>accurſed madneſs,</hi> you, Sir, have ſo fully
diſcovered to the world, in your incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53430:85"/>
Works, and ſo throughly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the <hi>myſteries</hi> of that <hi>black</hi> conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
againſt heaven, that 'twould be fond
for me to think to ſuggeſt any notion on
the Subject, which you could not teach.
But Sir, I have a <hi>Relation</hi> about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to make you, which I believe you will
not be unwilling to hear. And you ſhall
have it when I have ſaid ſomething to the
purpoſe of the particular I have mention'd.
Concerning which, 'tis too ſadly certain
that there is a <hi>latent Atheiſm</hi> at the root of
the SADDUCEAN principle: for too
many deny <hi>Witches,</hi> becauſe they believe
there are no <hi>Spirits;</hi> and they are ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
becauſe they own no being in the
world, but <hi>matter,</hi> and the <hi>reſults</hi> of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and conſequently, can acknowledge
<hi>nothing</hi> of a <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It <hi>hath</hi> indeed been a <hi>queſtion,</hi> whether
'tis poſſible there ſhould be ſuch a <hi>prodigy</hi>
as a <hi>ſpeculative Atheiſt</hi> in nature; and I
could wiſh it were ſo ſtill: But alas, our
Age and Experience hath ended the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute;</hi>
and we need not ſearch the <hi>dark,</hi>
and <hi>barbarous corners</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> nor ſeek
the <hi>Monſter</hi> among the <hi>wilde Men</hi> of the
<hi>Deſart;</hi> we have found him in Times of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53430:86"/>
                     <hi>Light,</hi> in a <hi>witty</hi> and <hi>civiliz'd</hi> Region, and
in an <hi>Age</hi> of the greateſt <hi>knowledge</hi> and
<hi>improvements:</hi> he <hi>ſculps</hi> not among the
thickeſt of the <hi>Woods,</hi> nor ſeeks <hi>Caverns</hi>
for <hi>concealment,</hi> but <hi>braves</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> and
appears in the <hi>cleareſt day.</hi> And the <hi>Fool</hi> is
not ſo <hi>modeſt</hi> as he was in the dayes of the
<hi>Royal Prophet,</hi> to ſay only in his <hi>heart, There
is no God:</hi> we know a bolder ſort of <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,</hi>
and I can ſay, Sir, from a <hi>particular</hi>
experience, That there are, who deny the
<hi>exiſtence</hi> of a <hi>Deity.</hi> I met with one ſuch
ſome years ſince in <hi>London,</hi> who confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
and without mincing, denyed
that there was any ſuch being, and bid me
prove it. I wondered at the <hi>boldneſs,</hi> as
well as the <hi>impiety</hi> of his <hi>ſaying;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I had a great <hi>compaſsion</hi> for one in
ſo deplorable a ſtate, I reſolved not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate
him by <hi>paſsion, hard words,</hi> or
<hi>damning Sentences,</hi> but <hi>calmly,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſeeming <hi>emotion,</hi> diſcourſed the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
with him; I granted him all I <hi>ſafely</hi>
or <hi>reaſonably</hi> could, and all that might
ſerve my deſign for his <hi>conviction,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we began the cloſe ingagement, that
ſo he might have leſs prejudice againſt
what was ſaid by one whom he might ſee
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53430:86"/>
not to be of a <hi>narrow, confined</hi> judgment;
and that I might not have the diſadvantage
of being put upon the impugning of <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
which are <hi>plauſible</hi> by the great
names, or reaſons of any eminent Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
and that were not abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the <hi>defence</hi> of the <hi>Propoſition,</hi>
for which I undertook, ſuch were the
<hi>Platonick Anima Mundi,</hi> the <hi>eternity,</hi> and
<hi>immenſity</hi> of the world; which Sir,
though I ſhould not <hi>affirm,</hi> yet I would not
at that time <hi>deny,</hi> but quietly granted them
as <hi>Hypotheſeis;</hi> being willing to permit
his belief of <hi>theſe,</hi> in order to the convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and abuſing him in his <hi>main,</hi> and <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concluſion.</hi> And by <hi>theſe conceſsions</hi> I
gain'd the <hi>advantages</hi> I expected; for
hereby he was diſappointed of all thoſe
<hi>plauſibilities,</hi> which I perceived he was
wont to urge for thoſe Doctrines. And I
ſaw, that when he was preſt with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of a <hi>cauſe</hi> of all things, and a <hi>Firſt,</hi>
his refuge was that old <hi>Epicurean</hi> one, of
an <hi>eternal, infinite matter;</hi> which when
his <hi>unwary oppoſites</hi> would attempt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
by endeavouring to demonſtrate the
<hi>beginning,</hi> and <hi>Finiteneſs</hi> of the world,
They gave him the opportunity of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53430:87"/>
                     <hi>Defence,</hi> and diverted from the
main <hi>Theſis,</hi> which might be evinced
though the <hi>Immenſity</hi> and <hi>Eternity</hi> of the
<hi>univerſe</hi> were granted. And ſo they let
him go from an <hi>aſſertion</hi> that is moſt <hi>impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
and <hi>abſurd,</hi> to <hi>another</hi> which is tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably
<hi>accountable,</hi> and <hi>ſpecious,</hi> And the
<hi>Concluſion</hi> would be at laſt, that ſince the
undertaker could not prove the world was
not <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>eternal,</hi> he could not make
it appear, <hi>There was a God.</hi> By which
procedure the arguer falls from a <hi>Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
which is the moſt <hi>demonſtrative</hi> one
in nature, to <hi>an other,</hi> which cannot be
cleared but by <hi>ſuppoſing</hi> the main thing in
Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>But beſides <hi>this ſhift</hi> which my conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
made inſignificant, when my <hi>Atheiſt</hi>
was urged with the <hi>Order, Harmony, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,</hi>
and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> that is viſible in the
Creatures, he would betake him to his
<hi>Anima Mundi;</hi> the <hi>exiſtence</hi> of which,
when thoſe other Antagoniſts he had dealt
with would endeavour to overthrow,
they undertook a thing of <hi>harder profuſion,</hi>
than the main <hi>concluſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay therefore, Sir, I permitted him to
aſſume <hi>theſe Principles,</hi> and then proved,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53430:87"/>
That though the world <hi>were immenſe.</hi> and
<hi>eternal,</hi> yet, That 'tis not poſſible meer
<hi>blinde, unguided matter</hi> ſhould ſhuffle it
ſelf into ſuch <hi>regular,</hi> and <hi>accurate produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi>
as we ſee are the reſults of every
day, without the <hi>manuduction</hi> of ſome
<hi>knowing Agent,</hi> and <hi>Contriver,</hi> as you
have fully made good in your excellent
ANTIDOTE. And when he at this turn
took <hi>ſanctuary</hi> in an <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> as the
cauſe of all the <hi>art,</hi> and <hi>exactneſs</hi> in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I granted him the <hi>being,</hi> but askt
him, Whether he took it for a ſubſtance,
that was <hi>intelligent,</hi> or devoid of reaſon,
and perception? when he ſeemed to incline
to this <hi>latter,</hi> I ſhewed him, that ſuch a
principle as had no ſence, or knowledge,
ſignified no more to his purpoſe, than if he
had ſtuck in the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of <hi>meer matter,</hi>
and <hi>motion.</hi> But when he allow'd his <hi>great
Soul</hi> to be an <hi>intellectual Being</hi> (as he at
laſt did) and that <hi>it</hi> was <hi>immenſe</hi> and <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
(as he was forced to do by his aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that this <hi>ſoul</hi> was diffuſed through the
whole maſs of his <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi>
matter.) I ſhewed him, that in effect he
was brought by his own principles to the
acknowledgment of a GOD, though he
gave him another name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:53430:88"/>
Thus Sir, I purſued my <hi>Infidel</hi> into all
his <hi>ſtarting holes,</hi> and <hi>retreats,</hi> and drive
him from one <hi>aſſertion</hi> to another, its <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory,</hi>
and then back again upon the
<hi>firſt Theſis,</hi> and ſo up and down till at
length he began to be aſhamed of his <hi>ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling,</hi>
and confeſt that I had ſaid to him
more then he had heard, and ſome things
that he would <hi>conſider.</hi> He deſired that I
would give him the ſubſtance of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
in writing, which I prepared for
him, and ſhall perhaps e're long give an
account of theſe, and other dependent
matters to the publick.</p>
                  <p>After the heat of our ingagement was
over, I was willing to learn by what means
he came into that <hi>deſperate Infidelity,</hi> and
underſtood from him, that he had run
through the ſeveral ſtages of <hi>modern Sects,</hi>
not ſtopping till he came down to that
<hi>ſink</hi> of <hi>Folly,</hi> and <hi>madneſs, Quakeriſm,</hi>
and thence made a ſtep into <hi>Atheiſm;</hi>
which is no great leap; for <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi>
at long run <hi>meet,</hi> and are the ſame. And
certainly he that places his <hi>Religion</hi> in <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi>
and judgeth <hi>it</hi> now to lie in <hi>this form</hi>
of <hi>belief,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> in <hi>another;</hi> when he
comes to <hi>conſider</hi> the <hi>vaſt variety</hi> of <hi>Sects,</hi>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:53430:88"/>
the <hi>confidence</hi> of each in his <hi>own reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
the <hi>pretences</hi> of all to <hi>Scripture, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
and <hi>Antiquity;</hi> the <hi>antipathy</hi> they
have one againſt another, and the <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,</hi>
if not <hi>falſhood,</hi> of things, that
each of them hold <hi>ſacred,</hi> and <hi>certain:</hi> I
ſay, he that takes <hi>Religion</hi> to be an <hi>adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
to <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi> is upon the
accounts mention'd, when he reflects, in
mighty danger of being an <hi>Atheiſt.</hi> And
except he fix at laſt upon the <hi>few, plain,
acknowledg'd eſſentials</hi> of <hi>belief,</hi> and <hi>good
life</hi> (if he be of an <hi>anxious, inquiſitive
mind,</hi> and not <hi>obſtinately</hi> reſolv'd in the
way of his <hi>particular Sect.</hi>) 'Tis a <hi>miracle</hi>
if he ends not <hi>there</hi> at laſt, for he having
eſtabliſht <hi>this,</hi> That Religion conſiſts in
the <hi>way,</hi> Or <hi>form</hi> of ſome party, or other;
and then having ſucceſſively deſerted thoſe
Sects that had moſt of his favour and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
and ſo paſt from one to another,
through all the ſteps of deſcent, when at
length he is fallen out with the <hi>laſt,</hi> he
hath nothing elſe to fly to but <hi>contempt</hi>
of all <hi>Religion,</hi> as a meer <hi>juggle</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture.</hi>
This I took to be this Gentleman's
caſe; and I believe much of the <hi>general
Atheiſm</hi> of our dayes is to be aſcribed to
this Cauſe.</p>
