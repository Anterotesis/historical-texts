            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER TO A Gentleman in the Country, Giving an Account of the Two Inſurance - Offices; THE <hi>Fire-Office</hi> &amp; <hi>Friendly-Society.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>YOurs of the 15th Inſtant I Received; and that I might return a Satisfactory Anſwer, I have peruſed the Settlements of both the Offices: That of the <hi>Fire-Office,</hi> and that of the <hi>Friendly Society</hi>; and have ſent you the Printed Papers of both, with the Obſervations I have made:</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. <hi>Upon the Validity of their Securities.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. <hi>Their Intereſt to preſerve the Inſured from Fire.</hi> And</item>
               <item>III. <hi>The Charge of Inſuring.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The Fund or Securities are theſe: That of the <hi>Fire Office</hi> is Ground Rents [Now] to the Value of <hi>Fifty Thouſand Pounds,</hi> ſetled upon Truſtees, to make good all Loſſes from Fire; and to be Increaſed, as the Number of Houſes <hi>Inſured</hi> Increaſe.</p>
            <p>The Strength of this Security ſtands upon this Suppoſition, That the Fund is ſo Large, conſidering the Houſes <hi>Inſured</hi> are diſperſed at ſeveral diſtances, That it is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable (unleſs the whole City be Deſtroyed at once) that any Loſs at One time ſhould exceed the <hi>Fund</hi>; and then it will be alwayes the Intereſt of the <hi>Inſurers</hi> (as of men that have Morgaged their Land for leſs than the Value) to pay the Debt when called for, to prevent a greater Loſs, ſince the Land is of more Value than the Debt.</p>
            <p>The Security of the <hi>Friendly Society,</hi> is the mutual Covenants between the <hi>Inſured</hi> and <hi>Inſurers:</hi> The Deſign is thus framed. The <hi>Inſured</hi> depoſite into the hands of the <hi>
                  <hi>Inſurers</hi>, Six Shillings, Eight Pence,</hi> for Inſuring <hi>One Hundred Pound</hi> on a Brick Houſe, and double for Timber; and Covenant to pay the reſidue of their <hi>Premiums</hi> when there ſhall be occaſion, not exceeding <hi>Thirty Shillings</hi> for <hi>One Hundred Pound</hi> on a Brick Houſe, and double on Timber, at one Loſs. Upon Condition, That after ſuch a Loſs to be at Liberty to go off from the <hi>Society:</hi> Alſo they Covenant to pay <hi>Sixteen Pence per Annum</hi> for every Hundred Pound <hi>Inſured</hi> on a Brick Houſe, and double on Timber, for the <hi>Inſurers</hi> trouble and charge of <hi>Holding Stakes, Collecting the Money,</hi> and <hi>Executing the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50579:2"/>
Office,</hi> under a penalty of <hi>Loſing their Money depoſited</hi>; with the <hi>Benefit of being after <hi>Inſured</hi>
               </hi>; and to be <hi>Caſheired out of the Company,</hi> if they do not pay their Rent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the time limitted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Inſurers</hi> Covenant with the <hi>Inſured:</hi> And becauſe they are Truſted with Money, give <hi>Collateral Security,</hi> to the Value of <hi>Sixteen Thouſand Pounds</hi> to perform theſe Covenants.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To pay the Loſs out of the Money depoſited in their Hands, and Covenanted to be paid by the <hi>Inſured,</hi> if it be ſufficient.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To make a proportionable <hi>Rate, Collect</hi> the <hi>Money,</hi> and Anſwer for all thoſe that are <hi>Miſſing,</hi> or prove <hi>Inſolvent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. At the end of the Term, to pay back what is left in their Hands, (except the Yearly Rent) to each of the <hi>Inſured.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Strength of this Security ſtands upon this Suppoſition, That the <hi>Premiums</hi> depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited, and agreed to be paid by the <hi>Inſured,</hi> are more than ſufficient to pay the Loſs: And therefore there is no proviſion made to pay thoſe Loſſes which may at one time exceed the <hi>Premiums:</hi> For the <hi>Sixteen Thouſand Pounds is not Security for the Loſſes from Fire, but only for the Inſolvent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inſuring of Houſes being a New Deſign, it is impoſſible to make a certain gueſs of the Strength of this Suppoſition; but that I might give you ſome Satisfaction, I have Examined its Foundation, by Enquiring into the <hi>Profits</hi> and <hi>Loſs</hi> of the <hi>Fire Office,</hi> ſince their firſt Beginning, which I find thus:</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Fire Office</hi> in Three Years hath <hi>Inſured</hi> Four Thouſand Houſes; And the <hi>Premiums</hi> of one Houſe with another, do Amount to about <hi>Four pound ten ſhillings</hi> the Houſe: Which in the Total, is <hi>Eighteen Thouſand pounds,</hi> and they have already paid Back for Loſſes above <hi>Seven Thouſand pounds,</hi> beſides Charges.</p>
            <p>By which it is plain, That they have Repaid almoſt half the <hi>Premiums,</hi> before a Fourth part of the Terms (the Houſes are <hi>Inſured</hi> for) are Expired: For ſome Houſes are <hi>Inſured</hi> for <hi>Seven</hi>; ſome for <hi>Eleven</hi>; and ſome for <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Twenty</hi> Years. This Calculation, any man that will Examine their Policy Books, will find to be True.</p>
            <p>So that by what hitherto appears, its moſt probable, that the <hi>Premium</hi> will not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to pay the Loſſes; and that this Deſign ſeems to be Fram'd upon the imaginary Succeſs of the <hi>Fire Office,</hi> incouraged by the common preſumption generally believed, <hi>That men never Set Up a New Invention without Hopes of a great advantage to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi>; and not remembring how often the firſt undertakers are miſtaken.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing the <hi>Premiums</hi> ſhould be more then ſufficient to pay the Loſs; it doth not appear to me, that any man is <hi>Inſured</hi> for any certain term by the <hi>Friendly Society:</hi> For how can any man be <hi>Inſured</hi> for <hi>Seven</hi> years, which is a term Certain, when the number of thoſe that are to pay the Loſs is Uncertain?</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. From the <hi>Forfeiture</hi> for Non-payment of Rent.</item>
               <item>2. From the <hi>Loſſes</hi> occaſioning many to go off.</item>
               <item>3. From the daily <hi>Expiration</hi> of the Terms after the firſt <hi>Seven</hi> years.</item>
            </list>
            <p>So that tho' the number be ſufficient, when a man firſt <hi>Inſures.</hi> By all, or any of theſe <hi>three</hi> Accidents, there may be too few left to pay the Loſs.</p>
            <p>And this Argument ſeems to me to have the greater Force, becauſe the <hi>Fire Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> that was firſt Set Up</p>
            <list>
               <item>Gives <hi>Better Security.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Better <hi>Preſerves the Inſured from Fire.</hi> And</item>
               <item>Inſures <hi>At a Cheaper Rate.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Which when Underſtood by thoſe of the <hi>Friendly Society,</hi> It is reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, many of them may alter their minds and go off.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Fire Office</hi> gives Better Security, becauſe Land was ſetled at firſt to the Value of <hi>Thirty Thouſand Pounds,</hi> to make good the Loſs, before a penny <hi>Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> was received; and the <hi>Premiums</hi> are ſetled in Proportion as the number of Houſes <hi>Inſured</hi> increaſe. But in the <hi>Friendly Society</hi> you have only the <hi>Premiums</hi> for Security.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50579:3"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Older</hi> the <hi>Fire Office,</hi> The <hi>Better</hi>; but the <hi>Friendly Society,</hi> The <hi>Older,</hi> The <hi>Worſe</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for every Loſs that happens to the <hi>Friendly Society</hi> being paid out of the <hi>Premiums,</hi> Leſſens the Security: The Security is not ſo Large, when every man hath paid <hi>Ten</hi> or <hi>Fifteen Shillings</hi> a man towards a Loſs as before: for tho by the Covenant, that a man is not at Liberty till after he hath <hi>Paid his Thirty Shillings at one Loſs,</hi> the Security is the Better to Thoſe whoſe Houſes Are Burnt: Yet it is the Worſe for Thoſe that are Not Burnt; for they run the hazard of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Value of their Houſes and More, by paying <hi>Nine and Twenty Shillings</hi> a time, or leſs, towards Other mens Loſſes. Now both being Inſured, it is the ſame thing whether their Houſes be Loſt by <hi>Fire,</hi> or by contributing to Others Loſſes.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, when a Loſs happens to the <hi>Fire Office,</hi> It is paid out of the Bank of the Office: And the Land [which is the Fund] is never the Leſs; but the Older the Office grows, the Better; for as the terms of <hi>Inſuring</hi> wears off, the Land is leſs Incumbred; and the Security is the Better to thoſe that continue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the <hi>Fire Office</hi> the <hi>Inſured</hi> are better preſerved from <hi>Fire,</hi> than in the <hi>
                  <hi>Friendly Society</hi>: It is more the Intereſt of the <hi>Inſurers:</hi>
               </hi> Becauſe the Loſs is their own; and experience hath already ſhewn, how great the advantage is to the <hi>Inſured,</hi> from thoſe Induſtrious men they keep to Extinguiſh the Fires; like Old Diſciplin'd Souldiers, that do greater things, then <hi>Ten</hi> times that Number of Raw and Unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced men.</p>
            <p>But in the <hi>
                  <hi>Friendly Society,</hi>  the Loſs is Paid by the <hi>Inſured</hi>
               </hi>; Therefore the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers</hi> cannot probably have ſo much damage when a <hi>Fire</hi> happens, as will equal the charge of keeping men to preſerve their Houſes; for they only run the hazard of paying for the <hi>Inſolvent:</hi> now it is but a ſmall ſum of Money that the <hi>Inſured</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to pay: Who are generally owners of Houſes: And the obligation not longer than for a year: (for it is not to be ſuppoſed, that the Office ſhould pay for any after they have forfeited their Intereſt;) <hi>So that the Hazard is but to pay the Overplus of what is not Depoſited in their Hands, if the Loſs exceed it,</hi> which cannot be conſiderable.</p>
            <p>But if it ſhould; They may (as ſometimes the Pariſh Aſſeſſors) Rate thoſe that are <hi>Solvent</hi> ſomething the more, to pay for thoſe that are <hi>Inſolvent</hi>: for conſidering the terms will daily expire. The many forfeitures and fractions, that muſt ariſe from the diſproportion of the <hi>Premiums,</hi> No account can be made ſo plain as to diſcover it, or at leaſt ſo eaſily, as to be worth any mans time to enquire into it to ſave a Shilling or two. So that tho thoſe Gentlemen that now keep The Office, are men of that Known Worth and Honeſty, as never to be ſuſpected; yet by their death it may happen into ſuch mens hands, as may gain by every <hi>Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Fire Office</hi> Inſures at a Cheaper Rate; for in the <hi>Friendly Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi> you are obliged to pay 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> down for a <hi>hundred Pound</hi> in Brick, and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Timber; and Covenant to pay your proportion of all the Loſſes within the term of <hi>ſeaven years, not exceeding Thirty Shillings per Hundred Pound, and Double for Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for one Loſs, at one time:</hi> So that if at ſeveral times the Loſſes amount to <hi>Ten</hi> times <hi>Thirty Shillings</hi> or more, in the <hi>Seaven</hi> years, you are obliged to pay it. And as the Chance at preſent appears, (by the Account of the <hi>Fire Office</hi>) it is more probable the Loſs may Exceed <hi>Thirty</hi> Shillings, then be leſs. Therefore ſuppoſing <hi>Thirty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> for <hi>Seven</hi> years the medium; and <hi>Nine Shillings Four Pence</hi> for the <hi>Seaven</hi> years Rent; and Half a Crown for the Policy, makes in the <hi>Total Forty One Shillings Ten Pence,</hi> for <hi>Inſuring</hi> of an <hi>Hundred Pound</hi> on a Brick Houſe. Whereas in the <hi>Fire Office</hi> you may <hi>Inſure</hi> the ſame ſum, for the ſame term of years, for <hi>Five and Twenty Shillings,</hi> and <hi>Two Shillings</hi> the Policy; which is <hi>one Third</hi> Cheaper.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, the <hi>Friendly Society,</hi> is a more <hi>Profitable</hi> deſign, than the <hi>Fire Office,</hi> for the <hi>Inſurers:</hi> For they have the uſe of about a fourth part of the <hi>Premiums</hi>; And a yearly Rent, which is better than Intereſt for the remainder; with the running little or no hazard.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Inſured</hi> are juſt in the ſame Condition or rather Worſe than if they had not <hi>Inſured:</hi> For <hi>What ever the Loſs be; It muſt be Paid, if ever, by the <hi>Inſured,</hi> who are Owners of the Houſes</hi>; And then it is the ſame thing whether paid by Contribution, or Parternorſhip, or by every mans paying ſingly for his own. For what is ſaved by the Contribution, is loſt by increaſe of the Hazard.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50579:4"/>For ſuppoſing that there are <hi>One Hundred Thouſand</hi> Houſes in this City, or within the Bills of Mortality, and <hi>One Thouſand</hi> of them are <hi>Inſured</hi> by the <hi>Friendly Society</hi>; It is then but a Hundred to One, when any Fire Happens, that ſome of the <hi>Inſured Houſes</hi> are Burnt. And at the ſame time is one Hundred Thouſand to One againſt any particular mans Houſe <hi>Not Inſured,</hi> that it is <hi>Not Burnt</hi>; So that it is an Equal Chance, That the whole <hi>Thouſand Houſes Inſured</hi> Are Burnt, as ſoon as any particular Houſe <hi>Not Inſured</hi> is Burnt: For a <hi>Thouſand Hundreds</hi> to <hi>One,</hi> makes <hi>One Hundred Thouſand</hi> to <hi>One.</hi> As in the <hi>Lottery</hi> of the <hi>Royal Oak,</hi> It is an equal Chance, That a <hi>Quarter Figure,</hi> which is <hi>Eight</hi> to <hi>One,</hi> ſhould Turn Up four times, as ſoon as a <hi>Whole Figure</hi> once, which is two and Thirty to One. For Four Eights makes Two and Thirty.</p>
            <p>Now to make an Inſtance of this <hi>Inſurance</hi>; Suppoſe <hi>Three Hundred</hi> &amp; <hi>Ten</hi> Brick Houſes in a Town, worth, one with another, <hi>One Hundred Pound</hi>; Of which number Three Hundred <hi>Are Inſured</hi> by the <hi>Friendly Society,</hi> and Ten are <hi>Not Inſured:</hi> And ſuppoſe it an Equal Chance, That Ten Houſes may be every year Burnt. In one Month Four Houſes are Burnt, which <hi>Were Inſured</hi> at Three Hundred Pounds; So that by Twenty Shillings a Houſe, among Three Hundred, the Loſs is paid. Another Month Two Houſes <hi>Inſured</hi> at <hi>One Hundred and Fifty Pound,</hi> are <hi>Burnt,</hi> which comes to <hi>Ten Shillings</hi> the Houſe. And within the year, Three more. And in Seven Years and a Half, a fourth part of the Town is (by Ten Houſes in a Year) <hi>Burnt</hi> and <hi>Rebuilt</hi>; And no loſs at one time, did Amount to <hi>Four Hundred and Fifty Pounds,</hi> which is <hi>Thirty Shillings</hi> a Houſe: And yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Stating the Account, every man hath equally Loſt a Fourth part of his Houſe: Thoſe that were Not Burnt, by paying the <hi>Premiums,</hi> to thoſe that Were Burnt.</p>
            <p>And ſuppoſing the <hi>Society</hi> to continue in this Friendſhip Thirty one Years; The whole Number of <hi>Three Hundred and Ten</hi> Houſes Are Burnt; The Ten that were Not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, Were Burnt: And of the <hi>Three Hundred</hi> Inſured, Some were Burnt Twice; Some Thrice; And ſome Never Burnt: And yet there is no Difference between the <hi>Inſured</hi> &amp; <hi>Not Inſured.</hi> Betwixt thoſe that Were Burnt; And Not Burnt. For every Man Loſt his Houſe, and every Man equally Paid for the Loſs. Thoſe that were not Burnt, loſt their Houſes, by Paying for thoſe that were Burnt Twice, and Thrice: Only thoſe that were <hi>Inſured</hi> Loſt their Houſes Yearly, by contributing <hi>Ten</hi> and <hi>Twenty Shillings</hi> at a time, towards one anothers Loſſes; and thoſe <hi>Not Inſured,</hi> loſt their Houſes at Once. But then with this Advantage all the time, They made uſe of their own <hi>Premiums,</hi> Saved the Rent of the Office, and Trouble of Examining Accounts.</p>
            <p>But if the Inſtance be made, That the <hi>Three Hundred</hi> Houſes were half Brick, and half Timber, Then the Difference will be Great; for the Timber paying Double <hi>Premium,</hi> and receiving it back Single, they will have loſt their own Houſes, and alſo have Paid for the Loſs of the Brick Houſes.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Fire Office</hi> is Much Better for the <hi>Inſured</hi>; For the Loſs is paid by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers,</hi> and their Land is Morgaged for the Payment: For there can be no <hi>Inſurance,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there be a <hi>Fund Setled,</hi> that is both Certain and Able to make good the Loſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the <hi>Remarks</hi> I have made, to which I Expect your Anſwer, with your fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Order about <hi>Inſuring</hi> your Houſes.</p>
