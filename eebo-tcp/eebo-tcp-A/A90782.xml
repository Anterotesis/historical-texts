            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A pleaſant new Ballad of the Miller of Mansfield in Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and how he was lodged at a Millers houſe, and of their pleaſant Communication.</head>
            <opener>To the Tune of, The French Lavalto.</opener>
            <l>
               <hi>HEnry</hi> our Royal King would ride a hunting </l>
            <l>to the gréen Forreſt moſt pleaſant and fair,</l>
            <l>To have the Hart chaſed, the dainty Does tripping, unto merry <hi>Sherwood</hi> his Nobles repair;</l>
            <l>Hawk &amp; hound was unbound, all things prepair'd,</l>
            <l>For the ſame to the game with good regard.</l>
            <l>All a long Summers day, rode the King pleaſantly, </l>
            <l>with all his Princes and Nobles each one,</l>
            <l>Chaſing the Hart &amp; Hound, &amp; the Buck gallantly, </l>
            <l>till the dark Evening enforc'd them turn home:</l>
            <l>Then at laſt, riding faſt, he had loſt quite,</l>
            <l>All his Lords in the Wood, late in dark night.</l>
            <l>Wandring thus warily all along up and down, </l>
            <l>with a rude Miller he met at the laſt,</l>
            <l>Asking the ready way unto fair <hi>Nottingham,</hi> 
            </l>
            <l>ſir, quoth the Miller your way you have loſt,</l>
            <l>Yet I think, what I think, troth for to ſay,</l>
            <l>You do not likely ride out of your way.</l>
            <l>Why, what doſt thou think on me, qd. the K. merrily </l>
            <l>paſſing thy judgement on me ſo brief?</l>
            <l>Good faith, ſaid the Miller, I mean not to flatter thée, </l>
            <l>I gueſs thée to be ſome Gentleman thief:</l>
            <l>Stand the back, in the dark, light thée not down,</l>
            <l>Leſt that I preſently crack thy Knaves Crown.</l>
            <l>Thou haſt abus'd me much, qd. y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King, ſaying thus </l>
            <l>I am a Gentleman and lodging I lack,</l>
            <l>Thou haſt not, qd. the Miller, one groat in thy purſe </l>
            <l>all thy Inheritance hangs on thy back,</l>
            <l>I have Gold to diſcharge all that I call,</l>
            <l>If it be forty pence, I will pay all.</l>
            <l>If thou béeſt a true man, then, quoth the Miller, </l>
            <l>then I ſwear by my Tole-diſh I'le lodge thée all night,</l>
            <l>Here's my hand, qd. the K. that I was ever, </l>
            <l>nay ſoft, qd, the Miller, thou may'ſt be a ſpright:</l>
            <l>Better I will know thée, e're hand I will take,</l>
            <l>With none but honeſt men, hands will I ſhake.</l>
            <l>Thus they went along unto the Millers houſe, </l>
            <l>where they were ſéething of Pudding and ſowſe,</l>
            <l>The Miller firſt entred in, then after him the King </l>
            <l>never came he in ſo ſmoaky a houſe:</l>
            <l>Now, qd. he, let me ſée here what you are,</l>
            <l>Quoth our King, look your fill, and do not ſpare.</l>
            <l>I like thy countenance, thou haſt an honeſt face, </l>
            <l>with my Son <hi>Richard</hi> this night ſhalt thou lye,</l>
            <l>Qd. his wife, by my troth, it is a handſom youth, </l>
            <l>yet 'tis beſt, qd. his wife, for to deal warily:</l>
            <l>Art not a run-away? prethée me tell,</l>
            <l>Shew me thy Paſport, and all ſhall be well.</l>
            <l>Then the King preſently, making low courteſie, </l>
            <l>with his hat in his hand, thus he did ſay,</l>
            <l>I have no Paſport, nor never was Servitor, </l>
            <l>but a poor Courtier rode out of my way;</l>
            <l>And for your kindneſs here offered me,</l>
            <l>I will requite it in every degrée.</l>
            <l>Then to the Miller his wife whiſpered ſecretly, </l>
            <l>ſaying, it ſeems this youths of good kin,</l>
            <l>Both by his Apparel, and eke by his manners, </l>
            <l>to turn him out certainly it were a great ſin:</l>
            <l>Yea, quoth he, you may ſée, he hath ſome grace,</l>
            <l>When he doth ſpeak to his betters in place,</l>
            <l>Well, qd. the Millers wife, young man welcom here, </l>
            <l>and though I ſay it, well lodg'd thou ſhalt be,</l>
            <l>Freſh ſtraw I will have laid, on your Bed ſo brave, </l>
            <l>good brown hempen Sheets, likewiſe, quoth ſhe:</l>
            <l>I, quoth the good man, and when that is done,</l>
            <l>You ſhall lye with no worſe then our own Son.</l>
            <l>Nay firſt, quoth <hi>Richard,</hi> good fellow tell me true, </l>
            <l>haſt any Creepers within thy gay hoſe?</l>
            <l>Or art thou troubled with the Scabbado? </l>
            <l>I pray, quoth our King, what things are thoſe?</l>
            <l>Art thou not lowſie or ſcabby? quoth he,</l>
            <l>If thou be'ſt ſurely thou lyeſt not with me.</l>
            <l>This cauſed the K. ſuddenly to laugh moſt heartily, </l>
            <l>till the tears trickled down from his eyes;</l>
            <l>Then to their ſupper they ſet orderly, </l>
            <l>with a hot Bag-pudding, and good Apple-pyes:</l>
            <l>Nappy Ale, good and ſtale, in a brown bowl,</l>
            <l>Which did about the Board merrily trowl.</l>
            <l>Here quoth the Miller, good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
            </l>
            <l>and to all Courteours that courteous be,</l>
            <l>I'le pledge you, quoth our K. and thank you heartily </l>
            <l>for your good welcom in every degree:</l>
            <l>And here in like manner I drink to your ſon,</l>
            <l>Do ſo, quoth <hi>Richard,</hi> but quick let it come.</l>
            <l>Wife, quoth the Miller; fetch me forth Light-foot, </l>
            <l>that we of his ſwéetneſs a little may taſte:</l>
            <l>A fair Veniſon-paſty then brought ſhe forth preſently</l>
            <l> eat, qd. the Miller, but ſir make no waſte:</l>
            <l>Here's Light-fort indeed, ſaid our King,</l>
            <l>I ne'r before eat ſo dainty a thing.</l>
            <l>I wis ſaid <hi>Richard,</hi> no dainty at all it is; </l>
            <l>for we do eat of it every day,</l>
            <l>In what place, ſaid our King, may be bought like to this? </l>
            <l>we never pay money for it by my fay:</l>
            <l>From Merry <hi>Sherwood</hi> we ſetch it home here;</l>
            <l>Now and then we make bold with our Kings Déer.</l>
            <l>Then I think ſaid our King, that it is Veniſon; </l>
            <l>each fool quoth <hi>Richard</hi> full well may ſee that:</l>
            <l>Never are we without two or three in the roof, </l>
            <l>very well fleſhed and excellent fat:</l>
            <l>But prethée ſay nothing where ever thou go,</l>
            <l>We would not for two pence the K. ſhould it know.</l>
            <l>Doubt not ſaid the King, my promis'd ſecreſie,</l>
            <l> the King ſhall never know more on't for me:</l>
            <l>A Cup of Lambs-wool they drank unto him then, </l>
            <l>and then to bed they poſt preſently:</l>
            <l>The Nobles next morning went all up and down,</l>
            <l>For to ſeek the King in every Town.</l>
            <l>At laſt at the Mill. houſe ſoon they eſpy'd him plain, </l>
            <l> as he was mounting upon his fair ſteed:</l>
            <l>To whom they came preſently, falling upon their knée,</l>
            <l>which made the Millers heart wofully bleed:</l>
            <l>Shaking and quaking before them he ſtood;</l>
            <l>Thinking he ſhould have béen hang'd by the rood.</l>
            <l>The King perceived him fearful and trembling, </l>
            <l>drew forth his Sword, and nothing he ſaid;</l>
            <l>The Miller down did fall, crying before them all, </l>
            <l>doubting the King would have cut off his head:</l>
            <l>But his kind courteſie there to requite,</l>
            <l>Gave him a Living, and made him a Knight.</l>

               <l>the which had many times béen in thoſe parts:</l>
               <l>When he came to the place where he did dwell,</l>
               <l>His Meſſage orderly then he did tell.</l>

               <l>The Purſevant ſmiling at their ſimplicity, </l>
               <l>and making many Legs took their reward:</l>

               <l>In this moſt ſtately ſort came they unto the Court, </l>
               <l>their jolly Son <hi>Richard</hi> the formoſt of all:</l>
               <l>Who ſet up by good hap a Cocks-feather in his cap </l>
               <l>and ſo they jetted down towards the Kings Hall:</l>

               <l>His wife like Maid Marrian did mince at that tide</l>
               <l>The King &amp; the Nobles that heard of their coming </l>
               <l>méeting this gallant Knight with his brave train</l>
               <l>Welcome Sir Kt. qd. he, with this your gay Lady, </l>

               <l>Quoth <hi>Dick,</hi> a bots on you, do you know me.</l>
               <l>Quoth the King gently, how ſhould I forget thée? </l>
               <l>thou waſt my Bed-fellow, well that I wot,</l>
               <l>But I think of a trick, tell me that prethée <hi>Dick,</hi>

               <l>The King &amp; his Courtiers heartily laught at this, </l>
               <l>while the King took them both by the hand,</l>
               <l>With Ladies and their Maids, like to the Quéen of ſpades </l>
               <l>the Millers wife did ſo orderly ſtand:</l>
               <l>A Milk-maids courteſie at every word,</l>
               <l>And down the folks were ſet at the ſide board.</l>
               <l>Where the King Royally, in Princely Majeſty, </l>
               <l>ſat at his dinner with joy and delight:</l>
               <l>When they had eaten well, to jeſting then they fell</l>
               <l> taking a Bowl of Wine drank to the Knight:</l>
               <l>Here's to you, qd. the King, in Wine, Ale, and Béer,</l>
               <l>Thanking you for all your Country fare.</l>

               <l>were it the beſt Ale in <hi>Nottingham-shire:</hi>
               </l>

               <l>ſome of your Light-foot I would we had here;</l>
               <l>Ho, ho, quoth <hi>Richard,</hi> full well I may ſay it,</l>
               <l>Tis knavery to eat of it, and then to betray it.</l>
               <l>Why art thou angry, quoth our King merrily, </l>
               <l>in faith I take it very unkind,</l>
               <l>I thought thou would'ſt pledge me in Ale &amp; Wine heartily, </l>
               <l>y're like to ſtay, quoth <hi>Dick,</hi> till I have din'd:</l>
               <l>You féed us with twatling diſhes ſo ſmall,</l>
               <l>Zounds a black puding is better then all.</l>
               <l>I marry, quoth our King, that were a dainty thing, </l>
               <l>if a man could get one for to eat;</l>
               <l>With that <hi>Dick</hi> aroſe, and pul'd one out of his hoſe, </l>
               <l>which with heat of his breech began for to ſweat:</l>
               <l>The King made a proffer to ſnatch it away;</l>
               <l>'Tis meat for your Maſter, good ſir you muſt ſtay.</l>
               <l>Thus in merriment was the time wholly ſpent, </l>
               <l>and then the Ladies prepared to dance,</l>
               <l>Old Sir <hi>John Cockle,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> incontinent, </l>
               <l>unto this practice the King did advance;</l>
               <l>Here with the Ladies ſuch ſport they did make,</l>
               <l>the Nob. with laughing did make their hearts ake.</l>
               <l>Many thanks for their pains did the K. give them, </l>
               <l>asking young <hi>Richard</hi> if he would be wed:</l>
               <l>Among thoſe Ladies frée, tell me which liketh thee, </l>
               <l>Quoth he, <hi>Jug Grumbal</hi> with the red head:</l>

               <l>She hath ſworn I ſhall have her Maiden-head.</l>
               <l>Then Sir <hi>John Cockle</hi> the King cal'd unto him </l>
               <l>and of merry <hi>Sherwood</hi> made him overſéer,</l>
               <l>And gave him out of hand <hi>3</hi> hundred pound a year, </l>
               <l>and now take heed you ſteal no more of my Déer:</l>
               <l>And once a year lets have your view,</l>
               <l>And ſo Sir <hi>John Cockle</hi> I bid you adiew.</l>
