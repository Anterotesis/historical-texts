            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>SOME may think it strange, since Gods Church has already been so well furnished with sound Grounds and Reasons by so many wise and godly men, for proof that the first day of the week is our true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Sabbath, that I should <hi>now</hi> offer this small Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise upon the <hi>same</hi> account.
<pb facs="tcp:48479:3"/>
But when the Scales are <hi>even</hi> by what already is put in, a little more, you know, makes the weight the better.</p>
            <p>Or grant we had down weight before, yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing over and above, may make <hi>his</hi> work the harder, that shall by hanging Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on the other end, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make things seem too light.</p>
            <p>Besides, This Book be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little, may best sute such
<pb facs="tcp:48479:3"/>
as have but <hi>shallow</hi> Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>short</hi> Memories, and but <hi>little</hi> Time to spare, which usually is the lot of the mean and poorest sort of men.</p>
            <p>I have also written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Subject, for that I would, as in other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-truths, be a fellow witness with good men that the day in which our Lord rose from the dead should be much set by of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48479:4"/>I have observed that some, otherwise sound in faith, are apt to be entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with a Jewish Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that some also that are far off from the observation of that, have but little to say for their own practice though good; and might I help them I should be glad.</p>
            <p>A Jewish Seventh-day-Sabbath has no promise of Grace belonging to it, if that be true (as to be sure it is) where <hi>Paul</hi> says,
<pb facs="tcp:48479:4"/>
               <hi>The command to honour Parents, is the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment with promise,</hi> Ephes. 6. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Also it follows from hence, that the Sabbath that has a promise annexed to the keeping of it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which the Lord Jesus shall give to the Churches of the Gentiles, <hi>Isai. 56.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps my Method here may not in all things keep the common path of
<pb facs="tcp:48479:5"/>
Argumentation with them that have gone before me: But I trust the godly-wise will find a taste of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-truth in what I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent them with as to the sanction of our Christian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabbath.</p>
            <p>I have <hi>here,</hi> by hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling four Questions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Seventh-day-Sabbath was not moral. For that must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be done, before it can be made appear that the First day of the week is that
<pb facs="tcp:48479:5"/>
which is the Sabbath day for Christians. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al it follows, that if the <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> was not moral, the first day is not so. What is it then? Why a Sabbath for holy worship is moral; but <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> day appointed for such service, is sanctified by Precept or by approved Example. The timeing then of a Sabbath for us lies in God, not man; in Grace, not Nature; nor in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of death, written and engraven in stones:
<pb facs="tcp:48479:6"/>
God always reserving to himself a power to <hi>alter</hi> and <hi>change</hi> both <hi>time</hi> and <hi>modes</hi> of worship according to his own will.</p>
            <p>A Sabbath then, or day of rest from worldly affairs to solemnize worship to God in, all good men do by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conclude is meet, yea, necessary: yet <hi>that, not</hi> Nature, <hi>but</hi> God reveals.</p>
            <p>Nor is that day or time, by God so fixed on, in its own nature, better than any
<pb facs="tcp:48479:6"/>
other: the holiness then of a Sabbath lies, not in the Nature or Place of a day, but in the Ordinance of God.</p>
            <p>Nor doth our sanctifying of it, to the ends for which it is ordained, lie in a bare confession that it is such; but in a holy performance of the Duty of the day to God by Christ, according to his Word.</p>
            <p>But I will not enlarge to detain the Reader longer

            <head>QUESTIONS About the NATURE and PERPE TUITY Of the <hi>Seventh-day-Sabbath.</hi>

               <head>
                  <hi>QUEST. 1.</hi> Whether the Seventh-day-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is Of, or made known to man by the Law and Light of Nature?</head>
               <p>SOmething must be here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, before I shew the grounds of this Question.</p>
               <p>First then, By the Law or Light of Nature, I mean, <hi>that Law</hi> which was <hi>concreat</hi> with man; that which is natural to him, being Original
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48479:8"/>
with, and Essential to himself; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently that which is invariable and unalterable, as is <hi>that</hi> Nature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I grant that by this Law of Nature, man understands that there is one eternal God; that this God is to be worshiped accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own will; consequently that <hi>time</hi> must be allowed to do it in: But whether the <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Light</hi> of Nature teacheth, and, <hi>that of it self,</hi> without the help of Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the <hi>Seventh day</hi> of the week is <hi>that</hi> time sanctified of God, and set apart for his Worship, that's the Question; and the grounds of it are thefe:</p>
               <p>First, Because <hi>the Law of Nature</hi> is anticedent to this day<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> yea com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated as a Law before 'twas known or revealed to man that God either did or would sanctifie the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day</hi> of the week at all.</p>
               <p>Now this Law, as was said, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing natural to a man, (<hi>for man is a L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>m unto himself,</hi> (Rom. 2.) could
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48479:8"/>
onely teach the things of a man, and there the Apostle stints it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11.)<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> But to be able to determine, and that about things that were yet without being either in Nature, or by Revelation, is that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to a man as a man; and the <hi>Seventh-day-Sabbath</hi> as yet, was such: For <hi>Adam</hi> was compleatly made the day before; and God did not sanctifie the Seventh day before it was, none otherwise than by his secret Decree. Therefore by the Law of Nature <hi>Adam</hi> understood it not, it was not made known to him thereby.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To affirm the contrary, is to make the <hi>Law</hi> of Nature <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural,</hi> which is an impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Yea, they that do so, make it a Predictor, a Prophet; a Prophet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout divine things to come; yea, a Prophet able to foretel <hi>what shall be,</hi> and that <hi>without</hi> a Revelation; which is a strain that never yet Prophet pretended to.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48479:9"/>
Besides; to grant this, is to run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a grievous errour; for this doth not onely make the Law of Nature the <hi>first</hi> of Prophets; contrary to <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 10. compared with <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1. but it seems to make the will of God, made known by Revelation, a needless thing. For if the Law of Nature, as such, can predict, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel Gods Secrets, and that before he reveals them, and this Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is universal in every individal man in the world, what need is there of particular Prophets, or of their holy writings? (and indeed here the Quakers and others split themselves:) For if the Law of Nature can of it self reveal unto me <hi>one thing</hi> pertaining to instituted Worship, for that we are treating of now, and the exact time which God has not yet sanctified and set apart for the performance thereof, why may it not reveal unto me more, and so still more; and at last <hi>all</hi> that is requisite for me to know, both as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48479:9"/>
to my Salvation, and how God is to be worshipped in the Church on Earth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If it be of the Law of Nature, then all men by nature are convinced of the necessity of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and that though they never read or heard of the revealed Will of God about it; but this we find not in the world.</p>
               <p>For though it is true that the Law of Nature is common to all, and that all men are to this day un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power and command there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yet we find not that they are by nature under a conviction of the necessity of keeping of a <hi>Seventh-day-Sabbath.</hi> Yea, the Gentiles, though we read not that they ever despised the Law of Nature, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had, as such, a reverence of a <hi>Seventh-day-Sabbath,</hi> but rather the contrary.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If therefore the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day-Sabbath</hi> is not of the Law of Nature, then it should seem not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48479:10"/>
to be obligatory to all. For institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Worship, and the necessary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances thereunto belonging, is obligatory but to some. The Tree that <hi>Adam</hi> was forbid to eat of, we read not but that his Children might have eat the fruit thereof: and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, the Passover, and other parts of instituted Worship was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned but to some.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I doubt the <hi>Seventh-day-Sabbath</hi> is not of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and so not moral; because though we read that the Law of Nature, and that before <hi>Moses,</hi> was charged upon the world, yet I fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>d not <hi>till then,</hi> that the prophanation of a <hi>Seventh-day-Sabbath</hi> was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon the world: and indeed to me this very thing makes a great scruple in the case.</p>
               <p>A Law, as I said, we read of, and that from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses</hi> (Rom. 5. 13, 14.) The transgressions also of <hi>that</hi> Law we read of them, and that particularly, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 8. ch. 6. 5.

               <p>But in all the Scriptures we do not read, that the breach of a <hi>Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-Sabbath</hi> was charged upon men as men <hi>all that time.</hi> Whence I gather, that either a <hi>Seventh-day-Sabbath</hi> was not discerned by the Light of Nature, and so not by that Law imposed; or else, that men by the help and assistance of that (for we speak of men as men) in old time kept it better, than in after A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges did the Church of God with better assistance by far: For they are there yet found fault with as brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of that Sabbath (<hi>Ezekel</hi> 20. 13.)</p>
               <p>It follows therefore, that if the Law of Nature doth not of it self reveal to us, as men, that the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48479:11"/>
                  <hi>day</hi> is the <hi>holy Sabbath of God.</hi> That that day, as to the sanction of it, <hi>is not Moral,</hi> but rather Arbitrary, to wit, imposed by the will of God upon his people, until the time he thought fit to change it for another day.</p>
               <p>And if so, it is hence to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that though by the Light of Nature men might see that <hi>time</hi> must be allowed and set apart for the performance of that Worship that God would set up in his House, yet, as such, it could not see <hi>what</hi> time the Lord would to that end chuse. Nature therefore saw <hi>that</hi> by a positive Precept, or a Word revealing it, and by no other means.</p>
               <p>Nor doth this at all take away a whit of that Sanction which God once put upon the <hi>Seventh-day-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath;</hi> unless any will say, and by sufficient Argument prove, that an Ordinance for divine Worship recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth greater Sanction from the Law
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48479:11"/>
of Nature than from a divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: or standeth stronger when 'tis established by a Law humane, for such is the Law of Nature, than when imposed by Revelation of God.</p>
               <p>But the Text will put this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie to an end. The Sanction of the <hi>Seventh-day-Sabbath,</hi> even as it was the <hi>Rest of God,</hi> was not till after the Law of Nature was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated; <hi>God rested the seventh day, and sanctified it,</hi> (Gen. 2. 3.) San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified it; that is, set it apart to the end there mentioned, to wit, to rest thereon.</p>
               <p>Other grounds of this Question I might produce, but at present I will stop here, and conclude, That if a <hi>Seventh-day-Sabbath</hi> was an essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial necessary to the instituted Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, then it self also as to its sanction for that Work, was not founded but by a positive Precept; consequently not known of man at first, but by revelation of God.</p>

                  <hi>QUEST. II.</hi> Whether the Seventh-day-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, as to <hi>Mans</hi> keeping of it holy, was ever made known to or imposed by a positive Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept upon him until the time of Moses? which from <hi>Adam</hi> was about two thousand years.</head>
               <p>SOmething must also be here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, in order to my propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of my grounds for this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; and that is, That the <hi>Seventh day</hi> was sanctified <hi>so soon</hi> as it had being in the world, unto the rest of God (as it is <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2, 3.) and he did rest from all his works which he had made therein. But the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, <hi>Whether when God did thus sanctifie</hi> this <hi>day to his</hi> own rest, <hi>be did also by the space of time above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:48479:12"/>
                  <hi>impose it as an holy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of rest upon men;</hi> to the end they might solemnize Worship to him in special manner thereon? And I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion this,</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Because we read not that it was.</hi> And reading, I mean, of the divine Testimony, is ordained of God, for us to find out the mind of God, both as to Faith and our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of acceptible service to him.</p>
               <p>In reading also, we are to have regard to two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To see if we can find a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: or,</item>
                  <item>2. A countenanced Practice for what we do: For both these ways we are to search, that we may find out what is that good, that accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible will of God.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For the first of these we have <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 16, 17. and for the second, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 20, 21.</p>
               <p>Now as to the imposing of a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>day-Sabbath</hi> upon men from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48479:13"/>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> of that we find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in holy Writ either from Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or Example. True, we find that Solemn worship was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Saints that then lived: for both <hi>Abel Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob</hi> sacrificed unto God (<hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 4. ch. 8. 20, 21. ch. 12. 7. ch. 13. 4. ch. 35. 1.) but we read not that the <hi>Seventh day</hi> was the time prefixed of God for their so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping, or that they took any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it. Some say, that <hi>Adam</hi> in eating the forbidden Fruit, brake al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the <hi>Seventh-day-Sabbath,</hi> because he fell on that day; but we read not that the breach of a Sabbath was charged upon him. That which we read is this; <hi>Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee, that thou shouldest not eat?</hi> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 11.) Some say also that <hi>Cain</hi> killed <hi>Abel</hi> on a <hi>Sabbath day;</hi> but we read not that in his Charge God laid any such thing at his door. This was it of which he stood guilty before
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48479:13"/>
God; namely, <hi>That his brothers bloud cried unto God against him from the ground,</hi> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 10.)</p>
               <p>I therefore take little notice of what a man saith, though he flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth his matter with many brave words, if he bring not with him, <hi>Thus saith the Lord.</hi> For that, and that onely, ought to be my ground of Faith as to how my God would be worshipped by me. For in the matters material to the Worship of God, 'tis safest that thus I be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in my Judgement: for here onely I perceive <hi>the footsteps of the Flock</hi> (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Song</hi> 1. 8.) They say further, that for God to sanctifie a thing, is to set it apart. This being true; then it follows, that the <hi>Seventh-day-Sabbath</hi> was sanctified, that is, set apart for <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise; and so, that it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a Sabbath of rest to the Saints from the beginning.</p>
               <p>But I answer, as I hinted before, that God did sanctifie it to his own
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48479:14"/>
rest. <hi>The Lord also hath set apart him that is godly for himself.</hi> But again, 'tis one thing for God to sanctifie this or that thing to an use, and another thing to command that that thing be forthwith in being to us. As for instance: the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was set apart many years for the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> before they possessed that Land. Christ Jesus was long sanctified; that is, set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to be our Redeemer before he sent him into the world (<hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 8. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 36.)</p>
               <p>If then, by Gods sanctifying of the <hi>Seventh day</hi> for a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> you understand it for a Sabbath for man, (but the Text saith not so) yet it might be so set apart for man, long before it should be, as such, made known unto him. And that the <hi>Seventh-day-Sabbath</hi> was not as yet made known to men, consider</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Moses</hi> himself seems to have the knowledge of it at first, not by <hi>Tradition,</hi> but by <hi>Revelation;</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:48479:14"/>
as it is (<hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 23.) <hi>This is that,</hi> saith he, <hi>that the Lord hath said,</hi> (namely to me; for we read not, as yet, that he said it to any body else) <hi>To morrow is the Sabbath of the holy rest unto the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Also holy <hi>Nehemiah</hi> suggesteth this, when he saith of <hi>Israel</hi> to God, <hi>Thou madest known to them thy holy sabbaths</hi> (<hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 14.) The first of these Texts shew us, that tidings of a <hi>Seventh-day-Sabbath</hi> for men, came <hi>first</hi> to <hi>Moses</hi> from Heaven: and the second, that it was to <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> before unknown.</p>
               <p>But how could be either the one or the other, if the <hi>Seventh<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>day-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> was taught men by the Light of Nature, which is the moral Law? or if from the beginning it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to men by a positive Precept for to be kept.</p>
               <p>This therefore strengthning my doubt about the affirmative of the first Question, and also prepareth an Argument for what I plead as to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48479:15"/>
this we have now under considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This yet seems to me more scrupulous, because that the punishment due to the breach of the <hi>Seventh-day-Sabbath</hi> was <hi>hid</hi> from men to the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>Moses;</hi> as is clear; for that 'tis said of the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the Sabbath, <hi>They put him in ward, because it was not as yet decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what should be done unto him,</hi> Numb. 15. 32, 33, 34, 35, 36.</p>
               <p>But methinks, had this <hi>Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-Sabbath</hi> been imposed upon men from the beginning, the penalty or punishment due to the breach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of had certainly been known before now.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Adam</hi> was forbidden to eat of the Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil, the Penalty was then, if he disobeyed, annexed to the <hi>Prohibition.</hi> So also it was as to <hi>Circumcision,</hi> the <hi>Passover,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ordinances for Worship. How then can it be thought, that the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day-Sabbath</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:48479:15"/>
should be imposed upon men from the beginning; and that the Punishment for the breach thereof, should be hid with God for the space of Two thousand years! <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 16, 17. ch. 17. 13, 14. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48. and the same Chapter, <hi>vers.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Gods giving of the <hi>Seventh-day-Sabbath</hi> was with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to <hi>stated</hi> and <hi>stinted</hi> Worship in his Church; the which, until the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> was not set up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his people. Things till then were <hi>adding</hi> or <hi>growing: Now</hi> a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, <hi>then</hi> Circumcision, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>long after that</hi> the Passover, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when <hi>Israel</hi> was come into the Wilderness, there to receive as Gods Congregation, a <hi>stated, stinted, limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> way of Worship, then he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points them a <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>times,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this Worship in; but as I said afore, before that it was not so, as the whole five Books of <hi>Moses</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew: wherefore the <hi>Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-Sabbath,</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48479:16"/>
as such a limited day, cannot be Moral, or of the Law of Nature, nor imposed till then.</p>
               <p>And methinks Christ Jesus and his Apostles do plainly enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare this very thing: For that when they repeat unto the people, or expound before them the Moral Law, they quite exclude the <hi>Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-Sabbath:</hi> Yea, <hi>Paul</hi> makes that Law to us compleat without it.</p>
               <p>We will first touch upon what Christ doth in this case.</p>
               <p>As in his Sermon upon the Mount, <hi>Matthew</hi> chap. 5. chap. 6. chap. 7. in all that large and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Discourse upon this Law, you have not one syllable about the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day-Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So when the Young man came running, and kneeling, and asking what good thing he should do to inherit eternal Life, Christ bids him keep the Commandments; but when the Young man asked <hi>which</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48479:16"/>
Christ quite leaves out the <hi>seventh day,</hi> and puts him upon the other.</p>
               <p>As in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>As in <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>As in <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>You will say, he left out the first, and second, and third likewise. To which I say, that was because the Young man by his Question did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose that he had been a doer of them: For he profess'd in his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, that he was a lover of that which is naturally good, which is God, in that his Petition was so universal for every thing which he had commanded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> also when he makes mention of the moral Law, quite leaves out of that the very name of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day-Sabbath,</hi> and professeth, that to us Christians the Law of Nature is compleat without it.</p>
               <p>As in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 7, 19.</p>
               <p>As in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>As in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that loveth another,</hi> saith he,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48479:17"/>
                  <hi>hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet: and if there be any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, it is briefly comprehended under this saying, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour, therefore love is the fulfilling of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I make not an Argument of this, but take an occasion to mention it as I go: But certainly, had the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day-Sabbath</hi> been <hi>moral,</hi> or of the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> (as some would fain perswade themselves) it would not so slenderly have been passed over in all these repetitions of this Law, but would by Christ or his Apostles have been pressed upon the people, when so fair an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as at these times offered it self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. But they knew what they did, and wherefore they were so si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as to the mention of a <hi>Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-sabbath</hi> when they so well talked of the Law as <hi>moral.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:48479:17"/>Fifthly, <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Ezekel</hi> both, do fully confirm what has been insinuated by us; to wit, that the Seventh day <hi>as a Sabbath</hi> was not imposed upon men until <hi>Israel</hi> was brought into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Moses</hi> saith to <hi>Israel, Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that thou wast a servant in the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand, and by a stretched-out arm; therefore the Lord thy God commandeth thee to keep the sabbath day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, he tells us, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which God made with them in <hi>Horeb,</hi> that written in stones, <hi>was not made with their forefathers</hi> (to wit, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi>) <hi>but with them,</hi> Deut. 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Ezekel</hi> also is punctual as to this: <hi>I caused them,</hi> saith God by that Prophet, <hi>to go forth out of the</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:48479:18"/>
                  <hi>land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and brought them into the wilderness. And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which if a man do he shall even live in them. Moreover, I gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctifieth them,</hi> Ezek. 20. 10, 11, 12, 13. Exod. 20. 8<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> ch. 31. 13. ch. 35. 2.</p>
               <p>What can be more plain? And these to be sure, are two notable witnesses of God, who, as you see, do joyntly concur in this; to wit, that it was not from Paradise, nor from the Fathers, but from the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, and from <hi>Sinai,</hi> that men received the Seventh-day-sabbath to keep it holy.</p>
               <p>True, it was Gods Sabbath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: for on the first Seventh day we read, that God rested thereon, and sanctified it. Hence he calls it in the first place <hi>MY Sabbath. I gave them MY Sabbath:</hi> But it seems 'twas not given to the Church
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48479:18"/>
till he had brought them into the Wilderness.</p>
               <p>But, I say, if it had been <hi>moral,</hi> it had been natural to man; and by the Light of Nature men would have understood it, even both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was, and otherwise. But of this you see we read nothing, either by <hi>positive Law,</hi> or <hi>countenanced</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, or <hi>any</hi> other way, but rather the flat contrary; to wit, That <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> had<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the knowledge of it <hi>first</hi> from Heaven, <hi>not</hi> by <hi>Tradition.</hi> That <hi>Israel</hi> had it, <hi>not of,</hi> or from their <hi>Fathers,</hi> but in the Wilderness, from <hi>him,</hi> to wit <hi>Moses,</hi> after he had brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And that that whole Law in which this <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> is placed, was given for the bounding and better ordering of them in their Church-state for their time, till the Messias should: come and put by a better Ministration this: out of his Church, as we shall further shew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:48479:19"/>The Seventh-day-sabbath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was not from Paradise, not from Nature, nor from the Fathers, but from the Wilderness, and from <hi>Sinai.</hi>

                  <hi>QUEST. III.</hi> Whether when the Seventh-day-Sabbath was given to <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilderness, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as such, was concerned therein.</head>
               <p>BEfore I shew my ground for this Question, I must also first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, <hi>That</hi> the Gentiles, as such, were then without the Church of God, and pale thereof; consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had nothing to do with the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials or necessary circumstances of that Worship which God had set up for himself now among the children of <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:48479:19"/>Now then for the ground of the Question.</p>
               <p>First, we read not that God gave it to any but to the Seed of <hi>Jacob.</hi> Hence it is said to <hi>Israel,</hi> and to <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> onely, <hi>The Lord hath given</hi> [you] <hi>his Sabbaths:</hi> And again, <hi>I also gave</hi> [them] <hi>my Sabbaths,</hi> Exod. 16. 29. Ezek. 2. 5, 12.</p>
               <p>Now, if the gift of the <hi>Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-sabbath</hi> was onely to <hi>Israel,</hi> as these Texts do more than seem to say; then to the Gentiles, as such, it was not given. Unless any shall conclude, that God by thus doing preferred the Jew to a state of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilism; or that he bestowed on them by <hi>thus</hi> doing, some high Gentile Priviledge. But this would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fictious: For, to lay aside reason, the Text always, as to preference, did set the Jew in the <hi>first</hi> of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 10:) nor was his giving the <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> to them but a signe and token there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:48479:20"/>But the great Objection is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> is found amongst the rest of those Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts which is so commonly called the Moral Law; for thence it is concluded <hi>to be of a perpetual dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I Answer, That neither that as given on <hi>Sinai</hi> is moral; I mean, as to the <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>ends</hi> of its Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration; of which, God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, we shall say more in our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the fourth Question, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I direct you for satisfaction. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Gentiles could not be concerned, as such, with Gods giving of a <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> to <hi>Israel,</hi> because, as I have shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it was given to <hi>Israel consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Church of God,</hi> (Acts 7. 31.)</p>
               <p>Nor was it given to them, as such, but with Rites and Ceremonies thereto belonging, so <hi>Levit.</hi> 24. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. 9, 10. <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. 22. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:48479:20"/>Now, I say, if this Sabbath hath Ceremonies thereto belonging, and if these Ceremonies were essential to the right keeping of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath:</hi> And again, if these Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were given to <hi>Israel</hi> onely, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all but such as were their Proselytes, then <hi>this</hi> Sabbath was given to them as excluding the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles as such. But if it had been Moral, the Gentiles could assoon have been deprived of their Nature as of a <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath,</hi> though the Jews should have appropriated it unto themselves onely.</p>
               <p>Again, to say that God gave this <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> to the Gentiles, as such, (and yet so he must, if it be of the moral Law) is as much as to say, that God hath ordained that <hi>that</hi> Sabbath should be kept by the Gentiles <hi>without;</hi> but by the Jews, <hi>not</hi> without her Ceremonies. And what Conclusion will follow from hence, but that God did at <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> time set up two
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48479:21"/>
sorts of acceptable Worships in the world: one among the <hi>Jews,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther among the <hi>Gentiles?</hi> But how ridiculous such a thought would be, and how repugnant to the wisdom of God, you may easily perceive.</p>
               <p>Yea, what a diminution would this be to Gods Church <hi>that then was,</hi> for one to say, the Gentiles were to serve God with more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than the Jew! For the Law was a <hi>Yoak,</hi> and yet the <hi>Gentile</hi> is called the <hi>Dog,</hi> and said to be without God in the world, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 7. <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 19, 20. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 26. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When the <hi>Gentiles</hi> at the Jews return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> came and offered their Wares to sell to the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> on <hi>this</hi> Sabbath; yea, and sold them to them too: yet <hi>not they,</hi> but the Jews, were rebuked as the onely breakers of <hi>that</hi> Sabbath. Nay, there dwelt then at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> men of <hi>Tyre,</hi> that on <hi>this</hi> Sabbath sold
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48479:21"/>
their Commodities to the Jews, and men of <hi>Judah:</hi> yet <hi>not they,</hi> but the men of <hi>Judah,</hi> were contended with, as the breakers of <hi>this</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
               <p>True, good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Gentiles that were Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, for lying then about the Walls of the City, for that by that means they were a temptation to the Jews to break <hi>their</hi> Sabbath; but still he charged the breach thereof <hi>onely</hi> upon his own people, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>But can it be imagined, had the Gentiles now been concerned with <hi>this Sabbath</hi> by Law divine, that so holy a man as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> would have let them escape without a rebuke for so notorious a transgression thereof; especially considering, that now also they were upon Gods ground, to wit, <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without</hi> the Walls of <hi>Jerusalem?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Wherefore he saith to <hi>Israel</hi> again, <hi>Verily my Sabbaths</hi> [ye]
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48479:22"/>
                  <hi>shall keep.</hi> And again, [ye] <hi>shall keep my Sabbaths.</hi> And again, <hi>The children of</hi> Israel <hi>shall keep my Sabbaths to observe my Sabbaths thoroughout</hi> [their] <hi>generations,</hi> Exod. 16. 29. ch. 31. 14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p>What can be more plain, these things thus standing in the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, than that the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day-sabbath</hi> as such, was given to <hi>Israel,</hi> to <hi>Israel</hi> onely; and that the Gentiles, as such, were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned therein!</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The very reason also of Gods giving of the <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> to the Jews, doth exclude the Gentiles, as such, from having any concern therein. For it was given to the Jews, as was said before, as they were considered Gods Church, and for a sign and token by which they should know that he had chosen and sanctified them to himself for a peculiar people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 12, 13. And a great token and sign it was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48479:22"/>
that he had so chosen them: For in that he had given to them this <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> he had given to them (his own Rest) a Figure and Pledge of his sending his Son into the world to redeem them from the Bondage and Slavery of the Devil: of whom indeed this Sabbath was a shadow or type, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>Thus have I concluded my ground for this third Question: I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now propound another.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="question">
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:48479:23"/>
               <head>
                  <hi>QUEST. IV.</hi> Whether the Seventh day-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath did not fall, as such, with the rest of the Jewish <hi>Rites</hi> and Ceremonies? Or whether that day, as a Sabbath, was afterwards by the Apostles im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon the Churches of the Gentiles?</head>
               <p>I Would now also, before I shew the grounds of my proposing this Question, premise what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary thereunto; to wit<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> That <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Day</hi> were both fixed upon by Law, for the solemn performance of Divine Worship among the Jews; And that <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Day</hi> is also by Law fixed, for the solemnizing of Divine Worship to God in the Churches of the Gentiles: But that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48479:23"/>
the <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath,</hi> as such, is <hi>that</hi> Time, <hi>that</hi> Day, that still I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
               <p>Now before I shew the grounds of my questioning of it, I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>that</hi> mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration in the bowels of which this <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> is placed. And</p>
               <p>First, I say, as to that, the <hi>nature</hi> of that Law is <hi>moral,</hi> but the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, and Circumstances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging, are <hi>shadowish</hi> and <hi>figurative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the <hi>nature</hi> of it, I mean the matter thereof: By the Ministration and Circumstances thereto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I do mean the giving of it by such hands, at such a Place and time, in such a Mode, as when 'twas gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilderness.</p>
               <p>The matter therefore, to wit, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength, and thy neighbour as thy</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:48479:24"/>
                  <hi>self,</hi> is everlasting, (<hi>Mark</hi> 12. 29, 30, 31.) and is not from <hi>Sinai,</hi> nor from the <hi>two Tables of stone,</hi> but in Nature; for this Law commenced and took being and place that day in which man was created: Yea, it was concreate with him, and without it he cannot be a rational creature, as he was in the day in which God created him. But for the ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it from <hi>Sinai,</hi> with the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances belonging to that mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, they are not Moral, not Everlasting, but Shadowish and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative onely.</p>
               <p>That Ministration cannot be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for three Reasons.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It commenced not when Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality commenced, but two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years after.</item>
                  <item>2. It was not universal as the Law, as moral is, 'twas given onely to the Church of the Jews in those Tables.</item>
                  <item>3. Its end is past as such a <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,</hi> though the same Law as to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48479:24"/>
the morality thereof abides. Where are the Tables of Stone and this Law as therein contained? We onely, as to that, have the notice of such a <hi>ministration,</hi> and a rehearsal of the Law, with that mode of giving of it, in the testament of God.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But to come to Particulars.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The very Preface to <hi>that</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration carrieth in it a type of our deliverance from the Bondage of Sin, the Devil, and Hell. <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Israels</hi> bondage there, being a type of these.</item>
                  <item>2. The very Stones in which this Law was engraven, was a figure of the Tables of the Heart. The first two were a figure of the Heart car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, by which the Law was broken: The last two, of the Heart spiritual, in which the new Law, the Law of Grace is written and preserv'd, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3.</item>
                  <item>3. The very Mount on which <hi>this</hi> Ministration was given, was typical of Mount <hi>Zion:</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. where
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48479:25"/>
they are compared, <hi>vers.</hi> 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.</item>
                  <item>4. Yea, the very Church to whom <hi>that</hi> Ministration was given, was a figure of the Church of the Gospel that is on Mount <hi>Zion:</hi> See the same Scripture, and compare it with <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 38. <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</item>
                  <item>5. That Ministration was given in the hand and by the disposition of Angels, to prefigure how the new Law or Ministration of the Spirit was to be given afterwards to the Churches under the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the hands of the Angel of Gods everlasting Covenant of Grace, who is his onely begotten Son, <hi>Isai.</hi> 63. 9. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 22, 23.</item>
                  <item>6. It was given to <hi>Israel</hi> also in the hand of <hi>Moses,</hi> as Mediator, to shew or typisie out, that the Law of Grace was in after-times to come to the Church of Christ by the hand and mediation of Jesus our Lord,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48479:25"/>
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. ch. 12. 24.</item>
                  <item>7. As to <hi>this</hi> Ministration, it was to continue <hi>but till the Seed should come;</hi> and then must, as such, give place to a better Ministration, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>A better Covenant, established upon better promises,</hi> Heb. 8. 6.</item>
               </list>
               <p>From all this therefore I conclude, that there is a difference to be put between the morality of the Law, and the ministration of it upon <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai.</hi> The Law, as to its morality, was before; but as to <hi>this</hi> ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 'twas not till the Church was with <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>he</hi> with the <hi>Angels</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>Now in the Law as moral, we conclude a time propounded, but no <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> enjoyned: But in that Law, as thus ministred, which Ministration is already out of doors, we find a <hi>seventh day;</hi> that <hi>seventh day</hi> on which God rested, on which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48479:26"/>
God rested from all his works, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned. What is it then? why the whole Ministration as written and engraven in stones being removed, the <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> must also be removed; for that <hi>the time,</hi> nor <hi>yet the day,</hi> was as to our holy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, or rest, moral; but imposed with that whole Ministration, as such, upon the Church, until the time of Reformation: Which time being come, this Ministration, as I said, as such, ceaseth; and the whole Law, as to the morality of it, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into the hand of Christ, who imposes it now also; but not as a Law of Works, nor as that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration written and engraven in Stones, but as a Rule of life to those that have believed in him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 21.</p>
               <p>So then that Law is still moral, and still supposes, since it teaches that there is a God, that <hi>time</hi> must be set apart for his Church to worship him in, according to that will of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48479:26"/>
his that he hath revealed in his Word. But though by that Law <hi>time</hi> is required; yet by that, as moral, the time never was prefixed. The time then of old was appointed by such a ministration of that Law as we have been now discoursing of; and when that Ministration cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that time did also vanish with it. And now by our new Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Son of God, he being <hi>Lord also of the Sabbath-day,</hi> we have a time prefixed, as the Law of Nature requireth, a <hi>new</hi> day, by him who is the Lord of it; I say, appointed, wherein we may worship, not in the oldness of that Letter written and engraven in Stones, but according to, and most agreeing with, his new and holy Testament. And this I confirm further by those reasons that now shall follow.</p>
               <p>First, Because we find not from the resurrection of Christ to the end of the Bible, any thing written by which is imposed that <hi>Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-Sabbath</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:48479:27"/>
upon the Churches. <hi>Time,</hi> as I said, the Law as moral requires; but <hi>that</hi> time we find no longer imposed: And in all duties pertaining to God and his true Worship in his Churches, we must be guided by his Laws and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: By his old Laws, when his old Worship was in force; and by his new Laws, when his new Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is in force. And he hath veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now said, <hi>Behold, I make all things new.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I find, as I have shewed, that this <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, not to the Law of Nature as such, but to that ministration of it which was given on <hi>Sinai:</hi> which Ministration as it is come to an end as such, so it is rejected by <hi>Paul</hi> as a Ministration no ways capable of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in the Church now, since the ministration of the Spirit also hath taken its place, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.) Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore instead of propounding it to the Churches with Arguments ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48479:27"/>
to its reception, he seeks by degrading it of its old lustre and glory, to wean the Churches from any likement thereof;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By calling of it the ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Death,</hi> of the <hi>Letter,</hi> and of <hi>Condemnation,</hi> a term most frightful, but no ways alluring to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</item>
                  <item>2. By calling it a Ministration that <hi>now</hi> has <hi>NO</hi> glory, by reason of the exceeding glory of that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration under which by the holy Spirit the New Testament-Churches are: And these are weaning Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</item>
                  <item>3. By telling of them it is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration that tendeth to <hi>blind</hi> the Mind, and to <hi>veil</hi> the Heart as to the knowledge of their Christ: So that they cannot, while under that, behold his beauteous face, but as their heart shall turn from it to him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</item>
                  <item>4. And that they might not be left in the dark, but perfectly know
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48479:28"/>
what Ministration it is that he means, he saith expresly, it is <hi>that written and engraven in stonÃ¨s.</hi> See again 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. And in that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration it is that this <hi>Seventh-day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabbath</hi> is found.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But shall we think that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles speaks any thing of all here said, to wean Saints off from the Law of Nature as such! No verily, that he retains in the Church, as being managed <hi>there</hi> by Christ: But <hi>THIS Ministration</hi> is dangerous <hi>now,</hi> because it cannot be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church, but in a way of contempt to the Ministration of the Spirit, and is derogatory to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that.</p>
               <p>Now these, as I said, are weaning Considerations. No man, I do think, that knows himself, or the glory of a Gospel-ministration, can, if he understands what <hi>Paul</hi> says here, desire that <hi>such</hi> a Ministration should be retained in the Churches.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This <hi>Seventh-day-sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:48479:28"/>
has lost its ceremonies (those unto which before you are cited by the Texts) which was with it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon the old Church for her due performance of Worship to God thereon: How then can <hi>this</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath <hi>now</hi> he kept? Kept, I say, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law. For it the Church on which it was at first imposed, was not to keep it, yea, could not keep it legally without the practising of those Ceremonies: And if those Ceremonies are long ago dead and gone, how will those that pretend to a belief of a continuation of the Sanction thereof, keep it, I say, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is written?</p>
               <p>If they say, they retain the day, but change their manner of obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation thereof; I ask, <hi>Who has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them so to do?</hi> This is one of the Laws of <hi>this</hi> Sabbath: <hi>Thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake. And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:48479:29"/>
                  <hi>the pure Table before the Lord. And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the Lord. Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the Lord continually, being taken from the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Israel <hi>by an everlasting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> Levit. 24. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. You may see also other places, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. 9, 10. <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. 22. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46. 4.</p>
               <p>Now if these be the Laws of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> this <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath;</hi> And if God did never command that <hi>this</hi> Sabbath should by his Church be sanctified without them<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> And, as was said before, if these Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies have been long since dead and buried, how must <hi>this</hi> Sabbath be kept?</p>
               <p>Let men take heed, lest while they plead for Law, and pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be the onely doers of Gods will, they be not found the biggest transgressors thereof. And why can
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48479:29"/>
they not as well keep the other Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, as the Sabbaths of Months, of Years, and the Jubilee? For <hi>this,</hi> as I have shewed, is no moral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, 'tis onely a branch of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Death and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath,</hi> as such, was a sign and shadow of things to come; and a sign cannot be the thing signified and substance too: Wherefore when the thing si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified, or substance, is come, the signe or thing shadowing ceaseth. And, I say, the <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> being so, as a <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> it ceaseth also. See again, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 13, 14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 12, 21. <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
               <p>Nor do I find that our Protestant Writers, notwithstanding their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of the Sabbath, do conclude otherwise; but that though <hi>time,</hi> as to worshipping God, must needs be contained in the bowels of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, as moral; yet they for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48479:30"/>
good reasons forbear to affix the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day</hi> as <hi>that</hi> time there too. They do it, I say, for good reasons, reasons drawn from the Scripture; or rather, for that the Scripture draws them so to conclude: yet they cast not away the morality of a Sabbath of rest to the Church. It is to be granted then, that time for Gods Worship abideth for ever, but the <hi>seventh day</hi> vanishes as a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and sign; because such indeed it was, as the Scripture above cited declares as to the Sanction thereof as a <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Law</hi> of Nature then calls for Time; but the <hi>God</hi> of Nature as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs it, and has given power to his Son to continue SUCH time as himself shall by his eternal Wisdom judge most meet for the Churches of the Gentiles to solemnize Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to God by him in. Hence he is said to be <hi>Lord even of the sabbath day,</hi> Matth. 12. 9.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, I find by reading Gods
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48479:30"/>
Word, that <hi>Paul</hi> by Authority Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical, takes away the Sanctions of all the Jews Festivals and <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is manifest, for that he leaves the observation or non-observation of them, as things <hi>indifferent</hi> to the <hi>Mind</hi> and Discretion of the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. <hi>One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully perswaded in his own mind.</hi> Rom. 14. 5.</p>
               <p>By this last clause of the Verse, [<hi>Let every man be fully perswaded in his own mind</hi>] he doth plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that <hi>such</hi> days are now stript of their Sanction: For none of Gods Laws, while they retain their Sanction, are left to the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>mind</hi> of the believers, as to whether they will observe them or no. Men, I say, are not left to their liberty in such a case; for when a stamp of Divine Authority is upon a Law, and abides, so long we are bound, <hi>not</hi> to our <hi>mind, but</hi> to that <hi>Law:</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:48479:31"/>
But when a thing, once sacred, has lost its sanction, then it falls, as to Faith and Conscience, among other <hi>common</hi> or indifferent things. And so the <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> did. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Thus <hi>Paul</hi> writes to the Church of <hi>Coloss. Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of any holy day, or of the new Moon, or of the Sabbath: which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is Christ,</hi> Coloss. 2. 16, 17. Here also, as he serveth other Holy-days, he serveth the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> He gives a liberty to believers to refuse the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of it, and commands that no man should judge against them for their so doing. And as you read, the reason of his so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, because the <hi>body,</hi> the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is come: Christ, saith he, is the Body, or that which these things were a shadow or figure of. <hi>The Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor hath the Apostle, since he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48479:31"/>
saith [or of the Sabbath] one would th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ€¦ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> left any hole, out at which mens inventions could get: but man has sought out many; and, so, many he will use.</p>
               <p>But again, That the Apostle by this word <hi>Sabbath</hi> intends the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day-sabbath,</hi> is clear; for that it is by <hi>Moses</hi> himself counted for a <hi>sign,</hi> as we have shewed: and for that none of the other Sabbaths were a more clear shadow of the Lord Jesus Christ than this. For that, and that alone, is called <hi>the Rest of God:</hi> in it God rested from all his works. Hence he calls it by way of eminency <hi>MY Sabbath,</hi> and <hi>MY Holy-day,</hi> Isai. 58. 13.</p>
               <p>Yet could that Rest be nothing else but typical; for God, never since the world began, really rested, but in his Son: <hi>This is he,</hi> saith God, <hi>in whom I am well pleased.</hi> This Sabbath then, was Gods Rest typically, and was given to <hi>Israel</hi> as a sign of his Grace towards them
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48479:32"/>
in Christ: Wherefore when Christ was risen, it ceased, and was no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of obligation to bind the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to the observation thereof. [Or of the Sabbath] He distinctly singleth out <hi>THIS Seventh day,</hi> as that which was a most noble sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, a most exact shadow. And then puts that with the other toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; saying, they are a shadow of things to come; and that Christ has answered them all. <hi>The body is Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eighthly, No man will, I think, deny, but that <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 4. intends the <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath,</hi> on which <hi>God rested from all his works;</hi> for the Text doth plainly say so: Yet may the observing Reader easily perceive, that both it, and the Rest of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> also, made mention of <hi>vers.</hi> 5. were typical, as to a day made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>vers.</hi> 7, and 8. which day he calls <hi>another.</hi> He would not <hi>after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> have made mention of <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> day. If <hi>Joshuah</hi> had given them
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48479:32"/>
rest, he would not. Now if they had not that Rest in <hi>Joshuah</hi>'s days, be sure they had it not by <hi>Moses;</hi> for he was still before.</p>
               <p>All the Rests therefore that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> gave them, and that <hi>Joshua</hi> gave them too, were but typical of <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> day, in which God would give them rest, <hi>vers.</hi> 9, 10. And whether the day <hi>to come,</hi> was Christ, or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it makes no matter: 'Tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that they before did fail, as always Shadows do, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention by <hi>David</hi> is, and that <hi>afterward,</hi> made of another day. <hi>There remains therefore a rest to the people of God.</hi> A Rest to come, of which the <hi>Seventh day</hi> in which God rested, and the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was a type; which Rest begins in Christ <hi>now,</hi> and shall be consummated <hi>in glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in that he saith, <hi>There remains a Rest,</hi> referring to that of <hi>David,</hi> What is it, if it signifies not, that the other Rests remain <hi>not?</hi> There
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48479:33"/>
                  <hi>remains</hi> therefore a Rest; a Rest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured by the <hi>Seventh day,</hi> and by the <hi>Rest</hi> of <hi>Canaan,</hi> though they are fled and gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There remains a Rest;</hi> a Rest which stands not now in signs or shadows, in the <hi>Seventh day,</hi> or <hi>Canaan;</hi> but in the Son of God, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to whom, and to which the weary are invited to come for rest. <hi>Isai.</hi> 28. 12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
               <p>Yet this casts not out the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians Holy-day or Sabbath: For that was not ordained to be a Type or Shadow of things to come, but to sanctifie the Name of their God in, and to perform that worship to him which was also in a shadow sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the ceremonies of the Law, as the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth plentifully declare.</p>
               <p>And I say again, the <hi>Seventh-day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabbath</hi> cannot be it, for the reasons shewed afore.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Especially if you adde
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48479:33"/>
to all this, that nothing of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Death written and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven in stones, is brought by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, or by his Apostles into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ, as a part of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Worship. Hence it is said of <hi>that</hi> Ministration in the bowels of which <hi>this Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> is sound, that it has now <hi>NO</hi> glory; that its glory is done away, in or by Christ, and so is laid aside, the ministration of the Spirit that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels in glory, being come in the room thereof.</p>
               <p>I will read the Text to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, so that the children of</hi> Israel <hi>could not stedfastly behold the face of</hi> Moses, <hi>for the glory of his countenance, which glory was to be done away.</hi> (It was given at first with this Proviso, that it should not always retain its glory, that Sanction, as a Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) <hi>How shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious? For</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:48479:34"/>
                  <hi>if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For even that which was made glorious, had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelieth. For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.</hi> 2 Cor. 3.</p>
               <p>What can be more plain? The Text says expresly, that this mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration doth <hi>NOT</hi> remain; yea, and insinuates, that in its first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution it was ordained with this Proviso, <hi>It was to be done away.</hi> Now if in its first institution upon <hi>Sinai</hi> it was thus ordained; and if by the coming in of the ministration of the Spirit, this Ordination is now executed; that is, if by it, and the Apostle saith it, it is done away by a ministration that remains: then where is that <hi>Seventh-day-sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus therefore I have discoursed upon this fourth Question: And
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48479:34"/>
having shewed by this Discourse, that the old <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> is abolished and done away, and that it has nothing to do with the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Gentiles; I am next to shew what day it is that must abide, that must abide as holy to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and for them to perform their New Testament-church-service in. Take the Question thus.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="question">
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:48479:35"/>
               <head>
                  <hi>QUEST. V.</hi> Since it is denied that the Seventh-day-Sabbath is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and is found it is not to abide as a Sabbath for ever in the Church, What time is to be fixed on for New Testament-Saints to perform together, Divine Worship to God by Christ in?</head>
               <p>UPon this Question hangs the stress of all, as to the Subject now under consideration: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can speak distinctly to it, I must premise, as I have in order to my speaking to the Questions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, something for the better clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our way.</p>
               <p>1. Then, we are not now speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>all</hi> manner of worshipping
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48479:35"/>
God, nor of <hi>all</hi> times in which <hi>all</hi> manner of worship is to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; but of that Worship, which is <hi>Church-worship,</hi> or Worship that is to be performed by the Assembly of Saints, when by the will of God they in all parts of his Dominion assemble together to worship him; which Worship hath a prefixed time alotted to, or for its performance, and without which it cannot, according to the mind of God, be done. This is the time, I say, that we are to discourse of, and not of <hi>ALL</hi> time appointed for all manner of Worship.</p>
               <p>I do not question but that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship by the godly is performed to God every day of the week; yea, and every night too, and that time is appointed or allowed of God for the performance of such Worship. But <hi>this</hi> time is not fixed to the same <hi>moment</hi> or <hi>ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> universally, but is left to the discretion of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as their frame of Spirit, or
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48479:36"/>
Occasions, or Exigencies, or Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, or Duty shall require.</p>
               <p>We meddle then <hi>onely</hi> with that <hi>time</hi> that the Worship aforesaid is to be performed in; which <hi>time</hi> the Law of Nature as such <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,</hi> but the God of Nature <hi>chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> And <hi>this</hi> time as to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Gentiles, we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved is not <hi>that</hi> time which was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to the Jews, to wit, <hi>THAT Seventh day</hi> which was imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by the ministration of death; for, as we have shewed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that Ministration indeed is done away by a better and more glorious Ministration, the Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit; which Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion surely would be much more inferiour than that which has now no glory, was it defective as to this. That is, if it imposed a Gospel-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but appointed not time to perform that Worship in: or if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all its commendation, it should be forced to borrow of a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48479:36"/>
Ministration inferiour to it self; <hi>that,</hi> to wit, the time without which by no means its most solemn wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship can be performed.</p>
               <p>This then is the Conclusion, that <hi>TIME</hi> to worship God in is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Law of Nature; but that the Law of Nature doth, as such, fix it on the <hi>Seventh day</hi> from the Creation of the World, that I utterly deny, by what I have said already, and have yet to say on that behalf: Yea, I hope to make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, as I have, that <hi>this</hi> Seventh day is removed; that God, by the ministration of the Spirit, has chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the time to another day, to wit, <hi>The first day of the week.</hi> Therefore we conclude the time is fixed for the worship of the New Testament-Christians, or Churches of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, unto <hi>that</hi> day.</p>
               <p>Now in my discourse upon this Subject I shall,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Touch upon those Texts that are <hi>more close,</hi> yet have a divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48479:37"/>
of this thing in them.</item>
                  <item>2. And then I shall come to Texts <hi>more express.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>First, for those Texts that are <hi>more close,</hi> yet have a divine intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this thing in them.</p>
               <p>First, The comparison that the Holy Ghost makes between the Rest of God from <hi>his</hi> Works, and the Rest of Christ from <hi>his,</hi> doth inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate such a thing: <hi>He that hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works as God did from his,</hi> Heb. 4. 10.</p>
               <p>Now God rested from his Works, and sanctified a day of rest to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as a signal of that Rest; which day he also gave to his Church as a day of holy rest likewise. And if Christ <hi>thus</hi> rested from his own Works, (and the Holy Ghost says he did <hi>thus</hi> rest) he also hath san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified a day to himself, as that in which he hath finished his Work, and given it also to his Church to be an everlasting Memento of his
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48479:37"/>
so doing, and that they should keep it holy for his sake.</p>
               <p>And see! as the Fathers work was first, so his day went before; and as the Sons work came after, so his day accordingly succeeded. The Fathers day was on the <hi>Seventh day</hi> from the Creation, the Sons the <hi>First day</hi> following.</p>
               <p>Nor may this be slighted, because the Text says, as God finished his Work, so Christ finished his; <hi>He also hath ceased from his own works as God did from his.</hi> He rested, I say, as God did; but God rested on his <hi>resting</hi> day, and therefore so did Christ. Not that he rested on the <hi>Fathers</hi> resting day; for 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that then he had great part of his work to do; for he had not as then got his conquest over Death, but the next day he also entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Rest, having by his rising a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, finished his Work, <hi>viz.</hi> made a Conquest over the Powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and brought Life and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48479:38"/>
to light through his so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>So then, that being the day of the Rest of the Son of God, it must needs be the day of the Rest of his Churches also. For God gave his resting day to his Church to be a Sabbath; <hi>and Christ rested from his own works as God did from his,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he also gave the day in which he rested from his Works, a Sabbath to the Churches, as did the Father. Not that there are <hi>TWO</hi> Sabbaths at once: The Fathers was imposed for a time, even until the Son's should come; yea, as I have shewed you, even in the very time of its imposing it was also ordained <hi>to be done away.</hi> Hence he saith, that Ministration was to be done away, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. Therefore we plead not for two Sabbaths to be at one time, but that a succession of time was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to the New Testament-Saints, or Churches of the Gentiles, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God in; which time is that in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48479:38"/>
which the Son rested from his own Works as God did from his.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Hence he calls himself, <hi>The Lord even of the Sabbath day,</hi> as <hi>Luke</hi> 5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. shews. Now to be a <hi>LORD,</hi> is to have Dominion, Dominion <hi>over</hi> a thing, and so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to alter or change it according to that power; and where is he that dares say Christ has not this <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We will therefore conclude, that it is granted on all hands he hath. The Question then is, Whether he he hath <hi>exercised</hi> that power to the demolishing or removing of the Jews <hi>Seventh day,</hi> and establishing another in its room? The which I think is easily answered, in that he did not rest from his own Works <hi>therein;</hi> but chose, for his own Rest, to himself <hi>another</hi> day.</p>
               <p>Surely, had the Lord Jesus inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to have established the <hi>Seventh day</hi> to the Churches of the Gentiles, he would himself in the first place
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48479:39"/>
have rested from his own Works therein; but since he passed by <hi>that</hi> day, and took <hi>no</hi> notice of it, as to the finishing of his own Works, as God took notice of it when he had finished his; it remains that he fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon another day, even the First of the Week; on which, by his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing again, and shewing himself to his Disciples before his Passion, he made it manifest that he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, <hi>as Lord of the Sabbath,</hi> that day for his own Rest. Consequently, and for the Rest of his Churches, and for his Worship to be solemnized in.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And on <hi>THIS</hi> day some of the Saints that <hi>slept arose,</hi> and began their eternal <hi>Sabbath, Matth.</hi> 27. 52, 53. See how the Lord Jesus had glorified <hi>this</hi> day! Never was such a stamp of divine Honour put upon any other day, no not since the world began. <hi>And the graves were opened, and many bodies of Saints which slept arose and came</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:48479:39"/>
                  <hi>out of their graves after his resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> &amp;c. That is, they rose as soon as he was risen: But why was not all this done on the <hi>Seventh day?</hi> No, that day was set apart that Saints might adore God for the works of Creation, and that Saints thorough that might look for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Christ: But now a work more glorious than that is to be done, and therefore another day is assigned for the doing of it in. A work, I say, of Redemption com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, a day therefore by it self must be assigned for this; and some of the Saints to begin their eternal Sabbath with God in Heaven, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a day by it self must be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for this. Yea, and that this day might not want <hi>that</hi> glory that might attract the most dim-sighted Christian to a desire after the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it, the Resurrection of Christ, and also of those Saints met together on it: <hi>Yea, they both did begin their eternal rest thereon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:48479:40"/>Fourthly, The Psalmist speaks of a day that the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the Son of God, has made; and saith, <hi>We will rejoyce and be glad in it.</hi> But what day is this? Why the day in which Christ was <hi>made the head of the corner,</hi> which must be applied to the day in which he was raised from the dead, which is the first of the Week.</p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Peter</hi> saith to the Jews, when he treateth of Christ before them, and particularly of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, <hi>This is the stone which</hi> [was] <hi>set at nought of you builders which</hi> [is] <hi>become the head of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:48479:40"/>For can it be imagined, that the Spirit by the Prophet should <hi>thus</hi> si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnalize <hi>this</hi> day <hi>for nothing;</hi> saying, <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made,</hi> to no purpose?

               <p>But I adde, that that is not all, 'tis a day that the Lord has both made for <hi>that,</hi> and that <hi>we might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and be glad in it.</hi> Rejoyce, that is, before the Lord while solemn di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship is performed on it, by all the people that shall partake of the Redemption accomplished then.</p>

Creation, for that in it his Son did live again to him.</p>
               <p>Now shall not Christians, when they do read that God saith, <hi>This day,</hi> and that too with reference to a work done on it by him, so full of delight to him, and so full of life and Heaven to them, set also a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark upon it, saying, <hi>This was the day of Gods pleasure,</hi> for that his Son did rise thereon; <hi>and shall it not be the day of my delight in him!</hi> This is the day in which his Son was both begotten, and born, and became the first-Fruits to God of them that sleep; yea, and in which also he was made by him the chief, and <hi>head of the corner;</hi> and shall not we rejoyce in it? <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Coloss.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
               <p>Shall Kings, and Princes, and Great men set a remark upon the day of their Birth and Coronation, and expect that both Subjects and Servants should do them high ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour on that day! and shall the day
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48479:42"/>
in which Christ was both begotten and born, be a day contemned by Christians! and his Name not be, but of a common regard on <hi>that</hi> day?</p>
               <p>I say again, Shall God, as with his finger, point, and that in the face of the world, at <hi>this</hi> day, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day,</hi> &amp;c. and shall not Christians fear, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake from their employments, to worship the Lord on this day!</p>
               <p>If God remembers it, well may I! If God says, and that with all gladness of heart, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee!</hi> may not! ought not I also to set <hi>this</hi> day apart to sing the songs of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This</hi> day my Redemption was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</p>
               <p>This day my dear Jesus revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>This day he was declared to be the Son of God with power.</p>
               <p>Yea, this is the day in which the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48479:42"/>
Lord Jesus finished a greater work than ever yet was done in the world: yea, a work in which the Father himself was more delighted than he was in making of Heaven &amp; Earth: And shall Darkness and the shadow of Death stain <hi>this day!</hi> Or shall a Cloud dwell on <hi>this day!</hi> Shall God regard <hi>this day</hi> from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove! and shall not his Light shine upon <hi>this day!</hi> What shall be done to them that curse this day, and would not that the Stars should give their light thereon? <hi>This day!</hi> after this day was come, God never, that we read of, made mention with delight, of the old <hi>Seventh-day-sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> more.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Nor is that altogether to be slighted, when he saith, <hi>When he bringeth his first - begotten into the world, Let all the Angels of God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him,</hi> to wit, at that very time and day, Heb. 1. 6.</p>
               <p>I know not what our Expositors say of this Text, but to me it seems
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48479:43"/>
to be meant of his Resurrection from the dead, both because the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle is speaking of that, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. and closes that Argument with this Text, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> And again, <hi>I will be his Father, and he shall be my Son. And again, when he bringeth his first-begotten into the world, he saith, And let all the Angels of God worship him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then, for Gods bringing of his first-begotten <hi>now</hi> into the world, was by his raising him again from the dead after they by <hi>crucifying</hi> of him had turned him out of the same.</p>
               <p>Thus then God brought him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, never by them to be hurried out of it again: For <hi>Christ being now raised from the dead, dies no more<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> death hath no more domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, saith the Text, <hi>when</hi> he bringeth him thus into the world, he requireth that worship be done
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48479:43"/>
unto <hi>HIM:</hi> When? that very day, and that by all the Angels of God. And if by <hi>ALL,</hi> then Ministers are not excluded; and if not Ministers<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> then not Churches. for what is said to the Angel, is said to the Church it self, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 1, 7. ch. 2. 8, 11. ch. 2. 12, 17. ch. 2. 18, 29. ch. 3. 1, 6. ch. 3. 7, 13. ch. 3. 14, and 22.</p>
               <p>So then, if the Question be asked, when they must worship him: the Answer is, <hi>When</hi> he brought him into the world, <hi>which was on the first day of the week;</hi> for <hi>then</hi> he <hi>bringeth him again from the dead,</hi> and gave the whole World and the Government thereof into his holy hand. This Text therefore is of weight as to what we have now under consideration, to wit, that the <hi>First day</hi> of the Week, the day in which God brought his First-begotten into the world, should be the day of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping him by all the Angels of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:48479:44"/>Seventhly, Hence this day is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>I was in the spirit on the Lords day:</hi> the day in which he rose from the dead, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lords day:</hi> Every day, say some, is the <hi>Lords day.</hi> Indeed this for discourse-sake may be granted<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> but strictly, no day can so properly by called <hi>the Lords day,</hi> as this <hi>First day of the week;</hi> for that no day of the Week or of the Year has <hi>those</hi> badges of the Lords glory upon it, nor <hi>such</hi> divine Grace put upon it us has the <hi>First day</hi> of the Week. This we have already made appear in part, and shall make appear much more before we have done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
               <p>There is nothing, as I know of, that bears this title but the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and <hi>this day,</hi> 1 Cor. 11, 20. Rev. 1. 10. And since Christians count it an abuse to allegorize the first, let them also be ashamed to santasticalize the last: The <hi>Lords</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:48479:44"/>
                  <hi>day</hi> is doubtless the day in which he rose from the dead. To be sure it is not the old <hi>Seventh day;</hi> for from the day that he <hi>arose,</hi> to the end of the <hi>Bible,</hi> we find not that he did hang so much as one twist of glory upon that; but <hi>this</hi> day is beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with glory upon glory, and that both by the Father and the Son; by the Prophets and those that were raised from the dead thereon; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>THIS</hi> day must be more than the rest.</p>
               <p>But we are as yet but upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Intimations, drawn from such Texts which, if candidly consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do very much smile upon this great truth; namely, that the <hi>First day of the week</hi> is to be accounted the Christian Sabbath, or Holy day for Divine Worship in the Churches of the Saints. And now I come to the Texts that are more express.</p>
               <p>Secondly then,</p>
               <p>First, <hi>This was the day</hi> in the which he did <hi>use</hi> to shew himself to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48479:45"/>
his people, and to congregate with them after he rose from the dead. On the first first day, even on the day on which he rose from the dead, he visited his people, both when toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and apart, over, and over, and over, as both <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>John</hi> do te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 24. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.) <hi>And prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched such sermons of his resurrection, and gave unto them;</hi> yea, and gave them such demonstration of the truth of-all, as was never given them from the foundation of the world. Shewing, he shewed them his risen body; opening, he opened their Understandings; and <hi>dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> he so scattered their Unbelief on <hi>THIS</hi> day, as he never had done before: And this continued <hi>one</hi> way or <hi>another</hi> even from before day until the evening.</p>
               <p>Secondly, On the next first day following the Church was within again; that is, congregated to wait upon their Lord. And <hi>John</hi> so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the matter, as to give us to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48479:45"/>
understand that they were not so assembled together again <hi>till</hi> then: <hi>After eight days,</hi> saith he, <hi>again the Disciples were within;</hi> clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, that they were not so on the days that were between, no not on the old <hi>Seventh day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now why should the Holy Ghost thus precisely speak of their assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling together upon the <hi>first day,</hi> if not to confirm us in this, that the Lord had chosen <hi>that</hi> day for the <hi>new</hi> Sabbath of his Church? Surely the Apostles knew what they did in their meeting together upon that day; yea, and the Lord Jesus also; for that he used <hi>SO</hi> to visit them when <hi>SO</hi> assembled, made his <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice a Law unto them:</hi> For Practice is enough for us New Testament Saints, specially when the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus himself is in the head of that practice, and that after he rose from the dead.</p>
               <p>Perhaps some may stumble at the word <hi>[after] after eight days;</hi> but
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48479:46"/>
the meaning is, at the conclusion of the eighth day, or when they had spent in a manner the whole of <hi>their</hi> Sabbath in waiting upon their Lord, then in comes their Lord, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth that <hi>their</hi> days service to him with confirming of <hi>Thomas</hi>'s faith, and by letting drop other most hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly treasure among them. Christ said, he must lie three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth, yet 'tis evident, that he rose the third day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 4.</p>
               <p>We must take then a part for the whole, and conclude, that from the time that the Lord Jesus rose from the dead, to the time that he shewed his Hands and his Side to <hi>Thomas,</hi> eight days were almost expired; that is, he had sanctified unto them <hi>two</hi> first days, and had accepted that service they had performed to him therein, as he testified by giving of them so blessed a farewel at the conclusion of both those days.</p>
               <p>Hence now we conclude, that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48479:46"/>
this was the custom of the Church at this day<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to wit, upon the <hi>first day of the week</hi> to meet together, and to wait upon their Lord therein. For the Holy Ghost counts it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to make a continued repetition of things; 'tis enough therefore if we have <hi>now</hi> and <hi>then</hi> mention made thereof.</p>
               <div type="objection">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But Christ shewed himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live to them at other times also, as in <hi>Joh. 21,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <div type="answer">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The names of all those days in which he so did are oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and blotted out, that they might not be idolized; for Christ did not set them apart for worship, <hi>but this</hi> day, <hi>the first day of the Week, by its name</hi> is kept alive in the Church, the Holy Ghost surely signifying thus much, that how hidden soever other days were, Christ would have <hi>his</hi> day, the <hi>first day</hi> had in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting remembrance among Saints.</p>
                  <p>Churches also meet together now on the Week-days, and have the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48479:47"/>
presence of Christ with them too in their employments; but that takes not off from them the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>first day</hi> of the Week, no more than it would take away the sanction of the old <hi>Seventh day,</hi> had it still continued holy to them: wherefore this is no let or obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to hinder our sanctifying of the first day of the Week to our God. But</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Adde to this, that upon <hi>Pentecost,</hi> which was the <hi>first day of the Week,</hi> mention is made of their being together again: For <hi>Pentecost</hi> was always the morrow after the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> the old <hi>Seventh-day-sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</hi> Upon <hi>this</hi> day, I say, the Holy Ghost saith, <hi>they were again with one accord together in one place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But oh! the glory that then at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them, by the presence of the Holy Ghost among them: Never was such a thing done as was done on <hi>that</hi> first day till then. We will read the Text; <hi>And when the day</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:48479:47"/>
                     <hi>of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, as of fire: And it sat upon each of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost,</hi> Acts 2. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Here's a first day glorified! Here's a countenance given to the day of their Christian assembling. But we will note a few things upon it.</p>
                  <p>First, The Church was now, as on other, first days, all with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in one place. We read not that they came together by vertue of any precedent Revelation, nor by Accident, but contrarywise by Agreement; they was to gather <hi>with one accord,</hi> or by appointment, in pursuance of their duty, setting apart <hi>that</hi> day, as they had done the <hi>first</hi> days afore, to the holy service of their blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:48479:48"/>Secondly, We read that this mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of theirs was not begun on the <hi>old Sabbath,</hi> but when <hi>Pentecost</hi> was <hi>fully</hi> come: the Holy Ghost intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that they had left now, and begun to leave, the <hi>Seventh-day-sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> to the unbelieving Jews.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Nor did the Holy Ghost come down upon them till every moment of the old Sabbath was past, <hi>Pentecost,</hi> as was said, was <hi>FULLY</hi> come <hi>first: And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place, and then,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And why was not this done on the <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath?</hi> but, possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, to shew, that the Ministration of Death and Condemnation was not that by or thorough which Christ the Lord would communicate so good a gift unto his Churches, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>This Gift must be referred to the <hi>Lords day,</hi> the <hi>first day</hi> of the week, to fulfil the Scripture, and to sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48479:48"/>
yet further this holy day unto the use of all New Testament Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Saints. For since on the <hi>first day</hi> of the week our Lord did rise from the dead, and by his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial presence, I mean his personal, did accompany his Church therein, and <hi>SO</hi> preach as he did, his holy truths unto them, it was most meet that they on the same day also should receive the first-fruits of their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life most gloriously.</p>
                  <p>And, I say again, since from the resurrection of Christ to <hi>this day,</hi> the Church then did receive upon the first day, (but as we read, upon no other) such glorious things as we have mentioned, it is enough to beget in the hearts of them that love the Son of God, a high esteem of the first day of the week. But how much more, when there shall be joyned to these, proof that it was the custom of the first Gospel-Church, the Church of Christ at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> after our Lord was risen;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48479:49"/>
to assemble together to wait upon God on the first day of the Week <hi>with their Lord as leader.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To say little more to this head, but onely to repeat what is written of <hi>this</hi> day of old, to wit, that it should be proclaimed the self same day, to wit, <hi>the morrow after the Sabbath,</hi> which is the first day of the Week, <hi>that it may be an holy convocation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: you shall do no servile work therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings,</hi> Levit. 23. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>This Ceremony was about the Sheaf that was to be waved, and Bread of First-fruits, which was a type of Christ; for he is unto God <hi>the first-fruits of them that sleep,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 20.</p>
                  <p>This Sheaf, or Bread, must not be waved on the old <hi>Seventh day,</hi> but on the morrow after, which is the first-day of the Week, the day in which Christ rose from the dead and waved himself as the First-fruits of

the Elect unto God. Now from this day they were to count seven Sabbaths compleat, and on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row after the seventh Sabbath, which was the first day of the week a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and this <hi>Pentecost</hi> upon which we now are, then they was to have a new Meat-offering, with Meat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings and Drink-offerings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And on the self same day they, were to proclaim that that <hi>first day,</hi> should be a holy Convocation unto them. The which the Apostles did, and grounded that their Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so on the Resurrection of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, not on Ceremonies, that at the same day they brought three thousand Souls<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to God, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41.</p>
                  <p>Now what another signal was here put upon the <hi>first day of the week!</hi> the day in which our Lord rose from the dead, assembled with his Disciples, poured out so abundantly of the Spirit, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered even by the first draught,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48479:50"/>
that his Fishermen made by the Gospel, such a number of Souls to God.</p>
                  <p>Thus then they proclaimed, and thus they gathered sinners on the first First day that they preached; for though they had assembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether over and over with their Lord before therein, yet they began not joyntly to preach until <hi>this</hi> first day <hi>Pentecost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, after this the Apostles to the Churches did never make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath.</hi> For as the <hi>Wave-sheaf</hi> and the Bread of First-fruits were a figure of the Lord Jesus, and the <hi>waving,</hi> of his life from the dead: So that morrow after the Sabbath on which the Jews waved their Sheaf, was a figure of <hi>that</hi> in which our Lord did rise; consequently, when <hi>their</hi> morrow after the Sabbath ceased, <hi>our</hi> morrow after <hi>that</hi> began, and so has conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a <hi>blessed</hi> morrow after <hi>their</hi> Sabbath, as a holy Sabbath to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48479:50"/>
from that time ever since.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We come yet more close to the custom of Churches; I mean, <hi>to the custom of the Churches of the Gentiles;</hi> for as yet we have spoken but of the practice of the Church of God which was at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem;</hi> only we will add, that the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms that were laudable &amp; binding with the Church at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> were with <hi>reverence</hi> to be imitated by the Churches of the Gentiles; for there was but one Law of Christ for them both to worship by.</p>
                  <p>Now then, to come to the point, to wit, that it was the custom of the Churches of the Gentiles, on the <hi>first day of the week,</hi> but upon no other that we read of, to come together to perform divine Worship to their Lord.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is said, <hi>And upon the first day of the week, when the Disciples were come together to break bread,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. This is a Text, that as to matter of fact, cannot be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48479:51"/>
by any, for the Text saith plainly <hi>they did so,</hi> the Disciples <hi>then</hi> came together to break bread, the Disciples among the Gentiles <hi>did so.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you see that the solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of a first day to holy uses was not limited to, though first preached by the Church that was at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> The Church at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was the <hi>Mother-church,</hi> and not that at. <hi>Rome,</hi> as some falsely imagine; for from <hi>this</hi> Church went out the Law and the holy Word of God to the Gentiles. Wherefore it must be supposed that this meeting of the Gentiles on the first day of the Week to break bread, came to them by holy <hi>tradition</hi> from the Church at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> since they were the first that kept the first day as holy unto the Lord their God.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, they had the best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to do it; for they had their Lord in the head of them to back them to it by his presence and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching thereon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:48479:51"/>But we will a little comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Text. <hi>Upon the [first day] of the Week.</hi> Thus you see the day is <hi>nominated,</hi> and so is kept alive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Churches: For in that the day is nominated on which this religious Exercise was performed, it is to be supposed that the Holy Ghost would have it live, and be taken notice of by the Churches that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
                  <p>It also may <hi>be nominated</hi> to shew, that both the Church at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and those of the Gentiles did har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monize in their Sabbath, joyntly concluding to solemnize Worship on a day. And then again to shew, that they all had left the <hi>old</hi> Sabbath to the unbelievers, and joyntly chose to sanctifie the day of the rising of their Lord, to this work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They came together [to break bread]</hi> to partake of the Supper of the Lord. And what day so fit as the <hi>Lords day</hi> for this? This was to be the work of that day, to wit, to solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48479:52"/>
that Ordinance among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, adjoyning other solemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship thereto, to fill up the day, as the following part of the verse shews. This day therefore was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for this work, the <hi>whole</hi> day, for the Text declares it: The first day of the week was set, by them, apart for this work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Upon [the] first day;</hi> not upon <hi>A</hi> first day, or upon <hi>ONE</hi> first day, or upon <hi>SUCH</hi> a first day; for had he said so, we had had from thence not so strong an argument for our purpose: But when he saith, <hi>upon the first day of the week</hi> they did it, he insinuates, <hi>It was their custom:</hi> (also upon one of these, <hi>Paul</hi> being among them, preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow.) Upon the first day: <hi>what,</hi> or <hi>which first day</hi> of this, or that, of the third or fourth week of the month? No, but upon the <hi>first</hi> day, <hi>every</hi> first day; for so the Text admits us to judge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:48479:52"/>
                     <hi>Upon the first day of the Week, [when] the Disciples were come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> supposes a Custom [<hi>when</hi>] or as they were <hi>wont</hi> to come together to perform such service among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to God: <hi>then Paul</hi> preached to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a Text also that supposes <hi>an agreement</hi> among themselves as to <hi>this</hi> thing. They came together then <hi>TO</hi> break bread; they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to do it then, for that then was the day of their Lords Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and that in which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self congregated after he <hi>revived,</hi> with the first Gospel-Church, the Church at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you see, <hi>breaking of bread,</hi> was the work, the work that by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral consent was agreed to be by the Churches of the Gentiles, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed upon the first day of the week. I say, by the <hi>Churches;</hi> for I doubt not but that the practice <hi>here,</hi> was also the practice of the rest of the Gentile-Churches<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:48479:53"/>
even as it had been before the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church at <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> For this practice <hi>now</hi> did become universal, and so this Text implies; for he speaks here <hi>universally</hi> of the practice of all Disciples <hi>as such,</hi> though he limits <hi>Paul</hi> preaching to that Church with whom he at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent personally was. Upon the first day of the week, <hi>when the Disciples were come together to break bread,</hi> Paul being at that time at <hi>Troas,</hi> preached to them on that day.</p>
                  <p>Thus then you see how the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile-Churches did use to break bread, not on the <hi>old Sabbath,</hi> but on the <hi>first day</hi> of the week. And, I say, they had it from the Church of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> where the Apostles were first seated, and beheld the way of their Lord with their eyes.</p>
                  <p>Now, I say, since we have so am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple an example, not onely of the Church at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but also of the Churches of the Gentiles, for the keeping of the <hi>first day</hi> to the Lord,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48479:53"/>
and that as countenanced by Christ and his Apostles, we should not be afraid to tread in their steps, for their practice is the <hi>same</hi> with Law and Commandment. But</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, We will adde to this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Text: <hi>Now,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the collection for the Saints, as I have given order to the Churches of</hi> Galatia, <hi>even so do ye. Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him as God has prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>This Text some have greatly sought to evade, counting the duty here, on this day to be done, a duty too inferiour for the sanction of an old <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath;</hi> when yet to shew mercy to an <hi>Ass</hi> on the old Sabbath, was a work which our Lord no ways condemns, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 15. ch. 14. 15.</p>
                  <p>But to pursue our design, we have a Duty enjoyned, and that of no inferiour sort: <hi>If charity be indeed,</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:48479:54"/>
                     <hi>as it is, the very bond of perfectness:</hi> and if without it <hi>ALL</hi> our doings, yea and sufferings too, are not worth so much as a rush, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
                  <p>We have here a Duty, I say, that a <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath,</hi> when enforce was not too big for it to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in.</p>
                  <p>The work now to be done, was, as you see, to bestow their charity upon the Poor; yea, to provide for time to come: And I say, it must be collected upon the <hi>first day of the week.</hi> Upon <hi>THE</hi> first day; not <hi>A</hi> first day, as signifying <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> but upon <hi>THE</hi> first day, even <hi>every</hi> first day; for so your <hi>ancient Bibles</hi> have it; also our <hi>later</hi> must be so understood, or else <hi>Paul</hi> had left them to whom he did write, utterly at a loss. For if he intended not <hi>every</hi> first day, and yet did not spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie a particular one, it could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly even a been understood <hi>which</hi> first day he meant: But we need not
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48479:54"/>
stand upon this: This work was a work for <hi>A</hi> first day, for <hi>EVERY</hi> first day of the week.</p>
                  <p>Note again that we have this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here commanded and enforced by an Apostolical Order: <hi>I have given order,</hi> saith <hi>Paul,</hi> for this; and his Orders, as he saith in another place, <hi>are the commandments of the Lord:</hi> you have it in the same Epistle, chap. 14. <hi>vers.</hi> 37.</p>
                  <p>Whence it follows, that there was given even by the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, a holy respect to the first day of the week above all the days of the week; yea, or of the Year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
                  <p>Further, I find also by <hi>this</hi> Text, that this Order is <hi>universal. I have,</hi> saith he, <hi>given this order not onely to you, but to the Churches in</hi> Galatia: Consequently to all other that were concerned in this Collection, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. and 9. chap. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this, whatever others may think, puts yet more glory upon the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48479:55"/>
                     <hi>first day</hi> of the week: For in that all the Churches are commanded, as to make their Collections, so to make them on <hi>THIS</hi> day: what is it, but that <hi>this</hi> day, by reason of the Sanction that Christ put upon it, was of vertue to sanctifie the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering thorough and by Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, as the <hi>Altar</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi> afore, did sanctifie the Gift and Gold that was, and was offered on them. The Proverb is, <hi>The better Day, the better Deed.</hi> And I believe, that things done on the Lords day, are better done, than on other days of the week, in his Worship.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="objection">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But yet, say some, here are no Orders to keep this first day holy to the Lord.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="answer">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. <hi>That is supplied;</hi> for that by this very Text this day is appointed, above all the days of the week, to do this holy duty in.</p>
                  <p>2. You must understand that <hi>this</hi> Order is but additional, and now enjoyned to fill up that which was
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48479:55"/>
begun as to holy Exercise of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worship by the Churches long before.</p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>universality</hi> of the duty being enjoyned to this day, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that this day was universally kept by the Churches as holy alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                  <p>4. And let him that scrupleth this, shew me, if he can, that God by the mouth of his Apostles did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver command that all the Churches should be confined to this or that <hi>duty</hi> on <hi>such</hi> a day, and yet put no Sanction upon that day; or that he has commanded that this work should be done on the first day of the week, and yet has reserved other Church-Ordinances as a publick so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization of Worship to him, to be done of <hi>another</hi> day, as of a day <hi>more</hi> fit, <hi>more</hi> holy.</p>
                  <p>5. If Charity, if a general Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection for the Saints in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches is commanded on this day, and on no <hi>other</hi> day but this day; for
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48479:56"/>
Church-collection is commanded on no other, there must be a reason for it: And if that reason had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the sanction of the day, I know not why the duty should be so strictly confined to it.</p>
                  <p>6. But for the Apostle <hi>now</hi> to give with this a particular command to the Churches to sanctifie that day as holy unto the Lord, had been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly superfluous; for that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and that by the countenance of their Lord and his Church at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> had done.</p>
                  <p>Before now, I say, it was become a custom, as by what hath been said already is manifest: wherefore what need that their so solemn a practice be imposed again upon the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? An intimation now of a continued respect thereto, by the very <hi>naming</hi> of the day, is enough to keep the Sanctity thereof on foot in the Churches: How much more then, when the Lord is still adding <hi>holy duty</hi> to <hi>holy duty,</hi> to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48479:56"/>
upon <hi>that</hi> day. So then, in that the Apostle writes to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to do this holy duty on the <hi>first day</hi> of the week, he puts them in mind of the Sanction of the day, and insinuates, that he would still have them have a due respect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="question">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But is there yet another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why this holy duty should, in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial as it is, be commanded to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on the first day of the week?</p>
               </div>
               <div type="answer">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes: For that now the Churches were come together in their respective places, the better to agree about Collections, and to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them. You know Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship is a duty so long as we are in the world, and so long also is this of making Collections for the Saints. And for as much as the Apostle speaks here, as I have hinted afore, of a Church-collection, When is it more fit to be done, than when the Church is come together upon the <hi>first day</hi> of the Week to worship God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:48479:57"/>2. This part of Worship is most comely to be done upon the <hi>first day</hi> of the week, and that at the close of that days work: For thereby the Church shews, not onely her thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to God for a Sabbath-days mercy, but also returneth him, by giving to the Poor, that Sacrifice for their benefit that is most behoveful to make manifest their professed sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Christ, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore necessary, that this work be done on the <hi>first day</hi> of the week, for a <hi>comely</hi> close of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship that we perform to the Lord our God on that day.</p>
                  <p>3. On the first day of the week, when the Church is performing of holy worship unto God, then that of Collection for the Saints is most meet to be performed; because then, in all likelihood, our hearts will be most <hi>warm</hi> with the divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; consequently most open and free to contribute to the necessity
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48479:57"/>
of the Saints. You know, that a man when his heart is open, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with some excellent thing; then, if at all, it is most free to do something for the promoting thereof.</p>
                  <p>Why, waiting upon God in the way of his appointments, <hi>opens,</hi> and makes <hi>fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> the heart to the Poor: And because the <hi>first day</hi> of the week was it in which now such solemn Service to him was done, therefore also the Apostle comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that upon the <hi>same</hi> day also, as on a day <hi>most fit,</hi> this duty of colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting for the Poor should be done: <hi>For the Lord loves a cheerful giver,</hi> 2 Cor. 9. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the Apostle by this, takes the Churches as it were at the advantage, and as we say, while the Iron is hot, to the intent he might, what in him lay, make their Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, not sparing nor of a grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging mind, but to flow from cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness. And the first day of the week,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48479:58"/>
though its institution was set aside, doth most naturally tend to this; because it is <hi>the</hi> day, the <hi>onely</hi> day, in which we received such blessings from God, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 26.</p>
                  <p>This is the day on which, <hi>at first,</hi> it rained Manna all day long from Heaven upon the New Testament-Church, and so continues to do this day. Oh! the resurrection of Christ, which was on <hi>this</hi> day, and the riches that we receive thereby: Though it should be, and is, I hope, thought on every day; yet when the First of the week is <hi>fully</hi> come! Then <hi>To</hi> day! <hi>This</hi> day! This is the day to be warmed; this day he was begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from the dead.</p>
                  <p>The thought of this, will do much with an <hi>honest mind:</hi> This is the day, I say, that the first Saints <hi>DID</hi> find, and that after-Saints <hi>DO</hi> find the blessings of God come down upon them; and therefore this is the day here commanded to be set apart for holy Duties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:48479:58"/>And although what I have said may be but little set by of some; yet, for a closing word as to this, I do think, could but half so much be produced from the day Christ rose from the dead quite down, for the sanction of a <hi>Seventh-day-sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> in the Churches of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, it would much sway with me. But the truth is, neither doth the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> nor any of his fellows, so much as once speak one word to the Churches that shews the least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, as to conscience to God, of a <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> more. No, the <hi>first day,</hi> the <hi>first day,</hi> the <hi>first day,</hi> is now all the cry in the Churches by the Apostles, for the performing Church-worship in to God. Christ began it on <hi>THAT</hi> day: Then the Holy Ghost seconded it on <hi>THAT</hi> day: Then the Churches practised it on <hi>THAT</hi> day. And to conclude, the Apostle by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand now under consideration, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues the sanction of <hi>THAT</hi> day

                  <p>But as to the old <hi>Seventh-day-sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> as hath been said afore in this Treatise, <hi>Paul,</hi> who is the Apostle of the Gentiles, has so taken away that whole Ministration in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of which it is; yea, and has so stript it of its Old Testament-gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, both by Terms and Arguments, that it is strange to me it should by any be still kept up in the Churches; specially, since the same Apostle, and that at the same time, has put a better Ministration in its place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>But when the Consciences of good men are captivated with an errour, none can stop them from a prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, as if it were it self of the best of truths.</p>

For <hi>Paul,</hi> who had before cast out the Ministration of death; as that which had <hi>no</hi> glory, would not now take thereof any part for New Testament instituted worship; for he knew that that would veil the Heart, and blind the Mind from <hi>that,</hi> which yet instituted Worship was ordained to discover.</p>

                  <p>I say, he preached now on that day to them and their Proselytes, because that day was <hi>theirs</hi> by their estimation: He did it, I say, of great love to their Souls, that if possible, he might save some of them.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, it you observe, you shall still find, that where 'tis said that he preached on <hi>that</hi> day, it was to <hi>that</hi> people, not to the Churches

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> I say first, These words was spoken to the Jewish Christians, not to the Gentile-churches: And the reason of this first hint, you will see clearer afterwards.</p>
                  <p>The Jews had several Sabbaths; as their <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath,</hi> their <hi>Monthly</hi> Sabbaths, their Sabbath of <hi>Years,</hi> and their <hi>Jubile,</hi> (Levit. 25.) Now if he means their <hi>ordinary</hi> Sabbaths, or that called the <hi>Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-sabbath,</hi> why doth he joyn the Winter thereto? for in that he joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the <hi>Winter</hi> with <hi>that</hi> Sabbath that he exhorteth them to pray their flight might not be in,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48479:61"/>
it should seem that the meaneth rather their Sabbath of <hi>Years,</hi> or their <hi>Jubile,</hi> which did better an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer one to another than <hi>one</hi> day and a <hi>winter</hi> could.</p>
                  <p>And I say again, that Christ should suppose that their flight should, or might last some conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part of a Winter, and yet that then they should have their rest on those <hi>Seventh-day-sabbaths,</hi> is a little besides my reason, if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered again, that the Gentiles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom they were then to fly, were Enemies to <hi>their</hi> Sabbath, and consequently would take opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity at their Sabbaths to afflict them so much the more. Wherefore, I would that they who plead for a continuation of the <hi>Seventh-day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabbath</hi> from this Text, would both better consider <hi>LT,</hi> and the incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that seems to be betwixt <hi>such</hi> a Sabbath and a <hi>Winter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But again, were it granted that it is the <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48479:62"/>
Christ here intendeth; yet, since, as we have proved, the Sanction <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> this was taken away; I mean, <hi>before</hi> this flight should be, he did not press them to pray thus because by any Law of Heaven they should then be commanded to keep it holy; but because some would, <hi>thorough their weakness,</hi> have conscience of it till then. And such would, if their flight should happen thereon, be as much grieved and perplexed, as if it yet stood <hi>obligatory</hi> to them by a Law.</p>
                  <p>This seems to have some truth in it, because among the Jews that believed, there continued a long time many that were wedded yet to the Law, to the ceremonial part thereof, and was not so clearly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelized as the Churches of the Gentiles was. <hi>Thou seest Brother,</hi> said <hi>James</hi> to <hi>Paul, how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of the Jews there are that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and they are all zealous of the Law,</hi> Acts 15. 5. ch. 21. 20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:48479:62"/>Of these, and such weak unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Jews, perhaps Christ speaks, when he gives this exhortation to them to pray thus; whose Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences he knew would be weak, and being so, would bind when they were entangled with an errour, as fast as if it bound by a Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
                  <p>Again, though the <hi>Seventh-day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabbath</hi> and Ceremonies lost their Sanction at the resurrection of Christ, yet they retained some kind of being in the Church of the Jews, until the <hi>desolation spoken of by</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel <hi>should be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it is said, that <hi>then</hi> the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Sacrifices shall cease, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 27. And hence it is, that <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> and the <hi>Temple</hi> are <hi>still</hi> called the holy place, even until this flight should be, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 15.</p>
                  <p>Now if <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> are <hi>still</hi> called holy, even after the Body and Substance, of which they were shadows, was come; then no
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48479:63"/>
marvel though some to that day that believed were entangled therewith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For it may very well be supposed that all Conscience of them would not be quite taken away, until all reason for that Conscience should be taken away also. But when <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> and the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the Jews Worship, by the Gentiles was quite extinct by ruines, then in reason that Conscience did cease. And it seems by some Texts, that all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to them was not taken away till then.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> These things had a <hi>vertual</hi> and a <hi>nominal</hi> being: As to their vertual being, that died that day Christ did rise from the dead, they being crucified with him on the Cross, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>But now, when the <hi>vertual</hi> being
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48479:63"/>
was gone, they still with the weak retained their <hi>name,</hi> (among many of the Jews that believed) until the <hi>abomination</hi> that maketh desolate <hi>stood in the holy place:</hi> for in <hi>Paul</hi>'s time they were, as to that, <hi>but ready to vanish away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, I say, they still retaining their <hi>nominal</hi> grandeur, though not by vertue of a Law, they could not, till <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Dispensation</hi> came, be swept out of the way. We will make what hath been said, as to this, out by a familiar similitude.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is a Lord or great man dies; now being dead, he has lost his vertual life. He has now no relation to a Wife, to Children, vertually; yet his Name still abides, and that in that Family, to which otherwise he is dead. Wherefore they embalm him, and also keep him above ground for many days. Yea, he is still reverenced by those of the family, and that in several respects. Nor doth any thing but time and dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wear this name away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:48479:64"/>Thus then the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-signs and shadows went off the stage in the Church of Christ among the Jews. They lost their <hi>vertue</hi> and signification when Christ nailed them to his Cross, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. But as to their <hi>Name,</hi> and the <hi>Grandeur</hi> that attended that, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with many that were weak, and vanished not, <hi>but when the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination that made them desolate came.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The sum then and conclusion of the matter is this; the <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> lost its glory when that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration</hi> in which it was, lost its: But yet the <hi>name</hi> thereof might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide a long time with the Jowish le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Christians, and so might become obligatory still, though not by the Law, to their Conscience, even as <hi>Circumcision</hi> and other Ceremonies did: and to them it would be as grievous to fly on that day, as if by Law it was still in force.</p>
                  <p>For, I say, to a weak Conscience, that Law which has lost its life, may
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48479:64"/>
yet thorough their ignorance, be as binding as if it stood still upon the authority of God.</p>
                  <p>Things then become obligatory these two ways.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. By an <hi>Institution</hi> of God.</item>
                     <item>2. By the <hi>over-ruling</hi> power of a mans misinformed Conscience. And although by vertue of an institution Divine Worship is acceptable to God by Christ, yet Conscience will make that a man shall have but little ease if <hi>such</hi> rules and dictates as it impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses be not observed by him.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>This is my answer, upon a supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> is in this Text intended: and the answer, I think, stands firm and good.</p>
                  <p>Also, there remains, notwithstanding this Objection, no divine Sanction in, or upon the old <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some indeed will urge, that Christ here meant the <hi>first day</hi> of the week, which here he puts under the term of Sabbath. But this is forein to me, so I wave it till I receive more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in the thing.</p>

                  <p>1. For we have shewed from sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Scriptures, that from the very day our Lord did rise from the dead, the Church at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> in which the Twelve Apostles were, did meet together on that day, and had the Lord himself for their Preacher, while they were auditors; and thus the day began.</p>
                  <p>2. We have shewed that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, the Third person in the Trinity, did second this of Christ, in coming down from Heaven upon <hi>this day</hi> to manage the Apostles in their preaching; and in that very day so managed them in that work, that by his help they then did bring
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48479:65"/>
Three thousand Souls to God.</p>
                  <p>3. We have shewed also, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this the Gentile-Churches did solemnize <hi>this</hi> day for holy Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and that they had from <hi>Paul</hi> both Countenance and Order so to do.</p>
                  <p>And now I will adde, that more need not be spoken: <hi>For the practice of the first Church, with their Lord in the head of them to manage them in that practice, is as good as many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</hi> What then shall we say, when we see a first Practice turned into holy Custom?</p>
                  <p>I say moreover, that though a <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> is not natural to man as man, yet our <hi>Christian</hi> Holy day is natural to us as Saints, if our Consciences are not clogged before with some old Fables, or Jewish Customs.</p>
                  <p>But if an old Religion shall get <hi>footing</hi> and <hi>rooting</hi> in us, though the grounds thereof be vanished away, yet the man concerned will be hard

put to it, should he be saved, to get clear of his clouds, and devote himself to that service of God which is of his own prescribing.</p>

                     <hi>Luther</hi> himself, though he <hi>saw</hi> many things were without ground which he had received for truth, had yet work hard enough, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self intimates, to get his Conscience clear from all those <hi>roots</hi> and <hi>strings</hi> of inbred errour.</p>
                  <p>But, I say, to an <hi>untainted</hi> and <hi>well-bred</hi> Christian, we have good measure, <hi>shaken</hi> together, and <hi>running</hi> over, for our Christian <hi>Lords day.</hi> And I say again, that the <hi>first day of the week,</hi> and the spirit of <hi>such</hi> a Christian, <hi>sute</hi> one another, as <hi>nature</hi> suteth <hi>nature;</hi> for there is as it were a natural <hi>instinct</hi> in Christians, as such, when they understand what in a <hi>first day</hi> was brought forth, to fall in therewith to keep it holy to their Lord.</p>

                  <p>2. The <hi>first day</hi> of the week!

The day in which he made himself <hi>known</hi> to them in <hi>breaking bread:</hi> The day in which he so plentifully poured out the Holy Ghost upon them: The day in

which the Church both at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and <hi>those</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> did use to perform to God Divine Worship: all which has before been sufficiently proved.

                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> could gather by what he met with upon Mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> that that was the place where God would have the Temple builded, therefore
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48479:68"/>
he sacrificed there (1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 21. 26, 27, 28. ch. 22. 1, 2. 2 Chr. 3. 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ruth</hi> was to mark the place where <hi>Baaz</hi> lay down to sleep, and shall not Christians also mark the day in which our Lord <hi>rose from the dead, Ruth</hi> 3. 4.</p>
                  <p>I say, shall we not <hi>mark</hi> it, when so many memorable things was done on it <hi>for,</hi> and <hi>LO,</hi> and <hi>IN</hi> the Churches of God! Let Saints be ashamed to think that such a day should be looked over, or counted common (when tempted to it by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan) when kept to religious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of old, and when beautifled with so many divine Characters of sanctity as we have proved, by Christ, his Church, the Holy Ghost, and the command of Apostolical Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it was.</p>
                  <p>But why, I say, is <hi>this</hi> day, on which our Lord rose from the dead, <hi>Nominated</hi> as it is? Why was it not sufficient to say <hi>he rose again;</hi> or, be rose again the <hi>third day?</hi> without
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48479:68"/>
a specification of the very <hi>name</hi> of the day<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> For, as was said afore. Christ appeared to his Disciples<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> after his resurrection, on other days also; yea<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and thereon did Miracles too: Why then did not these days live? why was their name, for all that, blotted out, and this day onely kept alive in the Churches?</p>
                  <p>The day on which Christ was born of a Virgin; the day of his Circumcision, the day of his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism, and Transfiguration, are not by their names committed by the Holy Ghost to holy Writ to be kept alive in the world<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> nor yet such days in which he did many great and wonderful thing: But <hi>THIS</hi> day<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                     <hi>this</hi> day is still nominated, the first day of the week is the day. I say, why are things thus left with us? but because we, as Saints of old, should gather, and separate, what is of divine Authority from the rest. For in that <hi>this</hi> day is so often <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated</hi> while all other days lie dead
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48479:69"/>
in their Graves, 'tis as much as if God should say, <hi>Remember</hi> the First day of the week to keep it holy to the Lord your God.</p>
                  <p>And set this aside, and I know not what reason can be rendred, or what Prophecy should be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the bare <hi>naming of the day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When God, of old, did sanctifie for the use of his Church a day, as he did many, he always called them either by the name of the day of the Month, or of the Week, or by some other signal by which they might be certainly known. Why should it not then be concluded, that for this very reason the first day of the week is thus often nominated by the Holy Ghost in the Testament of Christ?</p>
                  <p>Moreover, he that takes away the first day, as to <hi>this</hi> Service, leaves us now <hi>NO</hi> day, as sanctified of God, for his solemn Worship to be by his Churches performed in. As for
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48479:69"/>
the <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath,</hi> that as we see, is gone to its grave with the Signs and Shadows of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</p>
                  <p>Yea, and has such a dash left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it by Apostolical Authority, that 'tis enough to make a Christian fly from it for ever, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.)<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, I say; since that is removed <hi>by God:</hi> If we should suffer the first day also to be taken away <hi>by man,</hi> What day that has a divine stamp upon it, <hi>would be left for us to worship God in?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alass! the first day of the week is the Christians <hi>Market-day,</hi> that which they so solemnly trade in for sole provision for all the week fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. This is the day that they gather <hi>Manna</hi> in. To be sure the <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> is not that: For of old the people of God could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find <hi>Manna</hi> on <hi>that</hi> day. <hi>On the seventh day,</hi> said <hi>Moses, which is the Sabbath, in it there shall be none,</hi> Exod. 16. 26.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:48479:70"/>Any day of the week <hi>Manna</hi> could be found, but on that day it was not to be found upon the face of the ground. But now our <hi>first day</hi> is the <hi>Manna-day;</hi> the onely day that the Churches of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even of old, did gather <hi>Manna</hi> in. But more of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</p>
                  <p>Nor will it out of my mind but that it is a very high piece of ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and of uncomly behaviour, to deny the Son of God <hi>his</hi> day, the <hi>Lords day,</hi> the day that he <hi>has made:</hi> And as we have shewed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, this <hi>first day of the week</hi> is it; yea, and a great piece of <hi>unmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> is it too, for any, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the old <hi>Seventh day</hi> is so degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as it is, to attempt to impose it on the Son of God. To impose a day upon him which yet <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to be a branch of the Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, and of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Yea, to impose a part of that Ministration which <hi>HE</hi> says plam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48479:70"/>
                     <hi>Was to be done away;</hi> for that a better Ministration stript it of its glory, is a high attempt indeed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Yet again, the Apostle <hi>finites</hi> the teachers of the Law upon the mouth, saying, <hi>They understand neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm,</hi> (1 Tim. 1. 7.)</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Gods Rest from the works of Creation; but yet the <hi>Rest</hi> that he found in what the <hi>first day</hi> of the week did produce<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> for Christ was born from the dead in it, more pleased him than did all the <hi>Seventh days</hi> that ever the world brought forth; wherefore, as I said before, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but that the <hi>well-bred</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian must set apart this day for so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Worship to God, and to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie his name therein.</p>
                  <p>Must the Church of old be bound to remember that might in which they did come out of <hi>Egypt!</hi> must <hi>Jeptha</hi>'s daughter have <hi>four</hi> days
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48479:71"/>
for the Virgins of <hi>Israel</hi> yearly to lament her hard case in! Yea, must <hi>two</hi> days be kept by the Church of old, yearly, for their being deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Hamon</hi>'s fury! And must not one <hi>to the worlds end</hi> be kept by the Saints for the Son of God their Redeemer, for all he has delivered them from a worse than <hi>Pharaob</hi> or <hi>Haman,</hi> even from the <hi>Devil,</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>Hell!</hi> oh stupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! Exod. 12. 24. Judg. 11. 39, 40. Esth. 9. 26.â€”32.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A day! say some, God forbid but he should have a day. But what day? oh! the old day comprized within the bounds and bowels of the Ministration of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And is this the love that thou hast to thy Redeemer, to keep that day to him for all the service that hath done for thee, which has a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural tendancy in it to draw thee off from the consideration of the works of thy <hi>redemption,</hi> to the <hi>creation</hi> of the world! oh stupidity!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:48479:71"/>But why must he be imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? has he chosen that day? did he finish <hi>HIS</hi> work thereon? Is there in all the New Testament of our Lord, from the day he rose from the dead, to the end of his holy Book, one syllable that signifies in the least the <hi>tenth part</hi> of such a thing? Where is the Scripture that saith that this Lord of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> commanded his Church, from that time, to do any part of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service thereon? Where do we find the Churches to gather together thereon?</p>
                  <p>But why the <hi>Seventh day?</hi> What is it? Take but the shadow thereof away: Or what shadow <hi>now</hi> is left in it since its institution as to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service is taken long since from it?</p>
                  <p>Is there any thing in the works that was done in that day, more than shadow, or that in the least tends <hi>otherwise</hi> to put us in mind of Christ; and he being come, what
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48479:72"/>
need have we of that shadow? And I say again, since that day was to be observed by a ceremonial method, and no way else, as we find; and since Ceremonies are ceased, what way by divine appointment is there left to keep that old <hi>Sabbath</hi> by Christians in?</p>
                  <p>If they say, Ceremonies are cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. By the same Argument, so is the sanction of the day in which they were to be performed. I would gradly see the place, if it is to be found, where 'tis said, <hi>That day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains its sanction, which yet has lost that method of service which was of God appointed for the performance of worship to him thereon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Canaan</hi>-worship fell, the <hi>Sanction</hi> of <hi>Canaan</hi> fell. When <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>-worship, and <hi>Altar</hi>-worship, and the Sacrifices of the Levitical Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood fell, down also came the things themselves! Likewise so, when the <hi>service</hi> or <hi>shadow</hi> and <hi>ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> fell, the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48479:72"/>
                     <hi>Seventh-day-Sabbath</hi> fell likewise.</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath,</hi> as I told you, <hi>Manna</hi> was not to be found. But why for that <hi>that</hi> day was of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and of the Ministration of death. But <hi>Manna</hi> was was not of him: <hi>Moses,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>gave you not that bread from Heaven,</hi> Joh. 6. 31, 32. <hi>Moses,</hi> as was said, <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>gave that <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> in Tables of stone, and God gave that <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven. Christ, nor his Father, gives grace by the Law, no not by that Law in which is contained the old <hi>Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-sabbath</hi> it self.</p>
                  <p>The Law is not of Faith, why then should Grace be by Christians expected by observation of the Law? The Law, even the Law written and engraven in stones en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns perfect obedience thereto on pain of the curse of God. Nor can that part of it now under conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, according as is required, be fulfilled by any man, was the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony thereto belonging, allowed to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48479:73"/>
be laid aside, <hi>Isai.</hi> 58. 13. Never man yet did keep it perfectly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he whose name is Jesus Christ: in him therefore we have kept it, and by him are set free from that Law, and brought under the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>But why should we be bound to seek <hi>Manna</hi> on <hi>that</hi> day, on which God saies, <hi>None shall be found.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Perhaps, it will said, <hi>that the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of THAT day</hi> would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that <hi>Manna</hi> should be gathered <hi>on it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that was not all, for<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> on <hi>that</hi> day there <hi>was</hi> none to be found. And might I chuse., I had rather sanctific that day to. God on which I might gather this bread, of God all day long, than set my mind at all upon that in which <hi>no</hi> such bread was to be had.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lords day,</hi> as was said, is to the Christians the principal Manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:48479:73"/>On <hi>this</hi> day, even on it Manna in the morning very early gathered was by the Disciples of our Lord, as newly springing out of the ground. The true bread of God: The sheaf of First-fruits, which is <hi>Christ from the dead,</hi> was ordained to be waved before the Lord on the morrow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Sabbath, the day on which <hi>our Lord ceased from his own OWN Work as God did from HIS,</hi> Levit. 23.</p>
                  <p>Now<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> therefore the Disciples found their green Ears of Corn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! Now they read life, both <hi>IN</hi> and <hi>OUT</hi> of the Sepulchre in which the Lord was laid. Now they could not come together nor speak one to another, but either their Lord was with them, or they had heart-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming tidings from him. <hi>Now</hi> cries one and says, The Lord is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen: And <hi>then</hi> another and says, He hath appeared to such and such.</p>
                  <p>Now comes tidings to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48479:74"/>
that their women was early at the Sepulchre, where they had a Vision of Angels that told them their Lord was risen: Then comes another and says, The Lord is risen indeed. Two also comes from <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maus,</hi> and cries, We have seen the Lord: and by and by, while they yet were speaking, their Lord shews himself in the midst of them.</p>
                  <p>Now he calls to their mind some of the eminent passages of his life, and eats and drinks in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and opens the Scriptures to them: Yea, and opens their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding too, that their hearing might not be unprofitable to them; all which continued from early in the morning till late at night: Oh! what a <hi>Manna-day</hi> was this to the Church. And more than all this you will find, if you read but the four Evangelists upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                  <p>Thus began the day <hi>after</hi> the Sabbath, and <hi>thus</hi> it has continued
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48479:74"/>
thorough all Ages to this very day. Never did the <hi>Seventh-day-sabbath</hi> yield <hi>Manna</hi> to Christians. A <hi>new</hi> world was now begun with the poor Church of God; for so said the Lord of the Sabbath, <hi>Behold, I make all things new.</hi> A <hi>new</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and why not then a <hi>new</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting-day to the Church? or why must the <hi>old</hi> Sabbath be joyned to this <hi>new</hi> Ministration? let him that can shew a reason for it.</p>
                  <p>Christians, if I have not been so large upon things as some might expect; know, that my brevity on this Subject is, from consideration that much needs not be spoken thereto, and because I may have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calion to write a second Part.</p>
                  <p>Christians, beware of being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with Old Testament - Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niserations, left 'by' <hi>one</hi> you be brought into <hi>many</hi> Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
                  <p>I have observed, that though the Jewish Rites have lost their San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48479:75"/>
yet some that are weak in Judgement, do bring themselves into bondage by them. Yea, so high have some been carried as to a pretended Conscience to these, that they have at last proceeded to <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,</hi> to many Wives; and the observation of many bad things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
                  <p>Yea, I have talked with some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to Christianity, who have said, <hi>and affirmed,</hi> as well as they could, that the Jewish Sacrifices must up again.</p>
                  <p>But do you give no heed to these Jewish Fables <hi>That turn from the truth</hi> (<hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 14.) Do you, I say, that love the Lord Jesus, keep close to his Testament, his Word, his Gospel, and observe <hi>HIS Holy-day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this Caution in conclusion I would give, to put stop to this Jewish Ceremony, to wit, That a Seventh-day-Sabbath pursued ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its imposition by Law,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48479:75"/>
(and I know not that it is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Apostles.) leads to bloud and stoning to death those that do but gather Sticks thereon (<hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 32, 33, 34, 35, 36.) A thing which no way becomes the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, that Ministration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and of Righteousness (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.) nor yet the professors thereof (<hi>Luke</hi> 9. 54, 55, 56.)</p>
                  <p>Nor can it with fairness be said, that <hi>that</hi> Sabbath day remains, though the Law thereof is repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. For consident I am, that there is no more ground to make such a conclusion, than there is to say, that Circumcision is still of force, though the Law for cutting of the uncircumcised is by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel made null and void.</p>
                  <p>I told you also in the Epistle, That if the <hi>Fifth</hi> Commandment was the <hi>first</hi> that was with promise; then it follows, that the <hi>Fourth,</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Seventh-day-Sabbath, had no promise intailed to it. Whence
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48479:76"/>
it follows, that where you read in the Prophet of a Promise annexed to a Sabbath, it is best to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it of our <hi>Gospel</hi>-Sabbath, <hi>Isai.</hi> 56.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be asked, <hi>What Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is intailed to our First-day-sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath?</hi> I answer, The bigest of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises. For</p>
                  <p>First, The Resurrection of Christ was tyed by Promise to this day, and to none other. He rose the <hi>Third</hi> day after his death, and that was the <hi>First</hi> day of the week, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording</hi> to what was fore-promised in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> Hos. 6. 1, 2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>Second, That we should live be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God by him, is a Promise to be fulfilled on <hi>this</hi> day; <hi>After two days he will revive us, and in the third day we shall live in his sight,</hi> Hos. 6. 2. See also <hi>Isai.</hi> 26. 19. and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them again with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 4.</p>
                  <p>Third, The great promise of the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48479:76"/>
New Testament, to wit, the pouring out of the Spirit, fixeth upon these days; and so he began in the most wonderful effusion of it upon <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost,</hi> which was the <hi>first day</hi> of the week, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>Nor could these three Promises be fulfilled upon any other days, for that the Scripture had fixed them to the First day of the Week.</p>
                  <p>I am of opinion that these things, though but briefly touched upon, cannot be fairly objected against, however they may be disrelished by some.</p>
                  <p>Nor can I believe, that any part of our Religion, as we are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, stands in <hi>not kindling</hi> of <hi>fires,</hi> and not <hi>seething</hi> of <hi>Victuals,</hi> or in binding of men not to stir out of those places on the Seventh day, in which at the dawning thereof they were found: And yet these are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48479:77"/>
belonging to <hi>that Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-Sabbath,</hi> Exod. 16. 23, 29.</p>
                  <p>Certainly it must needs be an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to impose these things by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority upon New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Believers, our Worship stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>now</hi> in things more weighty, spiritual, and heavenly.</p>
                  <p>Nor can it be proved, as I have hinted before, that this day was, or is to be imposed without those Ordinances, with others in other places mentioned and adjoyned, for the sanction of that day, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made necessary parts of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship that was to be performed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>I have charity for those that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse themselves and their Lord, by their preposterous zeal and affection for the continuing of this day in the Churches. For I conclude, that if they did either believe, or think of the incoherence that this day with its Rites and Ceremonies has with the Ministration of the Spirit
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48479:77"/>
our New Testament-Ministration, they would not so stand in their own light as they do, nor so stifly plead for a place for it in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Gentiles. But as <hi>Paul</hi> insinuates in other cases, there is an aptness in men to be under the law because they do not hear it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>Nor will it out of my mind, but if the Seventh-day-sabbath was by Divine Authority, and to be kept holy by the Churches of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, it should not have so remained among the Jews, Christs deadliest Enemies, and a been kept so much hid from the Believers, his best Friends. For who has retained the pretended sanction of that day from Christs time quite down, in the world, but the Jews; and a few Jewish Gentiles (I will except some.) But, I say, since a Sabbath is that without which the great Worship of God under the Gospel cannot be well performed: How
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48479:78"/>
can it be thought, that it should, as to the knowledge of it, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to so blasphemous a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jews, with whom that worship it not?</p>
                  <p>I will rather conclude, that those Gentile-professors that adhere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, are Jewifi'd, Legaliz'd, and so far gone back from the authority of God, who from such bondages has set his Churches free.</p>
                  <p>I do at this time but hint upon things, reserving a fuller Argument upon them for a time and place more fit; where, and when, I may perhaps also shew, some other wild notions of those that so stifly cleave to this.</p>
                  <p>Mean time, I entreat those who are captivated with this opinion, not to take it ill at my hand that I thus freely speak my mind. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them also to peruse my Book without prejudice to my person. The truth is, one thing that has moved me to this work, is the shame
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48479:78"/>
that has covered the face of my Soul, when I have thought of the Fictions and Fancies that are grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among Professors: And while I see each Fiction turn it self to a Faction, to the loss of that good spirit of Love, and that oneness that formerly was with good men.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not but some unto whom this Book may come, have had seal from God, that the <hi>first day of the week</hi> is to be sanctified by the Church <hi>to Jesus Christ:</hi> Not onely from <hi>his</hi> testimony, which is, and should be, the ground of our Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; but also, for that the first conviction that the Holy Ghost made upon their Consciences, to make them know that they were sinners, began with them <hi>for breaking this Sabbath day;</hi> which day, by that same Spirit, was told them, <hi>was that now called the first day,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> the day before, (and the Holy Ghost doth not use to begin this work with a lye) which first conviction
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48479:79"/>
the Spirit has followed so close, with other things tending to compleat the same work, that the Soul from so good a beginning could not <hi>res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
