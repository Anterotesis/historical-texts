            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER From A FREEHOLDER OF BUCKINGHAMSHIRE TO A FRIEND in LONDON, CONCERNING The Election OF THE KNIGHTS of the said COUNTY.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have received yours, containing a very necessary and reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Request, whereunto I readily return you this plain and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Account following.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Writ</hi> being delivered to the <hi>under-Sheriff,</hi> the beginning of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>August,</hi> notice was given by <hi>Proclamation</hi> throughout the whole County, that the Election for Knights of the Shire for the County of <hi>Bucks,</hi> should be the <hi>twentieth of the said Month at</hi> Alisbury.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding this Legal Appointment the <hi>HIGH SHERIFF</hi> a few daies before the Election, sends his Orders to all the Bailiffs of the several Hundreds to this purpose, <hi>That for several weighty Reasons him thereunto moving,</hi> he intended to adjourn the Court, which was to be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60899:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
holden at <hi>Alisbury</hi> on <hi>Wednesday</hi> the twentieth, to be held at <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> on <hi>Thursday</hi> the 21th. at eight of the Clock in the Morning.</p>
            <p>But the major part of the Bailiffs thought it illegal, that after Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation made according to Law, the High Sheriff should order another time and place, and therefore did not give notice, so that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the <hi>Gentry and Freeholders of the County met at</hi> Alisbury, <hi>and at</hi> Buckingham there was only the High Sheriff Sir <hi>Timber T.</hi> with a very small number of their Faction: And at night by order of the Bailiff the Drums were beaten, which got together about twenty or thirty Boys, that cryed about the Town, A <hi>Sir Anthony C. and a Sir Ralph V.</hi> the latter of which had his name used without his consent or knowledge; But Mr. <hi>Wharton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hamden</hi> that stood for Knights of the Shire, accompanied with a very great number of Horse, came into <hi>Alisbury</hi> upon the aforesaid <hi>Wednesday</hi> about seven of the Clock in the Morning, and were informed that the Sheriff had been there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and had adjourned the Court, to be held at <hi>Buckingham</hi> the next Morning by eight of the Clock.</p>
            <p>Whereupon Mr. <hi>Wharton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hamden,</hi> with several Gentlemen lately Elected to serve in Parliament, and the rest of the Gentlemen of the County attended <hi>His Grace the Duke of Buckingham,</hi> who was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to honour them with his presence at the Election; and there they debated what was then fit to be done. And it was unanimously agreed, that though they must go to Elect at <hi>Buckingham,</hi> they would neither lye there, nor spend one penny in the place, lest they should be thought to encourage a Town that had so lately made so bad a Choice: And likewise to shew their resentment to that <hi>ill-bred Carriers Son</hi> (the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Sheriff) for so high an affront to the whole County to make them go (unnecessarily) <hi>Twelve long Miles</hi> cross the County in a very rainy day. The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> being desired by the Gentlemen of the County to acquaint the Freeholders with what they had resolved upon, we were drawn out into the Field, and there his Grace acquainted us with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions, and further desired, that we would return into <hi>Alisbury</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh our selves, and be ready by two of the Clock that we might go to <hi>Winslow</hi> in one entire Body (a Town within five miles of <hi>Buckingham</hi>) and promised that there should be Waggons provided for those that were on foot, and unable to go so far. And if the Town of <hi>Winslow</hi> were unable to receive them, His Grace, and my Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> and all the Gentlemen would keep together with them in the Field all night, resolving to <hi>fare all alike, which was answered with great shouts, crying out, One and All, One and Alls,</hi> not only to <hi>Buckingham,</hi> but from
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60899:2"/>
Hundred to Hundred round the County: <hi>Nay, were <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t to York rather than lose our former Members that served us faithfully in the last Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then we returned into <hi>Alisbury</hi> to refresh our selves, and between two and three of the Clock we marched out with about <hi>four thousand Horse, with Drums beating, and Trumpets sounding, Led by His Grace the Duke of Buckingham.</hi> Our Foot and Waggons being gone before, and in very good Order, and time, we came to <hi>Winslow,</hi> and were well satisfied with the mean Accommodation we met with, <hi>Every man chearfully beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About five next Morning His <hi>Grace</hi> mounted, and in the same Order we marched towards <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and in the way there joyned to us <hi>two thousand Horse</hi> more, which came from several parts of the County, all crying out, <hi>A WHARTON AND A HAMDEN</hi>: And thus we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued marching to the Town of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> where those that were on foot, and those that were in the Waggons stood ready to joyn with us; and thus we went through <hi>Buckingham</hi> into a great Field beyond the Town, crying out all the way, <hi>No Timber T. No Traitors Son, No Pensioner, No Papist, No Betrayers of their Country.</hi> And as soon as we were come into the Field, the under-Sheriff, with Mr. <hi>Wharton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hamden,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with several Gentlemen and Freeholders returned into <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and waited till eight of the Clock expecting the Sheriff, but he not coming, the under-Sheriff adjourned the Court into the Field.</p>
            <p>In the mean time His <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and several other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, drew the Horse up into several Troops, which pleaaed the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, and we marched in very good Order to the top of the Hill.</p>
            <p>The under-Sheriff being then returned, the Writ was opened and read. And there we proceeded to the Election, where Mr. <hi>Wharton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hamden</hi> were chosen without the least opposition, and Mr. <hi>Wharton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hamden</hi> were thereupon proclaimed, <hi>duly Elected Knights of the Shire for the County of Bucks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whilst the under-Sheriff went to prepare their Indentures, the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff with Sir <hi>Timber T. &amp;c.</hi> some of the Clergy came into the Town.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Sheriff</hi> hearing a PARSON cry out, <hi>A Wharton, A Hamden,</hi> was so transported with Zeal for the <hi>Catholick Cause,</hi> that he rode up and struck him with his Whip over the Face; the Gentleman apprehending this high Affront to be too great to be born by an English Spirit, and one of <hi>his Coat,</hi> he <hi>Cockt</hi> his <hi>Beaver,</hi> clapt <hi>Spurs to his Horse,</hi> rode up and smote the <hi>Carriers Son</hi> with so great a fury, that in the Rancounter the <hi>Sheriff fell</hi> from his Horse, and had like to have <hi>broke his Neck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although this might have been a sufficient warning to a <hi>wise man,</hi> they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60899:3"/>
had no sooner got him into a House, but he sent his Son to put a further Affront upon the County.</p>
            <p>The Young man comes into the Field just as the Indentures were sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and first he <hi>joyes Mr. Wharton</hi> of being <hi>Elected,</hi> and at the same instance demands a Poll. But being asked by the Gentlemen for whom he demanded it, he scornfully replyed, for whom he pleased, refusing to name any particular person: But being rebuked by the Gentlemen, saying, <hi>Young man, go home, and learn your Lesson better</hi>; upon which we gave a <hi>great Shout,</hi> and he, poor Lad, ashamed of his folly, rode away.</p>
            <p>But several of the Freeholders rode after him, and whipt him out of the Field into the Town; although he denyed to some, and often ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pardon to others of what he had said.</p>
            <p>The Indentures being signed and sealed, we marched back in good Order through <hi>Buckingham,</hi> all crying out as before, <hi>No Timber T. No Traitors Son, No Pensioner, &amp;c.</hi> without making any stop, or any manner of <hi>Expence in the Town</hi>: Part of our Company went to <hi>Winslow,</hi> and the rest to <hi>Alisbury,</hi> to refresh our selves, and so every man to his own home.</p>
            <p>Thus Sir, I have given you a short and true Accompt of our proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and it was very pleasant to me to see <hi>six thousand Horse</hi> in so small a County, every man able to bear his own Charges; <hi>And I hope the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Gentry and Freeholders throughout the Kingdom, will be ready on all occasions to give the like Encouragement</hi>; and then I doubt not but all the Freeholders in <hi>England</hi> will be united as one man against Popery, and Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and follow the Example of these brave English Spirits of <hi>Buckinghamshire.</hi>
