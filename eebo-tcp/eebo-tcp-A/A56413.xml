            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Stand not up in my own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar behalfe, but in the universall and generall name of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; Alas, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> they depend all upon our exemplary Iustice, which if we doe fully execute, will not onely give great and plenary satisfaction to our Nation,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96507:3"/>
but will likwise cause the Land to smile here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after with the blessed beames of prosperous felicitie: but if the least errour and smalest deliration be over-seene by us (oh! it strikes my trembling minde with horrour to thinke on it) how will all things precipitate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into ruine most irrevocable, but I speake not this as if any here would omit or extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the supremacy of Iustice in the least thought: to admonish you of that point, were to bid the Moone keepe her monethly course, the Spheares to reduce themselves in their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, Or the Sunne to shine upon the earth: but I speake this onely to adde a spurre unto you, least we should at any time languish in our heav'n-proceeding Iurney. The cries of the people have come up unto me, the voyce of the whole Nation tingles in my eares; and me thinkes I heare each subject wish that wee would briefely establish the Church Covern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with all expidition. Let us first begin to confirme our Religion, and God will blesse our other proceedings the better: that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes my opinion, and I am sure the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole kingdome; How long have we set here, and how little have wee ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected?
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96507:3"/>
How much time have we consumed, and what little have wee performed herein: How long have we laboured in this our dayly travell, and as yet have brought forth but an <hi>Embryo,</hi> in what we did intend? Tis true, I confesse, we have fomented our selves with dayly troubles &amp; vexations, and bin very solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous for the welfare of the Common-wealth, but what have we performed? or what have we perfected. I will once more relate what my former opinion was, let us (I say) begin in the reall establishment of our Religion, and (as I said) all our other determinations will succeede with a better <hi>Omen</hi>; for indeede most of our Delinquents are linkt to this chaine, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend most on this point, therefore we should doe well to enter speedily upon the Work. <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> excuse my zeale in this case; for my mouth cannot imprison what my minde intends to let out, neether can my tongue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale that which my heart desires to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulge. Behold, the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> (that great Incendiary, of this Kingdome) lyes now like a fire-brand rak'd up in the Embers, but if he ever chance to blaze againe, I am afraid, what heretofore he had but in a sparke, he will <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96507:4"/>
burne downe to the ground in a full flame. Wherefore Mr. <hi>Sheaker,</hi> let us begin, for the Kingdome is pregnant with expectation in this point. I confesse there are many more Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, for the Iudges and other Knights walke in <hi>Quirpo,</hi> but they, are but thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts forg'd in <hi>Canterburies</hi> fire: Looke upon them all with an impartiall eye, and you will finde them all but as poluted rivers flowing from that corrupt fountaine. Well? is it so then, that all depend on Religion? why are we then so backward in not Reforming the Church? why do we stike in this point, and not rather proceede in it with all expedition? For indeede, according to the Lawes of this <hi>Kingdome,</hi> as it hath the dignity of preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, so let us give it the priority in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> thinke with your selfe, I pray, in what faction the Church is now, in what Schisme, in what confusion of distracted Sectaries it is promiscuously shaken: Behold the <hi>Papists</hi> will have their way the <hi>Brownists</hi> will have their way, the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> their way, the <hi>Puritan</hi> (as some call them) their way, the <hi>Iesuiticall Priests</hi> their way; and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96507:4"/>
in these various wayes they make such a laba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynth of Religion, that few or none scarce can finde out the right way. It behoves us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and is expedient that we should adde a period to these irregular wayes, that the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar may no longer wander ill in these destra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted parts. <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> I have now unloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my mind of her weary burthen, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you digest my words with your serious considerations in this respect of establishing the Church-Government, in true, sinceere, perfect, and unpoluted Religion; which if we doe performe, and fully effect, wee shall doe great Honour to God, get great credit to our selves, and give great satisfaction to the whole Kingdome.</p>
            <p>This is my Opinion, this is my Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this is my Prayer; and lastly, this is my Hope.</p>
