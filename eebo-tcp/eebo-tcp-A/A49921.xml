            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>MAN,</hi> as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> saith, <hi>is born to Labour as the sparks fly upwards:</hi> That ought not to be thought so hard a case to any, which is no more strange than for the flame to ascend, nor less natural than for the <hi>Young Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to soar aloft,</hi> as some Interpreters read it. Yet tho' Labour or Trouble is so natural to Mankind, so familiar and engrafted into his Constitution; the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of such is so small as do either right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>understand,</hi> or do <hi>bear</hi> it as they ought, as is most deplorable to consider, and as challenges all that can be done toward the Cure of so General an Evil. I doubt not but there are several holy Souls who do both <hi>understand</hi> and <hi>bear</hi> This, as they are obliged to do; and are thereby, thro' God's Blessing, arrived to very great Heights of Religion: These stand not in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105989:3"/>
need of any thing that I can say to them. But to others perhaps it may, by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Assistance, prove of some service, to give them a few Hints of what they ought to consider, and practise in their daily Employ and Work. May the most good God bless this poor Endeavor of his unworthy Servant, to the end by it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed.</p>
            <p>Labour may be considered, either first as a <hi>Punishment</hi> inflicted; or secondly, as an Act of <hi>Religious Worship</hi> enjoyned by God. In the former respect, it is the <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> in the latter, the <hi>Remedy</hi> of Sin. And in both respects, it will not fail to give several useful Considerations: Such as follow.</p>
            <p>First: Labour, (as it is accompanied Now with much Weariness and Toil,) ought to be look'd on as a <hi>Punishment,</hi> or <hi>Corporal Chastisement,</hi> inflicted for our Transgression. God, who infinitely hates Sin, and is of purer Eyes than to behold the least Iniquity, could not but denounce the Doom of this <hi>Monster,</hi> as soon as ever it appear'd in the World. I say, <hi>Denounce the Doom,</hi> for I tell thee, O Man, he did no more. <hi>Accuse</hi> not <hi>God, flatter</hi> not <hi>thy self</hi>; Sin was the fatally fruitful <hi>Womb</hi> that brought forth every Evil into the World; the deadly <hi>Poison</hi> that blasted the Earth, and the baneful <hi>Seed</hi> of every
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105989:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Briar and Thorn in Human Life. Nay, had not the Divine <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately broke forth, as thro' a <hi>cloud,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter such a <hi>monstrous</hi> Birth: had not the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the Father then interposed as our Mediator, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner so astonishing, as to make the Wonder of Men and Angels for everlasting Ages; Man, whose Vitals were already seiz'd by this corroding Venom, who had begat and form'd in himself the <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> I am verily perswaded, could not have subsisted one minute lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but must certainly have <hi>died the Death</hi> without further delay, and have fallen into an irrecoverable Abyss of <hi>Darkness</hi> and <hi>Pain.</hi> But being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triev'd and rescu'd from the fatal stroke, by the means of our great and ever blessed Mediator; it being not only very <hi>fit,</hi> but also <hi>necessary</hi> for us to concur <hi>in some degree</hi> toward our recovery from this <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> state, into that <hi>Happy</hi> one, for which we were originally designed by our boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Creator and Father; It was judg'd meet by the same eternal Wisdom and Love, that then put a stop to the final Destruction of Man, that so much of the Effects of his Crime should remain upon him, a lasting Monument, as might be able to put him in mind of the Place whence he fell, as might push him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105989:4"/>
to seek earnestly his Delivery from this Place into which he is faln, from this State into which he has driven himself, and might be a constant Caution to him for the future, that he lose not the Effects of this <hi>Mediation,</hi> but endeavour, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming himself to the Divine Will, to render himself as capable as he <hi>can</hi> of those glorious Privileges, which by the means of it he may <hi>now</hi> attain. Thus was the heavy and intolerable Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin exchanged for an easy and very tolerable Doom. Now, Man is put into a state of Trial once more, into a capacity to chuse whether he will be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py or miserable: The Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is promis'd to bruise the Head of the Serpent; but withal, the Woman must be content to undergo <hi>pain</hi> and subjection; and the Man having by his folly brought a <hi>Curse</hi> upon the <hi>Earth,</hi> of which he was constituted Lord, must be content to eat his Bread <hi>in sorrow,</hi> and <hi>in the sweat of his brow.</hi> For <hi>now</hi> by <hi>Sin great Travel</hi> (as the wise Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> saith) <hi>is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for every man, and an heavy yoke is upon the sons of</hi> Adam; <hi>from the day that they go out of their mother's womb, till the day that they return to the mother of all things.</hi> The consequences that follow from this Consideration of Labour as an Infliction for, or as an Evil flowing from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105989:4"/>
Sin, ought I think at least to be these three.</p>
            <p>§. First, Since therefore <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> the Seed of the Woman, the Mediator betwixt God and Man, undertook to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Pardon and Restauration of Man on this condition, That Man should with Him tast of the Bitterness of Sin: Wilt thou, O Man, that callest thy self a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, refuse to satisfy this Condition? Dost thou think it hard to tast of the same Cup, to bear a little of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement with thy Saviour, who has sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to so very much for thee? God was graciously pleas'd to chuse Labour and Travel for this Chastisement, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out satisfying which, thou must never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to obtain thy Pardon. Indeed if thou hast no need of this, thou mayest e'en then follow thy own Ease, as thou pleasest, walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes, and trample on any Condition that brings with it the least pain: But if thou art otherwise perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as I doubt not but thou art, then submit contentedly to this Correction, and think not thy self too good for a little Toil or Labour, that is the <hi>Effect</hi> of thy Guilt, and is become by the Grace of God an <hi>Instrument</hi> in thy Release.</p>
            <p>§. Secondly, Since God was so very mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful toward his offending Creature, as for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105989:5"/>
all the Punishment of his Crimes to take no more but a <hi>Moderate Labour</hi> for a <hi>short</hi> time, that so he might afterward <hi>rest</hi> with his God, and be advanced to a nobler state of Bliss and Honour, than even that which he had lost by the most vile and sottish Rebellion: It behoves him not only with <hi>Contentedness</hi> to submit to this light Chastisement; but also with the humblest <hi>Thanks</hi> to praise the Mildness and Indulgence of his kind Father, that has made it so easy, for him to undergo; but especially for this that he has been pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to produce Hony from Bitterness, and to make Sorrow and Labour instrumental to Joy and Rest. Consider whether any thing could more deeply concern the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Creator, than to be frustrated of his End in his darling and most belov'd Creature, to see his Love despis'd, his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour spoil'd, and his Image defac'd; to see his Benefits slighted and abused, all Obligations trampled on, and the most necessary, sacred and lovely Law in the World, broken by his ungrateful Child: Consider all this, and tell me if thou canst, what is there that could move him in the least, to mitigate a Punishment, which was not only enhanced by so many provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but was by his rebellious Creature violently pull'd on himself? Could it be any thing beside Infinite Mercy? Was
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105989:5"/>
there any thing to move him, but his own essential infinite Goodness, which after such liberal Effects of it had been so base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undervalued. It has been said by some Persons very piously, That <hi>it were better that the whole World should be annihilated, than a Sin commited.</hi> For, say they, the World may be created again with ease, and all that is in it be repair'd with the Breath of his Word: But a Sin once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, can never be undone, but will appear in its place throughout all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. If Sin therefore be so great an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, so strange a Monster, something that I know not how to name, so infinitely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to the Divine Purity, and if it cost more to hinder its Effect, than to create a World, as nothing is more certain than it doth; consider, I pray good Christian, whether thou hast not the highest reason to be thankful, in that the Burthen im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on thee, is no heavier; which, had it not been lightn'd, would most infallibly have press'd thee down into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less-pit. Well, I hope thou art suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently sensible of this. But this is not all: For,</p>
            <p>§. Thirdly, Since God has been so good, as not only to moderate the Punishment of sin to Man, but even to condescend to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it, when dutifully underwent, as a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for the greatest Enjoyments; it is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105989:6"/>
not enough for thee to be Thankful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less also thou endeavour to undergo it in such a manner as shall be most serviceable, and best answer such his gracious Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. When ever therefore thou findest thy self wearied and opprest with Labour, this ought to put thee in mind that thou art not to take up thy Habitation here, but to look for one where Care and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour never enter; and where thou mayest safely say to thy Soul, <hi>Here take thy Rest.</hi> Let every Uneasiness in Labour teach thee to <hi>wean off</hi> thy Affections from the Body, hinder the Distractions of thy Soul, and bring her <hi>nearer</hi> to her God. Then will this light Punishment which endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but for a moment, work for thee a more weighty and lasting Crown of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Then will this Ordinary, but truly <hi>wholsom</hi> Penance, having daily more and more estranged thee from the love of the Flesh, and taught thee by inward Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the midst of thy Business, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse in thy Spirit with Him who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways no less present to it, than thou art to thy self, thereby prepare for thee a far more exceeding weight of Joy: which he cannot fail to give to as many as make a right use of their Labours; considering them as the <hi>Consequences,</hi> and <hi>Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of their sinful Deformity. And by this means is the <hi>Evil</hi> of Sin converted
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105989:6"/>
into its <hi>Remedy</hi>; the remaining <hi>Venom</hi> of the Serpent into a very good <hi>Antidote</hi> or <hi>Treacle</hi>; and a <hi>Punishment</hi> suffer'd for <hi>Crimes</hi> into an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi> Which is the other, and more <hi>lovely</hi> Face, under which it comes now to be consider'd.</p>
            <p>IN the Second place it ought with all diligence to be remember'd, That Labour ought not so much to be look'd on as a Penalty for our Transgression; but much rather as an Act of Religious Worship: and the former only in order to this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For Labour is indeed, with respect to Man, one of the first and most <hi>essential</hi> Worships of God, of all I mean not <hi>pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Spiritual, when it is perform'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God's Design and Institution. It doth not appear that He ever enjoyned or instituted any other external Worship, Rite, or Ceremony, than this for above two thousand years in the World. Now every outward Worship, or Religious Rite, being for no other end than to <hi>recollect</hi> the Soul into <hi>Inward</hi> Acts of Adoration, Love and Obedience; and to <hi>call</hi> her <hi>back</hi> to God, even by those very means which of themselves would be apt to <hi>withdraw</hi> and <hi>distract</hi> her from Him. It cannot be otherwise, but that those external parts of Worship, or Religious Rites, which are <hi>instituted</hi> by God <hi>himself</hi> as long as they <hi>continue</hi> so, must have something in them
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105989:7"/>
proper to recal the Soul of Man into such inward Acts (wherein the Spirit, the Soul, and the Life of all Religion consists) after a <hi>wiser</hi> and <hi>more excellent</hi> manner than any other, which either <hi>are,</hi> or <hi>can</hi> be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd by any <hi>meaner</hi> Authority, or <hi>lesser</hi> Wisdom. And this they do several ways: First, by Consideration that they are of <hi>immediate Divine</hi> Appointment. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, By the <hi>Mortification</hi> of the <hi>Body.</hi> Thirdly, By that <hi>Instruction,</hi> that is contain'd or <hi>vail'd</hi> under them. And fourthly, By the <hi>Divine Blessing,</hi> which never fails to <hi>concur with,</hi> and to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd by</hi> them, as often as they are rightly us'd. All this, I think, is plain, as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently in <hi>Circumcision</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices:</hi> so, at present, in <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. But what can be more evident, dear Christian, than that bodily Labour doth, in its right use, most nobly recal thy Soul to God by all these ways? For how, O Man, canst thou forget, whilst thou workest with thy hands, the Word of thy God, That <hi>in the Sweat of thy face shalt thou eat Bread</hi>? Or how canst thou forbear, being in this manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly admonish'd of the Evil and Misery of <hi>Disobedience,</hi> to <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> thy God as thou oughtest? Tell me, how canst thou, being thus engag'd to this <hi>Bodyly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105989:7"/>
Exercise,</hi> forget to mortify and tame thy proud <hi>Flesh,</hi> that thy <hi>Soul</hi> may be more at liberty to admit the <hi>inward</hi> workings of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> upon her? Or art thou in the <hi>next</hi> place so blind, as not to see the <hi>Instruction</hi> contain'd under this Primitive Establishment of thy good God? Canst thou be content thus to toil and sweat, for a little <hi>Bodily</hi> Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that by this thou mayest sustain a <hi>few</hi> years, at the best, a <hi>toilsom</hi> and a <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable</hi> Life? and art thou not content to to take as much pains to feed thy self with that Food, which infinitely more surpasses the richest dishes and Cates of Palaces, than they do thy brown Bread; to gain thereby, as soon as the Work is done, which cannot last long, for all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity a most <hi>delightful</hi> and <hi>happy</hi> Life? Canst thou do all this, my Friend, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide thy self, or thy Family, with a little <hi>perishing</hi> Food, and do so very little to get either for thy self, or them, that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Manna,</hi> which is <hi>incorruptible,</hi> and which deserves a thousand, nay a million of times, more than all that thou canst ever do? Let this, I pray, be seriously consider'd; that so the <hi>Instruction</hi> may not be <hi>lost</hi> which is contain'd under this <hi>Outward Institution,</hi> nor the Designs of God in it <hi>frustrated</hi> and made <hi>void.</hi> So by this means thou shalt be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105989:8"/>
a most essential and most acceptable piece of Service to the Author of thy <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and thy <hi>Happiness.</hi> Nor is there the least glimpse of Reason for thee to doubt, in the last place, as if he would ever fail to send his Blessing along with it, as often as it is thus perform'd according to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. For which purpose, it will be fit to keep in thy mind those <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>righteous Designs</hi> of His, for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee back to Himself, by an Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so unpleasant in it self. These <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs</hi> thou wilt find to be such as these, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">§. I. First, Bodily Labour was institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the most wise and just God, and commanded Man to the end, to bring forth in him, a constant <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> to his Commands. Since therefore, whoever thou art, that God has <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> thee to work, do thou learn hereby continually, and on every occasion chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to <hi>submit</hi> thy self to the Orders of his Divine Majesty, and resolutely <hi>obey</hi> all his Precepts; as being assured that this was the main End for which he was pleas'd to impose so seemingly an hard Command.</p>
            <p n="2">§. II. Secondly, Bodily Labour was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted for Man in his faln Estate, by the same most wise and just God, that his proud and haughty Heart might be <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:105989:8"/>
by mean and vile things. Nothing can fit the Soul for the Receiving <hi>light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som</hi> and <hi>comfortable</hi> Influxes of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side <hi>Humility</hi>; as nothing more widely withdraws her <hi>from him,</hi> and tumbles her into <hi>Darkness</hi> and <hi>Grief</hi>; then <hi>Pride,</hi> that loathsom Monster, which first threw Man out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> and now continues to barr the way back. Art thou not happy, O Christian, that thou art farther than a great many others remov'd from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Attaques of this foul Fiend<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> if thou art wise, thou wilt think so, and thank God. I hope at least thou art wiser, than to wish after that, which in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood would be a Serpent in thy Bosom, would secretly sting thee to death, and then cast thee into such a state, as I am perswaded thou canst not think on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shaking. Nothing indeed naturally more conduces to the beating down and Conquering the proud Heart of Man, than Affliction and Labour; nothing can be found out a more sensible sign of his Meanness and Necessitous condition than this: And let me tell thee, my dear Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that if this has its proper effect on thee, thou art a great deal more Happy, than if thou worest a Crown, and didst enjoy all earthly Happiness. For if the Great Persons of the World do undergo less trouble and pains than thee, which too

I very much doubt, I am sure their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and Enjoyments are far more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than thy most painful Labours. By them they have only so much the more to resist, and conquer than thou hast. What thinkest thou, canst thou envy them this? No sure. Say rather in thy self,
<q>I thank thee, O Heavenly Father, that thou hast plac'd me in this State, in which its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for me by the sweat of my Brow to gain my Bread; and that I am not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to those great Dangers and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations with those above me, which would most likely have overpower'd me, and lifted me up against thee, my kind Benefactor; since I am so little able at this distance from them, to repress and conquer this proud Heart of mine. Do thou, O my Father, break it: do what thou wilt, so it be broken and <hi>humbled,</hi> and fit to receive Thee, my <hi>Love,</hi> my <hi>Light</hi> and my <hi>Ioy.</hi> O let me ever chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully submit to thy Dispensation, and never call that hard, which Thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est best for calling me to Thee.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">§. III. Thirdly, As soon as the Heart of Man was turn'd away from God by <hi>Pride,</hi> there presently crept into it a <hi>slothful</hi> Disposition, strongly inclining it to the love of <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>sensible Pleasure.</hi> Now it being no less necessary to mortify this, than the former: God who is wise,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105989:10"/>
and good, and just in all his Institutions, ordain'd Labor for Man, that by the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of his Sloath, Ease and Pleasure, he might be brought to have a due value for what he had lost; and to labour after that <hi>Rest</hi> and <hi>Delight,</hi> that are only capable to satisfie a Creature of Original so <hi>noble,</hi> and of Desires so <hi>boundless.</hi> The Mischiefs that <hi>Sloath</hi> and <hi>Ease</hi> bring both to Soul and Body, are so very Many, and so very Great, as but to hint at them, would take up a large Discourse; of which I doubt not but thy own Experience may afford plenty of miserable Instances e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. As if it were indeed true in the most literal sense; That the Working and Industrious Person is exposed only to <hi>one,</hi> but the Lazy and the Sloathful to <hi>all</hi> the Devils in Hell. Nor are those which proceed from the <hi>Pleasures</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> either fewer, or less considerable. Thou may'st be certain of this, that thou hast not made the least step to <hi>true</hi> Happiness, unless thou art fully convinced that thou art not otherwise <hi>capable</hi> to relish those noble and exalted <hi>Pleasures</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which thy good Father invites thee to <hi>partake of,</hi> than according to the measure that thou art <hi>withdrawn</hi> from those mean and ignoble ones of the <hi>Flesh.</hi> Tell me therefore, O my Friend, hast thou not reason to thank this kind Father of thine,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105989:11"/>
that he hath put thee in a State, in which thou hast so much less to do toward the subduing, and bringing under the Body to the Spirit, than many others of his Children. Let me tell thee, thou art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible, if thou dost not bless him: I hope thou dost with all thy Heart: But if (which God forbid) thou dost hanker af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Onions and Garlick of <hi>Egypt</hi>; then I would have thee e'en fairly set down, and never expect to enter the <hi>Promis'd</hi> Land, flowing with Milk and Hony. Well, but I will hope better things, as that thou wilt endeavor with all thy might to destroy this silly hankering, and so fit thy self for an Admission to those <hi>pure</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, that are prepared for <hi>refined</hi> Souls.</p>
            <p n="4">§. IV. Fourthly, As Man, who in his Original State was but a little lower than the Angels, and stood not in need of any thing, having all his desires abundantly satisfied, as long as they stood, in the <hi>first</hi> place, directed toward God; became through <hi>sin,</hi> a <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>needy</hi> Creature: This God in his Wisdom and Goodness, thought fit to appoint a Rule, whereby to <hi>releive</hi> the Poverty, and <hi>succor</hi> the needs of this miserable Creature, and thereby <hi>bring</hi> him <hi>back</hi> to Himself. Thou oughtest therefore to remember, O Man, that in Conformity to this Rule, thou art obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not only to exercise an Act of <hi>Charity</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:105989:11"/>
toward thy <hi>Own self,</hi> by seeking to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve thy Life, for the sake and love of God, and out of a sense of his righteous Law; but also for the same love of God, to work for those of thy <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> that are <hi>not able</hi> to work them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or who cannot sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their <hi>Necessities.</hi> But if thou dost this in the first place for thy <hi>own,</hi> or for <hi>their</hi> sake, be not so miserably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, as to think thy self a <hi>Christian:</hi> without this <hi>Charity</hi>; a dead Corps is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as much a <hi>Man,</hi> as thou art a <hi>Christian.</hi> Believe me, this <hi>Selfish</hi> Love is the very Root and Principle of <hi>Hell</hi> Within thee; and only so far as thou <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiest</hi> and <hi>killest</hi> this, canst thou be said to have any <hi>Life</hi> with respect to <hi>God,</hi> or to enjoy any share of the <hi>Divine</hi> Image and Life, which is the sole Root and Principle of <hi>Everlasting Ioy.</hi> Think, my dear Friend, what manner of Charity it is, which I thus commend to thee, as the <hi>Office</hi> of thy Labour, and as what will most certainly be requir'd at thy hands.</p>
            <p n="5">§. V. Fifthly, As Man, who in his Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive State of Innocence, was not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from all Need, but also freed from every Violence and Grief, so that it was not possible for any thing <hi>without him,</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compose or disorder him in the least, or to bring to him but never so litle sorrow
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105989:12"/>
or pain; became thro' Sin not only a Poor and Indigent, but also an <hi>Afflicted</hi> and <hi>Calamitous</hi> Creature, expos'd to the rude Attaques of every thing <hi>Without him:</hi> the most wise and Merciful God, was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously pleas'd to appoint a Rule for his Rebellious Child, whereby he might be taught by <hi>suffering,</hi> in some small mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, the sad <hi>effects</hi> of his Crime, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the State whence he is fall'n, to reflect on the most ugly loathsomness of Sin, to consider and put to heart its wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and dire attendance; and so leaving the husks and the draff of impure Swine, to return to <hi>Him,</hi> whom he had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise forgotten, who will not fail to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, and entertain with the most Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate Expressions of his Love; This <hi>Son</hi> that <hi>was dead, and is alive again; that was lost, and is found. Luk. c.</hi> XV. <hi>v.</hi> 32. Consider this <hi>End</hi> of thy Labour, and be wise: Consider betimes. There is not a Maxim, that I can find, of greater Truth, or more worthy of the most serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of every one, than this, That <hi>All things faln into a corruptible state, are to be restored, and perfected by suffering.</hi> Think, and think again on this; for 'tis a Truth as of great <hi>Evidence,</hi> so of great <hi>Extent:</hi> 'tis that in which even the most profound Philosophers, and the most learned Divines may lose themselves:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105989:12"/>
And yet this is that which thou mayest easily reach, and I hope thou dost render familiar to thy self. Canst thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that God has plac'd thee in the <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Patience:</hi> many righteous Souls have rejoiced for this same. Be of good courage, I say; never repine at a little hardship, but rather <hi>thank</hi> thy good God for taking such a Method to <hi>cure</hi> thee, and <hi>draw</hi> thee to Himself. As well may a Body, that has all its Limbs disjointed, or broken into splinters, be set aright a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and be made as sound as at first without <hi>pain</hi>; or one that groans under the most heavy and tormenting pangs of the most cruel Distemper, or has his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses numm'd, or his Faculties doz'd in a cold and clammy sleep, be restored to his perfect <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Health,</hi> without <hi>bearing</hi> or <hi>feeling</hi> any thing: as a Soul that is put into disorder, and, as it were, disjointed thro' Folly, or sick and diseas'd thro' Sin, be restored to its perfect <hi>sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> that refuses to <hi>endure</hi> any <hi>Pain</hi> in a <hi>change</hi> which is so <hi>much more</hi> considerable. Nothing is more reasonable, just and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, than to bear with a <hi>bitter</hi> Potion, without taking which it's impossible to be ever <hi>cured.</hi> But dost thou think this a <hi>distastful</hi> Virtue to <hi>suffer</hi> in <hi>Patience</hi>? if thou dost, thou thy self hast made it <hi>so:</hi> it receives only <hi>Bitterness</hi> from Sin;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105989:13"/>
but Life and Beauty from God. Which must be acknowledg'd by all, to be very extraordinary and lovely. So much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as in this one syllable, <hi>Bear,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd no less than one half of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest Philosophy that ever enrich'd Mankind; and I am much mistaken if it make a less figure, in the Religion of a <hi>Suffering</hi> Saviour.</p>
            <p n="6">§. VI. Sixthly, Had Man, who thro' Sin was become an Afflicted and Calamitous Creature, and was therefore by God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the Lesson of Patience, which he was directed to learn from hard La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and from the Curse on the Earth; been hereby exposed to such Pains on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as did <hi>necessarily</hi> spring from the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order</hi> of the World, perhaps it would have been no such hard matter to a <hi>strong</hi> Constitution to have born them. But to ly open to all the Injuries and hard usages of those of <hi>our</hi> kind, who are as bad, or worse than our selves; this seems to be a task of far greater difficulty, and yet of no less necessity: Wherefore the most wise and just God instituted and commanded the Exercise of Bodily La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for this farther end, that the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being <hi>not</hi> pamper'd by Luxury or Ease, Man might be able by such a <hi>pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> subduing them, not to take any notice of those many Causes of Anger and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105989:13"/>
Distast, that continually offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but <hi>wholly</hi> to <hi>surrender</hi> himself to the Righteous <hi>Iudge</hi> of the World; make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Breast a Sanctuary of Peace, while both his <hi>Body</hi> and his <hi>Mind</hi> are so em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd for him, that he has not <hi>while</hi> to be disturb'd, or concern'd with the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders</hi> or <hi>Follies</hi> of <hi>other</hi> people. There are not lacking Examples of more than a few, who to learn this Excellent Virtue, have chosen to submit themselves to <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi> Offices and <hi>base</hi> Emploiments, from which by their Estates they have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emted. Is this which was in them a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension,</hi> in thee a Necessity? Consider whether it be not easier for thee, than for them; and whether thou hast not a greater Obligation, by such a Mastery over thy self, to obtain that blessed <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of Spirit, which will make thee to triumph over all the <hi>Injuries</hi> and <hi>Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi> that is in the power of Man to offer; prepare for thee perpetual <hi>Victories</hi>; fit thee for the Temple of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; and make thee able to enjoy, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all Disturbances, the Blessings of the Heaven above, and of the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath. Whereas the Passionate and Rageful are utterly uncapable of enjoying either: but <hi>Blessed are the Meek, for they shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Earth</hi>; and pass from <hi>this</hi> Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance to a <hi>better,</hi> into which our ever
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105989:14"/>
Blessed Fore-runner is thro' <hi>Meekness</hi> and Long-suffering arriv'd, and <hi>Set down at the right hand of God,</hi> giving us an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> that we might follow <hi>his Steps; and find Rest unto our Souls. Matth.</hi> XI.29.</p>
            <p n="7">§. VII. The proud heart of Man is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally carry'd to murmur and repine, if it meet with any Uneasiness; hankers after Greatness and Ease; greedily seeks for Riches, and envies them in another; all which being Dispositions directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that Serenity and Sobriety of Mind, which is absolutely necessary, to make it capable of any real Happiness; it pleas'd our good God to impose a Rule and Task on our <hi>Corrupted</hi> Nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by having daily Occasions, we might learn that most pleasant Virtue <hi>Contentment</hi>; and drive out, and overcome all those tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing Furies that are lodg'd in a <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, Ambitious, Covetous</hi> or <hi>Envious</hi> Breast. Canst thou look on these with any Satisfaction? Surely thou canst not. Tell me, O Christian, dost thou not think that the Wise Man had reason to say, <hi>Better is a bit of Bread with Content, than a fatted Ox with strife.</hi> Wherefore now let thy <hi>Conversation,</hi> thy Disposition and Temper of Mind, <hi>be without Covetousness, and be content which such things as thou hast;</hi> be fully satisfied with what ever God at present allows thee: for as he said
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105989:14"/>
to <hi>Ioshua, Iosh. c.</hi> I. <hi>v.</hi> 5. so says he now to thee, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee:</hi> Only be thou <hi>strong, and of a good courage;</hi> and so mayest thou tho' poor and needy, tho' persecuted, afflicted, and tormented, with the Saints of Old, boldly say, <hi>The Lord is my helper; yea, in God have I put my trust, and I will not fear what Flesh shall do unto me, Psal.</hi> LVI. <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Heb. c.</hi> XIII. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. For by this shalt thou be able to get advantage over <hi>Poverty, Affliction, Sickness,</hi> nay even <hi>Death</hi> it self, with all kind of Casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to which thou art expos'd by reason of thy frail Condition. Be assured that <hi>Godliness with Contentment is great gain:</hi> and remember how <hi>they that Will be rich,</hi> that set their Minds, which are design'd for a far <hi>Nobler</hi> End, on the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of riches, <hi>fall into Temtation and a Snare, and into many foolish lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> VI. 6, 9.</p>
            <p n="8">§. VIII. Lastly, Labour was ordain'd for Man, that he seeing himself bound to work, that he might provide food and raiment for his Body, should be thereby admonish'd to labour with all his might after that <hi>Divine. Grace,</hi> with which he has most need to <hi>feed</hi> and <hi>clothe</hi> his <hi>Soul</hi>; and not expect to be translated hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pure and holy Mansions of Heaven,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105989:15"/>
by an unresistible sort of Grace, whether he will or no. I hope rather, my Friend, that thou thinkest no Labour too great for thee, to save thee from the sad lot of the <hi>Slothful and unprofitable servant,</hi> which is to be <hi>cast into utter darkness.</hi> Give then all diligence, gird up the loyns of thy Mind, be sober and hope to the end. <hi>Labour not for</hi> (set not thy Heart upon) <hi>the meat that perisheth, but for that meat which endureth to everlasting Life, Iohn</hi> VI. <hi>v.</hi> 27. and so by <hi>patient continuance in well-doing,</hi> thinking it thy Meat and thy Drink to do the Will of thy Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Seek for Glory, and Honour, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whosoever labours after this manner, performs in it the best and divinest of all External Worships, whose end is to <hi>draw</hi> the Soul by <hi>sensible</hi> Means nearer to God. But whosoever in his Labour neglects these Considerations, doth certainly work like a <hi>Beast.</hi> Nay, if thou workest with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thinking on <hi>God,</hi> or his <hi>Institution,</hi> thou art in truth the <hi>greater</hi> Beast of the two. Whoever labours for the Ends of <hi>Pleasure, Vanity,</hi> or <hi>Covetousness,</hi> and who is busy'd about hurtful or wicked Emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, such an one cannot in any wise be said to labour as the <hi>Child</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> therefore be not <hi>deceiv'd,</hi> for many are hereby, (wholly forgetting its primitive
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105989:15"/>
Institution,) become the <hi>slaves</hi> of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> And this, I suppose, thou thinkest the <hi>lowest</hi> degrading of thy self that is possible.</p>
            <p>There is indeed no Estate of Perfection so sublime, that Humane Nature is capable of, to which one may not arrive by La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, directed according to the Designs of God. This is that in which the Holy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs of old, while they had hardly any other Ceremonies, or External Worship, than this appointed, became the <hi>Friends</hi> of God; and were advanced to a <hi>near</hi> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with Him on Earth. It was by this Exercise for about the first fourty years of his Life, that <hi>Moses</hi> arriv'd to that excellent pitch of Obedience, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and Humility, <hi>refusing to be call'd the Son of</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s Daughter;</hi> of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, Charity and Patience, <hi>chusing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;</hi> Of Meekness, Contentedness, and the highest inward Recollection and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>esteeming the reproach of</hi> Christ <hi>greater riches than the treasures of</hi> Egypt, <hi>Heb.</hi> XI. 24, 25, 26. who thereby spoke to God <hi>face to face,</hi> and received from him this Testimony, <hi>I know thee by Name, and thou hast found Grace in my sight, Exo.</hi> xxxiii. 12. Nay, a <hi>Greater</hi> than <hi>Moses,</hi> even <hi>Our</hi> Blessed <hi>Lord</hi> himself, chose no other
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105989:16"/>
Exercise than this, in the time of his <hi>Humiliation</hi>; while he <hi>grew in Wisdom and in favour with God and Men,</hi> before his Public Manifestation to the World. He submitted himself to <hi>work</hi> at an <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> and <hi>laborious</hi> Trade, to earn his own Victuals, and disdain'd not to serve his Neighbours that had any use of him, in such low <hi>manual</hi> Offices for the greatest part of his Life, and to assist the Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Family. And what art thou <hi>proud Worm,</hi> that canst despise, or repine at <hi>that,</hi> which thy <hi>Master</hi> and thy <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi> underwent for the sake of <hi>thee</hi>? Dost thou not think that He hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to leave thee such a <hi>Pattern</hi> of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> as might be able to bring down thy haughty Stomach; and might instruct thee how <hi>Corporal</hi> Labour is not any <hi>Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance</hi> in, but may it self be made a most acceptable <hi>Worship</hi> to God? To this purpose, it is said of a late Eminent Scholar, that after a most learn'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Defence</hi> of the <hi>Truth of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion,</hi> and an Elaborate <hi>Comment</hi> on the <hi>whole Bible,</hi> as well as many other fam'd Pieces, in Divinity, Law, History, and other Sciences, which advanc'd him to several Public Embassies, and the greatest Honours; this Illustrious Person after all, concluded his Life, with this Protestation, That <hi>He would give all his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105989:16"/>
Learning and Honour, for the plain Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and harmless Innocency of</hi> John Vrick; who was a poor Man that, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Day into three parts, spent eight hours of it in Labour, eight in the Necessaries of Life, and the other eight in Reading and Prayer. For</p>
            <p>There is this further plain Advantage of <hi>Bodily</hi> Labour to be consider'd, that it requires not so great a measure of Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Grace, as doth the <hi>Spiritual.</hi> Study, or <hi>Spiritual</hi> Labour, is indeed a great Labour: so very great, as none can conceive, but such as have felt it; and requires doubtless much larger Abilities, <hi>more</hi> and <hi>different</hi> Talents, and <hi>greater</hi> Graces, than what are requir'd toward that of the <hi>Body,</hi> that it be exercised as it ought. The Miscarriages of <hi>this</hi> are not only <hi>greater,</hi> but <hi>easier</hi> too; for <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge puffeth up,</hi> and without the greatest care and caution that is possible, this sort of Labour will feed the Pride and Vanity, and nourish the Passion of the <hi>diseased</hi> Mind: Whereas the other, as we have seen, is more fitted to produce those so needful Qualifications of Humility, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and Meekness.</p>
            <p>Thus have I endeavour'd to teach thee, in short, how thou oughtest to look Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways on thy Labour, as the <hi>Effect</hi> and <hi>Punishment</hi> of thy Sin; to remember that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105989:17"/>
thou must never expect to be <hi>sav'd,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less thou be content to <hi>tast</hi> its <hi>evil;</hi> be sincerely <hi>thankful,</hi> for that it is no hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier; be <hi>resolv'd,</hi> by a wise and chearful Submission unto thy <hi>share</hi> of the <hi>Cross,</hi> to seek for <hi>those things that are Above,</hi> and to balk at no difficulty, that so thou maist but at last enter into the <hi>Rest of the Lord:</hi> Nor is this all, for thou hast here both a <hi>Warning,</hi> and a <hi>Method,</hi> how thou maist even <hi>sweeten</hi> all its <hi>Bitterness,</hi> turning it into a most acceptable piece of <hi>Service</hi> to thy most kind Creator and Benefactor; by directing it according to his Designs, and learning thence those most necessary Graces of Obedience, Humility and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry; of Temperance, Charity, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; of Meekness, Contentedness, and even the highest pitch of Spiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, and Conversation with Him, that thy Nature is capable of on this side Heaven. And is <hi>this</hi> such a mean or piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful estate, that thou canst in the least envy <hi>that</hi> of those, who by being the <hi>Lumber</hi> of <hi>this</hi> World, make themselves <hi>Fuel</hi> for a <hi>worse</hi>? No, I am perswaded thou canst not. Methinks, I hear thee make this Answer, I will not hereafter account any Estate too mean, or any Labour too hard, which is capable of compassing such glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Ends; No Toil can be <hi>too</hi> great, which draws me <hi>nearer</hi> to my God: No
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105989:17"/>
Condition <hi>too</hi> low, which lifts me thus <hi>high.</hi> Well, then suppose (what is at this time the lot of so many Christians, better every way than thee,) that thou werst a slave chain'd to an Oar; or werst condemn'd to some dark Mine, there to be depriv'd of all the Light and Enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this World; could'st thou by such Acts as these set thy self free, and no more than exchange a few paltry and fading, for great and constant Delights? Examine thy Heart seriously, what in such a case thou would'st do. If thou could'st do so, then hast thou truly learnt <hi>Christ:</hi> but if not, I can never flatter thee, to tell thee, that thou art a <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Christ,</hi> or a <hi>Child of God.</hi> But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thou wilt say, This is afar off from me: God be thank'd, there's little danger yet of my falling into such a state. Well, but however, I advise thee, as thou lovest thy self, not to <hi>put</hi> it <hi>far</hi> from thee, but to make it by all manner of ways fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to thee; that so thou may'st not be unprovided against any disposal of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. But if, dear <hi>Christian</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman,</hi> the Lot be fallen to thee in a better Ground, consider what reason thou hast to thank thy good God, for laying so <hi>little</hi> upon <hi>thee,</hi> in comparison of what the poorer sort in most other Nations do bear: And forget not to offer up thy
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105989:18"/>
prayers to their Father and thine, even the Father of our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that he would be pleas'd to support them with his Spirit, under their most heavy Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, and also enable <hi>thee</hi> to undergo it couragiously, if he should call thee to drink with them of the same <hi>bitter</hi> Cup. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else now remains, but that after such a Prospect of Labour; as renders it both the <hi>Natural</hi> Punishment for Sin, and an Acceptable Act of Worship to God; which in the Bowels of Mercy I intreat thee, dear <hi>Christian,</hi> not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get; I shew in the last place, to the end I may make what I have said for thy sake, the more Useful, how thou may'st draw Hence such proper <hi>Exercises</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as are aforemention'd.</p>
            <p n="1">I. IN the first place therefore, if thou hast any sense, as I hope thou hast a great one of what thou hast hitherto read, (which God grant may never be brought into Judgment against thee,) I am fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that thou wilt <hi>presently,</hi> without any longer put-offs or delays, resolve and purpose to convert thy <hi>Work</hi> into a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> of God, and so <hi>Worship</hi> Him, in all the Designs of this His most ancient <hi>Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment,</hi> for the rest of thy Life. And especially thou wilt be to much the more earnest in this, if it appear that thou hast <hi>dishonour'd</hi> Him heretofore, by that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105989:18"/>
thou oughtest <hi>only</hi> to have consider'd thy own <hi>Baseness,</hi> and His <hi>Honour.</hi> If hitherto thou hast <hi>mistaken its</hi> Ends, thou wilt be truly glad that thou art now at last <hi>undeceiv'd,</hi> and wilt labour <hi>more</hi> dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently for the time to come, to keep them constantly in thy view: And if thine Heart accuse thee for having ever turn'd it into a <hi>Worship</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and of thy <hi>Lusts,</hi> thine Heart will also admonish thee to <hi>Consecrate</hi> it now, for ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, to <hi>God,</hi> according to his Blessed Institution, and will the <hi>more</hi> powerfully press thee to do this <hi>Effectually</hi> and <hi>wholly,</hi> not <hi>faintly,</hi> or <hi>partially</hi>; by vigorously stirring thee up to <hi>begin</hi> with as much So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, and Particularness, as either <hi>Thy self,</hi> or the <hi>Matter</hi> is capable of, thereby to make the Impression the deeper and more lasting. Place then thy self in the presence of God, reflect seriously on thy <hi>past</hi> Estate, and <hi>that</hi> which by his Grace thou art invited to enter into, and when, after having minutely and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially weigh'd the Advantages, or Disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of both, thou art <hi>fully</hi> Resolv'd; then with the most ardent Affection, and Resentment that is possible, declare this thy <hi>Resolution</hi> and <hi>Purpose:</hi> Which thou may'st do in the manner following. But first meditate upon, and consider it a while: Then upon thy bended Knees,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105989:19"/>
from the bottom of thy Heart say,</p>
            <p>IN the Name of God. <hi>Amen.</hi> I <hi>A. B.</hi> resolve henceforward never more to Labour again as the Horse and the Mule <hi>without Understanding,</hi> but constantly to look on, and resolvedly to embrace that State of Labour to which I am by my good God appointed, as a <hi>Chastisement</hi> for my Rebellion <hi>against,</hi> and a <hi>Mean</hi> to reduce me back to that Loyalty and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance which is due <hi>to</hi> his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty. I will evermore detest and abhor, as I do now most sincerely, from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of my Heart, detest and abhor; in the Sight of God and of all the Court of Heaven, <hi>Sin,</hi> which is its accursed Cause; I will quietly, nay thankfully undergo it, for that it is no greater; and will study to make it serve all those good and wise Ends, of which it is capable: I will La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be perfectly obedient to all the Commands of my God; I will humble my self before Him as low as I can, because it is not possible as low as I deserve; I will strive to the utmost to be as <hi>diligent</hi> and <hi>industrious</hi> in my Calling, as <hi>sober</hi> and <hi>temperate</hi> in the government of my Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as <hi>charitable</hi> and <hi>assisting</hi> towards my Neighbours and Friends; as <hi>patient</hi> under all hardship and pain; as <hi>meek</hi> under eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry harsh usage, and injurious insultings
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105989:19"/>
from my Fellow-creature; as <hi>contented</hi> and <hi>chearful</hi> in the meanness of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and lastly, as far <hi>remov'd</hi> from the World, and as nearly <hi>united</hi> to God, as either He hereby designs and invites me to be, or as I have need of: For as much as I am assur'd that He cannot deny me any Assistance of his Holy Spirit, which I beg through the Merits of his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, my Lord and Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Next, after this <hi>Protestation</hi> made, and <hi>Resolution</hi> declar'd as in the presence of God, and of the whole Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that it may become Effectual in thy Life, thou art to keep every Branch of it in thy Mind, and to secure the same in thine Heart by fervent and faithful Prayer: For this purpose, after I have directed thee, how to form in thy Spirit a <hi>General Abhorrence</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press thy <hi>Acknowledgments</hi> to God for his wonderful Goodness; I will teach thee on all occasions, according as thy needs shall direct, to call down the <hi>Divine</hi> Assistance, to enable thee in the performance of <hi>every</hi> part. But before all things, it's necessary that thou beg it of thy Heavenly Father, that there may be imprinted on thee a just Detestation and Abhorrence of all manner of <hi>Sin,</hi> the fruitful <hi>Mother</hi> of thy <hi>Misery.</hi> To which end, say,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:105989:20"/>ALmighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, grant, I beseech thee, that I may have that due sense as well of Thine infinite <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> as of mine own <hi>Deformity</hi> and <hi>Misery,</hi> that I may abhor my self in dust and ashes before Thee; and while I eat my Bread in the Sweat of my brow, may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forget to detest and fly that Monster, which has laid this <hi>Yoak</hi> on my shoulders, that I may confess to Thee my strange Vileness and Folly, and feeling thus in part the bitter Effect of Sin, may not only <hi>detest</hi> and <hi>confess,</hi> but be also ever ready to <hi>satisfy</hi> any Condition that will release me from its accursed slavery, for the Love and thro' the Merits of Him, who sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himself to bear so large a share, that mine might be no more, even thy most glorious and most adorable Son, my only Redeemer and Mediator <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then in the deepest Humility of thy Soul, address thy self to the most Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God in the following, or like Form of <hi>Thanksgiving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALmighty God, Father of all Mercies, I thine unworthy servant, do give Thee most humble and hearty thanks, for thy great goodness and loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness towards me, in that thou didst not only send Thy only begotten Son to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105989:20"/>
me from the Bondage of Sin and Death, and so restore me to the Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thy Favour, which are <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Ioy</hi> everlasting, by suffering together with me what I had brought upon my self; but didst also make the Burthen for me so easy, and the Chastisement so light, as I can wish it in Prudence neither ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier, nor lighter. But especially I bless thee, O heavenly Father, for that thou wert pleas'd even to turn this <hi>remaining Effect</hi> of Sin, thro' the <hi>Efficacious</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of this same dearly beloved Son, into a most powerful Remedy <hi>against</hi> it, that it may be to me, if I please, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Instrument of my Happiness, thro' the same <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> to whom with Thee, and the Holy Ghost, be all Honour and Glory, world without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in nothing more fitly canst thou shew thy <hi>Abhorrence</hi> of Sin, or <hi>Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> than by carefully watching thy Soul, and on all occasions, as thou either find'st thy self inwardly <hi>mov'd</hi> to some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Exercise, or <hi>assaulted</hi> by any Temta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, strengthening thy self by Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thy Heavenly Father, for such Graces, as thou standest most in need of, who when <hi>thou askest Bread,</hi> will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse it thee, or <hi>give thee a Stone</hi> in its stead. Wherefore <hi>Ask, and it shall be given: Seek, and thou shalt find.</hi>
