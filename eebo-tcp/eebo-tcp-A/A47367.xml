            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>Hosanna to the Son of David, blessed is he that cometh in
the Name of the Lord, hosanna in the highest.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese words are the Acclamation
of the people, at our Saviours
entering in Triumph into <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
and part of the Gospel
appointed for this Day, the first
Day of the Churches Year, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the Cicle or Round of Collects begun this
Day. Christians, with good reason; observing yearly,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65870:3"/>
double sort of year, an Ecclesiastical from the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of our Saviour, as well as a Civil from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of the Sun. For the Times and Seasons of the
Church are measured, her spiritual Growths foster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not by the Sun in the Firmament, but by the Sun
of Righteousness, not by Planetary Motions or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences,
but by the Star of <hi>Jacob,</hi> whose Dawn,
or Rising upon the World we at this time solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize.</p>
            <p>Advent do's not imply that Christ is come, but
coming; not his Presence, but his Approach;
Christmas is the high Celebrity of his actual Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
this day only reports and noyses abroad his
drawing near. Advent is to Christmas, as <hi>John</hi> was
to the Gospel, <hi>vox clamantis,</hi> the Herald or Harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that made way for it; so Advent is the Harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to make way for the Queen-feast to succeed
with more Majesty, Royal Personages not only ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Followers, but Fore-runners for greater
State.</p>
            <p>But how comes the Church to make choice of
one of the last Passages of Christs Life, to proclaim
his first coming into the World? the Season of his
Passion, to introduce the Time of his Nativity?
Because this coming of Christ in Triumph into
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65870:3"/>
               <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> shews him who he was, to be a King,
which <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> was but nam'd and stil'd at his Birth: at
his Nativity he was but design'd to the Crown of
<hi>Israel,</hi> but here he is seen in the Throne; his Star
shone then, but his Majesty now; the Sages and
Astrologers could only at that time discover the
King, but the People here could pronounce him to
be <hi>the Son of David,</hi> and rejoyce in their Soveraign.
Again, this last coming of Christ was more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to <hi>do the will of God,</hi> and perfect the Work of
mans salvation; and accordingly Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ascribes
to it, by way of excellence and eminence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.
the fulfilling of that prophecy, <hi>Then said I, Lo I
come to do thy will, O God.</hi> Christ did the <hi>Will of God</hi>
in the whole Course of his Life, but at the Time of
his Death he accomplisht it. And the Church could
not select a more proper portion of Scripture to
usher in his Birth, or to take off the Prejudices of the
Poverty and Infirmity seen in it; to convert, I say,
the Stable into a Palace; to disclose a helpless In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,
to be the Omnipotent Son of God, than this that
makes both ends of Christs Life meet; that joyns
the Scepter to the Cradle; the Triumph to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity:
the words of the Angel, <hi>Luke 2. 11. Vnto
you is born this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the City of David; a Saviour, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65870:4"/>
is Christ the Lord,</hi> with the words of the People here
in my Text, <hi>Hosanna to the Son of David, blessed is he
that cometh in the Name of the Lord, hosanna in the
Highest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may observe in the words these two General
Parts. Christs Entrance. And the Peoples Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of him.</p>
            <p>In Christs Entrance these four Particulars.</p>
            <p>First, Who it is that cometh, the Person here
spoken of, the <hi>Son of David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, For what he cometh, his Purpose,
which is more clearly set down at <hi>v. 5. To declare
himself to be the King of Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, How he cometh, or the Manner and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage
of his coming, it was in Pomp and State,
as is seen <hi>verses</hi> 7, 8.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, From whom he cometh, or his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
<hi>He cometh in the Name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Peoples Reception of him is with joyful
Acclamations.</hi> Hosanna to the Son of David, blessed
is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord, hosanna in the
highest.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>First, Who it is that cometh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Person here
spoken of, the Son of David.</head>
               <p>This was the whole Cities Question at <hi>verse</hi> 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65870:4"/>
                  <hi>And when he came into Jerusalem all the City was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
saying, Who is this?</hi> But God had shewed it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
out of the mouthes of Babes and Sucklings, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Children, properly so call'd, and of the poor ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
People, who were as Children. Their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
were first enlighten'd, their Tongues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
to declare and welcome Christ, as the Son of
<hi>David,</hi> the Messiah and Saviour of the World. And
this is most commonly the Method of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in making himself known unto men, that which
he hides from the Wise and Learned, he reveals un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Simple and Lowly. The Holy Spirit for the
most part taking up his Inne, as wise Travellers do
theirs, not the fairest and most frequented, but the
more private retir'd; where though there's less
Magnificence, there's also less Pride, and more Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
and Regard. So here he passes by the
Potent Priest and Pharisee, fill'd with Ambition, and
the conceit of their own Sanctity and Knowledge,
possest with the love of Riches, and the like, and
turns in to the humble, vacant, disinteressed Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
whose Hearts were <hi>rasae tabulae,</hi> so many fair
Tables, without blur, without scrowl, and fit for any
Inscription.</p>
               <p>This Question, <hi>Quis est hic? Who is this?</hi> was not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65870:5"/>
a question of Ignorance, but Malice; of Persons
Uninform'd, but full of Envy. 'Twas like that of
his Countrymen of <hi>Nazareth, Non hic est fabri filius?
Is not this the Carpenters son?</hi> They saw his words full
of Grace, and his works of Wonder, that all his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
were truly Divine; but because <hi>Joseph</hi>
was his reputed Father, and <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his Breeding and Parentage were not equal to
the Glories manifested in him, they would not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him as a Prophet; but chose rather not to
know him, than to believe in him; and to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at him, than to confesse him. After the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the Priests and Pharisees here, because our Lord
came not such a Person, and after such a Fashion, as
they had foolishly fancied, their Messiah would
come, a mighty Prince, inviron'd with Armies, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
to promote them to Honour and Riches; but a
poor Prophet calling them to the like Poverty
and Humility with his own; to Righteousness, not
to Greatness; to take up the Cross, and not the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of Magistracy, they would not acknowledge
him; but deny'd the Original, because it resembled
not a false Copy; rejected the Eternal Son of God,
because he was not like the Bastard Childe of their
Carnal Brains. And, <hi>Who is this?</hi> signifies not,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65870:6"/>
who is this that we have never heard of, or seen?
Or, who is this that usurps such honours which the
Scriptures allow to no man, no not to the <hi>Messiah?</hi>
But, who is this that we abhor? who is this our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version?
who is this that defrauds our Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
that grows daily greater, and makes out his
Pretences in spight of our Opposition?</p>
               <p>That Christ was to be the Son of <hi>David,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
of the Seed and Linage of the ancient Kings
of <hi>Judah,</hi> that God out of the old Stock or Root
of Jesse which now through length of time seem'd
decay'd, and doted, seare, and dead, would <hi>cause
to grow up a branch of Righteousness to execute Judgment
and Justice in the Land,</hi> was a truth asserted from all
antiquitie; And not only <hi>Esay</hi> and <hi>Jeremy,</hi> who
in expresse terms speak it, but as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> says,
all the Prophets bare witnesse to it. And the later
Doctors in our Saviours daies universally allow'd
the Tradition, as is seen by the answer of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees
to the question our Lord asked them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
himself: <hi>What say you of Christ? whose Son is
he? And they said, the Son of David.</hi> But then that Christ
was <hi>this Son of David,</hi> this <hi>Branch</hi> so long foretold
and expected, though his Extraction and Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
his words and works, his life and death, did
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65870:7"/>
quadrat and close with all the Accounts, Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Tipical Representations of the <hi>Messiah</hi> in the
Law, and the several Lines drawn from the mouths
of so many Prophets of different ages exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>center'd
in his Person; yet none but the dispassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and disinterressed would confesse and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
the Multitude here, and the People again
elsewhere, or some more particularly inspir'd, as
the two blind Men mention<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d <hi>Matt.</hi> 9. 27. poor
<hi>Bartimeus,</hi> and the like; who comparing the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
wrought by Christ, with the Prophecies that
went of him, confidently made out this truth, <hi>Jesus
thou Son of David have mercy on us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here we cannot enough admire the bounty
of God to his faithfull Servants that do his will, and
seek him with their whole heart; whom he does
not only blesse and prosper while they are alive,
but makes their Names and Memories illustrious
by a renown'd Posterity long after they are dead.
As he did not suffer <hi>Davids</hi> Soul to see corruption,
even in the grave where all things perish, so neither
did he suffer his Glory to see corruption after so
many ages, when commonly all things are lost in
oblivion, but reviv'd it by causing Christ to Spring
from his Loines. Christ, indeed, had an other
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65870:7"/>
higher and nobler Generation, an Eternal, such as
no man can declare; as the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> sayes,
<hi>Who can declare his Generation?</hi> This his Prime
Generation was not from the Will of Man; but
from the Power of the Spirit; he took Flesh of the
Virgin, but not by Propagation, but by Adum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration,
and the Will of God: And therefore in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of any humane Parentage on the Fathers side,
he was liken'd to <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> who is introduc'd in
Scripture without Parent, without descent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Genealogy: for so it became him that was to
be the Preacher of Purity to the World, that his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Generation should be also Pure. Yet I say so
much was God pleased with the Heroical Vertue
of <hi>David,</hi> so much was he a Man after his own
heart, that he ordained, that that great Person, the
Second Person in the Trinity, should be reckon'd
to him as his Issue; that he that was indeed his Lord,
as our Saviour also alledges as a strange Event,
should notwithstanding become his Son! he will'd
that the Son of his own Spirit, should be esteemed
the Son of his servant! So true is that which God
spake to <hi>Eli</hi> of old, and so exemplary a doctrine
to all posterity, <hi>Honorantes me honorabo, those that
honour me I will honour:</hi> Ye see what is done to him

whom God honoureth, the very Saviour of the
World counts it a piece of Nobility and Gentry,
as I may so speak, to derive his Pedigree from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
The second Particular I observed was,</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The purpose of Christs coming, to shew
himself the King of Israel.</head>
               <p>Thrice a year for three years together, as the
custome was for all <hi>Israel,</hi> Christ had gon up to
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> the chief City of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and yet did
never make any Overture, never shewed any Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance,
as if he had been King of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> before
this last time of his entry. Nay hitherto he used
all means to conceal his Title and Pretence, rather
than to declare it. When they would have made
him a King, he conveighed himself invisibly out of
the presse, and did a Miracle, to avoid an Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
How comes he therefore now voluntarily
to assume, what before he so sollicitously refused?
How comes he to do a Miracle, that he might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
a King, when he formerly did a Miracle not to
appear one? Affects to have a Mounture whereon to
ride; charms the owners Spirit that should surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, hearing the Lord had need of it; inspires the
Multitude to proclaim, what he forbad his Disciples
to whisper; takes the whole state of it upon him,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65870:8"/>
affirms it to <hi>Pilate,</hi> when he asks him concerning it.
Affirms it I say, though in a Ceremonious way of
affirmation usual among the <hi>Jewes, Art thou the
King of the Jewes? Thou saist it, says he.</hi> Which was
as much as if he had answered, I am indeed that
which thou sayst. Only he makes here the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
it self go for the Answer, and the Demander
asking the truth, in honour to him, he makes the
affirming of it, as it were also, to proceed from
his mouth. As in the case of a negative Answer,
the more Civill among us, choose rather to returne
an Excuse for their dissenting, than a flat No, or
Denial to the thing that was inquir'd.</p>
               <p>I say it was very strange, that Christ should thus
voluntarily assume that Dignity, which he had so
obstinately refused: but it was much stranger yet,
that he should assume it at the season he did, at
the Eve to his Passion, when he began to see <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
the Crosse standing at the door in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectance
of him! <hi>Is this a time,</hi> says the Prophet
to his servant <hi>Gehazi, to take money, and to buy Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards?</hi>
when the Lords anger was upon the land,
and the enemy daily expected. So was this a time
to lay claime to a Kingdom, when a mans Hour of
Death approacht? To put on the Royall Ensignes,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65870:9"/>
when he was to suffer as a Criminal? as if he would
present himself to the Executioner, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the Sacrifices of old were brought to the Priests,
with Garlands and gilded Horns. as <hi>Salvian</hi> says,
<hi>Ornatur ad poenam, coronatur ad supplicium,</hi> he was
invested in royal Robes to be Crucified, he was
made a King to suffer Death. This Hour, in the
Worlds judgment, so Incongruous to accept a
Crown, was yet the Season that he made choice of;
and he refused all Advancement, till he was upon
the point to be lifted-up on the Crosse. But as God
says in the Prophet, <hi>My thoughts are not your thoughts,
neither are your waies my waies.</hi> So we may say of
Christs Times and Seasons, that they suited and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
not with those of men, but he had an Hour
and Opportunity peculiar and particular for his
Actions which differ'd from the Vulgar apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
When his Mother prompted him to turne the
Water into Wine, <hi>My hour, says he, is not yet come.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
when his brethren mov'd him formerly to go
up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> saith he, <hi>Your time is alwayes, but my
time is not alwayes.</hi> And the like thing may be said of
his Non-acceptance of the Kingdom when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
offer'd it, His Hour for that purpose was not yet
come, He had not fully yet Preach'd the Gospel
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65870:9"/>
through the Cities of <hi>Judea,</hi> he had not clear'd his
Title to the Kingdom by Signs and Wonders, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd
the Prophecies that were of him, and the other
intermediate Works injoyn'd him by the Father:
and he would not abruptly seize the Soveraignty,
till all was prepar'd for it; usurpe it, till he had
made out his Pretence: rule over a people, that knew
him not to be their Prince; and exact their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
before they understood his Authority. But
when he had prov'd himself the Son of God,
then he first declar'd he was the Heir and Successor
of <hi>David;</hi> and well he might be allow'd to be the
King of <hi>Israel,</hi> when he had shew'd himself to be
the Lord of Heaven and Earth, and all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the World.</p>
               <p>And this is Gods Method in ruling the World,
he does not require from men, before he has given to
them; he exacts not their Faith, till he has first
enlighten'd them; demands not their Obedience,
till he has taught them his Laws, and given them
his Grace: But after these things if they pay him
not humble and ready submission, if his Subjects
refuse yet to acknowledge his Dominion, he will
cause the Rebels, as 'tis <hi>Luke 19. 27. To be brought
forth to Judgment, and those that would not that he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65870:10"/>
should reign over them, shall be slain before him;</hi> who
could not brook his Scepter, shall feel his Sword,
and undergo his Vengeance.</p>
               <p>But here in the next place we are to demand,
what Kingdom it is that Christ assumeth? that the
Prophets foretold, and the People congratulate?
for we shall find, that the Multitude here speak one
thing, and the Spirit in them means another. The
People hoped that Christ would presently shew
himself such a King, as I lately said the Pharisees
fancy'd, one that should visibly ascend the Throne
of <hi>David,</hi> restore the temporal Kingdom only with
greater Glory than in the Patriarchs daies, as their
words also plainly declare in the parallel place of
Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> where they cry, <hi>Blessed is the Kingdom of
our father David!</hi> But Christs coming at this time
was with far other Designes, to claim a Spiritual
Kingdom in the Soules and Hearts of men; <hi>-Illa ut
Dominetur in aula,</hi> that he might bare sway in these
Palaces. Says the <hi>Psalmist, A Scepter of Righteousnesse
is the Scepter of thy Kingdom, thou hast loved Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and hated Iniquity.</hi> Such a Scepter as a Prophet
might wield. The People congratulate him as an
Anti-Cesar, a King that should deliver from the
subjection of the Romans. But what says he of his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65870:10"/>
Coming? For this purpose came I into the World,
to destroy the Works of the Devil, to be an Anti-Lucifer,
and to lead this his Captivity captive.</p>
               <p>And we are to look here upon the Peoples Joy
from their imagination of an Earthly Kingdom, as
on the Infirmity and Feebleness of Natural Mens
Affections, who count no Blessings worthy the
congratulating, but Temporal; Secular Prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
Worldly Greatness, Outward Splendor, the
Complacency of the Senses, and the like, are the
things only which transport and ravish; Christs
Spiritual Scepter, his Dominion in the Soul, a
Crown of Immortality and Glory, are look<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d upon
as so many Melancholy Metaphors without reality,
without relish: that Felicity is only desireable,
which the World admires; and that held truly a
Kingdom, where Voluptuousness reigns.</p>
               <p>But yet we are not so to take this Doctrine of
Christs Spiritual Kingdom as if he had no Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Kingdom at all: for that Prophecie cited by
Saint <hi>Peter Act. 2. 30. God has sworn with an oath to
David, that of the fruit of his Loyns, according to the
flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his Throne.</hi> And
again, that the Kingdom of Christ should be of
much greater extent than that of his father <hi>David,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65870:11"/>
Even over all the Nations of the Earth;</hi> are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
literally, if due regard be had to the time
of their fulfilling. Neither did Christ, when his
Disciples ask'd him of his Temporal Kingdom,
wholly disclaim it, but checkt their curious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
after it. <hi>'Tis not for you,</hi> sayes he, <hi>to know
the Times and Seasons, which the Father has kept in his
own Power.</hi> Therefore, <hi>distingue tempora,</hi> distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
but the Times, and the same thing which at
one time is false, at another may be true. Christ at
this Time, when he enter'd into <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> had no
Temporal Kingdom: but after he ascended into
Heaven, he had one Visible and Glorious, even unto
the eyes of men. And though he professes in the
Dayes of his Humiliation, that he came not to be
minister'd unto, but to minister; yet after his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation,
he claims the Ministration of all men,
even of the greatest Princes: and that is fulfilled
which the Prophet sayes, <hi>All Nations shall do him
service.</hi> Sayes our Lord after his Resurrection,
<hi>All power is given to me both in Heaven and Earth.</hi>
He had this power originally before, but then he
first executed it in the Capacity of God and Man,
in the Capacity of the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy'd
King of <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:65870:11"/>
And if we shall regard the Events in the World
since the preaching of the Gospel, we shall find,
that no one of the four, which are usually call'd the
four Universal Monarchies, was ever so vastly, so
universally extended, as the Monarchy of Christs
Kingdom; but as <hi>Moses</hi> Rod devour'd the Rods
of the Magicians, so I may say, has Christs Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
swallow'd up all the Scepters of the Kings of the
Earth: and as heretofore the Nations flow'd so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
into the Roman Empire, that it was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deservedly
said, <hi>Orbem jam totum victor Romanus
habebat,</hi> the Victorious Romans have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Masters of the whole World, there being no
Nation that was not subdued by them, which they
thought worthy to march against with an Army, and
if any were exempt, 'twas because they were also
despis'd: so much more may it be said of Christs
Empire, <hi>That it comprises the whole World,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that very Globe or Orb of the Romans it self,
is contain'd within the Globe or Orb of Christs;
neither is there that Climate to be found, in which
there are not those that do bow the knee in adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the King Christ, and erect the Cross in token
of his Dominion. It is enough when we can say,
that there is no Sun, where there is no Church; and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65870:12"/>
if there be a People that know not Christ, 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
themselves are unknown.</p>
               <p>They therefore, who have so much doted on the
Fift Monarchy, and out of Scripture misinterpreted
will bring down Christ again from Heaven, to
Reign a thousand years on a Temporal Throne up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth, they seek for that in Future Ages, which
is already eminently perform'd in their sight, and
fulfill'd in Story; and it may be said to them of
the Temporal Kingdom of Christ, what he said
once of his Spiritual, <hi>That it comes not with Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
No, not with the Observation of any thing
that's Future: but rather is discern'd to be now
Currant and Instant upon us, both by the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of what is past, and what we daily see. And
however the Prophecies may seem to intimate some
Secular Way of Christs executing his Temporal
Kingdom, and that the <hi>Jews</hi> and others think they
degrade the Messiah, if they make him not an
Earthly Prince, yet no Grandure of an Earthly
Prince can reach to the Majesty of the Messiah, as
'tis spoken of in Scripture, or fulfil those very Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
they stand so much upon, after so Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a Manner as Christ has fulfilled them. Who
undoubtedly did a more Wonderful and Illustrious
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65870:12"/>
thing, in that he Reign'd ore the World after his
Decease, than if he had done it in the Dayes of
his Flesh; I say, he did a more Wonderful and
Illustrious thing, in first Dying, and after that,
Rising again, and subduing, and ruling the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Earth, and being adored ever after as
God, than if for a few years only he had Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer'd
like a <hi>Caesar,</hi> or a <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and then Inglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
have confessd his Mortality, expired, and
given place to another. And this is the High Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of Christ, which Saint <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 5. 30.
so powerfully urges to convert his Unbelieving
Crucifiers: <hi>The God of our fathers,</hi> sayes he, <hi>raised
up Jesus, whom ye slew, and hanged on a tree, Him
hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and
a Saviour.</hi> And Christ being such a Prince or King
as we have described, Let us see in the next place
the State and Majesty with which he came to claim
his Kingdom. Which is in the third Particular I
observ'd,</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Manner, Pomp, or Equipage of his
Coming.</head>
               <p>If we read the Triumphs of the Ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
nothing can be imagin'd more Magnificent,
more Stupendious. They being the Works of a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65870:13"/>
rack't Invention, and an immense Charge, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of many moneths, and the Business of several
dayes, the Sun sometimes making his Course thrice
about the World, before the several parts of the
well digested Pomp could be pass'd through the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The People were to behold Models of the
Towns and Fortresses they had conquer'd, the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
Weapons, and other Warlike Harness and
Engines of the Enemy; the vast heaps of their
Treasure, rich Vessels, Pieces of curious Art,
wild Beasts (if any such were found among them)
their Princes, with their Wives and Children led in
chains: in a word, whatever could heighten the
Popular Joy by Wonder, Pity, or Contempt, was
presented a Spectacle to them. After these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their own Victorious Army, Crown'd with Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
jovial, singing, and licentious; the Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Herd for Sacrifice, with all the Trappings of a
Pompous and Superstitious Religion. In the last
place, the Happy Conquerour himself, mounted
high on an Ivory Chariot imboss'd with gold, and
drawn with Horses of a Matchless beauty, sought
out in remote Provinces, and as Authors speak, led
at their bridles by White and Silken Querries;
<q>—Niveos ad fraena Quirites.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65870:13"/>
Now if to this Majestick Pomp we shall oppose
that of our Saviours entering into <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as
'tis describ'd in the Mornings Gospel, it will shew
like a Mock-Triumph, or Triumph in Burlesque.
Which was a thing resolv'd on, and perform'd the
same hour, countenanc'd and conducted only by a
Company of poor Fishermen his Disciples, and a
tumultuary Rabble of the Meaner Sort; for rich
Tapestry and Pieces of Needle-work to adorn the
Passage of the Triumph, the Coats of these poor
people, and some Extempory Branches snatcht from
Palm-trees there at hand, serv'd to strew the Way;
instead of a Gorgeous Charret, the humble Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour
came riding on a Asse, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
as St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> terms it, the most abject
and despicable of all the Beasts of Burden.</p>
               <p>But yet notwithstanding the Poverty and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of those Circumstances, if we shall look into
this Triumph of our Lord, as well as look upon it;
consider it with the sharper Eyes of the Spirit, as
well as glance on it with the mistie Eyes of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
we shall find, that with great reason, it was
usher'd in <hi>verse</hi> 5. with an Admonition of Special
Observation and Regard to be had to it; <hi>Tell the
daughter of Sion, Behold thy King cometh unto thee
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65870:14"/>
meek and sitting upon an asse, and a colt the fole of an
asse;</hi> and that it excell'd in Glory the Triumphs of
all the Princes of the World. For though there
was seen in it no Humane Invention or Cost, yet it
was Order'd and Contriv'd by the Wisdom of the
Eternal God; though 'twas resolv'd on and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
in an Hour, 'twas prophecy'd of many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years before; though no heaps of Gold or
Antick-plate were carried in it for ostentation, yet
the Vertues and Miracles of the Conquerour, his
holy Life and Doctrine were born, in a manner,
before him, to the greater Admiration of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders;
though no Models of demolisht Cities,
or Kings led in fetters, afforded a Spectacle of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
and compassion, yet the Kingdomes of
Hell and the Grave were there shew'd, dispoil'd and
ransackt, and <hi>Lucifer</hi> the Prince of Darkness him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
led in Everlasting Chains. And then the Joy
of this Triumph, was not the Mourning of many
Nations and People beside, but a Cause of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Jubilee to the whole World; or yet to last only
for a few days, but to continue even when the Sun
and the Moon shall no longer be.</p>
               <p>The Triumphs of Princes and Great Captains,
are to boast their Glory and Magnificence, but
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65870:14"/>
Christs Entrance into <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was not to shew a
Triumph of the Vain things of this World, but a
Triumph over them; not to Magnifie the Opinion
of Riches, but to bring them into Contempt.</p>
               <p>And this, and the like Passages of his Life, are
not so much to be look'd upon in the Story and
Fact, as in the Design and Purpose; as Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi>
sayes of them, they are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
a Rule of Christian Philosophy. At his Birth,
when he was Worship't by some Kings, and fear'd
by others, he was content to be found in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
and in the dayes that he fed thousands with
his Miracles, he chose often times himself to suffer
Hunger. And this to teach the Great Ones of the
World, to practise Self-denyal, in their highest
Affluence and Abundance; to teach the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be Humble; and the Mighty to be Meek; to
use their Power, not for Pride and Ostentation, but
for the Benefit of their Inferiors; to teach them
to despise their Greatness, when others admired
it; When the People envy or murmur at their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
flatter or adore it, cry, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>
makes them speak, <hi>Soli isti sunt, soli isti vivunt,</hi>
these are the Men that Live, these are the only Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
then to reflect on their Infirmities, and the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65870:15"/>
Unstableness of their Condition, fear, and cast
down their Souls. Outward Pomp and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
was annext to Kings, to preserve Reverence
and Awe in the Vulgar, but not to puff up their
own Spirits: That Great Person that is Proud and
Arrogant from the Contemplation of his Power
and many Attendants, shews a <hi>Plebian</hi> Spirit, in
a Royal Fortune; that is too High, to be Courteous,
too much Exalted, to do Good, dazles no mans
Eyes with his Eminence, but shews himself blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his Advancement. Christ therefore easily
condescended to take our Nature, because he was
<hi>the Son of God;</hi> to suffer the Indignities of a
Mean Condition, and to be Rejected of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
because he was conscious to himself that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Contempt; and digested here the Humble Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of his Triumph, because he came in <hi>the
Name of the Lord.</hi> Which brings me to my fourth
Particular. From Whom Christ Cometh, or his
Commission.</p>

                  <hi>To come in the Name of the Lord]</hi> is by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
or with the Authority of the Lord. He
was <hi>Vnctus Dei,</hi> the immediately Anointed by God

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65870:15"/>

his own Election and Anointing by God unto the

by him before at <hi>verse 22. The stone,</hi> sayes he,
<hi>which the Builders refus'd, is become the head stone of
the corner; It is the Lords Doing, and it is marvellous

coming <hi>in the Lords Name,</hi> is by his <hi>Ordering</hi> or
<hi>Doing;</hi> his Kingdom, was Gods Assignation; and
the Peoples saluting him the Messiah, was but the

but a Type of Christs, the Acclamations of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

words there.</p>
               <p>To come therefore <hi>in the Name of the Lord,</hi> is not
to come in the bare Pretence and Verbal Usurpation
of his Name, as false Prophets of old did, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousands of false Teachers now adayes do.
Who apishly imitating the Phrases of Gods True
Messengers, or but their Boldness and Rusticity,
their Astonisht Countenance, and the Dire Accent

all Learning, and Authority submit not to their
Counterfeit Mission. And 'tis little lesse than a
Prodigy to consider, how (in this not Ignorant
Age) Multitudes are carry'd away with these
grosse Follies. But that temper of men which
our Lord complain'd of <hi>John,</hi> 5. 43. is seen every
where in this Nation. <hi>I come in my Fathers Name,</hi>
says he, <hi>and ye receive me not, if another come in his
Own Name, him ye will receive.</hi> Christ shew'd the
Broad-Seal of Heaven for what he pretended, the
Divine Power bearing him witnesse by Miracles:
But these Imposters bring nothing but Impudence
and Ignorance to countenance their Proceedings;
neither are they seen to advance any thing but
Schisme and Sedition, Prophanation and Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
And as Saint <hi>John</hi> in his time forbad the
Faithful to shew the acts of common Humanity
to any one that brought another Doctrine, than
that which was taught by Christ, says he, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

them God-speed, least they seem to be their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and to partake of their Evill Deeds. Such
as these deserve only the Entertainment of the

to the Son of David,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Peoples Reception of Christ.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hosanna]</hi> is as much as <hi>Salva quaeso,</hi> O Lord
save, or give Salvation, adde Successe or Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to the Honour of thy King: for this is not a
Prayer of the People to Christ, but their Prayer for
him. As we cry, <hi>Vivat Rex,</hi> Long live the King
Praying for the Preservation of our Prince, who is
the Preservation of us all. And so the Multitude
here beseech God to save Christ, who was their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and indeed the Saviour of the World, and not
improperly. For though Christ in his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65870:17"/>
was above all Dangers and Necessities, yet in
his Humane he was Obnoxious to them; and though
he had the Power of a God, yet 'twas in the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of a Man; and even Humane Comforts, and
Good wishes, in the daies of his Flesh, were well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd
on him, and well accepted by him. And
now in the Days that he is ascended to the Right
hand of God, and needs no more the Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Men; though we present him not with
the same Contributions, and Expressions of our
Affection, yet we do not desist from offering <hi>All</hi>
Oblations to him, though our Oblations be
chang'd; our Faith, our Charity, our Prayses,
our Zeal for his Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are still due, and still
pleasing; for though he lacks nothing, yet for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he loves Vertue, and delights in Righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>And this is the Foundation of all Religious
Worship, and the Encouragement of Devotion:
this makes the Church observe Holy Feasts, the
Commemorations of Christs Benefits to her; so
sollicitously to warn her Children long before of
their Approach, that they may not be o'retaken with
Covetousness, Malice, Ambition, Sensuality, Worldly
Cares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when their Lord comes, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were;
and so his Presence prove Uneasie and Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65870:17"/>
and they be tempted to cry with them, <hi>Quis est
hic? Who is this?</hi> 'Tis Sin only, that makes men Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of Christ; and Guilt that makes his coming
Unwelcome. But certainly he that has deserv'd so
well of us, ought not to be held a Burden; nor he
that has bestow'd on us so many Benefits, to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.
Or if this move us not, yet he that is so
Mighty, cannot safely be Despised; and so Dreadful
in his Judgments, be cast out of our Thoughts.
St. <hi>Augustine</hi> has this plain Observation, not remote
to our present Concern, <hi>We should be troubled,</hi>
sayes he, <hi>if but a Friend or other Person that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
came to our Houses, when they were in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and we have nothing Worthy to Entertain him:</hi>
And his Application of it is this, <hi>Quicquid non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis
inveniri in domo tua, quantum potes labora ut non
inveniat Deus in anima tua,</hi> What ye would not
that Men should surprise in your Houses, be
much more careful that God when he comes sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
not in your Souls. Let him not find a Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedness
there, no nor yet an Emptiness; let not
his Reception be more Beggarly than that which
he found in the Inn, or more Unhandsome and
Uncleanly than that in the Stable. A Soul im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd
in Lust and Sensuality, is fouler than the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65870:18"/>
Stalls of Brute Beasts; and a Heart void of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and the Graces of the Spirit, is yet poorer
than his Cradle of a Manger. The Religious
Monks of old were wont, when they heard these
words read, <hi>And Christ was born in Bethlehem
Juda,</hi> to fall flat on their Faces on the ground,
in adoration and astonishment at the great Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Incarnation, and Gods Wonderful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension
therein to Mankind. But in these
dayes we hear this Gospel read like an Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Story, without astonishment, without
adoration, without thanks, without the least Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
and the Feast of the Nativity comes, and goes,
like the Day of a Lord Maiors entering on his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
it serves to compute our Years, and to digest
the Events of our Annals, but few consider the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of the Holy Season, or the Duties belonging
to it; few put away their Sins, and adorn their
Minds with the Graces of the Gospel; few are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
or New-born at the Birth of Christ. Men
prepare for a time of Excess, and Debauch, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast
to have Richer Apparel, and Choicer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
Money to play, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and some will borrow,
or rob, but they will have to supply these things.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65870:19"/>
And thus while the Flesh keeps Holy-day, the Soul
still drudges in the Work of sin; while our Houses
are trimmed, and our Posts bound with Laurel in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of Triumph and Deliverance, we continue Our
Selves in the Slavery of Vice, and the Thraldom of
the Devil. And the Sun of Righteousness rises and
sets upon us, as the Sun in the Firmament on Rocks
and Buildings, to parch and harden us, not as on
Hearbs and Trees, to make us productive of Fruit.</p>
               <p>'Tis the saddest Prognostick of a Nation to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
when neither the Benefits, nor Judgments
of God work upon the hearts of the People; but
whether it be a Victory, or a Loss; a Plague, or a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance;
a Season of Temporal Blessings, or a Season
of Spiritual; they receive all these Various Changes
of Gods Favour and Displeasure with one Fix't
and Unmov'd Affection to their Sins. And though
like the Deriders of Gods Judgments, which Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> speaks of in his second Epist. and third Chapt.
they blasphemously cry not aloud, <hi>Where is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of the Lords Coming? &amp;c.</hi> yet silently and secretly,
in their very holding fast of their Iniquities, they try
what will be the Issue of his Threats and Denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
against sin, and they Experiment, as I may say,
their Destruction, though they Invoke it not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:65870:20"/>
That this day may be the <hi>Advent</hi> to us not only
of Spiritual Blessings, but also of Temporal; the
drawing neer of Peace or Victory, as well as of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;
of the saving of our Nation, as well as
of the Salvation of our Soules; let us make a fit
Reception in our Hearts for the Lord of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
who now approaches. And God who at
this Season bestowed on us his Son, <hi>How shall he
not,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> says, <hi>with him also freely give us
all things?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have heard Christ's Kingdom is Spiritual,
and his Throne Planted in the Hearts of Men; and
I may say, his Nativity is now also Spiritual, and
his Cradle ought likewise to be planted in the
Hearts of men; that he is then only truly Born in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world, when we become Regenerate; and
seen again in the Flesh, when we shew forth the
Works of Righteousnesse. How little he regards
the meer Outward Magnificence of his Feasts, we
may Collect from the Pomp which he affected, when
he was really born in <hi>Bethlehem Judah,</hi> and when
he made his present Triumphant Entrance into
<hi>Jerusalem;</hi> a Stable serv'd him for the one, and a
Despicable Asse for the other. He that had an
Angell to foretell his Conception, and a whole
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65870:20"/>
Host of them to congratulate his Nativity, had he
so pleas'd, he could have fix't his Cradle in <hi>Herods</hi>
Bed-Chamber, and have forc't the Proud Tyrant
to have fled into <hi>Egypt</hi> in his stead. Again, he
could have Excell'd <hi>Paulus Aemylius,</hi> and all the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi>
in the Splendor of his Triumph: But his
Birth, was the Birth of Meeknesse, of Innocence,
and of Mercy; and when he enter'd in Triumph,
Humility rode in State.</p>
               <p>The Offices of the Church for this day best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
us, how to welcome our Lords Coming.
What in the Collect we pray, let us set our selves to
practice. <hi>To cast away the Workes of Darknesse now in
this Mortal Life, in which Christ came to visit us in great
Humility.</hi> What the People here do in my Text, let
us transcribe and imitate; use their Acclamations,
and also their Ingeminations, <hi>Hosanna to the Son of
David,</hi> and again, <hi>Hosanna.</hi> Reiterating and repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
these <hi>Ave's</hi> and <hi>Good Wishes</hi> to <hi>Christ</hi> in our
<hi>Soules,</hi> a second, third, and fourth time. Tautology
is the Language of Joy, a Hearty Affection is not
satisfi'd with uttering Kind Words of Welcome,
unlesse it may utter the same often. And as Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
accept of Acclamations from their Subjects, as
well as Panegyrihs; continu'd and redoubl'd Shouts
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65870:21"/>
of Joy, as well as Set-Orations; nay, esteem these
Simple Expressions of a Loyal Heart, before more
Studied and Artificial Complements: So God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
many times the Eruptions and Ejaculations of
a Faithfull Soul, before a longer Prayer; the lifting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up
only of the Spirit, before a Formal Psalme. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
and Righteousnesse make the <hi>Esclat</hi> or Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
in Christ's Feasts; when Mens Hearts are full
of Grace, then his Houses are hang'd, and his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
prest with rich Provisions: 'twas not the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and Busy Hous-wifry of <hi>Martha,</hi> but the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
and Abstracted Faith of <hi>Mary</hi> that made the
Entertainment at <hi>Bethany;</hi> and if we will Treat
our Lord acceptably it must not be from the Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
or the Mercers; with the Cooks or the Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
skill; but with the Sacrifices of Obedience, and
the Adornings of the Holy Spirit. Our Feasts upon
Earth must resemble these they typifie in Heaven,
where Righteousnesse is the Robe, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
and Glorifying of God, the Cheer and
the Rejoycing.</p>
               <p>Glory be to God on high, the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, from all Angels, and all Men, and all Creatures,
now and to all Eternity, <hi>Amen.</hi>
