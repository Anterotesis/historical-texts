            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AT a Conference of both Houſes in the painted Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Reported againe as followeth by the Lord Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts
to the houſe of Lords concerning the importance of
imbracing and promoving the deſigne of thoſe Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
who deſire and hope that the ſtate may be eaſed of the
charge of the Iriſh Warre, by the undertaking of particular
adventurers in the houſes of Parliament, London and the
reſt of the Kingdome.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Maſter Whitlocke,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ho managed the conference, acquainted
my Lords, that he was commanded by
the houſe of Commons to preſent a
Vote of that houſe to your Lordſhips,
which being read, he afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.
That whereas your Lordſhips were pleaſed
to returne thankes lately to the King with the Houſe
of Commons for his Maieſties favour expreſſed in
the paſſing of two Bils much importing the ſafety,
quiet and content of this Kingdome, and the King
had thereupon recommended to both houſes the care
<pb facs="tcp:43104:2"/>
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſo as theſe propoſitions read to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
even with relation to that meſſage, were ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
Then he offered by way of pretenſion, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
concerning the tytle, which was, the vote of
the Lords and Commons. This he knew your
Lordſhips underſtood to be but matter of forme,
for your Lordſhips conſent was that, which muſt
make it to be ſo. He then proceeded and offered to
your Lordſhips three motives, each begining and
concluding the entertainement of this courſe.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 The reducing of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2 The proffit of the King.</item>
               <item>3 The eaſe of the people of <hi>England.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>For the firſt, <hi>Ireland</hi> was in that condition, as not
onely the civill power, which was wont to be the
former quarrell, but now even religion, the rooting
up of the proteſtant religion, and extirpation of the
Engliſh is the quarrell.</p>
            <p>The rebels are ſo audacious as to ſcandalize the
King and Queene; and the queſtion is not now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Iriſh or Engliſh, but whether the Proteſtant or
Popiſh Religion ſhall ſtand in that Kingdome; This
Rage of theirs ſtayes not there; they intend to ſtayne
this land with the bloud of Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>The life and ſoule of Religion is now at ſtake, and
<pb facs="tcp:43104:3"/>
hee made no doubt every good Proteſtant will lay
downe his life and fortune for the preſervation of it.</p>
            <p>Then he came to the ſecond motive, which he am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified,
firſt by way of diſadvantage, and ſhewed,
what a loſſe it would be to the King, to be bereaved of
that large and fruitfull Iſland, which was a third part
of the Kings dominions, yea a third Kingdome. He
then ſhewed how much the preſervation of it condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the Kings profit, and how improveable this
would be, by keeping that: now was the time to
make him a through King there, and to eſta<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>liſh the
throne, which had bin diſputed and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ottering in that
Realme theſe 400 yeares.</p>
            <p>He then proceeded to the third motive, and ſaid
the people of England, have lately undergone many
and heavie payments; he meant not thoſe illegall
payments, which were a juſt puniſhment, to ſuch as
would ſubmit to ſuch uniuſt charges, but he ſpake of
the levyes by Parliament, the burthen whereof toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the decay of trade, our neighbours in the
Country were very ſenſible, by thoſe propoſitions
reade to your Lordſhips, the poorer ſort will be eaſed,
the payments made eaſie, becauſe voluntary, and
thereupon will be many and chearefull givers, who
muſt ever have the honour of a memory to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
<pb facs="tcp:43104:3"/>
to ſo good a worke; ſo as where profit is an
ingredient with piety and Loyalty, the plaiſter will
be ſooner applyed to <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When therefore our duty to God, and the King,
may invite to ſo good a worke, he doubted not of
your Lordſhips concurrence with the Houſe of
Commons for the good of that, which was the good
of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid thus much in generall he offered
ſome thing to the propoſitions in particular. That
whereas the firſt Propoſition demanded two Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and halfe of Acres for the undertakers, which
might at firſt ſight looke as a great demand to ſuch as
know not the extent of that Kingdome which is
computed by thoſe who well underſtood the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of it, to containe 15. Millions of Acres, and
therefore to take out two Millions and halfe, when
two parts of three of that Kingdome are in open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
is not ſo great a demand, as may at firſt ſight
appeare; and the propoſition conduceth much to
the raiſing of Rent to the King; He ſaid it was well
knowne that the revenew of the Exchequer, and
Court of wards in <hi>Ireland,</hi> did not exceed the
ſumme of 43000 l. yearely, beſides the Cuſtomes
which your Lordſhips found not great, except in
<pb facs="tcp:43104:4"/>
Monopolies and undue charges, what ever the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
are, they will be by theſe propoſitions much
advanced, 20 or 30 Thouſand pounds a yeare rent
will accrew to the Crowne by the reſervations in
them expreſt, beſides 7 Millions and halfe of Acres,
over and above the two Millions and halfe deſired
in the propoſitions left to the Kings diſpoſall.</p>
            <p>The other propoſitions which are for the manner
of bringing in of the money are very neceſſary, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
being of more conſequence then to diſpatch
this warre.</p>
            <p>He obſerved out of <hi>Livy,</hi> that the Romans made
their warres great and ſhort, ſome they finiſht within
6, ſome within 10, other within 20 dayes, as with
the Samnites, Latins, &amp;c. He did not mention this,
as though it were feaſable for us to conclude this
warre in ſo ſhort a time, but onely to prove by the
Actions of that great State, that nothing is more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to a State, then the ſpeedy diſpatch of a
warre, and he hopes that if this money comes in, the
warre of <hi>Ireland</hi> might be brought to a ſhort iſſue: he
added that he remembred with griefe the former
obſtructions for <hi>Ireland,</hi> but he now hopeth by the
King and your Lordſhips concurrences, that delayes
will be turned into diſpatches; and this was neceſſary
<pb facs="tcp:43104:4"/>
becauſe forragine Princes though now otherwiſe
imployed, will be a wakened by a laſting warre, to
take care of our affaires. He obſerveth the courſe of
<hi>Irelands</hi> firſt plantation, to ſuite much to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
            <p>King <hi>William</hi> the firſt, gave leave to 12 Knights to
goe into <hi>Wales</hi> to get what they could and to plant
themſelves there, from thoſe deſcended <hi>Richard le
ſtrong bow,</hi> firſt Earle of Pembrooke, who made the
firſt impreſſion in that Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Of which <hi>Geraldus Cambrenſis</hi> ſaith, that it ſhould
be maintain'd <hi>Multis caedibus, crebris Conflictibus
multoque certamine,</hi> he hopeth the courſe now in hand
will give a period to that Conqueſt, and this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
and that thoſe intended plantations may be as
proſperous to ſettle, as the former to gaine that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Wherefore this worke being ſo full of piety, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and charity, none ſhall need to ſpeake for it,
the workes ſpeake for it ſelfe. And ſo delivering the
vote of that houſe to your Lordſhips he concluded
the Conference.</p>

               <p>HIs Majeſty being very glad to receive any propoſition that may repaire
the calamitie of his diſtreſſed Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> eſpecially when it
may be without burthen or Impoſition, and for the eaſe of his good Subjects
of this Kingdome, hath graciouſly conſidered the overture made by both Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of Parliament to that purpoſe, and returnes this anſwer.</p>
               <p>That as he hath offered and is ſtill ready to venture his owne Royall perſon
for the recovery of that Kingdome, if his Parliament ſhall adviſe him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
ſoe he will not deny to contribute any other aſſiſtance he can to that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
by parting with any profit or advantage of his owne there, and therefore
relying upon the wiſdome of this Parliament doth conſent to every propoſition
now made to him without taking time to examine whether this courſe may
not retard the reducing of that Kingdome by exaſperating the Rebells and
rendering them deſperate of being receaved into grace, If they ſhall returne to
their obedience; and his Majeſty will be ready to give his Royall Aſſent as to
all ſuch Bills as ſhall be tendered unto him by his Parliament to the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
