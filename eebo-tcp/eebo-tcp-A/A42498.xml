         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I ſhould be too happy, and aboundantly excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable for my boldneſſe in ſpeaking to you this day, if, through Gods aſſiſtance, and your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I might be able ſo to repreſent to you that ſmooth, ſafe, and beautifull way of <hi>Peace and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe</hi>; that by the ſerious and conſciencious fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of them, all of us might orderly and cheerfully goe together, the <hi>Prince</hi> with the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>; and the <hi>People</hi> with the <hi>Prince</hi>; the hearts of each drawing neerer to other, and all to God; to the ſight and fruition of him in whoſe <hi>preſence is fulneſſe of joy, and life for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Text is a <hi>ſacred and ſolemn exhortation,</hi> by which the Spirit of God directs all men the next and onely way to attaine the moſt ſoveraign good, and deſireable end, the <hi>happy ſight of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In it we have, 1 The <hi>precept or direction, Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49417:4"/>
peace with all men, and holineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 The <hi>motive</hi> or inducement, <hi>Without which no man ſhall ſee God:</hi> not promiſſory and affirmative, <hi>for in ſo doing you ſhall ſee God</hi>; but menacing and negative: ſuch being indeed the temper of mens hearts, that they are more terrified with loſſe, than won and invited with the hopes of good; the miſery of ſuffering prevailing more with our hardneſſe, than the happineſſe of enjoying. The horror of being ever ſeparated from the ſight of God, the chiefeſt good of the ſoule, which can import no leſſe than hell and extreme miſery, this happily may ſcare many one to follow Peace and Holineſſe, whom neither the pleaſantneſſe of the way, nor the ampleneſſe of the reward, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to forſake their pleaſing, but yet impure and dangerous courſes.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Precept</hi> we have 1 the <hi>Object,</hi> which is double, <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Holineſſe.</hi> 2 The <hi>Act,</hi> or <hi>Duty,</hi> but one, and ſerves to both; <hi>Follow them.</hi> We will conſider the objects ſeverally in their natures, and carry along the Act or Duty with them.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Of Peace: <hi>Follow peace with all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now although the beauty, ſweetneſſe, and uſefulneſſe of this ſubject (which is ſo agreeable to my mind, and ſo neceſſary to our times, that I ſhould be glad to meet it in every Sermon I make or heare, and in every man with whom I deale) though (I ſay) it might deſerve and juſtifie a large and renewed diſcourſe upon it; yet I may but ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly now ſpeak of it, and onely ſprinkle you with a few drops of this pure and chryſtall ſtream,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49417:5"/>
which makes all to flow with milke and honey whereſoever it runs; in the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> or in the <hi>State,</hi> and <hi>Civill Societies</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have, not long agoe, in a publick, though farre inferiour, Aſſembly, largely diſcourſed of it: And I would not ſeem to doe what I need not, that is, drive two Mills with one ſtreame, ſince the plenty of the other Branch of <hi>Holineſſe</hi> will afford matter ſufficient, and worthy your attention, my ſpeech, and all our practices.</p>
            <p>Onely give me leave to point out briefly to you theſe three things: 1 What this Peace is. 2 How and by whom to be followed. 3 Why.</p>
            <p n="1">1 For this generall Peace, we can better tell what it is by the fruition, than any deſcription of it.</p>
            <p>What <hi>health</hi> is to the body, and <hi>calmneſſe</hi> to the Sea, and <hi>ſerenity</hi> to the day, ſuch is peace to the hearts and converſation of men: it is a kind of ſweet, divine, and heavenly <hi>concent, harmony,</hi> and <hi>beauty</hi> of minds and manners, of affections and actions: it is one of the faireſt and pleaſanteſt fruits of that which among Chriſtians wee call charity, by which each is endeared to other by a mutuall love, and ſtudy of one anothers good, welfare, and happineſſe, as their own, both private and publick, temporall and eternall.</p>
            <p>This muſt be followed to the latitude and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of the ſubject, <hi>with all men, Rom.</hi> 12.18. <hi>As much as in you lies (if it bee poſsible) live peaceably with all men.</hi> As farre as the common bounds of our nature extend we are to follow
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49417:5"/>
peace with all men, ſo farre as men; <hi>Pax cum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus, bellum cum vitiis.</hi> The more thou art an enemy to their enemies, their ſins and vices, the more faithfull friend thou art to them. <hi>Peccata in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terficio homines amplector</hi> is the Motto not onely of every good Magiſtrate, but of every good man; hate and ſlay their ſinnes, but love and ſave their ſoules.</p>
            <p>There is a double bond for it, 1 <hi>Commune vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum naturae,</hi> the common <hi>tie of our nature,</hi> being all of one metall, binds us to peace, by making us ſociable; God having <hi>ſweetned</hi> our nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſavageneſſe and fierceneſſe of other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which are prone and armed to offend: God hath tempered our duſt, and ſoftned our clay with a <hi>ſpring of teares,</hi> a fountain of pity, humanity, and compaſſion above other creatures.
<q>
                  <l>Principio indulſit communis conditor illis</l>
                  <l>Tantùm animam, nobis Animum quoque, mutuus ut nos</l>
                  <l>Affectus petere auxilium, &amp; praeſtare juberet.</l>
               </q>
And again, 
<q>
                  <l>— Molliſsima corda</l>
                  <l>Humano generi dare ſe natura fatetur,</l>
                  <l>Cum lachrymas dedit.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 There is <hi>Commune vinculum Indigentiae:</hi> we are weake and wanting in many things, if alone and at diſtance, which ſociety and communion
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49417:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtrengthens and ſupplies us withall. So that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more agrees to the nature of man, nothing more ſuits to his neceſſities, than to follow peace together, both publick and private.</p>
            <p n="2">2 How muſt we all follow Peace? As of pride and envie comes ſtrife and contention,<note place="margin">Pro.</note> ſo this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall peacefulneſſe proceeds from humility, ſelf-denying, low and moderate opinion of our ſelves, ſtudying our own nothingneſſe and unworthineſſe, in honour preferring one another. This ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, plaines and poliſheth the roughneſſe and aſperity of mens minds and manners, and fits them to follow peace, 1 by avoiding to give offence. 2 By loathneſſe to take offence. 3 By a forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and eaſineſſe to be reconciled, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly offended. 4 By ſeeking for peace, and a faire underſtanding between our ſelves and others; though at preſent, through humane infirmities, things cannot be ſo well compoſed.</p>
            <p>Thus all muſt follow <hi>Peace with all men,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, freely, cheerfully, heartily, conſtantly, not to be damped or diſcouraged; we muſt <hi>proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui</hi> till we doe <hi>aſſequi,</hi> follow till we overtake and obtain it.</p>
            <p>But who? 1 <hi>Princes,</hi> and ſoveraigne Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, the <hi>great Arbitrators of warre and peace,</hi> they muſt follow <hi>Peace with all men,</hi> by equall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall diſtributions of juſtice and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which makes Kingdomes to flouriſh with peace. He that will be <hi>Melchiſalem, King of peace,</hi> muſt be <hi>Melchiſedec, King of righteouſneſſe,</hi> as Chriſt was both.<note place="margin">Heb.</note>

The Father is holy, and the Son holy, and the Spirit holy; in their eſſence, in their relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in their operations. This Holineſſe wee muſt follow. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.48. <hi>Be ye perfect, as your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father is perfect.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Be ye holy, as he that hath called you is holy.</hi> Here is the <hi>rule,</hi> pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, Idea, and Prototype of <hi>Holineſſe</hi>; the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Sun,</hi> and <hi>Sea</hi> of Holineſſe, from whence it derives it ſelfe in the <hi>ſecond place</hi> to reaſonable creatures, <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>men,</hi> who onely are capable of Holineſſe in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe.</p>

by creation, onely the <hi>reaſonable</hi> are veſſels of Holineſſe; which properly is, or at leaſt ought to be in us, <hi>A full and exact conformity of the Soul in all its motions and operations to the will and mind of God.</hi> In the <hi>bleſſed Angels</hi> it is, and was in man at firſt a gift of creation, whereby they and wee were made in the <hi>Image of God, in righteouſneſſe and true Holineſſe.</hi> Since our fall <hi>Holineſſe is a gift of free grace, a ſupernaturall quality or habit infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into the Soule by the Holy Spirit, which by degrees reneweth us to a conformity</hi> (or an unfained ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at leaſt of conformity) <hi>to the will of God</hi>; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all out of conſcience to his command, regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all by to his word, and directing all to his glory.</p>
               <p>This Holineſſe we muſt alſo follow, as the true and onely beauty, honour, riches, pleaſure, and perfection of the ſoule. For, as much as <hi>men</hi> by reaſon exceed beaſts, ſo much doe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by Holineſſe exceed meere men, in their unholy and unregenerate ſtate.

               <p>Yet here it is that <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> is prone to dote and flatter it ſelfe in its outward formalities of Holineſſe (as <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh did in his leaden gods pardon, and the protection of an Hermite and his Reliques, with which he had fortified and barricadoed himſelfe againſt the invaſions of death, but all in vaine.)</p>

               <p>This is one great intent of Chriſts comming, his living with us, and dying for us, that hee might <hi>ſanctifie,</hi> as well as <hi>juſtifie us</hi>; ſave us from the <hi>power</hi> as well as the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of ſinne; that he might give us a moſt perfect and excellent example, and purchaſe <hi>to himſelfe a holy people, Luke</hi> 1.74. <hi>That we being delivered from our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, might ſerve him without feare, in righteouſneſſe and holineſſe all the dayes of our life,</hi> So <hi>Titus</hi> 2.11. <hi>The grace of God that bringeth ſalvation to all men hath appeared, teaching us that denying, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Chriſt is made to us wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, and redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the <hi>fire</hi> that inflames, and the <hi>incenſe</hi> that perfumes all our duties, ſacrifices, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to God, ſo as to make them accepted through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This ſets a value on two <hi>mites,</hi> and a cup of cold <hi>water,</hi> and a handfull of <hi>meale,</hi> without which all externall pompe and coſt of ſervices, is not only not pleaſing, but <hi>fulſome,</hi> nauſeous, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable to God, <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.12 Offer <hi>no more vaine oblations; who hath required theſe things at your

               </p>
               <p>The Heathen ſaw this well, and hath admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expreſſed it,

                     <l>— Quin demus ſuperis —</l>

               <p>Holineſſe is the <hi>Ladder</hi> of heaven, whoſe low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtep is humility, and the higheſt love, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; by which the ſoule deſcends to men in charity, and aſcends to God in piety.</p>
               <p>This is that which prepares and diſpoſeth the ſoule for Heaven; without which Heaven it ſelfe would be no Heaven, or not pleaſing to us: Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be <hi>holy in hell,</hi> if poſſible than <hi>unholy in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>; though theſe two are unſeparable, <hi>Holineſſe</hi> and <hi>Happineſſe</hi>; differing only in degree, not in kinde. For <hi>Holineſſe</hi> is the ſparke of <hi>Happineſſe,</hi> and <hi>happineſſe</hi> the flame of <hi>holineſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Holineſſe is the <hi>infancy</hi> of happineſſe, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe the compleat ſtature of holineſſe.</p>
               <p>Holineſſe is the morning of happineſſe, and happineſſe the <hi>meridian</hi> or <hi>noone-tide</hi> of holineſſe. Holineſſe is the <hi>ſeed-time,</hi> and happineſſe the full <hi>harveſt</hi>: For Heaven is not, as groſſer mindes imagine, onely an <hi>impunity,</hi> or freedome from puniſhment, and fruition of pleaſures, &amp;c. but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49417:13"/>
rather it conſiſts in an immunity from ſin, and a perfection of holineſſe.</p>
               <p>This is that <hi>one thing neceſſary,</hi> and required of the Sons of men, as the condition of ſeeing God; tis not without Riches no man ſhall ſee God; or without Beauty, honour, ſtrength, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, wit, &amp;c. No, but without holineſſe: all other additaments thou maiſt diſpenſe with, and yet be happy; but <hi>Holineſſe is indiſpenſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the <hi>paths of holineſſe</hi> onely our wearied and wandring Soules may returne to paradiſe, that happy ſtate and ſtation, whence we fell, and were driven out: all other waies are ſeverely kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, by the <hi>flaming ſword</hi> of Gods irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liable anger and hatred againſt ſinne: <hi>No unholy thing ſhall enter</hi> (much leſſe remaine) <hi>in the holy City; all ſuch ſhall be caſt out, Rev.</hi> 21.27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Thou art the God that haſt no pleaſure in wickedneſſe, nor ſhall any evill dwell with thee.</hi> God is of ſo pure eyes that he cannot behold iniquity, no more than the Sun can behold darkneſſe; for its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing turnes all darkneſſe into light; much leſſe can darkneſſe looke upon light, or ſinners on God; this is hell neither to ſee, nor to be ſeen of God; whoſe favourable preſence is the life, his abſence the death of the ſoule forever.</p>
               <p>But I have done with the firſt particular, what holineſſe is.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is, who muſt follow it?</p>
               <p>Every one that hath a ſoule to ſave, or a minde to ſee God. The excluſion is peremptory and univerſall; <hi>Without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee God</hi>:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49417:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with this no man need deſpaire, though never ſo defective for other things; without this no man may preſume, <hi>God is no Accepter of perſons.</hi> Not the rich, nor great, nor noble, nor valiant, nor beautifull; not the morally civill, not the witty and learned Scholars, not the deepe Stateſ-men, and darke Polititians, not the potent Princes and mighty Monarchs of the world; none of them may flatter themſelves to reach Heaven without holineſſe: God will caſt deformity on all your ſo much flattered and ſelfe-admiring beauty, which is <hi>deceitfull to the owner,</hi> and dangerous to others; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the beauty of holineſſe be added to thee, like Apples of Gold in pictures of ſilver, which makes thee lovely not only to good minds on earth, but alſo to the Angels, and God himſelfe in Heaven.</p>
               <p>God will <hi>infatuate</hi> all your <hi>fallacious</hi> wiſedome and ſelfe-deſtroying wit: he will diſcover the ſhallowneſſe of all your imaginary depths and counſels. He will one day appeare the only true wiſe man, who is wiſe for his ſoule to God and to Eternity, which is none but the holy man.</p>
               <p>God will make to vaniſh all the dreames and ſhadowes of your imaginary greatneſſe, and flat the ſwelling ſailes of your titles of honour, fild only with popular breath and opinion of men, your ſelves and others: He will be then truely and only honourable who hath ſought Gods honour, more than his owne, whom God will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his ſacred preſence and favour: this is none but the holy man.</p>
               <p>Nay God will caſt contempt upon Princes, as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49417:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes, and in ſtead of Robes of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, they ſhall be covered with their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion as with a cloake, unleſſe they be ſacred in <hi>heart</hi> as wel as in <hi>title</hi>; conſecrated to God as wel as exalted above men; except there be the inward annointing of Gods holy Spirit, as wel as the outward of the Prelate. As they are neere to God in greatneſſe and place, ſo they muſt be in grace and holineſſe, if ever they hope to attaine to glory and happineſſe. Even in <hi>Princes</hi> God tels <hi>Samuel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 16</note> 
                  <hi>He lookes not at the outward appearance, but at the heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That, that indeed is truely <hi>Sacred Majeſty</hi> in Princes, when being Gods Vicegerents on earth, they doe that which they are perſwaded in their conſcience God himſelfe or Chriſt would doe, if they reigned viſibly as King on earth: when being <hi>Vmbratiles Dij,</hi> the back parts and ſhadowes of God, they moſt fully repreſent in a humane model, the divine perfections.</p>
               <p>Certainely nothing ſets forth Princes to a more divine honour, love and veneration, than their exemplary vertues and holineſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hic animus, atque hae ſunt generoſi Principis artes.</hi> This even they, the greateſt of men, muſt follow, ſince they are but <hi>Mortales Dij,</hi> and muſt die like men; unleſſe they meane to come infinitely below the meaneſt of their good Subjects in the other world, whom in this they ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p>Indeed all of us, both great and ſmall muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low holineſſe, ſince all have relation to ſo holy a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49417:14"/>
Creator, to ſo holy a Redeemer, and to ſo holy a Comforter, being Subjects to the King of Saints.</p>
               <p>Yea, we are, or ſhould be the habitation and <hi>Temple</hi> wherein God will delight to dwell, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. <hi>If any man defile the Temple of God, him will God deſtroy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay we are the Heaven where God reſides: every Saint (ſaith Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>) is Gods <hi>Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> and every holy heart a Heaven; therefore that is called the <hi>Heaven of Heavens</hi> where the Saints are; in every of whom God dwels more gloriouſly than in any materiall Heaven.</p>
               <p>In all <hi>callings</hi> and ſtates of life <hi>holineſſe</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; every action ſhould be a ſtep to arrive neerer to God: Holineſſe is the poore mans riches, the meane mans honour, the weak mans ſtrength, the baniſheds home, the priſoners free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the young mans glory, the old mans crowne, the ſick mans health, the dying mans hope and life: In a word it is all in all to all men dying and living. The <hi>weight of this text</hi> lies upon <hi>All,</hi> to move them to follow holineſſe, and thoſe eſpecially who have moſt impediments and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions, yet their actions are moſt exemplary, whether they be good or bad.</p>
               <p>O when power and piety, greatneſſe and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, heigth and holineſſe meet together, and make up one Magiſtrate, one Miniſter, one King, how divine, how glorious, how attractive, and commanding all hearts to a love or feare, are their lives and actions! Like a <hi>noble conſtellation</hi> which conſiſts of many ſtars, no leſſe benigne and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49417:15"/>
propitious for their influence, than eminent and conſpicuous for their light.</p>
               <p>And if I were to ſpeake to men of my owne calling, ſuperiors or equalls (as I ſee I am likely to doe to ſome) I ſhould with all humble and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective earneſtneſſe recommend Holineſſe to their hearts, thoughts, words, lives, geſtures, lookes, and converſations. <hi>Etiam vultu laeditur ſanctitas: Haughty and ſupercilious lookes,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent comportment, much more ſuch ſpeech and actions miſ-become the holineſſe and humility of our profeſſion.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>holy orders,</hi> and <hi>holy duties,</hi> to which we are admitted; and there is a ſpeciall ceremony of <hi>conſecration</hi> uſed for Biſhops. O let us make good the holineſſe of our titles and function, by the hloineſſe of our converſation.</p>
               <p>Let not the world reproach us, as ſome doe the vanity and arrogancy of the <hi>Popes,</hi> who challenge to themſelves the title of <hi>his Holineſſe</hi>; by way of eminency (or emphaſis) when indeed it is (ſay they) by <hi>Antiphraſis,</hi> or contrariety, being for the moſt part ſoleciſmes and contradictions to their names, as he ſaid of <hi>Probus, vir minimè probus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O let us never vainely imagine, that there is a neerer way to the <hi>Clergies honour,</hi> than by the <hi>Clergies Holineſſe.</hi> Though Holineſſe even deſpiſed as a Jewell under foot, hath its true and internall honour and value ſtill.</p>
               <p>But O let not our preaching, our writing, our living any way decry, damp, and diſcountenance
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49417:15"/>
Holineſſe, which is Gods honour, and the Churches honour, and muſt be our both honour and happineſſe.</p>
               <p>O let us not vainely contend for an <hi>imputed</hi> and relative <hi>Holineſſe</hi> in Churches, and tables, and veſtures, and geſtures, and neglect it in our hearts and lives. Our word muſt be that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Be ye followers of me as I am of Chriſt,</hi> that is, <hi>of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, which was Chriſts way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, not onely the <hi>better world,</hi> which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely aſhamed and grieved for the contrary, but even the worſer, diſſolute, and debauched ſort of people exact of us, whom we harden extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt our doctrines by our contrary manners; and who are glad by the faults and ſcandalls of Miniſters (holy men as they ſhould be) to juſtifie or excuſe their owne vitious and unholy lives.</p>
               <p>The higher our calling raiſeth us, the neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhould it bring us to God, and the more ſhould the face of our lives like <hi>Moſes</hi> his, ſhine with the beames of holineſſe while we daily converſe with God.</p>
               <p>Nothing more juſtifies, and aſſures the truth of our faith and doctrine, than the ſutable holineſſe of our lives. (let not that be verified of us, which <hi>Ieremy</hi> complained of in his time,<note place="margin">Ier. 23.15.</note>

               <p n="2">2 Follow it <hi>earneſtly,</hi> with vehement affections, not cold, languiſhing, lukewarme and indifferent; content not thy ſelfe with a few poſting and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functory prayers; eaſie and lazy formalities of duties, <hi>obeſae animae,</hi> like fat and purſie ſoules that cannot follow either faſt, or farre: But riſe to that intenſiveneſſe in following Holineſſe, with which the Covetous man followes his gain, the Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous his honour, the Voluptuous his pleaſure; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it with the ſame eagerneſſe, wherewith thou

               <p>The deadneſſe and indiſpoſitions from within, which we are Subject unto, are not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the wayes of holineſſe, but to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our natures; as the lothneſſe to uſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe proceedeth from the ill humors, which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the Spirits in a diſeaſed body, and not from the inconvenience of exerciſe, which is the way to diſpel thoſe ill humours, and to recover health and agility.

               <p>Follow holineſſe, not <hi>timidè &amp; pudibundè</hi>; it is <hi>pudendus pudor,</hi> a ſhame infinitely to be aſhamed of, that any Chiſtian ſhould be aſhamed to be, or to be thought too holy; but that he muſt now and then dare to ſweare, and ly, and talke obſcene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; prophanely, or live riotouſly, that he may not ſeeme too preciſe.

Nothing hath more clouded, ecclipſed and deformed the beauty of holineſſe, than the impudent pretentions of ſome to it; who like Apes and Monkies are the more deformed and ridiculous, becauſe in ſome things they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the ſhape, and imitate the actions of men, but want their reaſon, <hi>Galat.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked, what a man ſowes that he ſhall reape</hi>: He that ſowes only ſhadowes, and ſhewes, and formalities of holineſſe, ſhall reape only ſhadowes and ſhewes and dreames of peace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and happineſſe. The deceiver will at laſt be moſt deceived. O be good in good earneſt, or not at all; Loſe not ſo much time and paines to act a part of holineſſe, which will but improve thy miſery: what is it to be applauded of men, and abhorred of God? <hi>What is the hope of the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite</hi> (ſaith he in <hi>Iob) when God ſhall take away his ſoule?</hi>

               <p n="7">7 And laſtly, follow holineſſe <hi>conſtantly,</hi> not <hi>deſultoriè,</hi> lamely, brokenly, and abruptly, by fits only; but with a ſteddy and reſolute courſe, as the Sun moves, neither going backe, nor ſtanding ſtill. <hi>Perſeverance</hi> is the <hi>crowne</hi> of graces, and gets the crowne of Glory: thou expecteſt God ſhould make thee inceſſantly happy in his Eternity; O be thou holy (<hi>in tua aeternitate</hi> as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>) in thy limited and ſhort eternity.</p>

               <p>O let no <hi>difficulties</hi> take thee off, nor errors di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert thee, let them rather whet and exaſperate thy reſolutions and endeavours; let no ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deceive thee, nor perſecution deterre thee; having <hi>begunne in the ſpirit, doe not end in the fleſh.</hi>

               <p>Heroick and invincible followers of holineſſe, now glorious and immortall poſſeſſors of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>Praeclara ſpectantibus mediocria praeſtare pudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri eſſe debet</hi>: having ſo noble and inviting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples ſet before us, it is a ſhame for us either to follow them not at all, or with weake and ſlender imitations.</p>

               <p>But this is a point of ſo high ſpeculation, of ſo ſerious conſideration for the obtaining or looſing of it, of ſo infinite comfort is the viſion and frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God; of ſo infinite honour, the ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from him, that it would farre exceed the time, and my ſpeech, to ſet it forth to you as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.</p>
               <p>Onely this ſhort glimpſe we may take of it, That there are many intervenient fruits of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe worth our ambition here, by which <hi>we ſee God,</hi> though dimly, &amp; at diſtance in his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> in his <hi>Sacraments,</hi> in his <hi>Son</hi> our <hi>Saviour,</hi> in his <hi>workes,</hi> in his <hi>ſervants,</hi> in the motions <hi>of his</hi> Spirit, in the <hi>wayes of his</hi> providence, <hi>mercies</hi> and <hi>judgements.</hi> To all which Holineſſe only cleares and enlightens and enables the ſoule ſo as to ſee God, to enjoy and admire him.

               <p>O What a Sea and inundation of unſpeakeable joy and happineſſe muſt flow in upon the ſoule, to behold the brightneſſe of Gods preſence, the glory of his Majeſty, the beauty of his goodneſſe, the treaſures of his wiſedome, the immenſity of his power, the amplitude of his mercy, the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his holineſſe and infinite happineſſe! And laſt of all, the eternall wonder of his free and unchangeable love to us, ſo much below him, ſo as nothing in compariſon of him!</p>
               <p>In <hi>thy light</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>wee ſhall ſee light</hi>; the way is by the <hi>light of grace,</hi> to come to the <hi>light of glory</hi>; by the beauty of holineſſe to come to the perfection of happineſſe, which is the ſight of God: which what it is we ſhall beſt tell when we come to it. I muſt now leave it to the worke of Gods Spirit in your devouter hearts, to conſider more largely and ſublimely of this point.</p>
               <p>Onely give me leave by way of concluſion to appeale to your piety, wiſedome, and experience, Whether the waies of holineſſe be not worth the following, which end in ſuch happineſſe, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expreſſing: Whether it be not a vanity,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49417:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
folly, and extreame madneſſe for men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that are built for eternity, and capable of the higheſt good, ſo much to neglect their ſoules, their God, and their happineſſe by following their ſins, the worldly pleaſures, profits, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, with the neglect of holineſſe? The <hi>Devill,</hi> the <hi>evill world,</hi> and a mans <hi>owne corrupt heart,</hi> will allow him to bee any thing, ſo he be not holy: let him bee rich, and faire, and ſtrong, and great, and honourable, and witty, and eloquent, and civill, and politicke, and knowing even in divine myſteries, any thing, ſo as hee bee not holy. All <hi>theſe things</hi> (as the Devill ſaid to Chriſt) <hi>will I give thee,</hi> if thou wilt be unholy ſtill, and like my ſelfe: Holineſſe is that alone the Devill wants, and deſpaires of himſelfe, and that he moſt envies us the ſons of men; becauſe hee knowes it ſets us in a way of happineſſe ſo infinitely above him.</p>
               <p>But what our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.22. to the young man that deſired reſpite to bury his dead Father, <hi>Let the dead bury the dead, but follow thou me.</hi> This give me leave to ſay to all you that heare me this day; let dead hearts bury themſelves in dead comforts, dead honours, dead plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, dead hopes, &amp;c. but follow thou Chriſt, follow Holineſſe.</p>
               <p>I further appeale to the juſtice of your piety, and goodneſſe, Whether the waies of holineſſe, and the followers of them deſerve to be derided, deſpiſed, diſcountenanced, &amp; diſcouraged ſo much as they are by the proud, prophane, ſenſuall, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49417:20"/>
ſuperſtitious mindes of the world? whether they which deſpiſe holineſſe doe not withall deſpiſe <hi>their owne ſoules,</hi> their God and Saviour? whether they <hi>forſake not their owne mercies, who follow lying vanities</hi>? whether this be not to <hi>glory in our ſhame,</hi> to be aſhamed of that which is the glory of God, and the reaſonable creature?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I appeale to your royall wiſedome, and the reſt of your Noble and Chriſtian Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence &amp; Piety, Whether thoſe that follow peace and Holineſſe, and are fitted to a capacity of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great God and King of Heaven in his Glory, be not alſo the worthieſt and fitteſt to ſee the face and enjoy the favours of Chriſtian Kings on earth?</p>
               <p>Theſe, theſe are they that beſt know the duty, honour, and fidelity, they owe to Majeſty; and make a conſcience to pay it, becauſe it is a point of Holineſſe ſo to doe. Theſe are the <hi>propugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula &amp; munimenta regni &amp; Eccleſiae,</hi> as was ſaid of Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> the ſtrength, honour, and ſecurity of the Church and State, under God and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties care and pious providence. Theſe are in ſome ſort, the (<hi>tutelares Genii</hi>) protectors of his Majeſties perſon, health, life, Crowne, Queene, and poſterity; while they daily lift up pure hands and holy hearts to the God of Heaven, for his Majeſties ſafety, honour, and happineſſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe are like <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias, the Horſemen and Chariots of Iſrael</hi>; theſe have power with God by their prayers, counſells, and good examples; they ſtand in the gap, and hinder the inundation
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49417:21"/>
of ſin and judgements. To theſe we owe under God the enjoyment of our peace, plenty, ſafety, and Religion, and of the bleſſing of bleſſings tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, <hi>a pious and gratious Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O then let not <hi>Holineſſe</hi> (I beſeech you) bee <hi>baniſhed,</hi> as I beleeve it is not, from your hearts, your words, your houſes, your lives, from your favour and good opinion, from your ſervice; nor from your Court: Let there not be wanting in this place <hi>Ioſephs,</hi> and <hi>Mordecays,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiahs,</hi> and <hi>Daniels,</hi> men in whom <hi>is the Spirit of the holy God,</hi> as that Heathen Prince ſaid of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a Booke called <hi>The holy Court,</hi> which might be uſefull to Courtiers, if it were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe, being larded with many falſe and frivolous opinions, and ſuperſtitious practiſes: It will bee your honour and happineſſe to act what he ſought to write.</p>
               <p>O follow not ſinne and vanity, or ſtrife and contention, or lubricity and impurity, or vaine-glory, &amp;c. theſe will caſt you out from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and betray you to utter darkneſſe: And what conſiderate minde can with patience thinke of being ever ſeparated from the fountaine of its being, life and happineſſe? O what infinite darkneſſe, neceſſity, and horror muſt for ever op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe that ſoule! Holineſſe only is that divine magnetick power, which drawes the ſoule to God, and God to the ſoule, never quiet till it be united to the fountaine, its vertue.</p>
               <p>I know your piety cannot but conſider oft and ſeriouſly, That the greateſt of you will be one

day like <hi>Sampſon</hi> (when his <hi>fatall</hi> haire was cut) weak, and impotent and like other men; your eyes blinded, your great ſtrength departed, the chaines of darkneſſe will involve you, the wormes will be your fetters, and the grave your priſon.</p>
               <p>O while you live follow holineſſe, that when you die (as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did) you may quite deſtroy thoſe enimies, which living you could not; that death may be an end of your ſinne and mortality, but the beginning and conſummation of your endleſſe happineſſe in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>That when the eyes of your bodies ſhall be ſhut to this world, and all things deſirable here; the eye of your ſoule (<hi>that rationall and eternall eye</hi>) may be opened to ſee and enjoy God, and reigne with Chriſt for ever.</p>
               <p>That you and we though in different degrees, may then receive that <hi>Crowne of immortall glory,</hi> which is free from cares and croſſes, from feares and jealouſies, from ſleep, and ſoule-breaking diſtractions, but full of a divine and conſtant glory, ſerenity, joy, and eternall ſecurity. <hi>Amen.</hi>

and <hi>inſufficiency</hi> of all things under the Sun, which rather <hi>ſatiate</hi> than <hi>ſatisfie</hi>: which keeps our ſoules in a continuall appetite and longing, ſtill expecting to finde that content in what is New and unexperienced, which they have hitherto fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of.</p>
            <p>Thus daily deceiving the tediouſneſſe of our life, (which for the main is but the <hi>Crambe,</hi> and repetition of yeſterday) by the ſweetneſſe of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, and a taſte of <hi>novelty,</hi> which are the ſauce and ſeaſoning of all things wee enjoy.—<hi>New faſhions,</hi> New cloaths, New houſes, New Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, New opinions, New Countrey, New Teachers: Any thing New; though, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaid of the Wines, The elder bee the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>Omne enim antiquius &amp; verius &amp; melius.</hi> In manners and Doctrines, for the moſt part, it holds, The elder is the better and truer.</p>
            <p>Yea ſo <hi>ſtudious</hi> are wee of Newneſſe, that our whole life is but a repairing and continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of what through age and infirmity is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decaying in us; ſeeking in vaine to blot out the footſteps of old age, and with weak endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to row againſt the ſtreame of Time, which ſilently and inſenſibly carries us, and all things, downward to the Gulph of death and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: which as it hath involved all, the moſt renowned men, Cities, States, and Monuments, (<hi>ut &amp; ipſae periere ruinae</hi>) that the very ruines are now ruined; ſo will it ſhortly ſwallow up us, and all that wee magnifie and eſteeme as ours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:49417:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>Yet there is one thing in us, whoſe ruines, though they oppreſſe us, they grieve us not; and though they make us miſerable they offend not; Theſe are the Impairings and Decayes of our beſt and Divineſt part, our ſpirits and mindes. Theſe, wee are patient, as wee grow elder, they ſhould grow worſer; and though they are pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces built for eternity, yet wee ſuffer them, as much as in us lyes, to lapſe and fall to eternall ruines; not only of their happineſſe, but of their very Being: <hi>In quantum enim mali ſumus, in tantum minus ſumus,</hi> The more wee have of ſin,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aquin.</hi>
               </note> the leſſe wee have of wel-Being, and deſerve to have of ſimple Being; becauſe wee fruſtrate that end, for which the wiſe and beſt Maker gave us our Being: And by ſin wee goe farther from the Fountaine of our Being, and our Happineſſe, his will; which is the rule of Goodneſſe: And hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe is nothing elſe but a perfection of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>Yet the power of God will perpetuate wicked men, by a neceſſity of being, to all eternity, That ſince they would not bee the Objects of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing Mercies to happineſſe, They ſhould be the Subjects of his revenging Juſtice to everlaſting miſeries.</p>
            <p>Theſe ruines and decayes then, which of all are moſt conſiderable, becauſe moſt dangerous, well merit our ſurvey and care; eſpecially if wee ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly weigh, how vaſt the decayes are, how ſhort the time is allotted for this work, being <hi>magnae mentis &amp; molis opus,</hi> a great deſigne indeed; and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49417:48"/>
which falls not under the compaſſe of low, nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and ſmaller ſpirits; but requires a raiſed, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and ennobled minde, to begin, to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, and to perfect it.</p>
            <p>Which that wee may doe with the more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſucceſſe, Let us look to this Modell of the bleſſed Apoſtle; who having in the 21. and 22. verſes caſt away all that traſh, and rubbiſh of the old man, which is not ſo much ruined, as Ruine it ſelfe; In this verſe layes the Foundation of this ſtately ſtructure, whoſe heigth muſt reach to Heaven, and whoſe paterne is the Beauty and Image of that firſt, perfect, and divineſt mind, which wee call God.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In the words are two main things. 1. The Subject of our worke: <hi>The ſpirit of our mind.</hi> 2. The Nature of the work: <hi>Renewing.</hi> Wee will ſeek to comprehend them both under theſe foure Heads of Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 What is this Spirit of our mind, and how worthy Renewing.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Wherein it is Impaired, and needs Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="3">3 How, and by what meanes it is to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The Idea, or Character of a renewed Mind.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Wee will conclude ſo, as by Gods Grace may make the deepeſt Impreſſions on your minds; and at once incite and enable you to ſo ſerious, ſo ſacred, ſo Chriſtian, ſo divine, ſo neceſſary a work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:49417:48"/>The firſt thing that requires your Attention is the Subject, <hi>The Spirit of your mind.</hi> What it is.</p>
            <p>Some Interpreters underſtand, that <hi>holy Spirit which is in the mind:</hi> Thus <hi>Oecumenius, Gorran, A Lapide,</hi> and others: as if it were, Be renewed by that Spirit of God which dwels and walks in your minds. But this ſeemes to force the words.</p>
            <p>Therefore S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and others more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently thus. Though the words be two, yet the Subject is but one; <hi>non duas res intelligi voluit, quaſi aliud ſit mens, aliud Spiritus mentis; ſed quia omnis mens Spiritus est, non autem omnis Spiritus mens est, ideo dicere voluit, Spiritu mentis, i. e. in Spiritu qui mens vocatur.</hi> It is no more, but be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in that Spirit which is your Mind.</p>
            <p>This ſenſe agrees with that parallell place: <hi>Be yee transformed by the renewing of your minds.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2.</note> Where the word is but one, the meaning the ſame.</p>
            <p>The Acuteneſſe of ſome put this difference; <hi>Mens est Spiritus remiſſus, Spiritus est mens inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> The Spirit is the Mind moved, the Mind is the Spirit compoſed. <hi>Spiritus est mentis impetus,</hi> That the Spirit is the vigour, livelineſſe and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Mind; by which it is ſtirred up, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to, and exerciſed about its Object. That the ſubſtance of the Soule is as the <hi>Sun,</hi> the Mind as the <hi>Light,</hi> The Spirit as the <hi>Heat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe may ſeeme niceties, beyond the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall intent, which by the moſt and beſt is conceived to aime at that <hi>Princeps Animae facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi>

And the nearer the mind approaches by faith to God, the more it partakes of his light and grace; the more is the divine Image renewed in the mind and whole man, which wee call <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>; which is a ſtudy of conformity to the will of God, ariſing from the apprehenſion and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of his goodneſſe in himſelfe, and his love to us in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For untill a man believes this truth of God in the Goſpel, and ſees thoſe better things offered to him in Chriſt, hee cannot mind the things of God, with any delight or comfort; as being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incredible, or impertinent and unprofitable unto him; The myſteries of God being, as that of regeneration to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi>

               <p>Till we believe God will <hi>ſave us,</hi> as he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, upon our turning from ſin to Chriſt, wee cannot ſerve him with that free and faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as hee requires.</p>

cannot quit our minds of other things, and chooſe him for our higheſt good and only happineſſe. Therefore wee ſee the <hi>low and narrow minds</hi> of men out of Chriſt, ſeek only to ſupply their wants and pleaſe themſelves with theſe ſmall, tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and appearing good things which this life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords. <hi>Their deſires</hi> and feares, their ſhadowes of content, their dreames of honour, of happineſſe how meane and poore! how falſe and deluding! how much to be pittied! having nothing in their ayme, which is worthy the minds dignity, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the ſoules infinite capacity and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Only true Chriſtians, that is, Beleevers, above all ſects and profeſſions, have given great proofe of the true <hi>magnanimity</hi> of their noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous minds, both in doing and ſuffering; <hi>having minds</hi> by faith renewed, and ſo raiſed, that they were able to <hi>deſpiſe</hi> all that the world eſteemed, to <hi>contemne</hi> all they threatned or inflicted, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny themſelves unto death; their minds being fixed on that life, treaſure, and happineſſe, which God hath offered to mankind in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>So then, <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> wee ſee, is that firſt, great, and ſoveraigne object, whom whilſt our minds by faith look upon, they are renewed, raiſed, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ennobled, and transformed: the <hi>mind</hi> of Chriſt being that excellent paterne and type by which ours muſt be renewed,<note place="margin">

Although the <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>beauty</hi> of this Subject be ſuch, as might well ſave me the labour of ſtirring up your affections; preſuming that I ſpeak to an <hi>Audience,</hi> for the moſt part, piouſly learned, and judiciouſly devout: Who, I hope, heare your ſelves rather commended, for what you have already begun to doe, than either taught what to doe, or taxed for being wanting in a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe ſo well-worthy your ſelves, and your beſt endeavours; as this is, the Renewing of your minds.</p>
               <p>And indeed I think my ſelfe happy, (Reverend and the reſt learned Auditors) that, by your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, I have this opportunity offered me (which my owne weakneſſe might not have aſpired un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) that is, To recommend ſo ſerious, ſublime, and neceſſary an Argument, as this of the Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our minds, to ſo noble, ſo learned, ſo choice,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49417:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and conſiderable an Aſſembly, conſiſting of Minds and Spirits more elevated, enlarged and ennobled than ordinary.</p>
               <p>And certainly, this duty of renewing our minds, as it concernes all men, ſo it challengeth the practice of it, from none more than from you: To whom it will bee an extreme ſhame to bee exceeded by others in piety and holineſſe, as much as you exceed them in learning and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>O Let not that of S. <hi>Augustine</hi> bee verefied of us: <hi>Indocti rapiunt coelum, nos cum doctrinis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris perimus.</hi> Poore and ſimple minded men crowd into heaven, and wee with all our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning coldly and ſcarcely creep thitherward.</p>
               <p>It will bee little comfort at laſt to dye with thoſe words, <hi>Quantus Artifex pereo?</hi> The <hi>fall of Angels,</hi> you know, was the moſt deſperate and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reparable: the <hi>cleerer</hi> the light, againſt which wee ſin, the ſtraiter and heavier will the chaines of everlaſting darkneſſely upon us.</p>
               <p>It is not <hi>learning,</hi> but renewed, that is, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied learning that will comfort us, that will ſave us, that will ſecure us, while wee preach to others the way of life, our ſelves ſhall not be caſt-awayes. The <hi>new-fangled and phantastick mind</hi> indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth learning,; but the renewed mind prizeth it, ſeeks it, and uſeth it aright, with humility, with modeſty, with induſtry, with the love of truth, with obedience to it, with a care and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe to the ſoules of poore people, with conſcience to diſpenſe its talents to the glory
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49417:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of God, and good of mankinde.</p>
               <p>Never did <hi>any times</hi> (indeed) require and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act more of learned men and Scholars, than theſe now doe, in point of renewing our minds, our lives, our manners, to the paterne in the Mount, the example of Chriſt and his holy Apoſtles. <hi>The faults</hi> you ſee of ſome, are made the reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of all, by the raſh, unjuſt, and ignorant cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of many, who offended with ſome drone or waſpe will bee revenged by overthrowing the whole Hive of Bees. O let us confute their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, repreſſe their inſolencies, diſarme their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and if it be poſſible occaſion their envy, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than their contumelious pitty, by a ſerious, ſpeedy, and conſcientious following this precept, and the example too; which is moſt noble and imitable in this great Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi>; whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed mind had learned in all eſtates to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to count Godlineſſe great gaine, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to know nothing but Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified, to glory in the croſſe of Chriſt, to eſteeme all worldly wiſedome vaine, and fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, without the knowledge of God in Chriſt, to live with all good conſcience before God and men.</p>
               <p>This, this method of renewing our minds and lives to piety, holineſſe, humility and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe, will undoubtedly renew upon us, the love and favour, the honour and integrity of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>It is certaine the world <hi>cannot want us,</hi> except they will be wanting to themſelves, in the moſt

ſordid, ſupine and brutiſh negligence that can be. <hi>It defends</hi> upon us what opinion and eſteeme men ſhall have of us.</p>
               <p>Wee ſhall eaſily overcome all the difficulties and indignities of theſe times, if wee can but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome our hearts to this ſacred renovation, which will render us accepted and honoured both of God, and of all wiſe, learned and good men; whoſe wiſedome and juſtice, no doubt, will as they ought diſcerne betweene the juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome, and the noble encouragement of others; nor ſuffer the diſpleaſure againſt ſome mens abuſe of things to ſwallow up the lawfull, juſt, and commendable uſe of them.</p>
               <p>For the ignorant, brutiſh and impertinent cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of others, your only way is to let them weary themſelves, with their owne oblatrations; while you, as the cleere moone in a ſpheare above them, neither alter the conſtancy of your courſe in learned ſtudies, nor abate ought of the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of your manners, in a renewed, that is, a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied life and converſation.</p>
