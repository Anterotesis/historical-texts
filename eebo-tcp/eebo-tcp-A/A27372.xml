            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE IRISH SPAW; With a ſhort Diſcourſe on Mineral Waters in general, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HAving been informed that neer unto this City there is a Spring of Mineral Waters, of which divers perſons have drank
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54049:6"/>
with good ſucceſs, as to the Cure of ſome particular Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; I thought this a fit Subject on which to entertain my thoughts during my ſtay in this City, in order to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover its particular Virtues and Uſe, by the anatomiſing of its parts, and by a Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal examination of thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals &amp; Minerals, from whence it derived its Virtues.</p>
            <p>In this deſign I tranſported my ſelf upon the adjacent places to this Spring, and there examin'd the Soil, Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, diſtance from freſh and ſalt Waters, its Sediment in the Spring, the moſt proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Hills. Next I conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Water it ſelf, its Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54049:6"/>
Odour, Taſt, Brightneſs, Weight, and Softneſs; and what Skin, Film or Skum it did afford on the ſuperficies.</p>
            <p>Having made ſome imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate obſervations on all theſe circumſtantial accidents, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied my ſelf unto ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as might give me, what further obſervations they could, as to the Strength of the Water, when it was firſt found, the cauſes and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of its Decay, and its Effects, both internal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.</p>
            <p>To this I added thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations which I made dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the divers tryals and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, which are uſually
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54049:7"/>
performed with Galls, Oak-leaves, Oaken-veſſels, Allum, Spirit of Harts Horn, diſtill'd Vinager, Oil of Vitriol, Oil of Tartar, mixing, heating, and boyling of it with Milk, and the like; All which tryals ſtanding good (though weak) but having no effect at all on Milk. In the next place I entred upon the more judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Philoſophical way of examination, by Fire, after a more particular method then is common, whereby the Gaſs Silveſter, or wild volatile Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are ſo preſerv'd that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may paſs upon them, as well and with as much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage as on thoſe more groſs and terrene parts, which are rendred viſible, not only
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54049:7"/>
through common Diſtillation, but by Precipitation alſo. By theſe examens I was inform'd of the Minerals with which it was imbued, though not to that degree that I could wiſh, through its late mixture with common Waters.</p>
            <p>Having found that though this Mineral Water is tinged with ſuch Minerals as other efficatious Mineral Waters are, yet in ſo ſmall a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as would not raiſe any great hopes of ſucceſs in the Cure of obſtinate chronical Diſeaſes, but that like unto other weakly impregnated Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waters in other parts, it would require ſome Stimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator, to add more virtue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54049:8"/>
its weakneſs; I thought it convenient to give here a ſhort account of Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in general, to mention the inconveniencies which uſually attend weakly imbued Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to offer at the means to ſupply thoſe defects, and to render them not only e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the moſt powerful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Mineral Springs, but even to ſurpaſs them. Which I will endeavour to perform with the greateſt brevity that I can poſſible, conſidering the large extant of this Subject; after which I ſhall fall upon this particular Water, which is the Theme of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>That there is a univerſal
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54049:8"/>
Spirit, or <hi>Spiritus mundi,</hi> which God hath eſtabliſhed for the continuation of the Species, which Spirit gives a life to all beings, is a truth long ſince agreed upon by the Learned; but how, and through what conveyers, this Spirit is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and diſtributed into every individual being, is that point unto which I would come as neer, as this Subject does require, without amplification.</p>
            <p>Springs have been placed and appointed by a Divine Providence, in the Earth, for the ſame uſe, as is the Air, on the ſurface of it, to be the Vehicles by which this <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Spirit of the World</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:54049:9"/>
ſhould be communicated to all the parts thereof; yet with this difference, that whereas in the Air that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controled Spirit acts more in its purity; in the Waters it is attracted by matter, and ſo becomes adherent to it.</p>
            <p>The chief attracting mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Spirit, is by the Philoſophers eſteemed to be <hi>Vitriol,</hi> in which is contained that ſubtle acid Juice of the Earth, the ſole cauſe of that univerſal Fermentation which precedes all natural producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; this its external Green and Azurine colours, its inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal acidity and its magnetick property teſtifies; its Sulphur
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54049:9"/>
being that which attracts to it ſelf the univerſal Spirit, that opens, unites, gathers and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulates the ſubterraneous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, and forms them into Mineral and Metallick ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>Without diſpute <hi>Venus</hi> is moſt apparent in this <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;</hi> and therefore moſt inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly feigned (by thoſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets that were Philoſophers) to be the Principle or <hi>Mother</hi> of all natural production, which is manifeſted by its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Redneſs; that genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Blood of Nature, with which ſhe ferments all her Seeds, and of them produces ſuch varieties of <hi>Minerals, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables</hi> and <hi>Animals,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54049:10"/>
to the nature of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Matrix.</p>
            <p>This animated <hi>Vitriol</hi> is diſſolv'd in the Waters as they paſs thorough ſubterraneous concaves, and thence diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted throughout the whole Globe, that from thence, all things might receive their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nurture and conſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But as theſe Waters in their progreſs, ſometime do run through the veins and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the beds of Minerals and Metals, ſo they are more or leſs impregnated with the Medicinal properties of the ſaid Minerals, according to the time of their ſtay upon them, and the compactneſs or flexibility of their Natures,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54049:10"/>
whence ariſing to the ſurface of the Earth, they flow in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſtreams of Health.</p>
            <p>It was ſome reflections on this which gave occaſion to a Philoſopher to ſay, <hi>Fontes definire Arduum eſt, cum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aquam quam habent natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralem, &amp; in ſitam, Spiritum e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam habeant mundi, ex quo omnia producuntur cujus ſolius Fontes ſunt delatores per univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam Terram, ut hinc omnia deſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant &amp; eſſe ſuum, &amp; alimentum, &amp; conſervationem.</hi> It is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, ſays he, to define Springs, which (beſide their natural innated Water) have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the world alſo, of which all things are produced, and preſerved; the conducts of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54049:11"/>
which Springs are throughout the whole Earth, that from thence all things may receive their being, nurture and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
            <p>By what has been ſaid it is eaſily conceived that Springs are not only of a bare ſimple Waters, but of ſuch as are impregnated with a Spirit of power to work wonderful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
            <p>This Spirit (as we have ſaid) is mixed and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into every mix, which makes it yield with more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility to that Water which is impregnated with the ſame Spirit; ſo that thereby it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the Virtues out of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54049:11"/>
Minerals, and appropriates them to it ſelf, which a ſimple and unſpirited Water could not do, and then it may be thus defined.</p>
            <p>A mineral Water is that which has its paſſages under ground, through the Veins of one or more, of crude, and ſometimes digeſted Minerals or Metals, by which, through the aſſiſtance of that acid fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which it carries along with it, it is firſt inſinuated into, and then impregnated with ſome proportion of their <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> in which three, all the qualities and virtues of every mix do reſide. But above all they are tinged and imbued with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54049:12"/>
the moſt fix of theſe three ſubſtances (yet of a diſſoluble nature) namely the Salt, in which is contained, according to the opinion of the learned, the moſt eſſential qualities of every compound.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mirum eſt certè amoris Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vini ſymbolum maximum, &amp;c.</hi> It is for certain a wonderful argument of the Divine Love (cries out a Philoſopher) that in all the parts of the world there ſhould be ſound Springs endowed with ſuch ſignal and admirable Virtues for the Cure of all Diſeaſes! That God of Nature, who to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his infinite Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Man, has not only or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained an infinite number of

               <hi>Animals, Plants, Trees,</hi> and <hi>Minerals</hi> alſo, not to be reckoned, for the Cure of Diſeaſes, but moreover hath commanded the Springs to pour out continual ſtreams of Health in all parts.</p>
            <p>But to give the Reader a farther inſpection into the Conſtitution of a <hi>Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> I muſt ſay that in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Minerals, ſome are of a more eaſie and yielding na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then others, the more perfect, are the more fix, and not ſo eaſie to give their tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, ſuch are Metals, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> are the moſt compact, and concentred within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Copper, Tinn, Lead</hi> and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54049:13"/>
               <hi>Mercury,</hi> more yielding, and <hi>Iron</hi> the leaſt locked up of the ſeven, by reaſon of its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of crude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted Sulphur, which is not of power to ſecure the Salt from diſſolution in the bare open Air, as the ruſt which is ſo conſtantly annexed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handled Iron doth daily teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie: But <hi>Minerals</hi> being of a leſs perfect exiſtance then <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals;</hi> are therefore more yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any Menſtruum or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, in which they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merged.</p>
            <p>Now ſince that even from Metals may be expected a yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding tincture, full of virtue &amp; power to cure ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Diſeaſes; Iron being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54049:13"/>
with the moſt eaſe, though not eſteemed by ſome of ſo cordial a Virtue as Gold and Silver, yet endowed with divers excellent qualities, it may reaſonably be expected to be proper againſt moſt Diſeaſes proceeding from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, Iron being eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all Authors, without contradiction, to be the moſt powerful opener of all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, in what part ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſettled; wherefore I do prefer that Water which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with Iron before any other.</p>
            <p>But all Mineral Waters are not impregnated alike, ſome more, ſome leſs, according as they are animated with the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54049:14"/>
acid ferment beforemention'd, proportionable to the yielding or compactneſs of the Mineral they paſs over, and anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their ſtay upon them; care muſt be had of chuſing ſuch Waters as are moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated, which may be known by theſe following marks.</p>
            <p>Contrary to the beſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of common Waters, which conſiſts in their lightneſs, the moſt heavy and ponderous, the moſt clear, of a dark greeniſh Colour, of an acid and brackiſh Taſte, of a ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Smell, and which is the eaſieſt evaporated, is the beſt. For its weight denotes a good proportion in it of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54049:14"/>
that which only gives weight to all things, namely Salts in general. Its clearneſs ſhews it free from heterogenious parts, except ſuch as are annexed to all Waters, which in the Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of them is found in the bottom of the veſſel, not much unlike a ſlimy mudd, in looks, ſmell, and taſte, as well as in conſiſtency, in which (though of ſuch a contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſpect) lurks the eſſential Salt. But how to order that Earth either before, during the Evaporations, and after, ſo as to extract that Salt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any detriment of its qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, <hi>Hic Labor, hoc Opus.</hi> However I have found theſe terreſtrial particles diveſted of the Salt, to be of a ſtiptick
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54049:15"/>
and aſtringent nature, which could not but retard the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the eſſential Salt, and ſometimes create new Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in lieu of curing thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready contracted, when the Water is overcharged with them, which does frequently happen when they are drank too ſoon after great ſhowers of Rain, before they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſettled and clear. Its dark Colour ſhews its Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnation with a Vitriolick or Martial Salt, mixed with ſome Sulphur, which Sulphur is alſo denoted by its Odour. By its activity and aptneſs to be evaporated is more at large manifeſted the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable proportion of the ſaid eſſential Salt; which by his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54049:15"/>
native heat, joined with that of the culinary Fire, the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity or Flegm is therewith the eaſier rarified. Beſides theſe the dark green Colour which it receives from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of this Vitriolick Salt of Iron, is an infallible ſign of a Water apt to yield a good proportion of that eſſential Salt, and conſequently very medicinal.</p>
            <p>Moreover, that Water which is rough to the Palate, which at the firſt reliſh diſcovers ſome acid, that terminates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a kind of an auſtere Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a bituminous Odour, that dyes the Excrements black, and ſometimes the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines of a greeniſh Colour, of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54049:16"/>
an eaſie digeſtion, quick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance through the ſmalleſt veſſels, though taken in a ſmall quantity, is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</p>
            <p>But a Mineral Water ſo qualified in all reſpects, is not to be found in all places, in this our age, whither through that general decay of Nature, (which in the opinion of ſome is very remarkable) I ſhall not now inſiſt upon; but thus much I here aſſert, that for want of ſuch Waters, the ſick are frequently obliged to make uſe of ſuch as are leſs impregnated, which being not powerful to cure and eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate formed Diſeaſes, yet are generally known, and uſed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54049:16"/>
with ſome ſucceſs in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of recent Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in preparing the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the reception of ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Medicines, ordained by skilful Phyſicians, according to the nature of the Diſeaſes. Which Waters might alſo be happily us'd in confirmed Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, were they not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken then in ſuch large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities (for want of ſufficient Impregnation) to make them paſs by the preſſure of their own weight, from which there frequently follows an unuſual extenſion of the Tunicles of the Stomach, and an extincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its natural heat, from which two accidents do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly proceed Hyſterical Paſſions, Convulſions, Cramps,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54049:17"/>
Palſies, Apoplexies, and the like, and ſometimes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Suffocations, which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences by taking too large quantities of weakly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated Waters, I ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſiſt upon from theſe four particulars, Quantity, Quality, Time and Place.</p>
            <p>Firſt as to Quantity. A Gallon of Water is the uſual height, to attain unto any benefit by them, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſix Quarts, nay two Gallons, have been devoured, which Quantities are uſually taken within the ſpace of an hour, or two, at the moſt; the half of this vaſt quantity to be contained at once, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a Stomach which has
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54049:17"/>
been debilitated, either by the violence or duration of the morbifick matter, the tedious perſiſtance in a fruitleſs courſe of Phyſick, or both; diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled from digeſting and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing a ſmall proportion of a good Nutriment, much more incapable of dealing with ſuch a large quantity of a crude Liquor, ſo that it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters remain in the Stomach, not paſſing at every fourth or fifth Glaſs, as might be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and conſequently not to be voyded again but by Vomit, except (as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid) they be preſſed down by their own burden (a very dangerous thing to truſt to): For when they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54049:18"/>
chance to go off ſo on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, it is with ſuch an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous courſe, that the weight and quantity meeting with ſome obſtructions in the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler veſſels and paſſages, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are cauſed great Inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Meſeraick Veins, Kidnies, Uriteries, Bladder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with ſo great a dilatation of the Veſſels, to force it ſelf out, that Swounding Fits, Cold Sweats, and ſometimes, without a ſingular ſuppliment of Nature, ſudden Death has followed, notwithſtanding the uſe of common Salt, carmina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Seeds, mixtures of other Liquors with the Waters, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them in Bed, laying of warm Clothes and Down Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows over their Stomachs, the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54049:18"/>
uſe of Cream of Tartar, the heating of the Waters, and the like; which laſt renders them leſs, powerful, by the loſs of their moſt ſubtle parts, which are thereby evaporated; the Waters remaining more crude and indigeſtible then before.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if the Quantity is ſo nocent, well may the Quality. To have at once, in a weakned Stomach, the forementioned quantity of Water, in which the virtual ſubſtance doth not exceed the weight of ſix or eight grains, (all the reſt being of a cold, raw, and undigeſtible nature) muſt needs be a wrack to our Nature, who is contented with a little.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:54049:19"/>
Thirdly, the Sick are limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch particular ſeaſons of the year, wherein as the Proverb ſays, they muſt make Hey while the Sun ſhines, and frequently in the midſt of their courſe, are impeded by ſome great fall of Rain, which mixing with the alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy too crude Waters, does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly extinguiſh that ſmall portion of Virtue which they had, and ſo are deprived for that time from all kind of Operation, by which acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the poor Patient is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſappointed of his hopes, and abandoned to the cruel tyranny of a conquering and mercileſs enemy.</p>
            <p>Laſtly. And here I muſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54049:19"/>
except theſe Waters, near ſo great a place of all manner of Accommodation, as is this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Dublin,</hi> as well as others ſo advantagiouſly ſituated. I ſay, that there are no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have ſeen the great Inconveniencies which attend moſt of the places of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mineral Waters, but are already convinced of the great want of better Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations, I mean in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the poor, weak, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, ſick Creatures, which Inconveniencies moſt chiefly happen by the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people where there is ſuch a ſcarcity of Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies. For ſick perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at the beſt, fitted, not as their nice and peeviſh Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54049:20"/>
would require, but as well as they can, though when in their own habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, being tranſported to thoſe cold and bleek, places, in danger of having added to their other Diſtempers, Colds, Coughs, Agues; in a word, expoſed to all the injuries of a piercing Air, beſides the ſtirring up of Humours, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Vapours, there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined into ſome ſcanted Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, ſtreightned of ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Refreſhments as are requiſite for them, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity prove, if well examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, more prejudicial in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, then thoſe Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters can do good. I ſpeak not of ſuch whoſe plentiful For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes can render all places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54049:20"/>
commodious to them, but of the generality.</p>
            <p>Thus much as to Mineral Waters in general, and the many Inconveniencies which attend the taking of weak impregnated Waters. Now if ſuch accidents do uſually attend the uſe of weakly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated Waters, is it not a charitable act to endeavour the removing of all theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned impediments? It is well known that this has been already done in <hi>England</hi> and elſewhere; and no queſtion but that it may be alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in this Kingdom, in ſupplying the Weakneſs of theſe Waters, by joining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſmall proportion of them,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54049:21"/>
the eſſential Salt extracted out of others more ſtrongly impregnated Waters, of the ſame nature &amp; operation with theſe. Whereby they will be rendred more powerful in their Operations, enabled to carry themſelves through all Obſtructions, and that, not by the violence of their own weight, but by gently inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating themſelves, and by their penetrating qualities, piercing through the moſt remote opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and obſtructed parts of the Body.</p>
            <p>This, I humbly offer for the publick Good of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unto which I have been lately called, until I find ſome opportunity of being more
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54049:21"/>
ſerviceable. Namely, an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Vitriolick Salt of <hi>Mars,</hi> extracted out of Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſo far to be prefer'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt of Mineral Waters, as a ſtrong rectified pure Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine before a weak flegmatick Brandy, or a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Extraction before a meer Galenick Potage. For any perſon that is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed with prejudicate Opinions, againſt the ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifick Art of Chymiſtry, or too much byaſſed with his own Intereſt, but will confeſs upon tryal that this eſſential Salt, in which the Virtues of the Waters reſide, being-firſt diſengaged from that large proportion of Flegm, in which it lay drowned, and after
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54049:22"/>
mixed with a leſs proportion of the ſame or with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther idoneous Vehicle, will thereby be rendred, more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and eaſie to be taken, and received in the Stomach, and there once received, more powerful and active both in it ſelf, and its commixture, to operate upon the peccant Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to mix with the Chyle, and to be convey'd with more facility and quick diſpatch, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the moſt remote Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions.</p>
            <p>For this eſſential Salt is hot, piercing, ſearching, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and driving from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the circumference, by which Qualities it doth pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully reſiſt all putrid and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54049:22"/>
Humours, the reſults of evil Fermentations, which produce ſuch a variety of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, in all parts of the Body, by attenuating with its piercing heat their viſcous and tenacious parts, which choak up the ſmall paſſages of the Veins, Arteries, and Nerves, by which the free and natural Circulation of the natural, animal and vital Spirits is impeded. By its diſſolving quality liquifying and mixing it ſelf with the crude Humours, and by its dilating faculty inſinuating it ſelf into the moſt remote and laſt Digeſtions, there aiding Nature to overcome whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is offenſive to her; nay, if timely taken, preventing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54049:23"/>
all Obſtructions, firſt cauſed by ill Digeſtions in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, which at ſuch a time produces a viſcous Flegm, in lieu of a laudible Chyle; for Errors in the firſt Digeſtion, are not rectified in the ſecond or third. Thus Waters ſo qualified either in themſelves, or through the addition and aſſiſtance of ſuch a Salt, mix themſelves with the natural ferment, aid and enable it to oppoſe, combat and ſuppreſs, all preternatural Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diſingage the Stomach from all Crudities, cauſe the generation of a good Chyle, attend it to a perfect Sanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, circulate with the Blood, and driving forth all ſeroſſities, and other impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54049:23"/>
they are inſtrumental in the creation of quick and active Spirits; ſo that by theſe means they may with Juſtice deſerve the glorious title of univerſal Reſtorers and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers, by cleanſing, correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtrengthening all the natural Faculties, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vitiated are the Cauſes of all Diſeaſes. And <hi>Natura corroborata eſt omnium Morbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum medicatrix.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the juſt Commendations of arightly impregnated Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waters, I could enlarge my ſelf at pleaſure on every particular; but my intention being more to inform in the matter of fact, then to amuſe with multiplicity of Notions,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54049:24"/>
I ſhall conclude this part of my diſcourſe, and proceed to the other, which has reſpect to the ways and methods of uſing them both, as to the prevention and the extirpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid that all Diſeaſes proceed at firſt from a devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Functions of the Stomach: If therefore any perſons are ſenſible of ſick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, Weakneſs, Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Rawneſs, Gnawings, Burning in the Stomach, a dog-like Appetite, or a nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeating of Food, and the like; to intercept all Diſeaſes that would follow, let them by way of prevention, ſuppreſs thoſe evils in their buds with
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54049:24"/>
the uſe of Mineral Waters, in this following method.</p>
            <p>Firſt let them apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſome learned able Phyſician, to have the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours well prepared, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Conſtitutions of the Bodies; for that maxim <hi>Proemiſis univerſalibus</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be regarded. From the omiſſion of this caution do ordinarily proceed all the errors, and ill conſequences, which follow the unruly tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any Mineral Water, though never ſo good, if you will add the faults of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and ill Diets, which is the bane of all the ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and worſe proſecuted, Cures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:54049:25"/>
According to the natural ſtrength and vigour of the Waters you drink, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of eſſential Salt you add to them, ſo muſt your Doſes be; and this learned by experience the firſt day.</p>
            <p>Never begin to drink till the Sun be a little high, after the drinking of each Glaſs of half a pint, walk or ride moderately, till the Liquor begins to paſs, either by ſtool or by urine; but thoſe that are not able to perform ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe two exerciſes, are to be eaſily agitated in a Coach.</p>
            <p>Increaſe daily by one Glaſs, till you come to two quarts,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54049:25"/>
for ſtrong and vigorous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which is the moſt that any muſt aſcend to. When you are come to the tolerable quantity, ſtay in it during 8 or 10 days, according as you find your ſelf able. When you are near bidding the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters farewel, decreaſe for four or five days, till you come to your firſt proportion.</p>
            <p>All that is to be drunk e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, muſt be done at the furtheſt within an hour.</p>
            <p>When you walk or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe exerciſe, let it be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, reſting by intervals, and uſe not a ſuperfluous toil, which doth not awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but rather choak up
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54049:26"/>
Nature, and hinders the free Expulſion.</p>
            <p>Put off your Dinner till you find that the beſt part of the Water is paſt, and to that purpoſe, when the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters work only by Urines, as thoſe of <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> you muſt meaſure your Urine in Glaſſes of equal dimenſions to the former; but where the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters work both ways, a ſign that the moſt are paſſed, is when the Urine doth come again to its natural yellow Colour.</p>
            <p>Let your Dinner be light, and your Supper lighter, of one or two ſorts of Meats, at the moſt, young, tender,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54049:26"/>
of eaſie Digeſtion, and good juicy ſubſtance, roaſted, and not boiled. No Fruit, no Milk nor Cheeſe: no Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Tarts nor Spices; no Fiſh. Uſe well baked White Bread, good middling Beer or Ale, clear, ripe, and well ſettled, and good French White Wine, or ſmall Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, as Baccarach. All mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Drinks, and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Wines are moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
            <p>You will do well to weigh your ſelves every morning before you drink, and after, to know what alteration there is made by Stools and Sweats, if you have any.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:54049:27"/>
I forbear mentioning here any digeſtive Powders, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials, or the like, to fortifie the Stomach, becauſe that having a Water ſufficiently ſtrong of it ſelf, or made ſo by the addition of the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Salt, it has heat ſufficient in it ſelf, to aſſiſt the Stomach withal.</p>
            <p>Now a word to thoſe that uſe weakly impregnated Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (for want of better, or not having the eſſential Martial Salt) for the opening of ſlight Obſtructions, and new found Diſtempers.</p>
            <p>Let them conſult their Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians in order to have ſuch digeſtive Powders and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54049:27"/>
in readineſs, as will beſt ſuit with their Conſtitutions, to prevent all inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p>The ordinary Remedies are the uſe of Mace, Carda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mome, Aniſe, Foenel and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raway Seeds groſly beaten to powder, and mixed with four times as much of Loaf-ſugar in powder, of which, they take half a ſpoonful after Meal; this for the digeſting Powder. Their Cordials made of cold Mint and Balm-water, with a little Wormwood, Carda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mome, Hot Waters, and ſweetened with Syrup of Clove-July-flowers. They uſe alſo to take betwixt each Pinte Glaſſes ſome Aniſe or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54049:28"/>
Caraway Comfits, Candied Orange-peels and the like.</p>
            <p>The beſt way of mixtures or heating of the Waters is thus. Firſt to mingle with the firſt and ſecond Glaſs, one or two ſpoonful in each of pure rich Canary, ſecondly to have hard by the Well a Kettle full of Water with Fire under, to heat it, in which Kettle put divers Stone Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles full of the Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters taken within the Well, very well ſtopped, and when the Water is moderately warm; take out of one quart Bottle but two Glaſſes at the moſt, leaving the ſediment behind. Thirdly, they may be taken in bed, a little warm,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54049:28"/>
bearing upon the Region of the Stomach a Down Pillow; when the whole quantity hath been taken, and by the warmth of the Bed, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter begins to paſs, then the Patient muſt go to his mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate exerciſe, of walking, rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Horſeback or in a Coach, according to the ſtrength of the Body and his conveniency.</p>
            <p>Theſe and the like miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſhifts are ſuch glad to uſe, which drink too weakly impregnated Waters.</p>
            <p>To drink but few days the Waters of any ſort, is to no purpoſe, the ſhorteſt time, if nothing intervenes is one
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54049:29"/>
month, if the Waters paſs currantly, and the Patient find a good effect towards the romoval of ſome old chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Diſeaſe, he may go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. By all means if Rainy weather comes forcibly leave off drinking, except you have at hand ſome of the eſſential Salt, to revive the Waters. And from the beginning after three or four days tryal, if the Waters remain in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and are not voided, leave off.</p>
            <p>Some perſons are coſtive during the drinking of ſuch Waters, as only purge by U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines; thoſe, if they refuſe Clyſters, may take every third or fourth day Stomachal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54049:29"/>
Pills, a quarter of an hour before Supper, as thoſe <hi>de Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniaco, Maſtichinae Fernel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lii, Stomachicarum cum Gum mis, de Hyera,</hi> or the like.</p>
            <p>When arriv'd to the end of this task, to draw out of the Body all that might be lodg'd in the Veins, or elſewhere, one, two, or three Purgations, if needs be, are not to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, which done, nothing remains, but every one to make much of himſelf, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little by little to his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner of life, within the Rules of Art and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity.</p>
            <p>Now to come to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Mineral Water, near
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54049:30"/>
to <hi>Chappel-Izard;</hi> I ſay in the firſt place, that as it is now ſituated, it is impoſſible to preſerve it long in its <hi>puris naturalibus,</hi> and without ſome mixtures of common Waters by all the means imaginable. But with care and induſtry it may be traced unto the foot of the neighbouring Hill, ſome two or three yards high, from whence undoubtedly it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, and there guarding it round with good ſtrong Clay, then walling it in, and fixing a Baſon over its riſe, there it may be kept from all dangers, but a ſuddain fall of Waters, unto which inconveniences all Mineral Waters are liable. But ſo long as it remains on ſuch a flat bottom, ſo near to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54049:30"/>
a running ſtream, liable to be overwhelmed upon every glut of Rain, it will never be of any ſignificant uſe, for the Cure of any chronicall Diſeaſes, though it may ſucceed with ſome in the opening of ſlite recent Obſtructions.</p>
            <p>For though I deny not but that in divers places Mineral Springs have been overflowed through their proximity to Rivers, &amp; low ſituations; and yet preſently upon the retreat of the flouds have remained as ſtrong and vigorous as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by reaſon that the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impregnated Waters have kept them ſtations, by the weight which they received from their own Salts, not ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitting,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54049:31"/>
but of a very ſlight and ſuperficial mixture, with the intruding Liquor; yet when other Waters break un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground in to the courſe of the Mineral Waters, and ſo roll together for ſome ſpace, they are ſo mixed <hi>per minima,</hi> and ſo wholly enervated that no good can be expected from them.</p>
            <p>Though I am not of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to content my ſelf with <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Scholars bare <hi>Ipſe dixit,</hi> yet here I have been forced to take divers things upon truſt, through the late accidental weakneſs of the Mineral Waters near <hi>Chappel-Izard.</hi> But as to what has fallen under my inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54049:31"/>
upon thoſe tryals which I have made, thus much I can ſay, that when I mixed ſome Powder of Galls with it in a Glaſs, it turned purple; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a little Alum, it turned blackiſh: Oak-leaves in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der have made it of a <hi>ſubrufus</hi> brown, which has turned blackiſh with a little diſtill'd Vinagre. With Spirit of Harts horn, I caus'd a white ſeparation to be made with ſome little ſulphurious or bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuminous Odour, which was reduc'd again to its natural clearneſs, with ſome few drops of Oyle of Tartar. With Oak-leaves, or Galls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tinged, ſome few drops of Oyl of Vitriol have cauſed a ſeparation of a black ſediment.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54049:32"/>
This Sediment being exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, proves to contain a Vitriolick Salt of <hi>Mars.</hi> Its being mixed with equall parts and boyled with Milk makes no alteration.</p>
            <p>In the precipitation of it I have found a ſubtle Gaſs or ſharp fume to ariſe ſomewhat ſulphurious, which ſpeaks it to partake alſo of Sulphur.</p>
            <p>In the Diſtillation in cloſe Glaſs veſſels, it has afforded a ſmall proportion of this acid wild Spirit, which has been turned red with powder of Galls that were placed in the Receiver.</p>
            <p>In the bottom of the Glaſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſſel
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54049:32"/>
I found a black ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not much unlike mudd, out of which I have extracted ſome few grains of a Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Salt of <hi>Mars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which examinations and tryals make me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that this Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is imbewed with a ſlender proportion of Iron, Vitriol, Sulphur and Alum; which anſwers very properly to its effects, and to the Soil adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to it; and it is my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that it partakes of Nitre alſo, though I found none.</p>
            <p>I have been credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that when it was firſt found out, it had over it a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thick ſcum of Ruſt, which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54049:33"/>
denoted its paſſage through ſome Iron Mine, how remote from its riſe, it matters not. It had under that ſcum, a thin skin or film, <hi>Cauda Pavonis,</hi> or Rainbow commonly called, for the variety of its Colours, which it borrowed either from the Sulphur of <hi>Mars,</hi> or of common Brimſtone, which laſt I am more apt to believe, becauſe that then it had a ſtrong bituminous odour and taſte.</p>
            <p>No great obſervations can be made upon the Soil through which it paſſes; it is like unto moſt of the Earth about this place mix'd with ſmall pieces of a glittering Stone, which, by chewing in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54049:33"/>
my mouth I ſcaled ſo thin, that no Talk could be more finely ſplit, nor yield a more glorious luſtre and whiteneſs; this, and ſome ſmall particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of a kind of courſer Talk, call'd <hi>Lapis Entalis,</hi> which <hi>Schroder</hi> mentions, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a common gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Sand, and a Duſt of the ſame colour, is the compound of that Earth neareſt to it, which would give me occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not to deſpair of finding ſome Aluminous Mine, or Talk Veins in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hills, if ſome pains were taken about it.</p>
            <p>The Qualities and Virtues of the Minerals wherewith this Water is impregnated, are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:54049:34"/>
               <hi>Mars,</hi> or Iron, is hot, dry, internally red, it conſiſts of a double Mercury, burning and black, of a red Sulphur and an impure Earth. It is piercing, opening and corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borating; good againſt all Obſtructions, debility of the Stomach, all Fluxes: it is an Alkali, therefore a great dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifier of the Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vitriol,</hi> there are divers ſorts, and of various colours; it is commonly white, blue, and green; I have ſeen ſome in <hi>Poland</hi> that was yellow, and ſome red. It abounds in a combuſtible Sulphur, and a corroſive acid; it contains a ſweet anodine Oyl, difficult to be had; it is internally
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54049:34"/>
red. It is ſtiptick, emetick, deterſive, hot and drying: it partakes of the virtues of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> it is good againſt all Inflamations, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alum,</hi> of Alum there are divers ſorts alſo, and divers comprehend Vitriol under the nature of Alum, of which it only differs in a metallick Sulphur; it is void of Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> does attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the Names of Salts unto external Ulcers, according to the diverſity of the congela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Salts; if it is a red Ulcer, he calls it Vitriolick: if without redneſs, aluminous; and becauſe there are divers ſorts of Alum in reſpects of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54049:35"/>
Taſts, and ſome that are wholly inſipid, as the <hi>Alumen Entalis, plumoſum, &amp;c.</hi> There are likewiſe inſipid tuberous Ulcers. It is ſtiptick, drying, cooling, coagulating, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving; it moſt powerfully reſiſts putrefactions, precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates evil Ferments, allays the Inflamations of the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and ſtops a Gangraine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sulphur,</hi> it is called the Roſin, the Lungs of the Earth, the ſecond acting principle, exiſtant in mixt bodies: from it whatſoever is combuſtible either liquid or ſolid is called Sulphur, or ſulphurious. There are two ſorts, one that is combuſtible, and another that is incombuſtible. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54049:35"/>
is that which is burnt, and yields no ſmoke, but is inflamable: The incombuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble yields no flame, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains fix and permanent: Sulphur is found either coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, or liquid, in the form of a Bitumen; as it is found in the Mines before it is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by fuſion from its earth it is called, Living. It differs from Vitriol only in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal form, and each may eaſily be transform'd into the other; therefore they have much the ſame qualities and virtues, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this laſt is more inflamable, and a particular friend to the Lungs.</p>
            <p>Thus much as to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thoſe Minerals that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54049:36"/>
have embued theſe Waters, from whence may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reaſons why it cures recent Obſtructions, cleanſeth the Reins, Uriters, and Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: aids Dropſical perſons, caſes the pains of the Gout and Rhumatiſms, procures an Appetite, fortifies the tone of the Stomach, and corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the Viſceras.</p>
            <p>Now as to this eſſential Vitriolick Salt of <hi>Mars</hi> which I have mentioned, to be uſed to add ſtrength and energy to thoſe Waters that are but ſuperficially embued with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral tinctures; it may ſeem ſtrange to ſome perſons, and I expect that ſome will be ſound amongſt the ignorant
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54049:36"/>
mobile, that will deride my Propoſition; but <hi>Hos obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trantes caniculos cum contemptu praetereo.</hi> I addreſs my ſelf to the learned only, and to them I further add, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Extraction of this eſſential Salt from Mineral Waters, and the rejoyning of it to others of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or to its former Vehicle, in a larger proportion then before. I ſay, that of late days all Mineral Waters, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for drinking or bathing, have been by ſome ingenious Artiſts ſo exactly imitated, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome Philoſophical Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations uſed on the Natures of the natural Springs; nay, I may ſay, outdone, that by thoſe factitious Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54049:37"/>
as great Cures have been performed in the Patients par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular habitations, as any have been by the natural Springs upon the place; and what is more, the Artificial Baths brought to thoſe ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of heat, as the natural ones have at the Baths, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aid or aſſiſtance of any culinary fire; to which have been added all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accidents, of Odours, Taſts, Colours, and of Ting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Silver into a curious Solar tincture. All which things were once pretended to, at the place which goes under the notion of the <hi>Dukes Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo</hi> in <hi>Longaore, London:</hi> But how performed, I leave to all ingenious perſons to judge,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54049:37"/>
that have uſed thoſe Baths, and drank of that Water. The Art of Chymy has a multitude of Well-wiſhers, as many pretenders to, and more that court her deſignedly: But <hi>ex quovis Ligno, non fit Mercurius.</hi> There are but few that make uſe of thoſe two things which <hi>Galen</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons as neceſſary concurrants to the attaining the perfect Knowledge of Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, or the nature of any ſimple Medicine, <hi>viz.</hi> Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and Reaſon, from which there aroſe in his time two Sects of Phyſicians, the one called Empiricks, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Methodiſts. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirick did only obſerve the Operations and Effects of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54049:38"/>
Medicines, and never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelves concerning their Natures, or the reaſons of thoſe effects, but uſed all Medicaments promiſcuouſly, to the prejudice of many. The Methodiſts were not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the bare finding out of the Virtues of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, but added to the OTI the ALOTI, diving into the Nature of the ſame. Theſe he termed the two Legs of a true Phyſician, upon which he would have him to ſtand and walk.</p>
            <p>It is an eaſie matter to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to things, and after the picking here and there ſome mouldy Receipts, and Terms of Art, to cant, eſpecially in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54049:38"/>
Chymy, before the unthinking multitude, but firſt to entertain Philoſophical Notions, and then to reduce them unto Mechanical real Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, belongs but to a few. And now that my Reader may not put me in the number of the great Talkers and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le Doers, as to what I have in this Diſcourſe propoſed, I offer to produce, after a month or ſix weeks time, ſufficient quantity of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Vitriolick Salt of <hi>Mars,</hi> extracted from Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to ſupply this City, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeaſon of drinking the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or all the year long, at the ſame reaſonable Rates that any true and genuine Eſſential Salt of <hi>Mars</hi> can be prepared.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54049:39"/>
I could make larger prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers yet; but I forbear, leſt it ſhould be thought I were by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed by Intereſt, or blown up with Oſtentation. The curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous learned I ſhall ever be ready to ſerve, in giving them all the ſatisfactory Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations that I can poſſible, in every particular which I have mentioned in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or in any thing elſe that I am capable. Mean time, if they pleaſe to ſpend ſom hours in the Tryals of ſuch Chymical Preparations as I have faithfully delivered to the publick in my <hi>Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the French Author,</hi> in a Treatiſe, called, <hi>A new Myſtery in Phyſick, diſcovered by Curing of Feavers and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi>

               <p>I Had but juſt ended this precedent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, when word was brought me, of a new <hi>Mineral Spring</hi> found, in the Road that leads to the firſt, near the Gate; I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately went to examine it upon the place, and cauſed ſome of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be brought home to me for further inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But after all ſorts
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54049:40"/>
of Examens, I found theſe laſt much leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of the ſame <hi>Minerals</hi> with the firſt.</p>
               <p>In both a <hi>Vitriolick Salt of Mars</hi> predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates; they have ſo weake a tincture of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> that neither of them has the power to turn Milk, though for a long time boyled together in equal proportions, which ſpeaks theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54049:41"/>
to be <hi>Alkalies,</hi> and conſequently dulcifiers of Acids.</p>
               <p>This laſt found Spring has, within leſs then a foot of it, another of fresh common Water, which peradventure does commix with it, and may be the cauſe of its weakneſs; and in my opinion, neither of theſe Waters can laſt long untainted, except care be taken to trace them, on ſome more
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54049:41"/>
eminent ground, where they may be ſecured from the inſultations of violent Rains, Flouds, and Springs of common Waters.</p>
               <p>To conclude, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the viſible decay of either of theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, though removed but to the City from their Springs, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the laſt, which would ſcarce afford any Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture at all with Galls, it were very requiſite that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54049:42"/>
theſe Waters should be drank upon the place. To which purpoſe I could wish there were better Accomodations and Conveniencies, ſut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the occaſions of the more modeſt of the modeſt Sex.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe, if Rows of Tents were pitched on each ſide of the Green, proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the concourſe of people, and a large Walk left between, it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54049:42"/>
would ſupply in ſome meaſure the natural conveniences, which a multitude of Shrubs &amp; Bushes, beſides ſome winding Dales betwixt cloſe Hills, in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the like reſort, do afford.</p>
               <p>To which might be added, according to the laudable cuſtom of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations (which has been taken up of late in ſome parts of <hi>England</hi> alſo) the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement
