         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

leſs abhors a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> then that any place
ſhould be filled by a Subject ſo empty of deſert. He
is a ſavage Creature in the midſt of civil People,
not deſerving to be born of others, as not caring to
live, but for himſelf. Nay, it is worthily reputed a
kind of civil death, to do nothing elſe but live: for
as long as we have a Country to abide in, we have
a duty to tender it. All we have, we have from it;
and by conſequence owe it all we have. Our Lives
and Fortunes are ſafeſt, when ventured for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Intereſt; and he is the trueſt Lover of Law
and Liberty, that affects rather to be ruled, then to
rule; he the freeſt Subject, that creates himſelf
a voluntary Slave to his Countries ſervice. Take
from the world this inviolable Law, (that is not
writ in braſs, but deeply imprinted in loyal hearts)
and it ſhall again turn ſavage and barbarous. This
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168597:3"/>
is a truth ſo manifeſt, and not to be diſſembled, that
never yet was there a Tyrant, but pretended to be a
Saviour of the people. Liberty, Conſcience, a

and political Cheats ſo often put upon the people

undeceived us with a ſad experience of the miſeries
we have ſubjected our ſelves to, by a perpetual itch
of reforming, annulling, creating Laws, and framing
new Governments to the model of every Grandees
ambition; and yet we are againe ready to thruſt
our Necks into a new yoak of Slavery, rather then
any man will engage his private Fortunes, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to redeem his Country from Bondage. It is
laid to the charge of Engliſh-men by Forraigners,
that we are <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and above all Nations under
Heaven pretending to civility, the greateſt ſelf-ſeekers;
as regarding much more our own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
then the general concerns. I muſt needs ſay,
other Nations would have canonized for Martyrs,
and erected Statues after their death to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of ſome of our Compatriots, whom ye have
barbarouſly defaced and mangled yet alive, for no
other motive, but their undaunted Zeal. It has
been (I know not whether I ſhould ſay) your miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
or my glory, to become a Sufferer for a
Legal Vindication of the Liberties of our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
but yet I never knew what it was to fear,
when I perceived my ſelf engaged in ſo good a
cauſe; not envy nor ſnarling Pamphlets ſhall ſtop
the courſe of my Pen freely running into my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168597:3"/>
defence, which my Profeſſion and Age forbid
me to vindicate by the Sword. Let young Men ſerve
it with their ſtrength and arms, let old Men ſecure
it by their heads and counſel: for my part, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to live no longer then I can in ſome ſort contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to ſo glorious a work. I have of late been
ſnarled at for it by certain licentious Scriblers, that
durſt not own their names for fear of diſcovering
their Aſſes ears: however, they are pleaſed to
twitch at the honourable remnant of mine. They
thought to have ſtopt my mouth by their brauling
and braying; but I dare yet ſpeak louder; and I
hope I ſhall be heard by all ſuch as have yet ſound
and impartial ears: but if my cry will not reach
you, I fear (dear Country-men) the voyce of blood
will ſpeedily interrupt your ſlumbring ſecurity.
Thoſe that will be Lawleſs, finde fault with my
Writings, becauſe I vindicate the anciently eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
Laws of <hi>England;</hi> and tax me of deſperate
Non-ſenſe, becauſe I will not allow them an unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
unlegal Legiſlative Power to repeal, annul,
alter, and enact what Laws ſoever they deem beſt
to ſerve their own turns. They deceitfully cry out,
<hi>Salus populi ſuprema lex eſto!</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cicero.</note> an Axiome that I no
ways deny to be true; but I would deſire to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
who are to be Judges, of what is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for the good of the people? The Author of the
forecited Maxime ſays, <hi>Leges Magistratibus praeſunt,
ut Magistratus praeſunt populo:</hi> And the great Doctor
St. <hi>Austin</hi> not doubted to affirm, that thoſe ſocieties
where Law and Juſtice is not, are not Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
or Kingdoms,<note place="margin">De civit. Dei.</note> but <hi>Magna latrocinia,</hi> great
thefts and trapanning cheats. As for the power of
altering Laws, or bringing in new ones, and ſetting
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168597:4"/>
up new Governments, it is allowed by wiſe men,
that all power lawfully exerciſed upon a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
muſt neceſſarily be derived either from
the appointment of God, who is ſupreme Lord of
all; or from the conſent of the Society it ſelf, that
hath the next power to his, of diſpoſing of their
own Liberty, as they ſhall think fit for their good,
whoſe benefit is the end of all Government. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whoever arrogates ſuch power to himſelf, that
cannot produce one of theſe two Titles, is not a
Ruler, but an Invader, or a Tyrant. Now how this
pretended Long Parliament, reſtored by the force
of Souldiers, by whoſe force it had firſt been diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and was before annulled by the death or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, that ſummoned it, he
being <hi>Principium, cauſa, &amp; finis Parliamenti;</hi> after his
murther, the houſe of Lords and Monarchy being
aboliſhed, and ſo many of the ancient Members
thrown out, new ones unduly elected, and ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
thefts, rapes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> committed by them upon the
people, can lawfully be ſaid the Peoples Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives,
and authorized by them, is the greateſt
Riddle that ever was propounded to a puzzled
State. It was in the year 1649, that I publiſhed
<hi>a Legal Vindication of the Liberties of</hi> England; in
which I demonſtrated the nullity of the then-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Long Parliament; and lately I ſet forth a
lively pattern of the ſpurious <hi>Old Cauſe</hi> pretended to
be revived and vindicated by the fine Pageant or
now-ſitting Ghoſt of the long-ſince departed Long
Parliament; neither need I reaſon farther with
reaſonable Perſons about it: Yet ſince this Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical
Hob-gobbling appears ſtill to fright the
quiet people, and tempts them (like an evil Spirit)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168597:4"/>
to give themſelves to ſuch an unruly Devil; I will
here onely hold forth to the view of all good Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen,
what ſlavery they muſt needs ſubject
themſelves unto, if they reſolve to caſt off forever
their lawful Maſter and Soveraign, and take for
new Maſters theſe upſtart domineering Tyrants.
Let then every honeſt freeborn Subject of <hi>England,</hi>
lay his hand upon his breaſt, and ask of his own
Conſcience, whether notwithſtanding all former
Oaths of Allegiance, Supremacy, Proteſtation, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Leagues and Covenants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he can voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſubmit to, and thereby freely acknowledge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his former knowledge and the ſaid Oath,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That there may be, and now is a lawfully-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled

they think meet.</item>
                  <item>8. To abſolve themſelves (by more then a Papal

<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
