            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HE that will Reflect upon the last four Years,
will scarce believe a Prefatory Apology need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for Printing this Discourse: If at present the
Madness of the People be in some Measure stilled,
I think it not ill-timed, for I have taken the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of a lucid Interval, and have offered them
Reason when they have Recovered their Senses,
though not their Temper. It is with them as it is
with the restless Ocean, <hi>Posito flatu inquietum Mare.</hi>
So now, though the Popular Breath of a pretended
Patriot does not blow hard upon the Nation, yet the
giddy Multitude remain unsettled, and are in great
danger of a Relaps into the like Lunacy. This Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was writ, 'tis true, in 46, but it is exactly Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
for 82. For of late we have only Transcribed
those Times, as if we intended to Copy out the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
of our Fore-Fathers. We are now full of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings
and Repinings, the Natural Product of Ease
and Plenty, being almost tired with too long a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
as if we had deflowred our Felicity: For
though we cry out so loud of Grievances, they are
most like that of the Effeminate <hi>Sybarite,</hi> who, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>
says, <hi>Saepius questus est quod foliis Rosae duplicatis
incubuisset.</hi> We do not complain because we are
<pb facs="tcp:51001:3"/>
really hurt, but because we are too delicate. I may
boldly Challenge the tenderest Person of the Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
Party to shew me one Princes Reign since the
Conquest, in which the People of <hi>England</hi> have sat
under the shadow of their own Vines with less Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance:
But they that make the greatest noise are
Men that have been rejected by the Government, or
else Persons that would be silenced by Preferment,
and would willingly lose their Tongues with a silver
Quinzy. There is a pleasant Story in the History
of <hi>Great Britain</hi> of <hi>Gondemar</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
and a Lady, very applicable to our Times.</p>
            <p>In those Days there were some Ladies (who pretended
to be Wits) had fair Nieces, or Daughters, which drew
great Resort to their Houses; and where Company meet,
the Discourse is commonly of the Times. These Ladies
<hi>Gondemar</hi> sweetned with Presents that were too sour in
their Expressions. He Lived at <hi>Ely-House</hi> in <hi>Holborn;</hi>
his Passage to the Court was ordinarily through <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi>
and that Lane and the <hi>Strand</hi> were the Places
where most of the Gentry Lived; and the Ladies as he
went knowing his Times, would not be wanting to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
at their Balconies or Windows to Present him their
Civilities, and he would watch for it; and as he was
carried in his Litter, or bottomless Chair (the easiest
Seat for his Fistula) he would strain himself as much
as an Old Man could do to the Humblest Posture of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.
One day passing by the Lady <hi>Jacobs</hi> House in
<hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> she exposing her self for a Salutaion, he
<pb facs="tcp:51001:3"/>
was not wanting to her, but she moved nothing but her
Mouth, gaping wide open upon him. He wondred at
the Ladys Incivility, but thought it might be happily a
Yawning fit took her at that time, for trial whereof the
next day he finds her in the same place, and his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies
were again accosted with no better Expressions
than an extended Mouth. Whereupon he sent a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
to her to let her know, that the Ladies of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
were more Gracious to him than to Encounter his
Respects with such Affronts. She Answered, it was true,
he had Purchased some of their Favours at a dear Rate;
And she had a Mouth to be stopped as well as others. <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demar</hi>
finding the Cause of the emotion of her Mouth,
sent her a Present, which Cured her of that Distemper.</p>
            <p>We find this Gaping-Sickness is broke out afresh
in our Times, but it is grown much worse; for we
are not only troubled with a silent extension of the
Jaws, but it is attended with horrid Yellings against
Evil Counsellors, when under that Appellation we
would extort from our King his dearest Friends.
Neither has the King only been remotely Attacqued
in his Ministers of State, but the Mercenary Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of the Age have Blasphemed him in their Prints.
What swarms of written Lampoons besides have
crept abroad, some writ by Wretches Cursed with a
Wit too good, since they employ their Talents only
to commit an Ingenious Iniquity. <hi>Alexander</hi> thought
it too great at Priviledge for every Common Hand
to Pourtraict Majesty, and therefore established that
<pb facs="tcp:51001:4"/>
Liberty by a Law to none but Famed <hi>Apelles:</hi> Had
he Lived in our Days, when Princes sit to every
drunken Poet, who purposely deforms his Soveraign,
he had been impatient of so high an Indignity: But
now Treason is uttered under the strong Protection
of a Rhime, and he passes for the greatest Wit, whose
Talent 'tis to fling the filthiest Dirt in the Face of
Gods Anointed. My Blood has oft grown warm
at the repetition of a Modish Libel, to see how it
has tickled the Conceits of empty Fops, whose Parts
could reach no higher, than to understand the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Ribaldry: For if there chanced to be any quaint
Conceit, that was but lost to their pert dulness, and
pass'd by with an Ignorant silence. He that will
Burlesque his Prince, and suits Reproaches to the
Genius of the Age, must please by a gross and naked
Obscenity: For Men are come to that Unnatural
Dyscrasie as to relish or digest nothing but Poyson,
and Keck, and Vomit when you offer to their filthy
Stomacks a wholsom and a cleanly Banquet. The
Strumpet-Muse of these our Modish Poets was bred
up in Stews, and Brothels, and by her Language she
betrays her Education. They know not how to
reach the Noble heights of a Civil well writ Poem,
but grow weary of unaccustomed Goodness if once
they dare to undertake that Task, for then their Parts
are overcome, being not befriended, with those
baser Helps of speaking those things that most Men
blush to hear. Unhappy is that State where Princes
<pb facs="tcp:51001:4"/>
Faults are made the Pastime of Buffoons; they are
the common Calamities of the Nation, and every
Subject should become a Penitent when the King's
a Sinner, for they provoke Heavens Vengeance by
their Representative, and often feel the Punishments
that result from his Iniquities.</p>
            <q>Quicquid delirant Reges plectuntur Achivi.</q>
            <p>But if this Consideration cannot restrain this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency
of Rhiming, but their Debauched Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
will still make Majesty the Subject of their Droll,
Publick Authority, it is to be hoped, will Correct
these Poetical Traytors; and if they cannot be
taught better Religion, they will be forced to better
Manners. I must confess I have ventured to Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
this as an Immortality, and as an innovated
Crime of latter Ages; but I find in a Modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
it is a Christian Liberty of great Antiquity;
for he has run it up so high, that I was in great
dread that he would have proved it of Apostolical
Institution. But it seems it was certainly in Practice
amongst the Primitive Christians at <hi>Antioch,</hi> whose
Example he does alledge for its Justification; for
he says, They Lampoon'd the Beard of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Iulian,</hi> and Burlesqued his Princely Whiskers.
Surely this Instance serves much better to prove the
Lawfulness of Reviling the King, than to Confute
the Doctrine of Passive Obedience. But yet this
Revolted Divine would pass for a true Son of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> though he Renounces her
<pb facs="tcp:51001:5"/>
Doctrine and Practice; for he is very Angry she will
furnish her Magazines with no other Weapons than
Tears and Prayers, for he thinks he could manage a
Carnal Sword for Preferment much better than a
Spiritual, and for that Reason likes the <hi>Alcoran</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Gospel. I know he blames our Saviour
in's Heart for commanding St. <hi>Peter</hi> to put up his
Sword, and for not making use of those many Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of Angels that would gladly have Rescued
him from the <hi>Iews.</hi> But Alas! this Son lyes in his
Mothers Bosom only to Betray her, and stays in the
Vineyard, for the same Reason the Boar does, that
he may have the better Conveniency of Rooting
of it up. I know how unpalatable a Doctrine is
maintained in this Discourse, but though, like the
best Physick, it be bitter, it is wholsome, and will
certainly Cure the Divisions of the Church, for
they can have no pretence to Quarrel Episcopacy,
if once they be perswaded that the Government by
Bishops is <hi>Iure Divino.</hi> Neither do I believe the
Notion of Sacriledge will have a better Taste in
their Mouths; for it will not be worth while to
pull down the Bishops if the Church-Lands cannot
be shared, God Almighty being the real Proprietor.
I hope this little Book may convince some of their
Errors, but if not, I am sure it will confirm those
that have embraced the Truth.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU have put an odd task upon Me, in
commanding my judgment on a Letter
lately sent to a Doctor in <hi>Oxon,</hi> with a
Commission to shew it to my Lord
<hi>Dorset,</hi> and to as many more as own
Reason and Honesty; for thus it is in
the <hi>Post-script,</hi> and many like passages
more in the Letter: As, <hi>That the more
Wise and Honest Party would make use
of that Reason, &amp;c.</hi> And I know you to be too great a
Master of Reason to be unsatisfied, which makes me fear,
if perhaps I should dissent in opinion from this Epistler, I
might be thought (at least in his conceit) to incur a sharp
Censure both of Reason and Honesty; which (I confess) at
first somewhat troubled me, till I remembred you were wont
to say, That when once Vessels make such noises as these, it
was a shrewd sign they were empty. He who wrote the
Letter seems most desirous of Peace, and truly so am I. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
we agree in this, That we must not commit sin for a
good Cause: So that if peace it self cannot be obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that guilt, we must be content with a worse Estate. But
you very well know, with how many several deceits our
Affections can mislead our Reason; you remember who it
was that said it to the very face of a Prophet, <hi>I have
kept the Commandments of the Lord:</hi> and yet his sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
a great sin still, and much the worse because
he excused it; for his guilt is less, that commits a sin
only, than his that undertakes to defend it; because this
cuts off all Repentance, nay, it makes a sin grow up to that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51001:6"/>
more wicked height of a scandal; and so it is not only a
snare to the sinner himself, but it warrants many more to
be sinful.</p>
            <p>Whether this <hi>Oxford-Londoner</hi> (for so I take this Epist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
to be) hath not defended or made Apologies for sin, and
hath not in that sense done Evil, that Good may come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I am now to make enquiry; and I shall follow him in his
two Generals.</p>
            <p>1. The Delivering up of the Kings friends, whom they above
call Evill Counsellors. And,</p>
            <p>2. In the business of the Church.</p>
            <p>1. For the Kings friends he sayes. <hi>I know not how you
can with Reason gain-say the bringing of an Offender to
Iustice.</hi> Indeed nor I neither, but what if they be not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders?
What if they be brought to Injustice? I know no man
will refuse to be Judged by a Parliament, whose undoubted
Head, is the King sitting there with an unquestioned Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
nay, for His Majesty to refer Deliquents to be judged
by the House of Peers sitting in a Parliament, and judging
according to the know Laws of the Realm, is that at least
which in my opinion will be stuck at. But the Parliaments
Prerogative which this Letter speaks of, being now so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
we have cause to think it is a doubt in this case;
Whether not only in point of Honour, but in point of Justice
and Conscience, the King for His own peace, can leave his
Friends to such men, whom he is bound by so many grand
Ties to protect.</p>
            <p>But this, Sir, I shall commit to you to determine; and if you
return me a Negative, I shall not presume to question either
your Reason or Honesty. Nor shall I perswade the Kings
Friends that they should banish themselves, unless it were
to do that great favour to the two Houses of <hi>Westminster,</hi> as
to keep them from some future inhumane Act of Oppression
and Blood, because they shall have none left to Act them on.</p>
            <p>2. For the business of the Church, which he again divides
into two parts.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:51001:6"/>
               <item>1. That of Episcopacy.</item>
               <item>2. That of Sacriledge.</item>
            </list>
            <p>In those, Sir, I shall speak with less Hesitation, and clearly
tell you the Epistler is quite out; And though you know me
a great honourer of your Profession, yet I cannot hold it fit
for you to decide cases of Conscience, or in humane Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to tell us, what is sin, or not sin: And I am confident, Sir,
you will not take this ill at my hands.</p>
            <p>1. For Episcopacy, his words are, if I mistake not (and
if I do, I pray you inform me) <hi>The Opinion, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Bishops is</hi> Jure Divino, <hi>hath but lately been Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and that but by some few
of the more Lordly Clergy.</hi> These last words makes me
suspect some passion in the writer, as being in scorn hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
taken up by men, who for a long time were Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
in Heart, and are now Rebels in their Actions. And
since the Laws of the Land makes some Church-men Lords,
I do the more marvel, that the Epistler, who seems so Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for the Laws, should be angry at that. So that though
his profession be that he has undergone labours and hazards
for the Episcopal Government; Yet truly Sir, I must think
that it is then only fit for the Church to give him thanks,
when she has done all her other business.</p>
            <p>But grant the Tenent to be but of late countenanced, it
thence follows not, that it is any whit the less true: For in
respect of the many hundred years of abuse, the Reformation
was but lately countenanced, and yet I take it for an unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
truth, that the <hi>Laity</hi> ought to have the Cup; And
though I was not desired to reform the Epistlers Errors, yet in
charity I shall tell him he is out, when he affirms, that this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
was but of late countenanced in the Church, as I could
shew out of Archbishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> by Bishop <hi>Bilson,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
others. And since perhaps he might think these to be
men of the more Lordly Clergy, I shall name one more who
may stand for many, and who wrote forty years since, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51001:7"/>
most excellent man Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> (a Person of incomparable
learning, and of as much modesty, who, I dare be bold to
say, never once dreamed of a <hi>Rochet</hi>) he avers in clear terms.
<q>There are at this day in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> no other than
the same degrees of <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Order; Namely <hi>Bishops, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi>
and <hi>Deacons,</hi> who had their beginning from Christ
and his Blessed Apostles themselves; or as he expounds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> are, and by Christ himself in the
Apostles, and <hi>Seventy,</hi> and then <hi>Deacons</hi> by the Apostles.</q> I
may add <hi>Bucer</hi> too (no man I am sure of the Lordly Clergy)
who though he was not <hi>English</hi> born, yet he was Professour
here in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, and wrote, and dyed in this
Kingdom. <hi>Bishops</hi> (saith he) <hi>are ex perpetua Ecclesiarum or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatione
ab ipsis jam Apostolis;</hi> and more, <hi>visum est Spiritui
sancto;</hi> and surely, if <hi>Bishops</hi> be from the Apostles, and from
the holy Spirit himself, they are by Divine Ordination. Nay,
what think you, if this Tenent be approved by a plain Act of
Parliament? I hope then it wants no Countenancer <hi>England</hi>
can give it, and it needs not fly for shelter under the wings
of the Lordly Clergy. You have these words in the Books
of Consecration of <hi>Archbishops</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> which is confirmed
by Parliament: <hi>It is evident to all men reading holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Ancient Authors, that from the Apostles time, there
have been these orders of</hi> Ministers <hi>in Christs Church,</hi> Bishops,
Priests, <hi>and</hi> Deacons. And again, the prayer in the form
of Consecrating <hi>Bishops—Almighty God, giver of all good
things, which by thy holy Spirit hast appointed divers Orders of
Ministers in thy Church; Mercifully behold this thy Servant now
called to the Work and Ministry of a Bishop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the Question to the Person to be consecrated <hi>Bishop,
Are you perswaded you be called truly to this Ministration,
according to the will of the Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you Sir, consider, whether these words, or the Prayer,
could fall from any man not possessed with this Tenent, that
<hi>Episcopacy</hi> is of Divine Right: For if the three Orders may
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51001:7"/>
be found by reading Scripture, together with antient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors;
if men are taught to pray, That God by his Spirit hath
appointed divers Orders in his Church, and this made the
ground of praying for the present <hi>Bishop;</hi> If the Person to
be consecrated must profess, that he is called according to the
Will of our Lord Jesus Christ: either all this must be nothing
but pure pageantry, and then the Parliament mocked God
by their Confirmation; or else <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is grounded on
Scripture, is appointed by the Spirit of God, is according
to the Will of our Lord Jesus, and all this hath not been
said of late, and countenanced only by some, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And we
have the less reason to doubt, that this Tenent was countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in this Church of ours, because we find it desired in those
parts that have lost <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> For we are told by Doctor
<hi>Charelton</hi> (after Bishop of <hi>Chichester,</hi> one that writ against the
<hi>Arminians</hi>) more than twenty-five years since, That sitting at
<hi>Dort,</hi> he there protested in open Synod, that Christ ordained
no Parity, but made twelve Apostles the Chief; so under
them the <hi>Seventy</hi> Disciples, then <hi>Bishops</hi> succeeded the <hi>Twelve,</hi>
and <hi>Presbyters</hi> the <hi>Seventy</hi> Disciples. He affirmed this
order had still been maintained in the Church, and then
challenged the Judgment of any learned man that could
speak to the Contrary: Their answer was silence, which was
approbation enough. But after (saith he) discoursing with
divers of the best learned of the Synod, He told them how
necessary <hi>Bishops</hi> were to suppress the then rising Schisms.
Their answers were, That they did Honour &amp; much Reverence
that good Order and Discipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and
with all their hearts would be glad to have it established a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, but that could not be hoped for in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state;
their hope was, that seeing they could not be what they
desired, God would be merciful to them that did what they
could. If they hoped for mercy to pardon what they did,
sure they must suppose that what they did was sinful; nay,
they thought their necessity it self could not totally excuse
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51001:8"/>
that sin; for then in that particular there had been no need
of mercy. Nor could they well think otherwise, for being
pressed, they denied not but that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was of Christs own
Institution, and yet they were not Lordly Clergy. Nor do
I well see how either by charitable or civil men, they can at
all be taxed either for want of Reason or Honesty.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Londoner</hi> goes on, and proves this Tenent, could
not be here countenanced; for we alwayes allowed the
<hi>Protestants</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Low</hi> Countrys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> part of the
Reformed <hi>Catholick</hi>-Church, though they had no Bishops.</p>
            <p>The Reformed <hi>Catholick Protestant</hi>-Church, a pretty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
just like that so well known, the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi>
Church, which we were wont to call a <hi>Popish</hi> Solecisme,
an Universal particular. But wee'l forgive him this Slip:
Suppose his Sence be well worded, yet he has as ill luck
in his Argument as his Expression. For though we do
maintain, that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is of Divine Right (<hi>i. e.</hi>) of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Institution; does it then follow, That <hi>Germany</hi> and the
<hi>Low</hi> Countrys are no <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches, or no part of
the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church. I could almost believe, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of this Letter writ from <hi>London</hi> indeed, for sure <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
makes no such Arguments. No, it must be a Crime
of most horrid Nature, that makes a Church run in <hi>non Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiam:</hi>
For though that of the <hi>Iews</hi> was bad, Idolatrical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bad; yet God seriously professes, He had sent Her no
Bill of Divorce. Nay, no Learned Man of Judgment durst
ever yet affirm, That the <hi>Romaen</hi> Church her self; was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
no true part of the Church-<hi>Catholick;</hi> and yet She
breaks a flat Precept of Christs; <hi>Drink ye all of this.</hi> And
shall we be thought to deny the same right unto Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
without <hi>Bishops,</hi> when they brake but Christ's Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
No! Churches they are, true parts of the <hi>Catholick</hi>
Church, but in point of Ordination and Apostolical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
they are not: And to affirm this, will (I hope)
he thought (I am assured by Learned Men) neither irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
nor unhonest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:51001:8"/>
He goes on—<hi>I am certain the</hi> King <hi>would never have
have way for Extirpation of</hi> Bishops <hi>in</hi> Scotland, <hi>had he
conceived them to be</hi> Jure Divino. Grant it were so; yet
of all mankind, are Kings only bound that they must not
change their opinions? or if perhaps they have done ill,
must they for their Repentance be far more reproached than
Subjects for their Crimes?</p>
            <p>The King would not have given way to <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and
<hi>Independents</hi> to exercise Religion here in their own way (as
by his late Engagement) when such a Toleration in the face
of a divine Law must needs be sinful. There is a great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
in this Argument; for, to Tolerate, doth not at all signify
either to approve or commend Factions; neither of which
the King could at all do to gross Schismatiques without sin:
But it meerly implyes not to punish, which Kings may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
upon just reason of State, as <hi>David</hi> forbare the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Ioabs</hi> Murther (I say, in Person he forbare, though he
bequeathed it to his Son): And we our selves in our <hi>English</hi>
State, have no punishment for all kind of lyars, and yet
their sin is against a flat Law divine; and we should not be
still vexed with so much Poetical-News, had we Sanction
made that might prohibit and punish them. And now Sir,
I conceive, you think that what the <hi>Londoner</hi> hath said, in
this point, amounts to just nothing; yet, since you would needs
enjoyn me, to acquaint you with the state and grounds of
the Tenent he is pleased to deride, I shall readily obey you;
For truly Sir, I have ever held you a Gentleman of a pious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
and am confident you will welcome Truth for his
sake who is Truth, though it should cross both your gain and
peace. Indeed, this Tenent of Divine right of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> hath
been long since, and of late much years opposed; as on the one
side by the <hi>Pope</hi> and his party in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and after
that by some warmer <hi>Iesuites;</hi> so on the other side by Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques
and Sectaries, that call themselves of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51001:9"/>
And I remember You and I were oft wont to say, that
commonly the truth (our <hi>English</hi> Churches Tenents) lay in
the midst between those, and did seem the more Christian,
because they were Crucified oft between two such kind of
Thieves. We affirm then, <hi>Episcopacy</hi> to be of Divine
Right, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) of Divine Institution, and that must needs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
a Divine Precept too; for to what end are things insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by God, but that it is presumed it is our part to use
them? To what end should some men be appointed to teach
and to govern, but that it is clearly implyed there are other
men too, who ought both to hear and obey them? <hi>He that
erects a Bridge over a broad swelling Stream, needs not</hi> (you
will think) <hi>add any express command, that men should not haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
drowning by going into the water.</hi> Thus when our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Saviour made his Institution of that great Sacrament the
<hi>Eucharist,</hi> he gave command indeed concerning the Bread,
<hi>Do this in remembrance,</hi> &amp;c. And concerning the Cup, <hi>Drink
ye all of this;</hi> but he gave no express command to do both these
together, and yet his Institution hath been ever held to have
the Nature of a Command: and so for <hi>One Thousand</hi> Years
the whole Christian Church did ever practise it, save only
in some few cases, in which men supposed a kind of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
I say then, <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is of Divine Right, Instituted by
Christ in his Apostles; who, since they took upon them to
Ordain and Govern Churches, you need not doubt they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from their Master an Authority to do both; for sure
men will not think they will break their own Rules: No
man takes this upon him, but he that was called of God, as
was <hi>Aaron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Episcopacy</hi> then was Instituted in the Apostles, who were
<hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>aliquid amplius,</hi> and distinguished by Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from the <hi>Seventy,</hi> who were the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> so the most
antient Fathers generally: Or, if you will take St. <hi>Ieroms</hi>
opinion (who neither was a <hi>Bishop,</hi> nor in his angry mood
any good friend to that order) they were Instituted by the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51001:9"/>
Apostles, who being <hi>Episcopi &amp; Amplius</hi> did in the latter
time formalize, and bound out that Power which we do
still call <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and so these received opinions may
well stand together; for <hi>Episcopatus</hi> being in <hi>Apostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu,
tanquam Consulatus in Dictatura,</hi> as the latter and
Subordinate Power is alwayes in the greater; we may
truly say, it was instituted by Christ in his Apostles, who
had <hi>Episcopal</hi> Power and more, and then formalized, and
bounded by the Apostles themselves, in the Persons of
<hi>Timothy, Titus,</hi> and others; so that call the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Order
either of Divine Right or Apostolical Institution, and I
shall not at all quarrel with it, for Apostolical (I hope)
will seem Divine enough to Christians: I am sure <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius
Salmasius</hi> thinks so (a sharp Enemy to the Episcopal
Order) <hi>If</hi> (saith he) <hi>it be from the Apostles, it is of Divine
Right.</hi> Thus we find the Power of Ordination and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
to be given to those men alone, for then that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is properly Episcopal, when one man alone may execute
it. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, Lay hands,</hi> &amp;c. in the singular
Number, <hi>Against an Elder receive not an accusation under two or
three witnesses, 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 19. And then the Text is plain, he
and he alone might do it. So to <hi>Titus, For this cause left I
thee in</hi> Crete, <hi>that thou (and thou alone) shouldest set in order
the things that are wanting, and Ordain Elders in every City.</hi>
Where plainly these two Powers are given to one Man of
Government and Ordination, so St. <hi>Iohn</hi> to the Seven Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of <hi>Asia, Rev.</hi> 14. where he presumes all the Governing
Power to reside in the Angels of those Churches, and in them
alone, as all the Antients understand it. And hence it is plain
that though we should yield, that the Apostles only did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
Bishops; Yet in this Revelation Christ himself im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
in his own Person, and the Holy Spirit withall
did both Approve and Confirm them: And the Bishops
of those Sees are called Angels by St. <hi>Iohn</hi> who was born a
<hi>Iew,</hi> because in <hi>Palestine</hi> their Chief Priests were there cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51001:10"/>
their Angels, and so this Appellation was taken up by the
Apostle in that place, because those were the Chief of those
Churches. This truth appears not only from cleare Texts,
but from the Universal Consent and Practise of more than
<hi>One thousand five hundred</hi> Years space of all the Christian
Churches; So that neither St. <hi>Ierom</hi> nor any other Ancient
did either hold Orders lawfully given, which were not given
by a Bishop, nor any Church-Jurisdiction to be lawfully
Administred, which was not either done by their hands, or
(at least) by their Deputation. I know there are men late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
risen up especially in the last Century, who have col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
and spread abroad far other Conclusions, and that from
the Authority of Text it self: But as it is a Maxime in
Humane Laws, <hi>Consuetudo optima legum interpres;</hi> So no
rational man but will easily yield, it as well holds in Lawes
Divine. For I would gladly ask, what better way there
can be for interpreting Texts, than that very same means
whereby I know Text to be Text, to wit, <hi>The Consent
of the Church.</hi> Shall I believe, and yet disbelieve that
self-same Consent, which is the best ground of my belief?
This is as 'twere to say, that I believe such a tale for
the Authors sake, who hath told it, and yet now I do
hold the self-same man to be a Lyar. Men do believe the
Testimony of Universal Consent, in the sense it gives of
Singular terms, and why not in the sense it gives of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
and Propositions? Without the help of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
(which indeed is the ground of our Dictionaries)
how shall we know that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Body, which the <hi>Socinians</hi> at this day deny?
And I know no such way to confute their Errour as by
the Authority of this Consent. Admit then of that Rule
that Consent Universal is the best interpreter of the Text,
and then I am sure, that it is as clear as true, that Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
is of Divine or Apostolical Right. And that Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
There can be no Ordination without the hands of a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51001:10"/>
Bishop, will clearly appear to be as well grounded as
this. There can be no Baptism without a Lawful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
which yet is good Divinity amongst our new Masters
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and antiquity allowed it, <hi>Extra casum necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis;</hi>
For I ask upon what Text do they ground this
Rule? I suppose they will say upon our Saviours Words,
<hi>Go teach all Nations and Baptize them;</hi> but in the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> he spake those words too, but
only to the Twelve, <hi>Drink,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. I demand
then, how shall we know that when our Saviour spake
those words to the <hi>Eleven,</hi> he spake them only as to Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Ministers, but when he spake the other to the <hi>Twelve,</hi>
he spake them at large as to them that did represent all
Christian men? So that though only Ministers may Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize,
yet all Christians may receive the Cup? Perhaps theyl
say, that this general receiving the Cup is manifest from
the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. (and I think so too) where St. <hi>Paul</hi> seems
to chide the whole Church for their irreverence at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But if a quarreller should reply, that he there speaks
but of the <hi>Presbitery</hi> only, whereof many were at that time
at <hi>Corinth,</hi> as when in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. he seems to chide the whole
Church for not Excommunicating the Incestuous Person; yet
tis plain, that he means none but the men in Government
(as sure all <hi>Presbyterians</hi> will allow me.) I know not what
could be said, but to make it appear out of the Fathers and
others, that the whole Christian Church never took the
words in that sence. And if to stop the mouth of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious,
we must be constrained to quote the Authority of
Universal Consent, and of the common practise of Christs
Church, then you'l easily see, that those two Propositions
named, do stand fast on the same bottom. There can be no
Baptism without a lawful Minister <hi>extra casum necessitatis,</hi> for
so the Practise and Consent of Universal Church have still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
that Text. And again, 'tis true there can be no Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
without the hands of a Bishop, for so those Texts out of
<hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> have been understood and practised for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51001:11"/>
               <hi>One thousand five hundred</hi> Years together, by the Consent of
the whole Church of Christ.</p>
            <p>'Tis true that this precept of Christ, <hi>Go ye, teach all Nations,
and baptize them,</hi> runs not in exclusive words, ye Apostles,
or ye lawful Ministers, and none else; yet <hi>extra casum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitatis,</hi>
none was allowed but a lawful Minister: so that
though those commands, <hi>Lay hands suddainly on no Man, and
do thou Ordain Elders in every City,</hi> run not in <hi>Verbis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusivis,</hi>
thou and none but thou, or men of thine Order on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet the Church understanding, and Preaching them in
an exclusive sense, no man for <hi>One thousand and five hundred</hi> Years
in any setled Church, was held rightly Ordained without,
the hands of a Bishop.</p>
            <p>Nay, that there is something Divine in the Episcopal Order,
will appear clearly by this; That immediately from the times
of Christ and his Apostles, yea within the reach of those
times, it was Universally spread throughout the whole Church;
so that no man can name a Nation, that was once converted to
the Christian Faith, but he shall soon find there were Bishops.
So that there must needs have been an Universal Cause for an
Effect that was so Universal. General Council there was none
about it, at which all Christians might have met, and might
thence have obeyed their directions: Nor can any name a
Power to which all Christians would submit (for they were
soon fallen into factions) but either the Authority of Christ
or his Apostles; from them then must needs flow the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Order, and at that Fountain I shall leave it: I say within
the reach of the Apostles times, for before St. <hi>Iohn</hi> dyed, there
are upon good Church Records above <hi>Twenty-eight</hi> Bishops
appointed to their several Sees, as at <hi>Ierusalem, Alexandria,
Antioch, Rome, Ephesus, Crete, Athens, Colosse,</hi> and divers
others, a <hi>Catalogue</hi> whereof I shall be ready to attend you
with, when you shall be pleased to command it.</p>
            <p>And hence it will be plain, how great a Corruption, nay
how flat a sin is brought into Christs Church, when Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
is thrown down, and so where Ordination is performed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51001:11"/>
by any hands without theirs, 'tis as gross as if the <hi>Laymen</hi>
should be allowed to baptize where a <hi>Presbyter</hi> stands by.
Nay more, 'tis as bad, as if the Order of Presbytery should
be thrown down, that <hi>Laymen</hi> might Baptize. What is this
but wilfully to run into necessity, which may thence create
an Apology? 'Tis a Corruption far worse, than if a Church
should audaciously attempt to put down the Lords day, since
the Observation of that time is neither built on so clear a Text,
nor on the help of so Universal consent as is the Order of
Episcopacy. So that if men can think it sinful to part with
the Lords day, though the Institution of it be merely Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical;
they must needs confess, that there is at least as much
sin (nay indeed more) in parting with their Bishops: And
then the <hi>Oxford</hi> Doctrine he abuses, and talks of as Transmitted
for Orthodox Truth, will (it seems) prove no less in earnest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the point of <hi>Sacriledge;</hi> and the better to
clear this, I must premise these directions.</p>
            <p>1. That God accepts of things given Him, and so holds
a Propriety as well in the New as Old Testament.</p>
            <p>2. That God gets that Propriety in those things He
holds, as well by an Acceptation of what is voluntarily
given, as by a Command that such things should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
unto Him.</p>
            <p>3. To invade those things, be they moveable or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable,
is expresly the Sin of Sacriledge.</p>
            <p>4. That this Sin is not only against Gods positive, but
plainly against the Moral-Law.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>First,</hi> I quote this Text, <hi>I hangred, and ye gave
me Meat, I thirsted,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. If Christ do not Accept
of these things, He might say indeed, That you offered
Me Meat; but He cannot say, that you gave it, for a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
is then only to be called a Gift, when it is Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as his own that takes it. And doth He thus accept
of Meat and Cloathing, and doth he not accept of those
kind of Endowments, that bring both those to Perpetuity?
Will He take Meat, and refuse Revenues? Doth He like
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51001:12"/>
(can you imagine) to be Fed and Cloathed to day, and in
danger to be Starved to morrow? The Men thus provided
for, He calls no less than His Brethren, <hi>In as much as you
have done it,</hi> &amp;c. Whether those were of those Brethren
which He enjoyned to Teach others, or of those He would
have instructed, the Text then doth not decide: With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt it must be meant of both, for 'twere a strange
thing to Affirm, That Christ likes it extream well, to be
Fed and Cloathed in all those He calleth His, but only in
the <hi>Twelve</hi> and <hi>Seventy.</hi> But to put it out of doubt, That
what is done to these, is done to Him too, His own words
are very clear, <hi>He that receiveth you, receiveth Me</hi> (you
Teaching Disciples) in the work of the Gospel, when He
sends them forth to Preach; and that Reception implys all
such kind of Provision, as is apparent throughout the whole
Tenour of that <hi>Chapter.</hi> And again, I quote that so well
known passage of <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> his Wife, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.
His Sin was, he kept part of the Price of those Lands he
had given to God, for the publick use of Christ's Church;
they were given to God, and 'tis as plain God did accept
them. For St. <hi>Peter</hi> (you know) thus reproves him, <hi>why
hast thou Lyed, or why hast thou deceived the Holy Ghost?</hi> For
so <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth properly import; <hi>why dost thou so cheat him
of what is now his proper Right?</hi> And again, <hi>Thou hast not
Lyed unto Men, but unto God,</hi> ver. 4. And is this so strange
a thing? Are our Lyes to be accounted Sins before God?
Yes, All against God, as a Witness and a Judge, but not
all as a Party: And so this is a more remarkable, a more
signal Lye. Thou hast not Lyed to Man, a Negative of
Comparison, not so much to Man, as to God; what's done
to them is scarce worth the naming: But thou hast Lyed
to God as a Witness, and a Judge, and a Party too: Thou
hast Lyed, and robbed God by Lying, and so run thy self
into a most horrible Sin, and it shall appear in God's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
So the Fathers generally expound the place, both
of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Church; and affirm, his Crime
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51001:12"/>
was a robbing of God of that Wealth, which by Vow or
Promise was now become God's Propriety; so the modern
interpreters; so <hi>Calvin, Sacrum esse Deo profitebatur;</hi> and
<hi>Beza, Praedium Dco consecrassent;</hi> and he that will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
so universal Consent in the Interpreting of a place
of Scripture, should do well to consider, whether on the
same Ground (as I told you before) he may not be brought
to doubt of his Dictionary (for that's but universal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent)
he may as well almost doubt, whether <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signify God,
and altogether as well, whether <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signify the Gospel.</p>
            <p>The <hi>New-Testament</hi> will afford more places for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<hi>Rom. 2. 22. Thou that abhorrest Idols, committest thou
Sacriledge?</hi> 'Tis true, these words are spoken, as to the
Person of an unconverted <hi>Iew;</hi> and may be therefore thought
to Aim only at those Sins which were against the Law
of <hi>Moses:</hi> But do but view St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s way of Arguing, and
you shall find quickly they come home to us too. He
there tells the <hi>Iew,</hi> that he Taught others those things which
yet he would not do himself; and he strives to make this
good, by three several Instances: <hi>First, Thou that Preachest
a Man should not steal, dost thou steal?</hi> Secondly, <hi>Not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Adultery, dost thou commit Adultery?</hi> In both which, 'tis
plain, that the <hi>Iew</hi> he dealt with, did the same thing he
reprehended; and straitway the <hi>Third</hi> comes, <hi>Thou that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrest
Idols, dost thou commit Sacriledge?</hi> So that hence will
follow (if St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words have any <hi>Logick</hi> in them) that
these two Sins are of the self-same nature too; and that to
commit Sacriledge, is a breach of the same Law as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Idolatry: So that this Crime will appear without all
doubt, a plain Robbing of God. For he that Steals from
Men, yea, though a whole Community of Men; yet he
Sins but against his Neighbour, 'tis but an offence against
the second Table of the Law: But Sacriledge layes hold
on those things which the <hi>Latine</hi> Laws call <hi>Bona nullius,</hi>
it strikes down right immediately at God; and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
no Idolatry can can do it; 'tis a breach of the first
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51001:13"/>
Table of the Law; and both these Crimes are equally built
on the self-same contempt of God. The Offender in both
kinds, the Idolater, and the Sacrilegious Person both think
meanly of Him. The first conceives He will Patiently
look on, while His Honour is shared to an Idol; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
imagines He will be as unconcerned, though His Goods
be stolen to His Face. This was, without doubt, the Sence
of all the ancient Church; for upon what Grounds could
they profess they gave Gifts to God, but only that
they presumed, That God was pleased to Accept them.
So saith <hi>Irenaeus, We offer unto God our Goods, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of Thankfulness.</hi> So <hi>Origen, By Gifts to God, we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
him Lord of All.</hi> So the <hi>Fathers</hi> generally: So <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi>
and <hi>Kings:</hi> So CHARLES the Great, <hi>To God we offer,
which we deliver to his Church, in his well known Capitulary;</hi>
and our own <hi>Kings</hi> have still spoken in this good Old Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Language; <hi>We have Granted to God, for us, and our
Heirs for ever, that the</hi> Church of England <hi>shall be free,
and have Her whole Rights and Liberties inviolable:</hi> They are
the first words of our <hi>Magna Charta; <hi>Her whole Rights
and Liberties;</hi>
               </hi> words of a very large Extent, that imply far
more than Her Substance, and yet these, and all these Lands,
Honours, and Jurisdictions, all these have been given to God;
yea, and frequently confirmed by the publick Acts of this
Kingdom. And if <hi>Ananias</hi> might thus promise, &amp; yet Rob God;
I beseech you Sir consider, whether <hi>England</hi> may not do so too.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Second,</hi> 'tis plain in the Text, That God did as
much take the Temple to be His, as He did the <hi>Iews</hi> Tythes
and Offerings; these last indeed were His by special and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Law and Command, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. but the Temple was the
voluntary design of King <hi>David,</hi> and the voluntary work of
King <hi>Solomon.</hi> Nay, God expresly tells <hi>David,</hi> That He had
been so far from Commanding that House, that He had not so
much as asked this Service. And therefore St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his
Apology, tells the <hi>Iews, Neither against the Laws of the</hi> Jews,
<hi>nor against the Temple, have I offended any thing,</hi> Act. 25. 8</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:51001:13"/>
For he might in some cause offend against the Temple, and
yet not against the Law: Notwithstanding God pleads as
much for his Temple in the Prophet <hi>Haggai,</hi> as he doth in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi,</hi>
for his Tythes and Offerings. In this, his words are—<hi>Ye
have robbed me in Tythes and Offerings.</hi>
               <note place="margin">M. I. 3. 8.</note> In the other—<hi>Is
it time for you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hagg. 1 4. &amp; 6. Mat. 25.</note> 
               <hi>O ye, to dwell in cieled houses, and this house lie
waste? Therefore ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat,
but ye have not enough.</hi> And to affirm in the New Testament,
that God doth accept of meat, drink, and cloathing as is plain;
of money, for which the Land was sold, as in the case of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias:</hi>
And yet he doth not accept of Land it self, is so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to all reason, so contrary to the practice not only of the
Christian, but of the Heathen world; so contrary to what
God himself hath expressed in the Old Testament, and no
where recalled in the New; that he which can quiet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
with such Conceits as these, may (I doubt not) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to the discovery of some Evasions, which, in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
may palliate Murther or Adultery; or to think those
Possessions are indeed Gods which he commands, but not those
which he accepts, is to use God so, as we would neither use
our selves, nor our Neighbours: For no Man doubts, but that's
as properly mine which I accept, as what I attain to by my
own personal Acquisition, be it by a just way, by Study, by
Merchandize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Third: Sacriledge is then committed, (say the
<hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Casuists,</hi> and they speak in their own Profession)
<hi>Quando reverentia rei Sacrae debita violatur;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aquin. 22. Acts 1.</note> when we violate
the Reverence due to a thing Sacred, by turning it into a
thing Profane, so that this Violation may be committed either
<hi>per furtum,</hi> strictly so taken, by stealing a thing moveable;
or, <hi>per plagium,</hi> by stealing of a Man; or, <hi>per invasionem,</hi> by
spoiling Men of Lands or things immoveable: For as any one
of these done against our Neighbour, is, no doubt, in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
phrase Theft, a Sin against the Eighth Precept; so done
against God, 'tis no doubt a Sacriledge, and a breach of the
Table, be it against the First or Second Commandment, I
stand not now to dispute. Thus the word in the New Testament
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51001:14"/>
to express this Sin, is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>praeda,</hi> or <hi>spolium</hi>
so that Sacriledge is not only to be defined by Stealth strictly
taken, but 'tis a depredation, a spoliation of Things consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and so the word extends it self as properly (it not more)
to Lands, as to Things moveable. And hence <hi>Aquinas</hi> is
plain, That Sacriledge reaches out its proper sense—<hi>Ad ea
quae deputata sunt ad sustentationem ministrorum, sive mobilia, sive
immobilia:</hi> For 'twould be very strange to affirm, That in the
sacking of <hi>Ierusalem, Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was sacrilegious, when
he transported the holy Vessels; but not at all, when he burnt
the Temple.</p>
            <p>For the Fourth: Common Reason hath taught all, even the
<hi>Pagan</hi> Nations, to hold Sacriledge a Sin; so that <hi>Lactantius</hi>
observes, (and he was well read in humane Learning) and
therefore chosen Tutor to a Son of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great: <hi>In
omni Religione nihil tale sine vindicta;</hi> God will remarkably
revenge this Sin, not only in the true, but amongst Men of
the most false Religions. And 'twere easie to shew, That no
Nation did ever yet adore a God, but they thought he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
them, and possess himself of some substance; I omit
those Proofs that would be thought too tedious, 'tis enough
to quote the Prophet's words which he speaks to the <hi>Iews.
Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me,</hi> Malachi 3. 8.
A Man, any man, though an <hi>Amorite,</hi> or a meer <hi>Philistine,</hi> a
<hi>Pagan,</hi> (that must be the sense) will not do that to his god,
which you <hi>Iews</hi> do to Me: For the Law written in his heart,
(and he can go by no other) that Law controlleth this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and so plainly tells him, that because his God may be
robbed, or despoiled, he may therefore have a Property. And
if Sacriledge be a Sin against the Law Moral, 'twill follow,
That what we read in the Old Testament against that Sin,
must be as Moral (and that whereby we Christians are as
much obliged) as what we read against Theft or Adultery:
save only these passages which are peculiarly proper unto the
policy of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and we may let them go for Judicial.</p>
            <p>These Directions premised, I return to this <hi>Epistler,</hi> who
conceives it no Sacriledge to take away Church-Lands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:51001:14"/>
—Nor do I (<hi>saith he</hi>) ground my Opinion barely upon
the frequent practice of former Times not only upon Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
(in the Times of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and
King <hi>Charles,</hi> if you have not forgotten the exchange of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>-house,
as well as <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.) but even by the Bishops themselves,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He will not <hi>ground his Opinion upon bare practice,</hi> and indeed
he hath little reason for it; for if from a frequent practice of
sin, we might conclude it were no sin, we might take our leaves
of the Decalogue and (as our New Masters do) put it out of
our Directory, because our intent is to sin it down. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall say no more of such Laws of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. than I would
of <hi>David</hi>'s Adultery, that it is no ground at all to make Men
bold with other Mens Wives. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> made a Law,
(so you have told me, Sir for I speak nothing in this kind but
from you) That Bishops might not alienate their Castles,
Mannors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but only to the Crown: But if she sometimes
took order that Churchmen should not be Bishops, till they
had first made such Alienations, (as I have oft heard you say
she did) I know not how to defend it, but must withall tell
you, That if Prince or Subjects resolve to sell the Church Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,
it is great odds but in a Clergy consisting of Ten
thousand Persons, they shall have Chapmen for them. For
King <hi>Iames,</hi> I must highly commend that most Christian
Prince, you say amongst his first Laws took away that of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Nor can I well tell when this <hi>Epistler</hi> doth
quote King <hi>Charles</hi> for this purpose, unless it were only for the
Alienation of <hi>York</hi>-house; but I must inform him that that Act
was lawful, because it was for the advantage of that Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>episcopal
See, there being clear Text for it, that the <hi>Levites</hi>
themselves might change that which was theirs by Divine
Law, so they gained by Permutation; and this Answer will
serve for what King <hi>Charles</hi> did about <hi>Durham</hi>-house.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he thinks it an Argument</hi>—That by the Bishops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
Deans and Chapters, such things were done, Alienations
were made, long Leases were granted.</p>
            <p>True, Sir, for these Clergymen were but Men, and their sins
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51001:15"/>
can no more abrogate Law, than can the Sins of the Layety;
yet I could name you Churchmen of great Note, who totally
refused to be preferred by that Queen to any Bishoprick at all,
because they would by no means submit their Conscience to
the base Act of such Alienations, and one of them was Bishop
<hi>Andrews.</hi> I could tell you too, that those long Leases he speaks
of, had one cause more than the Marriage of the Clergy; for
when they saw a Stool of Wickedness set up, of sacrilegious
Wickedness, that imagined Mischief by a Law; some, not the
most Men, thought it fit to make those long Leases, that the
Estate of the Church might appear more poor, and so the
less subject unto Harpies, and then their hope was, that at the
length (at least after many Years spent) it might return
whole unto the Successors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He goes on</hi>—But to deal clearly with you, Sir, I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
how there can be any Sacriledge, (properly so called) which
is not a Theft, and more, <hi>viz.</hi> a Theft of something dedicated to
Holy Vse, (a Communion Cup, for instance, or the like) and
Theft, you know, must be of things moveable, even by the Civil
Law; and how Theft can be of Lands or Sacriledge by alienating
Church-Lands, I pray ask your Friend <hi>Holborne,</hi> and his Fellow-Lawyers,
for ours here deride us for the Question?—</p>
            <p>It seems they are very merry at <hi>London,</hi> or at least this
<hi>Epistler</hi> thinks so; for being Winners, he might perhaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
they make themselves pleasant with a Feather; and that
this Argument is as light a thing, appear'd before by my 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
For can any man think (in earnest) that 'tis Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
(and so a Sin) to take away a Cup from a Church, but
'tis none to take away a Mannor? As if <hi>Ahab</hi> had been indeed
a Thief, had he robbed <hi>Naboth</hi> of his Grapes? But <hi>Elijah</hi> was
too harsh when he talked to that good King, because he only
took away his Vineyards. Indeed there is such a Nicety in
the Civil Law, that <hi>Actio Facti</hi> lies only against him that hath
stolen <hi>Rem Mobilem;</hi> for <hi>Iustinian</hi> (it seems) in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of his Digests, (which he took from the writing of
the old <hi>Iuris Prudentis</hi>) thought it fit to follow <hi>Vlpian</hi>'s
judgment; and yet <hi>Sabinus</hi> in his Book <hi>de Furtis,</hi> (a Man of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51001:15"/>
Note amongst those Men) was known to be of another Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion—<hi>Non
tantùm rerum moventium.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gell. l. 11. l. ult.</note> 
               <hi>Sed fundi &amp; aedium
fieri Furtum.</hi> I would gladly know of this <hi>Epistler,</hi> whether
he thinks all Men, both Divines and others, bound to frame
all the Phrases of their Speech, according to the Criticisms
of the Civil Law, as it is now put out by <hi>Iustinian?</hi> If not,
why may not some use the word <hi>Furtum</hi> in <hi>Sabinus</hi>'s sense, as
well as others may in <hi>Vlpian</hi>'s, and then Sacriledge may be
properly a Theft, and as properly in immoveables; or if we
must needs speak in your sense whom <hi>Iustinian</hi> hath approved,
I do not well see how a Man can spoil the Church of her
Lands, and at the Civil Law 'scape an Action of Theft; for it
lies against him that takes the Trees,<note place="margin">F. l. v. 1.</note> Fruits, and Stones. And
I am confident there's no Church-Robber, but he intends to
make use of those kind of Moveables; otherwise, what good
will his Church-Land do him? And if he make this use, a
Thief he is in the Civil Law Phrase; and then in the sense of
this <hi>Epistler</hi> himself, he is without doubt a sacrilegious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>But where (I wonder) did the <hi>Londoner</hi> learn that <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
strictè Sumptum,</hi> was that <hi>genus</hi> of Sacriledge? So that
where there is no Theft in the Civil Law sense, there is none
of this kind of Sin. I am sure 'tis neither intimated by the
<hi>Greek,</hi> nor <hi>Latine</hi> word, nor (I believe) delivered by any
learned Author on this Subject: So that I must set down an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion,
and (I conceive well grounded too) point blank
against this <hi>Londoner,</hi> and affirm there may be a Sacriledge
properly so called, whch is not a Theft in the Civil Law sense;
which has been proved in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Affertion, and need not trouble
Sir <hi>R. Holborne,</hi> (that learned Gentleman may have other busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)
nor his Fellow-Lawyers: For I doubt not there are
enough besides who will here smile at this passage, and will
think that this <hi>Epistler</hi> hath met with a Civil Law Quirk,
which he knew not well how to wield: But, to say truth,
he deals clearly with the Doctor, and tells him, that for
his particular, he doth not yet understand, which for
my part I do believe, and do only wonder, that he would
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51001:16"/>
laugh at another, in a Point he could no better satisfie him
in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He goes on</hi>—The hyre of a Labourer at most as sitting main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
is all that can be challenged.</p>
            <p>But the Maintenance must be honourable, or else we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
use God like no other Men, far worse, I am sure, than
do <hi>Pagans.</hi> And when such a Maintenance hath been once
given in Lands, the Acceptation of it will soon make the Gift
immoveable; so that it signifies little, to say the Apostle had
no Lands, for they who had the Money for Lands sold, might
(no Man will doubt) have still kept the Lands, had they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
them: But the Church being in Her Persecution, the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
were to flie, and Lands, we know, are no moveables.
And 'twere very strange, if not ridiculous, to affirm, that
<hi>Ananias</hi> and his Wife sinned, in taking back what they had
promised; but if in <hi>Specie</hi> they had given those Lands, they
might have revoked that Gift without Sacriledge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He proceeds</hi>—Which I mention, to avoid the groundless Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
upon the Lands and Portions allotted to the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi>
by God's appointment, to whom our Ministers have no Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</p>
            <p>Our Ministers challenge nothing which belonged to the
Tribe by Levitical Right, but where things are once given to
God for the use of his Ministers, they there get a moral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest;
and what we read of this kind in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
doth as much oblige Christians, as if it were in the
New.</p>
            <p>And then 'twill follow, that they enjoy your Lands by the
same Law of the State as others do, and must be subject to
that Law which alone gives strength to their Title. <hi>Out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Coelo!</hi> Have Churchmen no Title to those Possessions they
enjoy, but by the Law of this Land alone? Yes, besides these,
they have Christ's Acceptation, and so they are become theirs
by Law Evangelical; their Lands are God's own Propriety,
and so they hold them from him by the Law moral too. And
therefore though by the new Constitution of the Laws of the
Land, they hold Estates in Fee simply, and so may alienate,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51001:16"/>
without punishment from the Law of <hi>England;</hi> yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do it without guilt of Sin, as being a breach of the Law
Evangelical and Moral, except then only when they better
themselves by some gainful, at least not hurtful Permutation.
Besides, were this Argument good, it would only follow, that
the Clergy by their own, yet might alienate their Lands, but
none else without their consent. And I conceive it would not
now prove so easie a task to bring Churchmen to such an
Alienation: But the Parliament may do it.</p>
            <p>—For (<hi>saith he</hi>) I am sure it will be granted, that (by
the Laws of this Nation) whosoever hath Lands or Goods, hath
them with this unseparable condition of limitation, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that
the Parliament may dispose of them, or any part of them, at their
pleasure.</p>
            <p>This you have told me, Sir, is strange Doctrine: For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Parliament (I hope he means the King in Parliament)
doth this, as being the Supreme Power, or as being Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative,
and so including the consent of the whole People of
<hi>England.</hi> If as being the Supreme Power, it will follow that
any absolute Prince may as lawfully do the like; and yet this
hath ever been held Tyrannical in the <hi>Great Turk,</hi> as being
against the Rules of all Justice and Humanity. Indeed <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>
tells the <hi>Israelites,</hi> That since they would needs change
their Theocracy, the immediate Government of God himself,
though it were into a Monarchy, the best of all humane Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.
Their Kings should take your Sons, and your
Daughters, their Fields and their Vineyards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they shall
cry, and find no help. Yet the best Divines think this would
be most sinful and most unjust in those Kings, and expresly
against the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> who grants to every Man his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety:
only the Prophet avers it should not be punishable in
him, they should have no remedy, since being the Supreme
Power, it was in no Subjects hands to judge him. So if the
Kings in Parliament should take away the Church-Lands,
there is (I confess) no resistance to be made, though the Act
were inhumanely sinful: or else the Parliament doth this, as
representing the whole People, so including their consent:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51001:17"/>
(For they who do consent, can receive no injury.) And then
I understand not which way it can now at all touch the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
who are neither to be there by themselves, nor yet (God
knows) by Representation. Or if again they were there, I
would gladly know what Burgess, or what Knight of a Shire,
nay, what Clerk or Bishop do represent Christ, (whose Lands
these are) and by vertue of what Deputation? Or do I believe
that any Subject intends to give that Power to him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
him in Parliament, as to destroy his whole Estate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
then only when the known Laws of the Land make him
liable to so high a Censure?</p>
            <p>But grant this Doctrine were true in Mens Lands, yet sure
it will not hold in Gods: For since <hi>in Magnâ Chartâ</hi> (that has
received by Parliament at least Thirty Confirmations) the
Lands we now speak of are given to God, and promise there
made, that the Church, Her whole Right and Liberties should
be held inviolable. Surely the Kingdom must keep what she
hath thus promised to God, and must not now think to tell
Him of implied Conditions or Limitations. For 'twere a
strange scorn put upon Him, that Men should make this grand
promise to their Maker, and then tell Him, after so many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years, that their meaning was, to take it back at their
pleasure. I believe there's no good <hi>Pagan</hi> that will not blush
at this dealing, and conclude, That if Christians may thus
use their God, without doubt he is no God at all.</p>
            <p>Hence it is (<hi>saith he</hi>) they sometimes dispose some part in Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and other Taxes, the Parliament disposes part of Mens
Estate in Subsidy, and without their consent, <hi>Ergo</hi> it may dispose
of all the Church-Lands, though the Churchmen themselves should
in down-right terms contradict it.</p>
            <p>Surely, Sir, this Account is neither worth an Answer, nor a
Smile: For I am sure you have oft told me, That the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Justice can destroy no Man's Estate, though private;
or if upon necessity it may need this or that Man's Lands for
some Publick Use, yet the Court is bound in Justice to make
that Man amends. Subsidies, you say, were imposed <hi>Salvo
contenento;</hi> so that a Duke may still live like a Duke, and a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51001:17"/>
Gentleman like a Gentleman. Is't not so with the Clergy too?
By your own consent indeed, and not otherwise, they are often
imposed, and payed by them; but if they are burdens, which
they may bear <hi>Salvo contenento,</hi> they are payed not out of
God's Propriety, by alienating his Lands, but out of the <hi>Vsus
Fructus</hi> they receiv'd from God, and so the Name doth go on
to their Successors. So that to infer from any of these Usages,
that the Lands of Bishops, Deans and Chapters, may be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alienated from the Church, is an Inference that will prevail
with none but those, who being led by strong passions that it
should be so, make very little use of the Reason.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He proceeds</hi>—Now hence comes the mistake, by reason there
is not such an express Condition or Limitation in the Deed of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
(which should silence all dispute) wherein it is as clear
as truth, that where any thing is necessarily by Law implied, 'tis as
much as if in plain terms expressed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No marvel if such Conditions be not expressed in Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
Deeds of Donation, because it will make such pious
Deeds most impiously ridiculous: For who would not blush
to tell God, that indeed he gives him such Lands but yet with
very clear intent to revoke them? And what Christian will
say, that such an intent is tacitely there, which were Impiety
to express? Nay, it is apparently clear, by the Curses added by
such Donors upon those who shall attempt to make void their
Gifts, that their meaning was plain, that such Lands should
remain Gods. For ever by <hi>Magna Charta</hi> these Gifts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
unto the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (She shall have all Her
whole Rights and Liberties inviolable) and yet is there a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
condition in that self-same Law that they may be violated?
No marvel if with us, Men cannot trust Men, if God himself
must not trust our Laws; and if that Charter, or any else
made by succeeding Princes, do indeed confirm such Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
(as without all doubt they do) sure they must confirm
them in the same Sense wherein the Donors made them, for
so do all other Confirmations. I say in this case of a total
Disinherison, there cannot be in Law any such tacite Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or Limitations, as the <hi>Epistler</hi> speaks of; for I have shewed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51001:18"/>
you such to be tyrannical and unjust in a private Subject's
Estate, therefore in Gods they are much more unjust, because
we are sure he cannot offend, and the tyrannical and unjust
meaning cannot be called the meaning of the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Letter goes on</hi>—Besides, it were somewhat strange, that
the Donors of the Land should preserve them in the hands of the
Bishops from the power of the Parliament, which they could not do
in their own, and give them to a greater and surer Right than they
had themselves.</p>
            <p>The Lay-Donor might preserve them thus in his own hands,
suppose him but an honest Person; for though a Parliament
may <hi>Impunè</hi> disinherit such an innocent Man, yet they cannot
do it justly, and so in this regard, both the Donor and they are
(you see) in the very same condition. Besides, 'tis no such
very strange thing for the self-same Right (as a Right suppose
a Fee-simple) to become more sure in his hand that takes it,
than it ever was in his hand that gave it. For though the
Right it self be still the same Right, (for <hi>Nemo dat quod non
habet</hi>) yet by Gift it may come into a stronger hand, and so
by this means that self-same Right may become the stronger.
And sure with us, God's hands should be more stronger than
Man's: Nay hence, as some think, Lands given to the Church,
were said to come in <hi>manum mortuam,</hi> as 'twere a dead hand,
that parts with nothing it hath once closed upon.</p>
            <p>And why the <hi>Epistler</hi> should call this a strange thing, I do
not yet see the reason, because 'tis always so when any one
Benefactor doth by vertue of a Mortmayne, convey his Lands
to any kind of Corporation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again</hi>—Nor do I understand their meaning, who term God
the Proprietary of the Bishops Lands, and the Bishops the <hi>Usu
Fructuarii.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I conceive I have made this plain, because such Lands were
first offered to God, and become his own Propriety, by his own
Divine Acceptation. And if the <hi>Dominiam ad rectum</hi> of Kings
do once rest in God, the <hi>Dominum utile,</hi> the <hi>Vsa fructus</hi> only
is left a Patrimony to the Clergy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:51001:18"/>
               <hi>But he adds a Reason</hi>—For I know not how (in propriety of
speech) God is more entitled to their Lands, than to his whole
Creation.</p>
            <p>Here the <hi>Epistler</hi> speaks out; for truly, Sir, I fear this
Lawyer, your Friend, is little better than an Independant:
For has God no more Title (in propriety of speech) to one
piece of ground than another? No more to a Church, no more
to a place where a Church is built, that where Men have pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
a Stable? Our English Homilies, which are confirmed by
Law, cry down this gross piece of <hi>Anabaptism.</hi> 'Tis true,
God made all things, and so the whole World is most justly
his, by that great work of Creation: But yet the <hi>Psalmist</hi>'s
words are as true, <hi>The earth hath he given to the children of
men.</hi> So as that great God is well content to receive back
what Men will give him, and this acceptance of his must
needs in all reason make those things his more particularly.
Thus Christ calls the Temple, <hi>My Father's House:</hi> 'Twas
Gods, and Gods more peculiarly; not only by the right of
Creation, but of Donation. Thus Lands given to God are
his, and his more peculiarly; so that his Priests and his Poor
being sustained by them, he calls it in a more peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>his meat, and his drink, and his cloathing.</hi> And then, if in
point of acceptance with God, there be a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
feeding his Priests, and feeding them that do him no
service, there must needs be as much difference betwixt Lands
set out to that Sacred Use, and Lands of a meer common em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He gives a second Reason</hi>—Were Clergymen the <hi>Usu
Fructuarii,</hi> how come they to change, dispose, and alter the propriety
of any thing, which an <hi>Usu Fructuarii</hi> cannot do, and yet is done by
them daily?</p>
            <p>Yes, they may change or dispose, or alter many kinds of
things, (for so, without doubt, may an <hi>Vsa Fructuarii</hi> do) so
that he wrong not his Lord, by an Abuse done to his Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Thus he may change his Corn into Cloathing, or his
Wooll into Books. Nay, he may alter the very Propriety of
his Possessions too, if he have express leave of his Lord. And
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51001:19"/>
God himself did tell <hi>Levi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lev. 27. 13.</note> that he was well content that men
should alter some things that belonged unto him, so that it
were to that Tribes advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Letter goes on</hi>—Ask then by what Divine Law St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s
Church in <hi>Oxon</hi> may not be equally employed for Temporal
Vses, as for holding the Vicechancellor's Court, the Vniversity,
Convocation, or the yearly Acts?</p>
            <p>He might as well have asked, Why not for Temporal Uses as
for Temporal Uses; for if these he means be not so, his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is naught; and if they be so, it is not well put down.
His meaning surely was, for other Temporal Uses, as well as
for these. And truly, Sir, to put a Church to any such kind
of use, is not to be defended; and therefore I excuse not the
University, especially She having had at least for a good time
so many large places for these meetings: Yet something may
be said for the Vicehancellor's Court, because 'tis partly Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal;
something for the Act, at least <hi>in Comitiis,</hi> because 'tis
partly Divinity; but I had rather it should receive an amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than an excuse, though it follow not neither, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this Church is sometimes for some few hours abused,
therefore it may be always so; as if because sometimes it is
made a prophane Church, therefore fit 'twere no Church at
all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He proceeds</hi>—And for the Curses, (those bugbear words)
I could never yet learn, that an unlawful Curse was any prejudice
but to the Author, of which sort these Curses must be, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
the Parliament, or any other, from exercising a lawful and
undeniable Power, which in instances would seem very ridiculous,
if any Curse should prejudice another lawful Right; I am
sure such Curses have no warrant from the Law of God, or this
Nation.</p>
            <p>No warrant from the Law of God? I conceive there is a
very clear one, and Our Mother the Church commends it to
the use of Her Sons, in the express words of the Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Cursed be he that removes the marks of his Neighbours
Lands,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 27. 17.</note> 
               <hi>and all the People shall say, Amen.</hi> If he be accursed
that wrongs his Neighbour in his Lands, what shall he be,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51001:19"/>
that injures his God? If a Curse light on him, and a publick
Curse, (confirmed by <hi>Amen,</hi> made by all the People) who
removes but the mark whereby his Neighbours Lands are
distinguished, sure a private Curse may be annexed by a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor
unto his Deed of Donation, in case Men should rob
the very Lands themselves that have been given to their
Maker.</p>
            <p>That such Curses restrain the Parliament in their undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Right, is (you have told me) but a great mistake: For
though the Parliament may <hi>impunè</hi> (which in some case is
called lawful) take away Church Lands, yet the Church it
self cannot do it justly without a Sin, and that a greater Sin,
than removing a Land-mark, and then a higher may follow it.
Let the <hi>Epistler</hi> then take heed of those more than Bugbear
words, for believe it, Sir, in such Curses as these, there is
much more than Shows or Vizards, and if you will give
trust to any Stories at all, many great men have sadly
felt it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His last Argument is</hi>—Ask your Bishops, Whether
Church Lands may not lawfully (the Law of the States not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting)
be transferred from one Church to another, upon emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Occasions, which I think they will not deny; if so, who knows
that the Parliament will transfer them to Lay-Lands? They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
no such thing, and I hope they will not, but continue them for
the maintenance of the Ministry.</p>
            <p>I conceive the Bishops Answer would be, That it is no Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to transfer Land from one Church to another, but yet
there may be much Rapine and Injustice, the Will of the Dead
may be violated, and so Sin enough in the Action. Men may
be injuriously put from the Estates, in which they have as
good Title by the Law of the Land, as these same Men that
put them out. To say then that the Church Lands may be
totally given up, because the <hi>Epistler</hi> hopes the Parliament will
commit no Sacriledge, is a pretty way of persuasion, and may
equally work on him to give up his own Lands, because he
may as well hope to be re-estated again, in that the Parliament
will do no Injustice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:51001:20"/>
And now, Sir, having thus observed your Commands, yet
one thing more I shall adventure to crave your Patience in, and
'tis to let you know, That if this <hi>Epistler</hi> had been right in
both his Conclusions—<hi>That Episcopacy is not of Divine Right,
and that Sacriledge is no Sin;</hi> yet if you cast your Eyes upon
His Majesties Coronation Oath, wherein He is so strictly
sworn to defend both the Episcopal Order, and the Church
Lands and Possessions, you would easily acknowledge, That
the King cannot yield to what this Letter aims at. And
though I must needs guess, and that the <hi>Epistler</hi> knew well
enough his Juratory Tye, yet you will the less blame him for
his concealment in this kind, because he was not retain'd of
the Churches Councel.</p>
            <p>His Majesties Oath you may find published by Himself, in
an Answer to the Lords and Commons in Parliament,<note place="margin">1646.</note> 26 <hi>May.</hi>
It runs thus:</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Episcopus.]</speaker>
               <p>Sir, Will You grant and keep, and by Your Oath
confirm unto the People of <hi>England,</hi> the Lavs and Customs to
them granted by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> Your Lawful and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Predecessors; and namely, the Laws, Customs and Franchises
granted to the Clergy by the Glorious King <hi>Edward</hi> Your Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,
according to the Laws of God, the true Profession of the
Gospel established in this Kingdom, and agreeable to the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the Kings thereof, and the ancient Customs of this
Realm?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>REX.]</speaker>
               <p>I grant and promise to keep them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Episcopus.]</speaker>
               <p>Sir, Will You keep Peace and godly Agreement
intirely (according to Your Power) both to God, the Holy Church,
the Clergy, and the People?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>REX.]</speaker>
               <p>I will keep it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Episcopus.]</speaker>
               <p>Sir, Will You (to Your Power) couse Law, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Discretion, in Mercy and Truth to be exeruted in all Your
Iudgments?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>REX.]</speaker>
               <p>I will.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:51001:20"/>
               <speaker>Episcopus.]</speaker>
               <p>Will You grant to hold and keep the Laws, and
rightful Customs which the Commonalty of this Your Kingdom
have? And will You defend and uphold them, to the Honour of
God, as much as in You lieth?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>REX.</speaker>
               <p>I grant and promise so to do.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then one of the Bishops reads this Admonition to the King
before the People, with a loud voice:</p>
            <p>Our Lord and King, we beseech You to pardon, and grant and
preserve unto us, and to the Churches committed to our Charge, all
Canonical Priviledges, and due Law and Iustice: And that You
would protect and defend us, as every good King in His
Kingdom ought to be Protector and Defender of the Bishops, and
the Churches under their Government.</p>
            <p>Then the King ariseth, and is led to the Communion Table,
where He makes a Solemn Oath in the sight of all His People,
to observe the Promises, and laying His Hand upon the Book,
saith—</p>
            <p>The Things which I have before promised, I shall perform and
keep. So help me God, and the Contents of the Book.</p>
            <p>In the first Clause (it is plain) He makes a promissory Oath
to the whole People of <hi>England,</hi> (a word that includes both
Nobility, Clergy, and Commons) <hi>That He will keep and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
their Laws and Customs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the second, He swears a particular Promise to the
Clergy, <hi>That He will keep the Laws, Customs and Franchises
granted to the Clergy by the Glorious King</hi> Edward.</p>
            <p>And again (more plain in the fifth Clause) he makes the
like promissory Oath to the Bishops alone, in behalf of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and their Churches, <hi>That He will preserve and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to them all Canonical Priviledges, and due Law and Iustice:
And that He will be their Protector and Defender.</hi> Where since
He swears Protection to the Bishops by Name, 'tis plain He
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51001:21"/>
swears to maintain their Orders: For he that swears he will
take care, that Bishops be preserved in such and such Rights,
must needs swear to take care, that Bishops shall first be, for
their Rights must needs suppose their Essence.</p>
            <p>And where the King swears Defence, it must needs be in a
Royal Kingly way: <hi>Tu defende Me Gladio, &amp; Ego defendam Te
Calamo,</hi> is the well known Speech of a worthy Churchman
to his Prince. For sure where Kings swear defence to Bishops,
I do not think they swear to write Books in their behalf, or to
attempt to make it clear to their People, That Episcopacy is
<hi>Iure Divino:</hi> But a King (whose Propriety it is to bear the
Sword) swears to bear it in defence of Bishops. For though
it be against the very Principles of Christian Faith, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
should be planted and reformed by Blood, yet when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Kings have by Law setled this Religion, and sworn de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of those Persons that should preach it, he ought sure to
bear his Sword to defend his Laws, and to keep his Soul free
from Perjury, as well to them, as the rest of his Subjects.</p>
            <p>And as by Canonical Priviledge that belong to them and
their Churches, there must needs be implied the Honour of
their several Orders, (as that Bishops should be above Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) together with all the due Rights and Jurisdictions.
And the words, <hi>Due Law and Iustice,</hi> cannot but import, That
His Majesty binds Himself to see that Justice be done to them
and their Churches, according to Law then in force when
He took that Oath. And the King swears <hi>Protection and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi>
that Clause must needs reach not only to their Persons,
but to their Rights and Estates; for He swears not only to
Men, but to Men in such a condition, to Bishops of their
Churches. And whereas He swears to be their <hi>Protector and
Defender, to His Power, in the Assistance of God;</hi> those words,
<hi>To His Power,</hi> may seem to acquit Him of all the rest, if He
fall into a condition wherein all Power is taken from Him.
But, Sir, I will prove that a mistake for one of the greatest
Powers of the King of <hi>England;</hi> Is His Negative in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
so, that without Him no Law can be Enacted there, since
'tis only the Power Royal that can make a Law to be Law? So
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51001:21"/>
So that if the King should pass a Statute to take away the
Churches Lands, He protects it not to His Power: since 'tis
plain, so long as a Man lives and speaks, he hath still power to
say No: For it cannot be said in this Case, that the Church
may be (as it were) ravisht from the King, and then He
may be no more guilty of the Crime, than <hi>Lucretia</hi> was in
her Rape; for though a chaste Body may suffer Ravishment,
yet the strength of a <hi>Tarquin</hi> cannot possibly reach to Man's
Will or Assent.</p>
            <p>Now in all promissory Oaths made for the benefit of that
Party to whom we swear, 'tis a Rule with Divines, That they
(of all others) do most strictly bind, except then allow when
Remission is made—<hi>Consensu illius cui facta est promissio.</hi>
So although the King swear to the People of <hi>England, That
He will keep and preserve their Laws,</hi> yet if upon their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
desires these Laws be either abrogated, or altered, 'tis clear
that Oath binds no farther, because a Remission is made by
their own consent who desired that Promise from Him. And
upon this ground 'tis true, the King swears to observe the
Laws only <hi>in Sensu composito,</hi> so long as they are Laws; but
should this desire either to alter or abrogate either Law or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
proceed from any other but from them alone to
whose benefit He was sworn, 'tis plain by the Rules of all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
that by such an Act or Desire, His Oath receives no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission;
for the foundation of this Promissory is the Oath He
was sworn to, and it cannot be remitted but by them alone
for whose sakes it was taken; so that when (in the second
Part of the first Clause, and more plainly in the fifth) He swears
a benefit unto the Bishops alone in behalf of them and their
Churches, 'tis apparent this Oath must perpetually bind, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a remission can be obtained from the Bishops themselves,
and their Churches He was sworn to.</p>
            <p>This then must be confessed to be the sense of the Oath, that
when the King hath first sworn in general, <hi>to grant, keep and
confirm the Laws and Customs of the People of</hi> England, He far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet swears to the Clergy, <hi>to preserve their Laws and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,</hi>
and since these are not able to make a Negative in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51001:22"/>
Parliament, so that the Clergy may be easily swallowed up
by the People, and by the Lords; therefore in a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
manner, they have obtained an Oath to be made unto
them by the King, which being for their particular benefit,
it cannot be remitted without their express Consent: So that
although an Act of Parliament being once passed by the Votes
of the King, and both Houses, it doth (Sir, as you have told
me our Lawyers say) bind the whole People of <hi>England,</hi>
yea, the whole People, as it includes the Clergy too; yet it
concerns the King, by vertue of His Oath, to give His Vote
to no such Act as shall prejudice what He hath formerly sworn
unto them, except He can first obtain their express Consent,
that He may be thereby freed from His Juratory Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
            <p>It may be said, perhaps, That in the Consent given by both
Houses of Parliament, the Consent of the Clergy is tacitly
implied, and so it is (say our Lawyers, as you have told me
Sir) in respect of the Powers obligatory, which an Act so
passed obtains upon them; for they affirm, That it shall
strongly bind the Clergy, as if they themselves had in express
terms consented to it, although Bishops being debarr'd from
the Votes in Parliament, and neither they nor their inferiour
Clergy having made choice of any to represent them in that
great Council, their Consent can be in no fair sense said to be
involved in such Acts as are done, as well without their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative
Presence, as their Personal. But the Question is,
Whether such tacit Consent (though it be indeed against
their express Wills) can have a Power remissory to the King,
to absolve Him of His Oath? He that affirms it must resolve
to meet with this great Absurdity, that although besides His
general Oath to all the People of <hi>England,</hi> His Majesty be in
particular sworn ot the Rights of the Clergy, yet they obtain
no more benefit by this, than if He had sworn only in general;
which is as much as to say, that in this little Draught, Oaths
are multiplied without necessity; nay, without signification
at all: And that the greatest part of the first, and the whole
fourth Clause, are nothing else but a more painful Draught of
superfluous Tautologies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:51001:22"/>
For His yielding to the two first Lines, swears Him <hi>to keep
and to confirm the Laws and Customs of the whole People of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
which word <hi>People,</hi> includes those of the Clergy too,
and so in general their Laws and Customs are confirm'd (no
doubt) in these words, and so confirm'd, that they cannot be
shaken, but at least by their tacit Consent in Parliamentary
way: And since the King condescends to afford to their Rights
a more particular Juratory Tye, there is no doubt but it binds
in a way too that's more particular; so that His Majesty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expect a remission of this Oath, without the Consent
clearly expressed.</p>
            <p>For as when the King swears to keep the Laws of the whole
People in general, He can by no means acquire a remission of
this Oath, but by the express Consent of the People. So
when in particular He swears unto the Laws and Customs of
the Clergy, this Oath must needs bind, until it be remitted in
an express Form, either by the whole Clergy themselves, or by
some Body of Men (at least) that represents the Clergy,
<hi>quatenus</hi> a Clergy, and not only as they are involved in that
great Body of the People. So that he that presumes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
His Majesty to pass any Act in prejudice of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Body, (to whom He is thus sworn) without their
express Consent first obtained, counsels Him that which is both
injurious to his Fellow Subjects; nay, which is indeed a most
damnable wickedness against the very Soul of the King.</p>
            <p>SIR, As I conceive, it is now plain enough, That if the
Parliament should destroy the Episcopal Order, and take away
the Lands of the Church, the Houses in that Act will run
themselves into two Sins, and His Majesty into three. And
upon this Supposition the <hi>Epistler</hi> and I have agreed; <hi>I do not
think,</hi> saith he, <hi>that Convenience or Necessity will excuse Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in a thing in it self unlawful:</hi> And before that, he calls
the contrary, the Tenent of the <hi>Romanist,</hi> or <hi>Iesuited Puritan;</hi>
only I will beseech him for his own Souls sake, to consider how
great a Scandal he hath given to Mankind, in defence of such
Sins as these: For, I conceive, that <hi>Durand</hi> offended more, in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51001:23"/>
holding that Fornication was no Sin against the Law natural,
than <hi>Sechem</hi> did (who was only under that Law) in his lust
upon old <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Daughter; for <hi>Fraudem legi facere,</hi> (saith the
<hi>Civilian</hi>) is worse than <hi>Legem violare.</hi> It argues a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subject-like
disposition, for a Man to put Tricks and Fallacies
upon his Princes Laws, than to run himself into a downright
Violation: And God (we know) is a King; <hi>I am a great
King, saith the Lord of Hosts, and a King in whose hands is a
vengeance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, SIR, we are thus put into a very sad Condition,
when the only Option that seems left us now, is either to chuse
Sin or Ruine; but yet (if well us'd) 'tis a Condition glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
a Condition in which all that Noble Army of Martyrs
stood, before they could come at Martyrdom. And if in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of mind, we thus lay our Lives down at the Feet of
Christ, I am undoubtedly persuaded it is the onely way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them; for this Word of God is the Lord of Hosts too,
and for his Glories sake, he oft effects to save them who have
lost both their strength and hopes: But to you, Sir, whom I
know so well, such Persuasions as these are needless. I rest</p>
