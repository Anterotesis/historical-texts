         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>So that by this ye maye clerely se, that Tyndale affer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> &amp; techeth for a treuth, that in all other thinges bysyde the promyses / a trewe member of hys electe chyrche maye somtyme erre, but neuer malycyously / and that is to wytte neuer but of weykenesse and furmentye, as hym selfe hath often all redy declared.

                  <p>But than gothe Tyndall farther and sayth, <hi>that god ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his electes see bothe theyr owne dampnacion in the lawe, and also the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that is layde vp for them in Christes bloode, and therto what he wyll haue them do.</hi>

For Tyndale as ye shall here after rede, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the faythe of the electes a felyng faythe. Nowe if Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid were in a slepe, all that whyle &amp; had thereby forgotten his faythe and hym selfe to / than though his faythe had all the whyle the lyfe, yet at the leste hit loste for the whyle the felynge.

                  <p>But lette this passe this ones as for thys tyme / and se howe he proueth that Dauid was fallen to suche a dede slepe, that he had in all that whyle neyther wytte nor wyll / and therfore consented nat vnto synne agaynste the lawe of god.

                  <p>Lo good reders, here se ye very clere, that where as Tyndale sayth that Dauid in all those horryble dedes dyd yet no dedely synne, bycause he sayeth he consented not to synne, nor dyde none of these dedes wyllyngly, nor cast not of the yoke of loue towarde the lawe of god / god here sayth that Dauyd dyd in those horryble dedes dyspyce bothe his lawe and hym selfe to. And how dyd he then kepe styll his loue to the lawe of god, in the whyle in whyche he dyspysed both the lawe of god and god hym selfe also? Or how sayth Tyndale that Dauyd co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sented not to the synne, when god hym selfe that beste knewe hys thoughte layed hys synnes so sore to hys charge, that he appoynted an endeles plage for the punisshement therof? tyll by hys repentaunce &amp; his humble confessyon, god as he forgaue the dedelynesse of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the synne, and translated it from mortall in to venyall, so chaunged the punysshemente from endeles in to endynge.</p>
                  <p>For where as the prophete, had before hys repentaunce and confessyon sayed vnto hym by the byddynge of god, The plage shall abyde in thyne howse for euer world with ende / forthwyth after hys repentaunce and hys confessyon made, he sayed vnto hym, Our lorde hath translated thy synne that was, from dedely to venyall / that is to wytte the punysshement from eternall to temporall. And therfore the prophete sayed, that yet the chylde that he bygatte vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon her in that auoutry, sholde dye as it dyde after in dede. And yet was not Dauyd out of hope wyth other penaunce (whyche he hadde leuer sustayne) to purge and redeme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> punisshement to / and therfore fasted and prayed to saue the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> chylde, vntyll the tyme that it was dede in dede.</p>

                  <p>who can more plainly say that they were fallen from the faythe and lacked the belefe, than Tyndale sayeth here?

                  <p>But where as before in the tytle he made as I saye hys questyon of the pope and hys secte / here he turneth it into the pope and hys spyrytes.

                  <p>And Tyndale very well woteth, that the spyrytualtye so farforth doth accompte not them selfe alone but the tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poraltye, and them selfe to gether for the catholyke chyrch / that there is not so pore a frere, but he professyth it almost in euery sermone.

                  <p>Nowe it is a greate shame for Tyndale to flye fro the poynte as he dothe, in a mater so playne and open, that euery chylde maye se how lothe he is to comme nere and cope.</p>

                  <p>But thys is hys fasshyon lo in all thynges / he maketh as though he mocke but men of these later dayes / whyche

                  <p>But I wyll nat do saynt Cyprian so moche dishonour, as to sette hym to dispute with Tyndale. But syth Tyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale and I be somwhat more metely matches.

For euery chyld may se perde that these two thynges be not lyke / that is to wytte the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge out of the trewe chyrche of Cryste, and the goyng out of the false chyrche of heretykes. For the trewe chyrche of Cryste is but one. And the false chyrches of heretykes be many. And therfore though euery man that goth from the
<pb n="cclxvi" facs="tcp:4480:138"/>
faith out of that one trew chyrch of Crist, must nedes be an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> heretyke, bycause he can not so go out but by heresye / it fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not that in lyke wyse euery man that goeth oute of the chyrche of heretykes, goeth into the trewe chyrche of Cryste, by the trewe fayth agayne / for as mych as of many chyrches, he maye go out of one into another / and so ye se well they do. And therfore Tyndale speketh false Englysh when he sayth the chyrche of heretykes. For they neyther be any one chyrch, nor haue any one chyrche ouer them all, so specyall that it maye be by a certayne specyall preemy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens in respecte of the remanaunt called the chyrche.</p>
                  <p>Now that a man maye go out of a false chyrche of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tykes and yet not into the trewe chyrche of Cryst / Tyndale maye well perceyue by two samples of two specyall herety<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes of two contrary condycyons / that is to wytte one here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of olde called Berengarius, and an other of new cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led wyllyam Hychyn. Berengarius fell fyrst into that fals heresye agaynste the blessed sacrament of the aulter, that he affermed and helde that there is not in it the very body of Cryste, nor nothynge but onely very brede, and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hys chyrche of his heresye togyther.

                  <p>And thus in Berengarius may Tyndale well perceyue that a man may go frow a false chyrche of heretykes, and yet not strayt into the trewe chyrche of Cryste.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tyndale maye also perceyue thys poynte well by the tother new heretyke wyllyam Huchyn, whych fyrste fell to the secunde heresye that was of the twayne the lesse euyll, that is to wyt the heresye that Luther holdeth, that in the sacrament is bothe the very body of Cryst and very brede. But now eyther bycause he longed euer to falle vnto the wurste, as longe as he myght fynde any wurse then other, or ellys bycause he fauored frete Huskyn, bycause his own name was Huchyn / he fell in that poynt from Luthers he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resye to hys, and affermeth now that there is in the blessed sacrament nothynge ellys but brede / and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And thus where the olde heretyke Berengarius began at the worste, and from that fell to lesse euyll: this new he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retyque Huchyn goth contrary way, begynnynge at the lesse euyll and fallynge from that vnto the worse.

and all theyr whole secte such a sure fall, that they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> well aryse and walke vp ryght whyle they lyue agayn. For as hys hyghnes layed vnto hym, syth Luther can not saye nay but that he must byleue the chyrch when it telleth hym that these thynges god caused hys apostles to wryte / wherfore must he not as mych byleue it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it telleth hym These thynges god caused hys apostles to tell and teche by mouth?

                  <p>There is good reders a boke whyche saynte Austayne wryteth agaynste heretyques of his owne tyme, that dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praysed then the lyuyng of the crysten people of the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke chyrch, extollyng the holy vertuouse lyuyng of theyr owne secte / by whyche we may well se y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heretykes had yet at that day a right fayre visage of very vertuouse lyuyng, and preached not theyr heresies with defence of open sham<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full lechery, as these bestely heretykes do nowe. But saynt Austayne, all be yt he coulde not say naye, but that in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> chyrche there were as well badde as good: yet descrybeth he partely the vycyouse lyuynge and partely the ypocrysy to, that was then amonge those hcretyques, and bysydes that the vertuouse lyuynge that then was amonge many good folke of the catholyke chyrche.</p>
                  <p>And what vertues be those? surely euen the same that the knowen catholike chyrch teacheth now, and which ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tues in this catholyke chyrch many a good man both spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytuall and temporall yet vnto this daye god be thanked very well kepe and obserue / howe be yt the fewer a great many, syth these deuelyshe heresyes came vppe.</p>
                  <p>And this dare I well promyse Tyndale, let hym rede ouer that boke when he wyll, in whyche saynt Austayn re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>herseth the vertues y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he prayseth in the chyrche / &amp; when he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hath well and perfytely redde yt onys ouer, or yf he lyste hardely twyse or thryes yt can be no losse of his tyme / and this I say wyll I gladly geue hym wyth yt, let hym take myn yie for an apple, yf he fynde yt in all the boke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for any great vertue, a frere to wedde a nunne.</p>

               <p>Uery well declared, as though he wold tell vs that there were a woman that went inuysyble, and that he ment not that her handes, or her fete, or her hed, or any parte of her were inuysyble / but all her partes beynge vysyble, her self were yet inuysyble.

               <p>Now where that the glose sayth, there muste nedes be suche a chyrch so say I to. For I say playnly that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chyrch muste nedes be. For all the deuylles in hell, nor all theyr in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>strumentes vpon erth, shall neuer be able to destroy yt, but pull they neuer so many from yt, &amp; leue they the remanau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t neuer so few: yet shall the remanaunt alway be the chyrch, and a well knowen chyrche, to byelded vppon that hygh mountayne, that is to wyt vppon Cryst, that yt shall alway be syghtely &amp; can not be hydde. For as our sauyour sayth: The cytye that is set vppon a mountayne can not be hyd / meanynge that his chyrche shold be well sene, and his trew fayth well knowen / and not that his chyrche in whych hys fayth sholde contynue, and in whyche &amp; of whyche yt shold be lerned, sholde be suche an vnknowen thynge as they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that wolde lerne: coulde neyther wote where to fynde yt, nor of whome to aske for yt, nor so myche as know yt yf yt fortuned them to fall vppon yt by happe, as frere Barons wolde here brynge yt to.</p>
               <p>Also the tother glose that Barons bryngeth forth, De pene dis. 2. Si, that sayth, The whole chyrche can not erre: what maketh that glose for Barons? He speketh agaynste Barons. For Barons sayth that his owne chyrche whyche hym selfe assygneth, though she can not erre whyle she cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to her spouse / yet she may leue hym and fall from him, and then erre. And so this glose that Barns bryngeth, saith clere agaynst hym / how be yt no more then he semeth to do hym selfe. For yf yt be trew that he sayth of his chyrch that she may fall from god and not heare her husband, and then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> therby erre: then is yt false that he sayth in a nother place, that there muste nedes be suche a chyrche as can not erre / whyche thynge he wolde proue by this glose of the lawe that saith, The whole chyrch can not erre. And yet ye se wel that this glose takyng yt after the beste fashyon for it, saith not as Barons sayeth, that the very chyrche is no mo but that very secrete sorte of faythfull folke that be wythout a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny errour, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> be pure &amp; clene wythoute spot or wryncle / but he sayth that the whole chyrch that is to wit the knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> catholyque chyrche, can not all erre / but that though that god wold suffer some partis or me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of his chyrch to erre, yet he will not suffer the whole corps or body of hys chyrch to erre. This maketh playne agaynste Barons, that bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth

               <p>I can not therfore meruayle inough of Barns in bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng forth these gloses for him, that make so clere agaynst hym / and than to se him so boldely say therupon, <hi>These wordes be playne what chyrche it is that can not erre.</hi> As though these gloses had sayd as he sayth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the chyrch which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not erre is onely the vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chyrch of folke pure &amp; clene without any spot or wryncle / of which thynges neyther nother glose speketh one worde. And yet where Barns sayth: These wordes of these gloses be playne: as playne as he maketh them of them selfe / yet hath hym selfe made a playne chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of one worde in the tone of them, to make it seme the more playne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for hym. For where he reherseth the glose by these wordes: The hole chyrch can not erre / this worde erre is not there / but the very wordes be, The whole chyrche can not fayle. Than be not ye wote well those wordes erre &amp; fayle, precy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely &amp; playnely both one, neyther in wrytyng nor in voyce, nor yet in sygnyfycacyon / no more than the two laten wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des <hi>errat</hi> and <hi>deficit.</hi> For a man may fayle &amp; yet not erre. As he that doth auowtry &amp; woteth wel he doth nought / he fayleth and falleth from god, &amp; yet erreth he not in fayth.</p>
               <p>A man maye also erre &amp; yet not fayle nor fall awaye fro god / syth euery errour is not dampnable, As a man myght erre and not fayle nor fall fro god therby nor be dampned therfore / as Iacob dyd in wenyng that Lya had bene Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell / or as hys father Isaac dyd in wenynge that Iacob <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> had ben Esau.</p>

And therfore thys lawe ye se wel was not for hys purpose to brynge in / but in stede of the law he layeth vs forth a pache of the glose.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> The thyrde is that thys partycular chyrch yf she be of god and a trewe member of the vnyuersall chyrch, than she wyll iudge ryghtuousely after Christes worde, and after the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bacyons brought afore her. The fourth is that thys party<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular chyrche doth somtyme whole erre.</p>
               <p>Now as touchynge the fyrste poynt / frere Barons here sayth that Cryst spake there of hym that hath wrong done to hym sylfe, as thoughe Cryste ment of no mo, but wolde onely sende hym that had wronge to complayne to the chyr<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che for his recompense. But me thynketh surely that yf Ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rons take it thus, he taketh it wronge. For I say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> though Cryste doth not so forbyd the man that is wronged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne, that it were alwaye dedely synne for hym to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne: yet he rather counsayleth hym to bere that wrong <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and pacyentely suffer it than to complayne vppon hys bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for it.

               <p>Now good chrysten readers ye shall fyrste vnderstande, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> where as frere Barns maketh as though saynt Austayn had spoken those wordes agaynst the Donatystys, whych vexed (sayth he) saynt Austayne wyth the same reason that is now layd agaynst hym: he maketh vs two lyes at onys. For neyther dyd the Donatystes vexe saynt Austayn with that reason that is layed agaynst hym, nor saynt Austayne made not that sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agaynst them. Fyrst as for them, they vexed saynt Austayn wyth this heresy, that they affermed y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> very chyrche to be onely in Affryque / and none to be of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> very chyrch but yf he were of the secte of the Donatystes. And now ye wote well no man vexeth frere Barons wyth that heresye. For we saye that the chyrch is the whole nom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bre of all chrysten nacyons, not beynge by newe heresyes dyuyded from the olde stocke, in what places of the world so euer those people be, and be they neuer so many cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treys, or be they neuer so few that remayne in the same knowen chyrche, that hath ben by a well knowen successyon preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued and contynued from Chrystes dayes vnto our own, and in the profession of the same fayth whyche is called the catholyke fayth, bycause it is the faith of the same whole ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tholyke chyrche. And therfore thys thynge wyth whyche frere Barons is vexed now is not the same wyth whych the Donatystes dyd vexe saynt Austayne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="cccccxlvi" facs="tcp:4480:284"/>Now yf Barns wyll say, that though it be not the same / <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it is yet lyke the same, bycause we assygne the chyrche to be in these onely cuntreys in whych it now remayneth / what can we other saye than that for the tyme in whyche it stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth no ferther, it is but in these cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treys. But we deny not but yf there be dwellynge amonge Turkes or Sarasyns any chrysten, or men than longe to be chrysten, whych agre with the knowen chyrche of these chrysten contynued na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyons in fayth / all those folke are of thys knowen chyrche also.</p>
               <p>And ouer that whan so euer the same contreys that are vnchrystened nowe, shall here after as I truste onys they shall, bycome chrystened agayne, and be byleuers of the comon catholyke fayth, and so become membres of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon knowen catholyke chyrch / than say we that there shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the chyrche be to. But the Donatystes sayd and wold haue semed to proue it by the very scrypture to, that the chyrche sholde not remayne but in Affryque. And therfore the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natystes vexed not saynte Austayne wyth the same thynge wyth whyche we vexe frere Barns.</p>
               <p>yet yf frere Barns wyll saye that it is lyke, in that that lyke as those heretykes were called Donatystes, so these heretykes call the catholyke chrysten people papystes: yet can it not be lyke for that. For saynt Austayn called the suc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cessoure of saynt Peter the chyefe hed in erth of the hole ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholyke chyrche, as well as any man doth now. And also frere Barns can not alledge that poynt agaynste vs. For hym selfe ye wote well confesseth that the pope is the vicare of Cryste here vppon erth.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               </p>
               <p>Fynally the questyon that is bytwene frere Barns and vs, is not the same that was bytwene the Donatystes and saynt Austayn. For bytwene Barns and vs, the questyon is whyther the very chyrch be a knowen chyrch of chrysten people good and badde bothe, or an vnknowen chyrche of onely good holy vertuouse people, pure and clene wythout eyther spot or wryncle. And in thys poynt were both saynte Austayne and the Donatystys agreed, that the very chyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was a chyrche knowen.</p>
               <p>And thus good reders ye may se that frere Barns sayth vntrewe in thys poynt, where he sayth that saynt Austayn was vexed by the Donatystes, wyth the selfe same reason that hym selfe is now vexed wyth vs. But thys he fayneth,

               <p>But now to proue you that frere Barns maketh vs a ly in that poynt, ye shall vnderstande good reders, that saynt Austayne spake those wordes not agaynst the Donatistes, but agaynste other sectes of heretyques called the Pelagy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anys <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and the Celestyans.</p>
               <p>And to proue you farther, that frere Barns maketh you therin not onely a lye, but also a very folyshe lye / ye shall se hym conuycted in this poynte, by the very wordes of saynt Austayne hym selfe in the selfe same sermon. For in all that whole sermon is there not onely no worde spoken of Dona<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tystes / but that also he declareth hym selfe by playne and open wordes, to speke those wordes agaynst Pelagyans &amp; the Celestyans, as I sayde byfore.

               <p>But now concernynge that law good reders / you shall vnderstande that the wordes of that law be taken out of a sermone of saynte Austayne, whyche he made vnto certayn persons forthwyth vppon theyr baptysme. In whyche ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone amonge many other thynges that he preached vnto them, both in the same and other two sermons that he had made them byfore / he sayth vnto them thus: where as we haue asked eche of you, Byleuest thou in holy chyrche, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myssyon of synnes, and resurreccyon of the flesh: we asked you not after that maner, that you sholde euen in the same maner as you byleue in god, byleue in the catholyque holy chyrche / whyche chyrche is therfore holy and catholyque,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> bycause yt byleueth ryght in god.

               <p>Lo good crysten reders, here haue you herde that in the selfe place where as saynt Austayne sayth that the chyrche is holy and catholyque, bycause yt byleueth ryghte in god, bycause none of all the sectes of heretyques can be holy nor catholyque, that is to saye vnyuersall / syth very holynesse can none be out of the ryght chyrch, nor god shall suffer no secte of heresye to sprede ouer all the worlde so as he sprede <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the vnyuersall chyrche: in the selfe same place I say saynte Austayne declareth, that by these wordes, I byleue in the holy catholyque chyrche, is not ment that we shall byleue therin as we byleue in god / but that that we must byleuing one holy catholyque chyrche, abyde and be conuersaunt in the same one holy catholyque chyrche / and byleuynge in god, contynue in that one holy catholyque chyrche, and not go out therof into any of so many folde dyuerse sectes of he retyques. By whyche ye may playnely perceyue that saynt Austayn ther declareth the holy catholyque chyrche of the ryght bylyefe, to be y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> comen one vnyuersall knowen chyrch dystyncte and dyuyded from all the knowen chyrches of he<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>retyques.

For yf yt were vnknowen, how could yt any thyng instytute or ordayne?</p>
               <p>And fynally to put out of all doute &amp; question, that saynt Austayn obhorreth from frere Barns heresy, that argueth vppon that artycle of the crede, that the chyrche sholde be an vnknowen chyrche / saynte Austayne sayeth playne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly as I shewed you byfore agaynst Tyndale, that lykewise as he were accursed that wolde saye that Cryste was not a man knowen, so accursed be he that sayeth the chyrche of Cryste is not a chyrche knowen.</p>
               <p>Lo thus are we now good cristen reders comen vnto an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ende of frere Barons chyrche, in whych ye playnely se that he can neyther agre wyth Tyndales vnknowen chyrche of repentaunte synners, nor impugne the comen knowen ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholyke chyrch of Cryste, nor proue his own secrete chyrch of onely sayntes vnknowen.
