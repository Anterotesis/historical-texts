            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout a few yeares past, right Honorable, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend and worshipfull, I was requested to giue out the description of the citie of Excester, some one (then liuing) pretending and minding after the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Ministers, to set foorth a generall description of the whole realme of England, and also a Topo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphicall and a particular discourse of euerie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, citie, and towne, in the same. This request ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to so good an end, liked me so well, that albeit I were and am verie vnfit, and of small knowledge, to wade into such a matter: yet when I sawe no man would take it in hand, I was contented to yeeld therevnto. And finding no such thing before doone, my paines were the greater, and I driuen to make the more diligent search and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie, for such old and ancient presidents, records and writings, as might be found and had for my best furtherance herein. In which my trauels, it was my hap among other things, to haue the sight of a certaine table within your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall church, which cheefelie conteined a certeine Catalog of a few Bishops thereof. I did not so much reioise at the sight thereof, at the first, but when I had throughlie perused and considered the same, I was sorie, that no one man, in the course of manie yeares, had continued it. At length, considering with my selfe, that there is such a sympathie and affinitie, betweene this citie and the church, both which are inclosed and inuironed within one wall, and be as it were one bodie, though in certeine priuiledges distinguished; and that in the search for the one, I might the better doo the like in the other, I did resolue my selfe, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe my trauels in both alike, and yet greatlie was I herein discouraged, for being an earnest sutor to some of your owne companie, for some helpe out of your auncient records, I had small furtherance; some being more suspicious than needed; some if I may speake it, vnder your patience, not vnlike <hi>Aesops</hi> dogge, who would neither eate haie himselfe, nor yet suffer the oxe to doo it, by meanes whereof, I was driuen to picke out els where what I could, which I doo persuade my selfe to be so much the more imperfect. Well, what I haue doone for the citie, I haue presented it to the Maior and magistrates of the same; and what I haue doone concerning your church, I doo here most humblie offer vnto you, the effect whereof is; The antiquitie and first foundation of your cathedrall church, when and by whom the same was doone, and then the Catalog of all the Bishops that I can find, which haue beene of this prouince, as well before as si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence the sea was stablished in this church and citie. And for as much as the Bishops were alwaies accompted to be the fathers of Gods people, for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of them in all holines, vertue and religion, I will by way of a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction, set downe the beginning of christian religion, within this realme,
<pb facs="tcp:2248:3"/>
and of the first placing and appointing of Bishops ouer this prouince and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of Deuon and Cornewall. It is recorded in sundrie histories, that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atlie vpon the death of Christ, the Gospell was preached in this land of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Some write, that <hi>Simon Zelotes,</hi> one of the apostles was here and preached; some write that S. <hi>Paule</hi> was here, and did the like; some saie that <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathia,</hi> did come into this land, when king <hi>Aruiragus</hi> reigned, &amp; did both preach and baptize the king and his people; some saie that it was some one of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, but they name him not; but whosoeuer was the preacher, true it is, that Christ was preached, and his Gospell receiued, euen with the first: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the seed was cast among the thornes and high waies, and brought foorth no fruit, but as a candle vnder the bushell, and as fire raked vp in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, it seemed to be hidden and buried, vntill the time of king <hi>Lucius</hi> the sonne of king <hi>Coyleo,</hi> who about the yeare of the Lord 187. was by the goodnes of God called to the knowledge of the Gospell; and he foorthwith expelled all the Archiflamines and Flamines, and constituted in their places, Archbishops and Bishops, which were in number three of the one, and xxviij. of the other; and at this time the prouinces of Deuon and Cornewall were vnder the Archbishop of London, for of anie other particular Bishop, there is no mention made. And notwithstanding, the Gospell had his free passage for the time, yet clouds coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the sunne, and through persecutions, the godlie were put to silence, and the true religion seemed to be extinguished, for almost about foure hundred yeares, vntill the time of king <hi>Vlphus,</hi> then king of West sex, or West Saxonie, who about the yeare of our Lord 636. was conuerted vnto christian religion, by the good and godlie man <hi>Birinus,</hi> and the sea for West sex was appointed to be at Dorche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and then vnder the same were the prouinces of Deuon and Cornewall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twentie yeares, vntill the time of <hi>Kinwalchus,</hi> who builded the church of Winchester, about the yeare 654. and he remooued the sea from Dorchester vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Winchester, and thencefoorth was all Deuon and Cornewall vnder the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Winchester, for and about fiftie yeares, vntill the time of king <hi>Iewe.</hi> In whose time about the yeare of our Lord 705. there was a synod or a prouinciall councell, holden vnder <hi>Brithewaldus</hi> Archbishop of Canturburie, in which it was ordeined, that the Bishoprike of Winchester, should be diuided into two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprikes or diocesses: that is Winchester, and Shereborne, and then vnder the Bishop of Shereborne, and in his Diocesse was Deuon and Cornewall, and so thenceforth did this constitution hold and continue about two hundred yeares, vntill the time of king <hi>Edward</hi> the elder, the sonne of king <hi>Alphred,</hi> who making a progresse through out his kingdome of Westsex, came to this citie of Excester, and found both it, and the whole countrie cleane destituted of Bishop or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and so had beene for sundrie yeares, wherevpon by the aduise of <hi>Pleymun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> Archbishop of Canturburie, a synod or a prouinciall councell was kept in Westsex: and therein it was ordeined and concluded, that in euerie particular prouince or shiere, within Westsex, there should be a particular Bishop: and then one Bishop was appointed for Deuonshire, and an other for Cornewall. <hi>Werstanus</hi> was consecrated Bishop of Deuon, and his sea was then at Tawton, now named Bishops Tawton, and from thence shortlie after remooued to Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and after manie yeares, from thence to Excester. <hi>Herstanus</hi> was consecrated Bishop of Cornewall, and his sea was first at S. <hi>Petrokes</hi> in Bodmin, and after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued vnto S. <hi>Germines,</hi> and at length was vnited vnto Crediton, and in the end both were remooued vnto Excester. And for as much as I haue not yet found anie thing of the Bishops of Cornewall, worthie memorie, I will deale
<pb facs="tcp:2248:3"/>
and set downe onelie the Catalog of the Bishops of Deuon and of Excester, and what I find doone by them or in their time worthie the obseruation. I know that for want of knowledge in me, there be manie imperfections herein. But among so manie wise godlie and learned men, as you are, I hope that some one good man or other, and hauing accesse vnto your euidences and records, will either reforme what they find amisse, or impart it vnto me, that I may so doo it, when time and opportunitie shall serue therevnto. And thus much concerning the first receiuing of the true and christian religion, and appointing of Bishops in this prouince of Deuon. And for as much as this pamphlet doone and written a fewe yeares past, came vpon some occasion to my hands, to be reuiued at this present time; being the end of the yeare past, and the beginning of the new now come, in which it hath beene an old vsage and custome among good freends, and especiallie of the yoonger to their elders, and of the inferiour to their supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, to offer some small present, ech one to the other, congratulating thereby the good successe of the yeare past, and wishing the like to come, and considering also, that you which doo labour in the word and in doctrine, doo dailie beget vs through the Gospell in Christ Iesus, and are his ministers to our saluation, and therefore the more worthie of double honour; and for as much as I my selfe am (his name be praised) by these meanes made partaker of his heauenlie bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, and dailie confirmed, doo thinke my selfe most bounden to be thankefull and gratefull vnto you all herein. Wherefore these my trauels, so much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne your church, I thought it good, by waie of a strene, to offer and present vnto you, praieng you, that though it be somewhat imperfect, yet such as it is you will accept and take in good part, not respecting the slendernes of the thing offered, but the good will and beneuolence of the offerer. And herewith also I am to praie you to call to your remembrance, that as the old yeare is past, and the new is come; so that euerie one doo cast awaie the old man, which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousnes and holines, and that you be renewed in knowledge after the image of God, which created vs, and to cast awaie the workes of darkenes, and put on the armor of light, walking honestlie as in the daie time, not biting nor deuouring one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, least we be consumed one with another: but walke in loue, and peace, long suffering, gentlenes, goodnes, faith, meekenes, and temperance, which are the fruits of the spirit, crucifieng the flesh and the affections and lusts thereof; and thus hauing purged awaie the old leauen, and being freed from sinne, and made the seruants of God, and prepared to good works through Christ, you maie haue your fruits in holines, and in the end to enter into the ioie of our Lord, and life euerlasting. And thus commending you vnto the eternall and euerliuing God in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, I doo most dutifullie take my leaue. Exon the last of the old yeare, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the new. 1583.</p>

            <p>After <hi>Leophricus</hi> death, his successors following his example did euerie of them, for the most part, procure the augmentation &amp; increase of their church, some in liueliehoods, some in liberties, and priuiledges, and some in buildings, and some in one thing or other.</p>

This Bishop was in great familiaritie and acquaintance with <hi>Baldwin</hi> of Excester his countriman, now Archbishop of Canturburie, who was a poore mans sonne in this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; but for his learning aduanced to this estate.

Likewise he got the patronage of Clist Fomeson, now called <hi>Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and annexed the same to his new Lordship, which as it was said was in this order.

<pb facs="tcp:2248:10"/>
which died in his said house of Clist, and should haue béene buried at the parish church of Faringdon, bicause the said house was and is in that parish: but bicause the parish church was somewhat farre of, the waies foule, and the weather rainie, or for some other causes; the Bishop willed and commanded the corps to be carried to the parish church of Sowton, then called Clist Fomeson, which is verie néere, and bordereth vpon the Bishops Lordship: the two parishes there being diuided by a little lake called Clist. At this time one <hi>Fomeson</hi> a Gentleman, was Lord and patron of Clist Fomeson, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aduertised of such a buriall towards in his parish, and a léech waie to be made ouer his land, without his leaue or consent requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red therein; calleth his tenants togither, and goeth to the bridge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the lake, betwéene the Bishops land and his, and there méeteth the Bishops men, bringing the said corps, and forbiddeth them to come ouer the water. But the Bishops men nothing regarding the same, doo presse forthwards to come ouer the water: and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doo withstand and fall at strife about the matter, so long, that in the end my Lords Frier is fallen into the water. The Bishop taketh this matter in such gréefe, that a holie Frier, a religious man, and his owne chaplaine and confessor, should so vnreuerentlie be cast into the water, that he falleth out with the Gentleman, and vpon what occasion I know not, he sueth him in the lawe, and so vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and tormenteth him, that in the end he was faine to yéeld him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the Bishops deuotion, and séeketh all waies he could to cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the Bishops good will, which he could not obteine, vntill for his redemption, he had giuen and surrendred vp his patronage of Sowton, with a péece of land, all which the said Bishop annexeth to his new Lordship.

The Franciscans or Graie Friers of this citie, imputed his death to his hard dealing with them: for whereas he had promised the king to prouide a conuenient place for them to build their house in, and had willed their warden, named <hi>Deoditus,</hi> to séeke out and make inquirie for the same: yet notwithstanding, when he had so doone, bicause the same was in his fée, he did swarue from his said promise, and did vtterlie denie to performe the same, by the persuasion of one <hi>Peter Kenefeld,</hi> a Dominican or a blacke Frier, and confessor vnto the said Bishop: for he enuieng the good successe of the Franciscanes, persuadeth with the Bishop, that in no wise he should permit them to enioie the place which they had gotten, nor to build therein, bicause it was within his fée; for saith he, as vnder colour of simplicitie, they créepe in to the hearts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and hinder vs poore preachers from our gaines and liuings: so be ye sure, that if the canons put foote within your liberties, they will

The Bishop being soone persuaded and contented contrarie to his promise to yéeld therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, denieth the Franciscans; and vtterlie forbiddeth them to build or to do anie thing within his fée or libertie. About two yeares after, the Bishop kept a great feast, vpon the sundaie next before Saint <hi>Francis</hi> daie, and among others was present with him one <hi>Walter Winborne,</hi> one of the kings chéefe iustices of the bench, and who was present when the Bishop at the request of the king, made promise to further and to helpe the Franciscans, and who in their behalfe, did now put the Bishop in mind thereof, and requested him to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration both of his owne promise, and of their distresse.

This Bishop as he grew and increased in wealth, so he was carefull in the well disposing of part thereof; for the increase of learning he builded &amp; erected two houses in Oxford, the one named Stabledons inne, but sithens Excester colledge, the other Harthall, he was also a speciall benefactor vnto the hospitall of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> in Excester; vnto the which, for the reléeuing of certeine poore children therein, he impropriated the rectorie or personage of Ernescome. In the controuersie betwéene his maister King <hi>Edward</hi> the second, and <hi>Charles</hi> the French king, he was sent Embassadour, to the French king and ioined in commission with the Quéene, for the treatie of a peace and reconciliation: which though it were obteined, yet he ioining with the Spensers, who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured not the Quéene, he returned into England; leauing the Quéene behind him. And whereas they practised what they could, to put enmitie betwéene the King and hir; and to set hir besides the cushion, they themselues fell into the same snares, which they had lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for others. For not long after the Quéene, by the helpe of the Earle of Henaulde, and of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> his brother, came into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with a great armie, whereof the King and the Spensers, being afraid, departed from London to Bristowe, leauing this Bishop at London, and made him custos of the same, who requiring the keies of the gates of the citie, of the Maior, the commoners tooke him and beheaded him, as also his brother Sir <hi>Richard Stapledon,</hi> in cheape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, and carried his bodie to his house without templebarre, and there buried it in a sand-hill; namelie, the xv. of October, anno 1329. But the Quéene forgetting all discourtesies, and reuerencing his calling, commanded his corps to some more honourable buriall, wherevpon the same was taken vp, and brought to this citie, and with great solemnitie, was buried in his owne church, vpon the 28.

He was from his childhood verie well affected to learning, and became a good scholar and a professor of Diuinitie, of which method he wrote two bookes, the one intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Pontificales maiores,</hi> &amp; the other <hi>Pontificales minores.</hi> He was also verie graue, wise, and politike, and thereby grewe into such cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the xxij. that he was not onelie of his priuie counsell, but also <hi>Nuntius apostolicae sedis.</hi> And in all matters of weight, and importance, an embassador for him, to the emperor, to the kings of Hispaine, of France, of England, and all other, the mightiest princes of Christendome, and being on a time sent on in an embassage to K. <hi>Edward</hi> the third, he did with such wisedome and grauitie behaue himselfe, that the king was rauished in loue with him; and did so tenderlie loue and fauour him, that he neuer ceassed vntill he had procured him from the Pope, and then he gaue him the Archdeaconrie of Notingham, and bestowed great liuings vpon him. He made him one of his priuie counsell, and in the end
<pb facs="tcp:2248:13"/>
preferred him to this Bishoprike. After this, there being some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking betwéene Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the sixt, and the king, he for his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued wisedome was sent in an ambassadge to the Pope, anno. 1343. for an intreatie of a peace, and an amitie betwéene them to be had; and with such wisdome he did his message, that he obteined his purpose, and made a reconciliation. After his returne home to his Bishoprike, he was altogether giuen in dooing some good things, he builded and founded the colledge of S. <hi>Marie Otrey,</hi> and endo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the same with great and goodlie liueliehoods. He was a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall benefactor to the Vicars Chorall of his owne church, as also to the colledge of Glasney in Perrin; he builded the two last arches in the West end of his church, vaulted the roofe of all the church, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie performed and ended the buildings of the same, and then inri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched his said church, with plate, ornaments, and great riches, he also builded a verie faire house in his sanctuarie at Bishops Taington, which he gaue and least full furnished vnto his successors, and did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate vnto the same the personage of <hi>Radwaie,</hi> to the end as he setteth downe in his testament, <hi>Vt haberent locum vndè caput suum reclinarent, si fortè in manum regis eorum temporalia caperentur:</hi> and which his halsening in the end came partlie to effect. For not onelie the most part of the temporalities of this Bishoprike, but this new builded house and impropriation are come to be the possessions and inheritances of temporall men. This Bishop waxed old, and féeling in himselfe a decaie of nature, made his last will and testament, wherein he made such large and bounteous legacies to the Pope, Emperour, King, Quéene, Archbishop, Bishops, colledges, churches, and to sundrie persons of high estates and callings, that a man would maruell, considering his great and chargeable buildings and works otherwise, how and by what meanes he could haue attei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to such a masse of wealth and riches; but his wisdome and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie considered, it was easie. For first he sequestrateth from himselfe and out of his house the troope of manie men and horses, reteining and kéeping no more than to serue his reasonable estate, his diet was frugall, his receipts great, his expenses no more than necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Moreouer he had taken and set an order with all the ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all persons of his Diocesse, that at the time of their deaths, they shuld leaue &amp; bequeath all their goods to him or to some other in trust, <hi>In pios vsus,</hi> and towards his chargeable buildings; &amp; so well he was beloued, &amp; his dooings liked, that they all accepted this his order: by meanes whereof he grew within the course of xl. yeares to infinite

wealth and riches. He was in all his life time a plaine man, and void of all vaine glorie and pompe, and preuenting that none should be vsed at his buriall, commanded the same to be doone plainelie and simplie. And that none of his executors, Chaplaines, seruants, nor none of his house should weare anie moorning blacke cloths at the same, but onelie their accustomable and common apparrell, which then was commonlie graie coloured clothes. This Bishop was no more graue and wise, than stout and of courage, if occasion so did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. And among other things, this is reported of him; that about the yeare of our Lord 1331. <hi>Simon Mepham,</hi> then Archbishop of Canturburie, sent his mandatum vnto this Bishop, that he would visit his church and diocesse vpon mondaie next after Ascension daie then following. This Bishop (vpon what occasion it is not written) did refuse this mandatum, and appealed from the same, aduertising the Archbishop that he should not visit his church nor diocesse. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, the Archbishop at the time appointed, came to this citie and went to S. <hi>Peters</hi> church, nothing thinking that anie durst to withstand him. But the Bishop knowing of his comming, goeth to the church doore and méeteth the Archbishop, and forbiddeth him to enter into his church; and the Archbishop pressing forward, as with force to enter, the Bishop being then well guarded, denieth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth him: wherevpon the Archbishop departed, and after at a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall councell holden at London, the Archbishop complained hereof, but by meanes of the like discord betwéene him and his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraganes, he preuailed not. In this Bishops time one <hi>William</hi> of Excester, a verie well learned man, was a Canon of this church, and he ioining himselfe with <hi>Nicholas de Cesena, Okeham, Walsing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and others, did openlie preach, that Christ and his apostles were but poore men, and had no temporall possessions: neither was anie Emperor or laie man subiect to the Pope, but onelie in matters of religion. But when he heard that Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the xxiij. had excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and would condemne them all for heretikes; this <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> to saue his liuings, secretlie shronke away from his old compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and changed his copie, and writeth certeine conclusions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and his owne preachings.

He was a professor of diuinitie, and very well learned; for in the second yéere of his Bishoprike being the ix. yeare of the kings reigne, there was a parliment holden at West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster, in which great complaints were made against the loose and dissolute life of the religious men, and especiall the blacke moonks.

<pb facs="tcp:2248:15"/>
how the nobilitie of England was bent to haue him to be their King, came from thence to Paris, and sought vnto Charles then king of France for aid and helpe: in which the Earle his sutes, this <hi>Fox</hi> was a speciall traueller and counseller; and in the end, God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the successe, the Earle obteined the crowne, and hauing had the triall of the fidelitie, wisedome, and trust of this Bishop, he made him Lord priuie seale; and kept and vsed him, and his aduise in all his weightie matters, as well at home as abroad. He being Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador sundrie times, to the K. of France and Scotland, and of a verie hartie good will and loue, the King made him godfather to his second sonne K. <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight. There was a kind of emulation, betwéene this Bishop and the Earle of Surreie: both of them being verie wise and of great seruice to the King and common-wealth. Howbeit, in some diuersitie of respects, the one hauing no issue, to care for, did deale without anie priuate affection, or singular gaine; and the other hauing issue, was desirous to aduance his house and honor. These affections did bréed some dislike betwéene them two, yet the king finding a faith vnto himselfe and a commoditie to the common-wealth; misliked it not, if the same excéeded his measure: and they more warme than commendable for their calling &amp; estates. The king then or the councell would deale betwéene them for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peasing and pacifieng of them, and to them he was both fréendlie, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and liberall. The one he deliuered out of the tower, pardoned him of his offenses, restored him to his lands, receiued him into spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall fauour, made him of his priuie councell, as also Lord Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of England, and his generall into Scotland, and augmented his liuelihoods.

And for the dealings with the clergie, the matter was by commission committed to this Bishop. Who when they came before him, vsed all the excuses that they could, to shift them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from lending of anie money: some came verie séemelie and well apparrelled, and awaited vpon by their men, according to their liuelihoods, and these alledged, that they were greatlie charged in hospitalitie, and house kéeping, with other charges incident to the same, so that they had no money, and therfore could paie none. Some came poorelie and barelie apparrelled, and they alledged that their
<pb facs="tcp:2248:16"/>
liueliehoods were but small, and yet their charges great, and by that means the world was so hard with them, that they had it not to spare. This bishop hauing heard all these excuses, vsed this dilemme: to the ritcher sort he said, For as much as you are so well and séemlie appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled, and doo kéepe so great houses, and haue all things necessarie about you, it is a manifest argument, that you haue some store about you, or els you would not doo as ye doo: and therefore ye must néeds lend. To the others who pretend excuse of their pouertie, he thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied vnto them; that For as much as they were so bare in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, and so sparing of their expenses. It must néeds be that they saued their pursses and had money, and therefore they must néeds paie, and so adiudgeth them to lend vnto the prince. As he rose by learning, so he was a great fauorer and furtherer of learning, and for the good increase of the same, he builded and founded <hi>Corporis christi</hi> colledge in Oxenford.

He was a man hauing more zeale than knowledge, and more deuotion than learning; somewhat roughe in spéeches, but fréendlie in dooings. He was carefull in the sauing and defending of his liberties, for which, continuall sutes was betwéene him, and the Abbat of Tauestoke, he was liberall to the vicars chorall of his church; and reduced them to the kéeping of commons, and towards the maintenance thereof, he gaue them certeine reuenewes, and impropriated vnto them the rectorie of Cornwood; he albeit (of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe) he were not learned, yet a great fauourer and a furtherer of learning, and of learned men. Notwithstanding, he was somtime crossed, in his honest attempt therein. He first was minded to haue inlarged Excester colledge, in Oxford; as well in buildings, as in fellowships. But after being a requester to the fellowes for one <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> to be a fellowe; in whose fauour he had written his letters, and was denied, he changed his mind, and his good will was alienated. About the same time, Doctor <hi>Smith</hi> Bishop of Lincolne, was buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the colledge, named Brasen nose, and was verie willing and desirous to ioine with him: but being denied to haue the nominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a founder, his mind was changed. Not long after being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised, that Bishop <hi>Fox</hi> of Winchester, was minded to erect and found a new colledge, ioined with him, and contributed vnto him a great masse of monie, and so a colledge was builded for scholers, and great liueliehoods prouided for them: and then the house was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Corporis christi</hi> colledge. Whereof the one of them bare the name of a founder, and the other of a benefactor. Howbeit some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie was betwéene these two Bishops, at the first, to what vse this colledge should be imploied: for the founder was of the minde that he would haue made it for a house of moonks, but the benefactor was of the contrarie mind, and would haue it for scholers; alledging that moonks were but a sort of bussing flées, and whose state could not long indure; whereas scholers brought vp in learning, would be profitable members to the common wealth, and good ornaments to
<pb facs="tcp:2248:17"/>
the church of God, and continue for euer. The founder being a wise man, and of a déepe iudgement, when he had well pawsed and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered hereof, yéeldeth herevnto: and so it was concluded betwéene them, to make and build a colledge for scholers. And foorthwith for the good direction, guiding, and gouernment of the said colledge, and scholers; such wise, good, and politike statutes and ordinances were by good aduise and counsell deuised, stablished, and ordeined; as wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the said colledge hath béene, and yet continueth one of the best nurseries for training and instructing of good scholers in learning within that vniuersitie. This bishop and the abbat of Tauestoke did still contend and continue in lawe, during their liues: and during which sute, this bishop died, being excommunicated at Roome, and who could not be suffered to be buried, vntill an absolution from Rome was procured for him, after that he had béene Bishop about xvj. yéeres he died the xxv of Iune, 1519. and was buried in his owne church.</p>

He was borne in the North countrie, and from his childhood giuen to learning, wherein he profited verie much: he was one of the first which professed the Gospell in this land; in the time of king <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight, he translated the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble out of the Hebrue into English, and wrote sundrie bookes vpon the scriptures, which doctrine being verie new and strange in those daies, and he verie straightlie pursued by the Bishops, made his escape, and passed ouer into lowe Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, where he printed the Bibles of his translation, and sent them ouer into England, and thereof made his gaine, whereby he liued: but the Bishops, namelie Doctor <hi>Stokesley,</hi> Bishop of London, when he heard hereof, and minding to preuent that no such bibles should be dispersed within this realme, made inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where they were to be sold, and bought them all vp, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that by this means no more Bibles would be had, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his expectation, it fell out otherwise; for the same mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie which the Bishop gaue for these bookes, was sent ouer by the merchant vnto this <hi>Couerdale,</hi> and by that meanes he was of that wealth and abilitie, that he imprinted as manie more, and sent them ouer into England; but he was then so narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie sought for, that he was driuen to remooue himselfe out of Flanders into Germanie, and dwelled vnder the Palsgraue

At length when the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was altered in England, and the Gospell had a frée pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, he returned and did verie much good in preaching of the same. And when the commotion in Deuon was for religion, he was appointed to attend the Lord Russell, when he came to suppresse the same, and verie shortlie for his learning and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie life was made Bishop of this sea: who most worthilie did performe the office committed vnto him, he preached continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie vpon euerie holie daie, and did read most commonlie twise in the wéeke, in some one church or other within this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. He was after the rate of his liuings, a great kéeper of hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalitie, verie sober in diet, godlie in life, fréendlie to the godly, liberall to the poore, and curteous to all men; void of pride, full of humilitie, abhorring couetousnes, and an enimie to all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, and wicked men: whose companies he shunned, and and whom he would in no wise shrowd, or haue in his house and companie. His wife a most sober, chast, and godlie matrone; his house and houshold, another church, in which was exercised all godlinesse and vertue. No one person being in his house, which did not from time to time, giue an account of his faith and religion, and also did liue accordinglie: and as he had a care for the good successe in religion, so had he also for the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the gouernment in ecclesiasticall causes: and bicause he he was not skilfull therein, neither would be hindered from his godlie studies, and be incombred with such worldlie matters, which neuerthelesse he would haue be doone in all vprightnes, iustice, and equitie, he sent to Oxford for a learned man, to be his Chancellor, and by the ministerie of the writer hereof, he procured and obteined one Maister <hi>Robert weston,</hi> Doctor of the ciuill lawe, and afterwards Lord Chancellor of Ireland, vnto whom he committed his consistorie, and the whole charge of his ecclesiasticall iurisdiction; allowing vnto him, not onelie all the fées therevnto apperteining, but also lodged and found him, his wife, familie, horse, and man, within his owne house,

and gaue him a yéerelie pension of xl. pound. And surelie the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop was no more godlie and carefull of his part, concerning preaching, but this man also was as diligent and seuere in doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his office, without reproch of being affectionated or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. And notwithstanding this good man, now a blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Bishop, and liued most godlie and vertuous, yet the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, whose old bottels would receiue no new wine, could not brooke nor digest him, for no other cause, but bicause he was a preacher of the Gospell, an enimie to papistrie, and a married man. Manie deuises were accompted against him, for his confusion; sometimes by false suggestions, sometimes bp open railings, and false libelles; sometimes by secret back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitings; and in the end practised his death by impoisoning, but by the prouidence of God, the snares were broken and he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
