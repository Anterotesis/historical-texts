            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I was loath to neglect an oportunity which I thought might help to the curing the mentioned humour in the Author, and I knew would gratifie his Friends and others. Being therefore assured by this Gentleman that he would procure me the Authors <hi>pardon</hi> for my printing <hi>this</hi> without his leave, I have adventured to do so; and I hope, when he hath perused it, I shall easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtain the <hi>Readers.</hi>

               </gap>, a Divine Good, is the assertion of <hi>Plato,</hi> and confession of <hi>Cyrus: All the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the Earth hath the Lord of Heaven given me,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxxvi. Yea, and <hi>Tiberius</hi> acknowledgeth, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Thou</hi> hast given this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to <hi>Constantius</hi> thy <hi>servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These, I think, are testimonies enough to prove that <hi>Kings</hi> wear Gods <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi> And therefore <hi>Menander</hi> calls the <hi>King,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, God's living Image; and the <hi>Pythagorean,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, The <hi>King</hi> is the <hi>Figure</hi> of God among Men. But besides all this, there is evidence enough in the nature of the thing to prove, that <hi>Kings</hi> have their <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> and are no <hi>Substitutes</hi> of the <hi>People</hi>: which I thus inferr.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God</hi> made the World, and consequently the World is <hi>his,</hi> and <hi>his</hi> alone is the <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Govern</hi> it. But <hi>he</hi> being of such immense perfections, that our Frailty cannot bear his immediate converses: 'tis necessary that <hi>he</hi> rule us by men like our selves, and put the Sword into the hands of Creatures of our own make. This he doth, and hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53426:6"/>
that they that <hi>Rule</hi> are <hi>Gods Substitutes,</hi> and no <hi>Creatures</hi> of the <hi>People</hi>: For the People have no power to <hi>Govern</hi> themselves, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cannot devolve any upon another.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole then I conclude, that the same Commands and Authority that oblige us to obey <hi>God,</hi> bind us to revere those that so signally wear his <hi>Image</hi>: and he that disobeys the <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts the <hi>Soveraign. He that resists, resists the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God,</hi> saith the <hi>Apostle,</hi> and <hi>who can lift up himself against the Lords Anointed and be guiltless?</hi> saith <hi>David</hi> in the case of <hi>Saul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have dispatched the <hi>first,</hi> viz. <hi>Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance affronts</hi> the <hi>authority</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> with which Kings are invested; as I think I have made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from <hi>testimony,</hi> and the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Then RESISTANCE is <hi>opposite</hi> to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of RELIGION. Religion is of a calm and <hi>pacifick</hi> temper, like that of its <hi>Author,</hi> whose <hi>voice was not heard in the street.</hi> It subdues our <hi>passions,</hi> and governs our <hi>appetites</hi>; it destroyes our <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>sordid selfishness</hi>; it allays the <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests,</hi> and speaks down the <hi>storms</hi> of our natures; it sweetens our <hi>Humours,</hi> and pollisheth the <hi>rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of our tempers; it makes men <hi>gentle</hi> and <hi>peaceable, meek</hi> and <hi>compliant.</hi> This was the Spirit of the great <hi>exemplar</hi> of our Religion; this was
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53426:7"/>
the genius of his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and his <hi>Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He commands the payment of all Duties to <hi>Caesar,</hi> He acknowledgeth <hi>Pilates Power</hi> to be from <hi>above</hi>; He commands his <hi>Disciples</hi> to pray for their <hi>Persecutors</hi>; He permits them to <hi>flie,</hi> not to <hi>oppose.</hi> He rebukes <hi>Peters violence</hi> to the High Priests servant; and the <hi>revenge</hi> of the <hi>Disciples,</hi> when they called for <hi>Fire</hi> from <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He paid <hi>Tribute,</hi> submitted to the Laws of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and to that <hi>unjust sentence</hi> against his <hi>life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was his temper: and the Apostles who lived among <hi>his enemies</hi> and <hi>theirs,</hi> and met with severity enough to have <hi>sowred</hi> their <hi>Spirits,</hi> and <hi>exasperated</hi> their <hi>Pens</hi> to contrary resolutions and instructions. Yet as true Followers of their dear Lord, they faithfully transmit to us what they had learnt from him, <hi>viz. That we should obey those that have the rule over us; submit to every ordinance of man; pray for Kings and all in authority; submit to Principalities and Powers, and to obey Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And those <hi>Noble Spirits</hi> of the first Ages after, who began to be <hi>Martyrs</hi> as soon as to be <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>; who lived in the <hi>Fire,</hi> and went to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven wrapt in those <hi>Flames</hi> that had less <hi>ardor</hi> than their <hi>love. These,</hi> I say, amidst the greatest and fiercest <hi>Fires</hi> that <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Barbarism</hi> had kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53426:7"/>
paid the Tribute of a <hi>peaceable</hi> and <hi>quiet</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to their <hi>Murderers,</hi> and made unforced acknowledgments of the right they had to their obedience. Nor do we ever read of any attempts they made to free themselves by <hi>resistance,</hi> though (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith) they were in powerful num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers mingled in their <hi>Villages,</hi> and in their <hi>Cities</hi>; yea, in their <hi>Castles,</hi> and in their <hi>Armies.</hi> Yea, there is an illustrious instance of <hi>passive obedience</hi> in the <hi>Thebaean Legion,</hi> whose <hi>tenth</hi> man being executed for not offering Sacrifice to <hi>Idols,</hi> they quietly submitted to the cruelty. And a second <hi>Decimation</hi> being commanded by <hi>Maximinian,</hi> the Author of the <hi>first,</hi> one of their great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, an excellent Christian, perswades them to suffer it with the same patience: because it was not with their <hi>Swords</hi> they could make their way to the Kingdom of Heaven, but by another kind of <hi>Warfare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now if after all this, and infinitely more that might be said on the subject, to pretend <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and plead <hi>Scripture</hi> for <hi>Rebellion,</hi> is <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> and <hi>shameful,</hi> an <hi>affront</hi> to Religion, and a <hi>Lie</hi> in the face of Conscience. And those that cannot discern those <hi>great lines</hi> of their <hi>Duty</hi> which are set upon the High places, and shone upon with a full beam; and yet can find <hi>sin</hi> in <hi>little harmless circumstances,</hi> which nothing hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53426:8"/>
but the coyness and perversness of their own humour; are like him that could see the <hi>Starrs</hi> at Noon, but could not see the <hi>Sun</hi>; and could spye the <hi>shadows</hi> made by the <hi>Mountains</hi> in the <hi>Moon,</hi> but could not discern the greater <hi>spots</hi> upon its <hi>visible surface.</hi> And for men to strain at the <hi>decency</hi> of an <hi>Habit,</hi> or the usage of a <hi>Ceremony,</hi> when they can swallow <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> and <hi>Sacriledge</hi> without chewing; is to be like him who durst not <hi>eat</hi> an <hi>Egg</hi> on <hi>Saturday,</hi> but made nothing to <hi>kill</hi> a <hi>Man.</hi> Doubtless had the Scripture said by a thousand part so much for the <hi>Ius Divinum</hi> of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> as it hath for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to <hi>Authority;</hi> had there been one plain word against <hi>Conformity,</hi> as there are many against <hi>Rebellion</hi>; that would have been worn bare up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the tongue, and have filled the World with endless importunities.</p>
            <p>But the Injunctions and Commands of <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> are against our <hi>humours</hi> and <hi>opinions,</hi> against the <hi>darlings</hi> of our <hi>phansies,</hi> and the <hi>interest</hi> of our <hi>Party</hi>: and therefore here we must shuffle and evade, cogg and interpret by <hi>Analogies</hi> of our own making, by the <hi>Rules</hi> of our <hi>Sect,</hi> and the <hi>Authority</hi> we <hi>worship,</hi> by <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> and any thing that will <hi>colour</hi> Sin, and <hi>cozen</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that will turn Religion into the <hi>Current</hi> of our <hi>appetites,</hi> and make <hi>Scripture</hi> speak the <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi> of our <hi>humours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:53426:8"/>Thus <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>divine Authority</hi> shall be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced,</hi> and pleaded when they agree with mens own measures, and send any light or advantage to the <hi>Favourites</hi> of their <hi>affections:</hi> But when they <hi>cross</hi> their <hi>Models,</hi> oppose the <hi>people</hi> of their <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi> and call them upon <hi>duties</hi> that are <hi>displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant</hi>; the <hi>case</hi> is <hi>altered,</hi> the great <hi>motives</hi> of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion have lost their <hi>power</hi> and <hi>influence,</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> can do nothing with them.</p>
            <p>Thus briefly of the two first Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance (1) <hi>affronts the Authority of God,</hi> and (2) is <hi>opposite to the Spirit of Religion.</hi> From which I come to the third, which makes <hi>resistance</hi> both a great <hi>sin,</hi> and a great <hi>punishment, viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3) It is <hi>ruinous</hi> to the INTEREST OF SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIETIES. This I must more largely prosecute, because it will lead us into the <hi>sad</hi> occasion of our present meeting. <hi>Man</hi> is a Creature made for <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi>; and what is against the <hi>interest</hi> of <hi>Societies,</hi> is destructive to <hi>Humane Nature.</hi> And if the greatness of a sin, and a mischief be to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by its reference to the <hi>Publick,</hi> for ought I know, <hi>Rebellion</hi> will be the next <hi>sin</hi> to that which is <hi>unpardonable,</hi> in the degree of <hi>guilt,</hi> as well as it is near it in the <hi>penalty</hi> threatned.</p>
            <p>Now there are two great <hi>interests</hi> 
               <unclear>of</unclear> 
               <hi>Societies, viz.</hi> GOVERNMENT and RELIGION,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53426:9"/>
to both which <hi>Resistance</hi> both in <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>practice,</hi> is <hi>fatal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To begin with <hi>Government</hi> in order.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) Then both doctrine and practice of <hi>resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> is <hi>destructive</hi> to <hi>Government.</hi> For if <hi>Subjects</hi> may <hi>resist</hi> the <hi>Powers</hi> over them, no <hi>Government</hi> in the World can stand longer, then till the next opportunity to overthrow it. Every man will <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist</hi> what he doth not <hi>like,</hi> and endeavour to pluck down what comports not with his humour. Thus every <hi>fit</hi> of <hi>discontent</hi> will stir up the various and inconstant People to seek an <hi>alteration.</hi> And there was never any <hi>Government</hi> so exactly framed in the World, but in the menage, and administration of it, many things would <hi>displease.</hi> Now the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of men are lead by their <hi>present senses</hi>; and if they feel themselves pained by any thing (and it may be too, the Grief is but in their <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>) they are for <hi>present</hi> deliverance from that Evil by <hi>any means</hi>; never considering whether the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Cure</hi> draws not greater Evils after it than the <hi>distemper</hi>: and so upon every <hi>discontent</hi> the people are <hi>inflamed,</hi> and upon every <hi>occasion, rebel.</hi> And thus is a <hi>Kingdom</hi> laid open to inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table devastation and ruine: and by a <hi>dear</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience we have learnt, that 'tis better to endure any <hi>inconveniences</hi> in a <hi>setled</hi> Government, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour <hi>violent alterations.</hi> When the Sword is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53426:9"/>
               <hi>drawn,</hi> no man knows <hi>where,</hi> and <hi>when</hi> it will be <hi>sheathed.</hi> When the <hi>Stone</hi> is out of a mans hand, he cannot direct it as he pleaseth. <hi>Men</hi> with <hi>Swords</hi> by their <hi>sides,</hi> will do what <hi>likes</hi> themselves, and not what is <hi>enjoyned</hi> them by those that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them.</p>
            <p>Or, could we suppose what our own unhappy experience hath confuted, that <hi>Armies</hi> would be <hi>obedient</hi>; yet the <hi>Murders</hi> and <hi>Rapes,</hi> the <hi>Spoils</hi> and <hi>devastations,</hi> which are the <hi>natural issues</hi> of a <hi>Civil War,</hi> are worse than any <hi>inconveniencies</hi> in any <hi>Government</hi> possible. And though, as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> notes, <hi>Foreign War</hi> is like the <hi>heat</hi> of <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,</hi> good and healthful for the Body; yet <hi>Civil</hi> War is like the <hi>heat</hi> of a <hi>Fever,</hi> ruinous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive.</p>
            <p>Besides, those that <hi>resist,</hi> either overcome the <hi>supream</hi> Power, or are <hi>conquered</hi> by it. If the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, their <hi>Instruments</hi> in all likelyhood conquer them, as well as those they served them against: and so from the <hi>just authority</hi> of their <hi>lawful Rulers,</hi> they fall under the insolence of their <hi>licentious Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals.</hi> Or suppose they get the <hi>Government</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, all the evils will follow, which usually do upon <hi>Competitions</hi> and <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>Claims,</hi> which will breed <hi>everlasting disturbance,</hi> and <hi>eternal fears.</hi> Such evils will follow if the <hi>resisters prevail</hi>: and if they chance to be <hi>supprest</hi> and <hi>overcome</hi> by the

Powers they oppose, they can expect nothing less than to be <hi>crusht</hi> and <hi>ruined.</hi> So that those that <hi>resist,</hi> whether they <hi>conquer,</hi> or are <hi>overcome,</hi> draw inevitable ruine upon themselves, and probably on the common Body. For <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> are the great <hi>Charter</hi> of our <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> our <hi>Properties,</hi> and our <hi>All</hi>; and as the Father, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And how far all this hath been verified in our Borders: a little recollection will inform us. For,</p>

had incouraged it self by <hi>Noise</hi> and <hi>Numbers,</hi> by <hi>Popular zeal</hi> and <hi>talk</hi> of <hi>Reformation,</hi> it flew into the highest <hi>irreverencies</hi> towards the <hi>King,</hi> and the most <hi>violent</hi> proceedings against his <hi>Ministers,</hi> that the nearest <hi>Trees</hi> being removed, they might have a full <hi>stroke</hi> at the <hi>Cedar.</hi> Nor did things stop here.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sparks</hi> grew into mighty <hi>Flames,</hi> and those <hi>Vapours</hi> into <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Tempests.</hi> The <hi>whispers</hi> of the <hi>Corner</hi> past into the <hi>noise</hi> of a <hi>Camp</hi>; and the <hi>murmurs</hi> of the <hi>Street</hi> into the <hi>sound</hi> of the <hi>Trumpet.</hi> The <hi>Cloud</hi> like an <hi>hand,</hi> became a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine</hi> of <hi>Storms,</hi> and our <hi>New lights</hi> set us all on <hi>Fire.</hi> The <hi>Pulpit</hi> sounded as much <hi>Warr</hi> as the <hi>Drum</hi>; and the <hi>Preacher</hi> spit as much <hi>flame</hi> as the <hi>Cannon.

            <p>Therefore, after ten thousand <hi>butcheries</hi> and <hi>devastations, miseries</hi> and <hi>disorders,</hi> which cannot be <hi>described,</hi> but they will in part be felt; <hi>prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wickedness</hi> finally prevailed, the friends of <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Iustice</hi> were scattered and destroyed. <hi>Majesty</hi> is made a <hi>prey</hi> to the <hi>sons</hi> of a <hi>Dunghil</hi>; and <hi>afflicted innocence</hi> falls into the hands of the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> And after <hi>He</hi> had been <hi>infamously sold</hi> like a <hi>Slave,</hi> and <hi>imprisoned</hi> like a vile <hi>Malefactor</hi>: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>He</hi> had been <hi>ravisht</hi> from his Friends, <hi>bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemed</hi> in his <hi>name,</hi> and <hi>robbed</hi> of the <hi>ensigns</hi> of his <hi>dignity</hi>: after <hi>He</hi> had heen <hi>tost</hi> up and down from one place to another, according as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs and insolencies of his <hi>cruel Iaylors</hi> should call him: after <hi>He</hi> had been <hi>mocked</hi> by <hi>Conditions</hi>

of <hi>Peace,</hi> and terms of <hi>Accommodation,</hi> that were never meant: after <hi>He</hi> had made <hi>concessions</hi> to all their Demands, and for the sake of the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Settlement</hi> of his <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> had granted things that <hi>Subjects</hi> had never the <hi>insolence</hi> to <hi>ask.</hi> I say after these and a thousand instances of <hi>barbarism</hi> and <hi>indignity</hi> more, that his <hi>cruel Persecutors</hi> might transcend all <hi>examples</hi> of <hi>wickednesse</hi>; that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to come might <hi>honour</hi> them, as they do that HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of PONTIUS PILATE WAS PRESI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENT, and that they might deserve a <hi>deeper damnation</hi> than that threatned by the Apostle to bare <hi>Resisters.</hi> They summon their SOVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAIGN to their <hi>Bar,</hi> and <hi>trie Him</hi> by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Petty-fellows,</hi> that called themselves by a <hi>great Name</hi>: They <hi>buffet</hi> him with their <hi>insolent Taunts,</hi> and <hi>bait</hi> him with the <hi>mercenary noise</hi> of JUSTICE, JUSTICE, like CRUCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIE him, CRUCIFIE him.

            </p>
            <p>Therefore let this <hi>Day</hi> be <hi>darknesse,</hi> let the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering</hi> of the <hi>blackest Grief</hi> be upon it; because this Day fell a <hi>Prince,</hi> one of the <hi>best,</hi> the <hi>wisest,</hi> and most <hi>generous,</hi> and the most <hi>gracious</hi> that ever swayed these <hi>Scepters.</hi> He <hi>fell,</hi> and fell by <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> and the <hi>violent</hi> hands of his <hi>own,</hi> who ought to have sacrificed <hi>their</hi> lives to the preservation of <hi>His.</hi> He fel to the <hi>dishonour</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to the <hi>grief</hi> of good <hi>Men</hi>; to the <hi>scandal</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> to the <hi>shame</hi> of <hi>Protestantism,</hi> to the <hi>overthrow</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>ruine</hi> of the <hi>Nation.</hi> This is a <hi>Lamentation,</hi> and to all Generations it shall be for a LA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTATION.</p>
            <p>But Oh <hi>Heavens!</hi> oh <hi>Providence!</hi> must <hi>Vertue</hi> be <hi>dethroned,</hi> and <hi>Villany</hi> be <hi>crowned!</hi> must <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Successe</hi> wait upon <hi>Treasons</hi> and <hi>Paracides,</hi> while <hi>infamy</hi> and <hi>losse</hi> dogg <hi>Innocence</hi> to the Grave! Must the most <hi>righteous</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> be the most <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable</hi> of <hi>Men</hi>; and <hi>Religion</hi> and a <hi>good Cause</hi> be the onely way to be <hi>unfortunate</hi> and <hi>undone</hi>! Will the <hi>Searcher</hi> of <hi>hearts</hi> abet <hi>hypocrites</hi>; and <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> lend it self for an <hi>argument</hi> to <hi>legitimate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi>! Shall the <hi>Pharisee pray,</hi> and <hi>prosper</hi>; and the <hi>righteous cry,</hi> and be <hi>forsaken</hi>!

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53426:13"/>
shall the <hi>wicked</hi> lift up their <hi>hands</hi> in an <hi>appeal</hi> to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and bring them <hi>down</hi> to the <hi>destruction</hi> of the <hi>Iust!</hi> Shall <hi>Villany</hi> raise its head to the <hi>Clouds,</hi> and meet no <hi>Thunderbolts</hi> there; while the <hi>Devotions</hi> of the <hi>Innocent</hi> return upon him in <hi>storms</hi> and <hi>flames!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> would complain on this occasion. But <hi>Providence</hi> is <hi>just,</hi> though we are <hi>blind. Prosperous Villany</hi> crows and triumphs for a moment, but is covered with <hi>shame,</hi> and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>darkness</hi> in the issue. The <hi>end</hi> of things will disentangle <hi>Providence,</hi> and rectifie all disorders. Then shall we see that <hi>afflicted Vertue</hi> shoots up on the <hi>other side</hi> the <hi>Grave,</hi> and sends its <hi>branches</hi> into a <hi>flowring Paradise,</hi> where they shall be <hi>green</hi> and <hi>verdant</hi> in an eternal <hi>Spring,</hi> while every <hi>Tree</hi> that Vertue hath not <hi>planted</hi> shall be <hi>rooted</hi> up and <hi>wither</hi> in a moment.</p>
            <p>This briefly I thought fit to suggest as an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> for <hi>Providence</hi>; lest the <hi>successes</hi> of the <hi>wicked,</hi> and <hi>misfortunes</hi> of the <hi>Iust,</hi> in instances so <hi>great</hi> and so <hi>near,</hi> might tempt any to think, that there is <hi>no GOD that judgeth in the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I am arrived at the <hi>first period</hi> of the <hi>miseries</hi> that we brought upon our selves by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,</hi> which concludes in the <hi>ruine</hi> and <hi>dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> and this runs into all the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53426:14"/>
to which humane Nature is obnoxious. For <hi>Government</hi> is the great <hi>interest</hi> of <hi>mankind; that</hi> which bounds our <hi>passions,</hi> and secures our <hi>rights</hi>; prevents <hi>confusion,</hi> and that <hi>deluge of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches</hi> that <hi>Anarchy</hi> lets in upon the World. And how far we felt this also in the consequent Calamities, would be considered.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Nation</hi> then had lost its <hi>Head,</hi> and its <hi>Glory,</hi> 'twas turned with its <hi>Heels upwards,</hi> and governed by a <hi>Thing</hi> as <hi>infamous</hi> in its <hi>Quality,</hi> as its <hi>Name.</hi> The <hi>Dreggs</hi> of the <hi>Populace,</hi> the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> of a <hi>Sectarian Army,</hi> the <hi>worst</hi> part of a Body, that was <hi>bad</hi> enough in its <hi>best</hi>; these were our <hi>Senators,</hi> and our <hi>Patriots,</hi> the <hi>preservers</hi> of our <hi>Peace,</hi> and the <hi>Keepers</hi> of our <hi>Liberties</hi>: and keep them they <hi>did,</hi> but not <hi>for</hi> us, but <hi>from</hi> us. And was not this a <hi>Liberty</hi> worth the <hi>Bloud</hi> and <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> that was spent to purchase it.</p>
            <p>O the <hi>blessed Reformation</hi> that filled our <hi>Pulpits,</hi> and <hi>emptied</hi> our <hi>Purses</hi>; that <hi>quickned</hi> our <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,</hi> and <hi>inspired</hi> our <hi>zeal</hi>; and that was so <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> in our <hi>mouths,</hi> and so <hi>pleasant</hi> in our <hi>hopes.</hi> Were not all <hi>miscarriages</hi> of Government well <hi>mended,</hi> when <hi>Government</hi> was thrown up by the <hi>roots,</hi> and was not the <hi>disease</hi> well <hi>cured,</hi> when the <hi>Body</hi> was <hi>destroyed?</hi> Were we not well freed from <hi>evil Counsellours,</hi> when we made <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>worst</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:53426:14"/>
we had. And was not <hi>Tyranny</hi> well <hi>extirpated,</hi> when we were under an <hi>Army</hi> of <hi>Tyrants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>glorious</hi> things are to <hi>come,</hi> and we must be cast into <hi>New Models.</hi> And when the <hi>Birds</hi> of <hi>Prey</hi> have <hi>divided</hi> the <hi>Spoil,</hi> and satisfied the <hi>cravings</hi> of their <hi>appetites</hi> and <hi>ambition,</hi> the <hi>Nation</hi> shall be made <hi>happy</hi> with <hi>New-nothings,</hi> and <hi>golden Mountains</hi>; with <hi>Chimoeraes</hi> of <hi>Common-wealths,</hi> and <hi>fine names</hi> for <hi>Slavery.</hi> In the mean while <hi>Loyalty</hi> must be scourged with the <hi>Scorpions</hi> that are <hi>due</hi> to <hi>Rebellion.</hi> And those that feared the <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> shall be sure to incurr the <hi>damnation</hi> of the <hi>Reformers</hi>; and they that would not hazard their Souls, must compound for their Estates.</p>
            <p>But when the JUNCTO had run to the length of their <hi>Line</hi>; that is, as far as their MASTER would permit them; when <hi>they</hi> were as <hi>odious</hi> as they <hi>deserved,</hi> and <hi>his designs</hi> as <hi>ripe</hi> as he could <hi>wish</hi>; then up steps the single TYRANT, kicks <hi>them</hi> out of their Seats, and <hi>BEELZEBUB</hi> dispossesseth the LEGION. He <hi>engrosseth</hi> the <hi>prey</hi> to himself, and assumes the <hi>sole</hi> priviledge of compleating our miseries. He made himself after the <hi>Image</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi> and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted his <hi>Sword</hi> with the <hi>authority</hi> of <hi>Law.</hi> He ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us with the <hi>Rod</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> we <hi>deserved,</hi> and made us feel a difference between the <hi>silken Reins</hi> of a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53426:15"/>
               <hi>lawful Authority,</hi> and the <hi>heavy yoke</hi> of an <hi>insolent Usurpation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when <hi>Providence</hi> had freed us from this <hi>Plague,</hi> and called him to account for his <hi>Villanies,</hi> we fell back into our old <hi>disorders</hi>; wee <hi>reeled to</hi> and <hi>fro,</hi> and staggered like a <hi>Drunken man,</hi> and were at our <hi>wits end.</hi> We knew not <hi>this</hi> week, who would be our <hi>Lords</hi> the <hi>next</hi>; nor did our <hi>Lords</hi> themselves know to day, by what <hi>Laws</hi> they would Rule to <hi>morrow. Confusion</hi> was in their <hi>Councils,</hi> as well as <hi>Tyranny</hi> in their Actions; and there was but <hi>one thing</hi> they seemed to be <hi>agreed</hi> upon, which was to <hi>inslave</hi> the <hi>Nation.</hi> And if we would not believe that this was <hi>Liberty,</hi> we must be <hi>knockt</hi> in the head with our <hi>chains</hi>; if the <hi>Sheep</hi> would not take the <hi>Wolves</hi> for their <hi>Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> 'twas fault enough, and good reason why they should be <hi>devoured.</hi> And were not things come at length to a pretty pass, when men in <hi>Buff</hi> durst proclaim themselves the onely <hi>Legal Authority</hi> of the Nation, when our Armed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters murdered men in the Streets, and threatned the <hi>antient Metropolis</hi> of the Nation, with <hi>Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>Granadoes. Fire</hi> and <hi>Sword</hi> must be our portion, if we would not be in love with <hi>infamous Usurpers,</hi> and a worse <hi>Powder-plot</hi> than <hi>Faux</hi>'s was acting in the <hi>face</hi> of the <hi>Sun.</hi> The <hi>strength,</hi> the <hi>riches,</hi> the <hi>beauty,</hi> yea, the almost <hi>All</hi> of the Nation
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53426:15"/>
was designed a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to the <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>revenge</hi> of our <hi>Oppressors</hi>; and <hi>Plunder</hi> and <hi>Massacres</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most the <hi>least evils</hi> we <hi>feared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus were we <hi>tost</hi> up and down from one <hi>wave</hi> to another, and made the sport of the <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>insulting billows,</hi> till Almighty Goodness setled us again upon our <hi>old basis,</hi> and by a <hi>Miracle</hi> of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> restored us our PRINCE and our <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> which our sins had deprived us of, to <hi>re-establish</hi> us upon the <hi>sure Foundations</hi> of <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are some <hi>sprinklings</hi> of that <hi>deluge</hi> of <hi>Wo</hi> that we brought upon our selves by <hi>resistance,</hi> which I have briefly described to this purpose, that the remembrance of these miseries, may beget a sense of our <hi>sins,</hi> and the truth of the <hi>particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> I have been discoursing under this Head, <hi>viz. That Resistance is fatal to Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though <hi>Government</hi> may be fixt again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its <hi>Foundations,</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> turned into their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Channel,</hi> after the <hi>violence</hi> they have suffered; yet they lose much of their <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>strength</hi> by such <hi>dissettlements.</hi> And the People that have <hi>rebelled once,</hi> and <hi>successfully,</hi> will be ready to do so <hi>often.</hi> As <hi>water</hi> that hath been <hi>boyled,</hi> will boyl again the sooner.</p>
            <p>And thus we see how ruinous <hi>resistance</hi> is to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53426:16"/>
               <hi>Government,</hi> and how destructive to that <hi>first</hi> great Interest of Societies, as it is also.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) TO RELIGION, which is the other. That <hi>Rebellion</hi> is contrary to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> we have seen; and consequently, that 'tis <hi>destructive</hi> of its <hi>Being,</hi> will not need much proof, since contraries destroy one another. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> layes the <hi>Reins</hi> on mens necks, and takes off the <hi>restraints</hi> of their <hi>appetites;</hi> it opens the <hi>flood-gates</hi> of <hi>Impiety,</hi> and lets loose the <hi>brats</hi> of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Imagination.</hi> It destroys the <hi>reverence</hi> of all things <hi>sacred,</hi> and drives <hi>Vertue</hi> to Corners. It gathers mens <hi>lusts</hi> into a <hi>common storm,</hi> and fills all things with <hi>Chaos</hi> and <hi>confusion. Religion</hi> cannot be <hi>heard</hi> in the <hi>noise</hi> of <hi>battail,</hi> but is trampled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-foot in the <hi>hurry</hi> and the <hi>tumult. Faith</hi> and <hi>love, humility</hi> and <hi>meekness, purity</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast and silenced by <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>cruelty, pride</hi> and <hi>barbarism, lust</hi> and <hi>revenge.</hi> Thus <hi>Rebellion</hi> by breaking up the <hi>foundations</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> lets in an <hi>Hell</hi> upon us, and brings a kind of present <hi>damnation</hi> upon the World. And that this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fatal mischief of <hi>Resistance,</hi> we have felt also by an <hi>experience</hi> that will keep it in our memories. And what execution it hath done upon <hi>Religion</hi> must be considered next.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:53426:16"/>But now this is a <hi>tender thing,</hi> and I am willing to keep my self within bounds that are <hi>charitable</hi> and <hi>sober</hi>; and therefore must <hi>premise</hi> to what I have to say about it; that I charge not the whole <hi>Body</hi> of the People of the late Times, with the guilt of all the <hi>Follies</hi> and corruptions I describe. Nor do I <hi>believe,</hi> or <hi>say,</hi> that the whole <hi>Mass</hi> of their <hi>Religion</hi> was so <hi>monstrously vitiated</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved.</hi> I profess <hi>Universal Charity,</hi> and have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, more for the worst of them, than they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally will own for any that are not of their own <hi>party</hi> or <hi>opinion.</hi> And therefore at present I shall say no more, than what the sober and intelligent among themselves will acknowledge to be justly chargeable upon some or other of the <hi>Sects</hi> bred by our <hi>late Disorders</hi>; and this will be enough for my purpose, which is only to prove by <hi>near</hi> and <hi>deplorable instances,</hi> that <hi>resistance</hi> brings <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs</hi> upon <hi>Religion</hi>; and not to expose to <hi>hatred</hi> or <hi>contempt</hi> the persons of any that are <hi>serious</hi> in the way of their <hi>profession,</hi> though I judge it never so <hi>obnoxious</hi> and <hi>mistaken.</hi> And having said this out of a <hi>tender charity,</hi> that none may be wronged by <hi>misinterpretation,</hi> nor any <hi>offended</hi> that are not <hi>concerned</hi>; I come with freedom to describe some of the <hi>injuries</hi> our <hi>unhappy resistance</hi> hath done <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> notwithstanding that both <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Tongues</hi> so highly pretended its defence.</p>

            <p>And when these had <hi>kindled</hi> the <hi>imagination,</hi> and sent the <hi>phansie</hi> into the <hi>Clouds</hi> to flutter there in <hi>mystical non-sense</hi>: and when it was mounted on the <hi>Wings</hi> of the <hi>Wind,</hi> and got into the <hi>Revelations</hi> to <hi>loosen</hi> the <hi>seals, pour</hi> out the <hi>vials,</hi> and <hi>phantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> to interpret the <hi>fates</hi> of <hi>Kingdoms</hi>; when it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53426:18"/>
flew into the <hi>Tongue</hi> in an <hi>extravagant ramble,</hi> and abused the Name and Word of God, mingling it with <hi>canting, unintelligible</hi> babble. I say, when the diseased and disturbed <hi>phansie</hi> thus <hi>variously dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played</hi> it self, many made themselves believe that they were <hi>acted</hi> by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and that those <hi>wild agitations</hi> of <hi>sick Imagination,</hi> were <hi>divine motions.</hi> And when this <hi>fire</hi> was <hi>descended</hi> from the <hi>phansie</hi> to the <hi>affections,</hi> and <hi>these</hi> being <hi>exceedingly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> by those <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>proud conceits,</hi> caused <hi>trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings</hi> and <hi>fomings, convulsions</hi> and <hi>extasies</hi> in the body, (all which are but <hi>natural diseases,</hi> if not worse; and just like those <hi>odd exstatical motions of the Devils Priests</hi> when they come <hi>foming</hi> from his <hi>Altars</hi>) these, I say, the <hi>wild phantasticks</hi> had learnt to ascribe to the <hi>blessed</hi> and <hi>adorable Spirit</hi> And when their <hi>phansies</hi> being full of <hi>turgid noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and their bodies in an <hi>extasie,</hi> they <hi>dream'd</hi> of <hi>strange sights, voices,</hi> and wonderful <hi>discoveries,</hi> which were nothing but the <hi>unquiet agitations</hi> of their own <hi>disordered</hi> brains. These also were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for <hi>divine Revelations,</hi> and the <hi>effects</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, shewing it self <hi>miraculously</hi> in them.</p>
            <p>Briefly then, and in sum; Every <hi>humour</hi> and <hi>phantastick unaccountable motion,</hi> was by some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented as the work of that Spirit, to which they are most opposite. Thus when <hi>warm</hi> and <hi>brisk
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53426:18"/>
sanguine</hi> presented a <hi>cheerful Scene,</hi> and filled the <hi>imagination</hi> with <hi>pleasant</hi> Dreams; <hi>these</hi> were <hi>divine</hi> Illapses, the Joys and Incomes of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> When <hi>heated Melancholy</hi> had kindled the <hi>busie</hi> and <hi>active phansie,</hi> the <hi>Enthusiast</hi> talks of <hi>Illuminations, New Lights, Revelations,</hi> and many <hi>wonderful fine things,</hi> which were ascribed to the same <hi>Spirit.</hi> And when <hi>Phlegm</hi> prevailed, and had quencht the <hi>phantastick Fire,</hi> rendring the <hi>Mad man</hi> more <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>unactive</hi>; then the <hi>Spirit</hi> was <hi>withdrawn,</hi> and the man under <hi>spiritual darknesse</hi> and <hi>desertion.</hi> And when again <hi>Choler</hi> was <hi>boyled</hi> up into <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>fury</hi> against every thing that was not of the <hi>fond Cut</hi> and <hi>Measure</hi>; this also was presumed to be an <hi>Holy Fervour</hi> kindled by that <hi>Spirit,</hi> whose <hi>real Fruits</hi> are <hi>gentleness</hi> and <hi>love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, after that which I have said on this occasion, it may perhaps be necessary to add, that I hope none here will be so <hi>uncharitable,</hi> or so <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,</hi> as to think that I go about to disparage the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and its <hi>influence</hi>; which, as I ought, I <hi>adore</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi>: and because I do <hi>so,</hi> I think it fit to represent, and shame the <hi>blasphemous abuses</hi> of <hi>it,</hi> which would expose the most Divine things to <hi>scorn,</hi> and make them <hi>ridiculous.</hi> And that the Holy Spirit hath been thus <hi>traduced</hi> and injured, and is still by great numbers among us, 'twould be shameful not to acknowledge. And I add,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53426:19"/>
that my <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> for the <hi>realities,</hi> make me thus <hi>sharp</hi> and <hi>severe</hi> to the <hi>Counterfeits.</hi> Nor do I think that <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>phantastry</hi> is to be spared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they wear the <hi>stollen Livery</hi> of things <hi>vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> and <hi>sacred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore to go on, this was a kind of <hi>Religion</hi> that the <hi>corruption</hi> of <hi>it</hi> bred among us. A <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> conceived in the <hi>Imagination</hi> and begot by <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Self-Love,</hi> which gilded the <hi>Professors</hi> of it with all the <hi>glorious names</hi> and <hi>priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> And when they had encircled their Heads with their own phantastick rayes, and swoln their <hi>Imaginations</hi> into a <hi>Tympany</hi> of <hi>ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> greatness, they <hi>scornfully</hi> contemned all but their <hi>Darling</hi>-selves, under the notion of the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,</hi> the <hi>Moral,</hi> and the <hi>Wicked</hi>: and <hi>proudly</hi> pitied the <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>carnal</hi> World, that is, all that were not of <hi>their conceited</hi> pitch and elevation. And having thus <hi>dignified</hi> themselves, and <hi>debased</hi> others: they herded together, drew the <hi>Church</hi> into their <hi>little Corners,</hi> and withdrew from the <hi>communion</hi> of others, who had less <hi>conceit,</hi> though more <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</hi> They bid us <hi>stand off,</hi> lest we should have <hi>polluted</hi> them by our <hi>unhallowed</hi> approaches; and having made us as the <hi>Heathen</hi> and the <hi>Publican,</hi> they cried, <hi>Come out from among them.</hi> The <hi>true Church, soundness</hi> of <hi>Iudgment, purity</hi> of <hi>Doctrine</hi> and of <hi>Worship</hi> (if men would believe them) was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53426:19"/>
confined to their <hi>gang,</hi> just as they were to the Corners of <hi>Africa</hi> of old, when their Friends the <hi>Donatists</hi> were <hi>there.</hi> Thus did they <hi>swell</hi> and <hi>swagger</hi> in their <hi>Imaginations,</hi> till some other <hi>Sect,</hi> as well <hi>conceited</hi> as themselves, endeavoured to take their <hi>Plumes</hi> from them, and to appropriate those glorious <hi>prerogatives</hi> to their own party. And then they bussled and contended, <hi>Here, the Church,</hi> cried one; nay, but <hi>'tis here,</hi> cried another; till a third gave the <hi>Lye</hi> to them both: and then the Scuffle grows warm of <hi>Pride</hi> against <hi>Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi>; the <hi>Self-conceit</hi> of one Sect, against the <hi>Pride</hi> of another, and all against <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This among some was the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Godliness,</hi> this the <hi>spirituality</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> under pretence of which, all <hi>reverence</hi> to things <hi>sacred</hi> was <hi>destroyed.</hi> For when this <hi>Spirit</hi> had got into the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and set up the Cry of the <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Spirituality</hi> of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> it never left <hi>canting</hi> on the Subject, till mens Tongues and Minds were fired against every matter of <hi>decency</hi> and <hi>order,</hi> as <hi>formal</hi> and <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</hi> And so far had it prevailed, as to drive those of <hi>warm</hi> affections and <hi>weak</hi> heads, from all due <hi>external Reverence</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Holy</hi> things. And these well meaning people being frighted with the <hi>terrible</hi> noise of <hi>Popery, Superstition,</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianism,</hi> (things they had learnt to <hi>hate,</hi> but not to <hi>understand</hi>) boggled and flew off from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53426:20"/>
thing their <hi>furious</hi> Guides had marked with these <hi>abhorred Characters,</hi> though it were never so <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>becoming.</hi> And thus a <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi> Religion had made its way into the World, and such a <hi>sordid</hi> carelessness in matters of <hi>divine</hi> Worship, that should a Stranger have come into the <hi>Assemblies</hi> that were acted by this Spirit, he would not have imagined what they had been doing: and that they were about <hi>Holy Offices,</hi> would perhaps have been one of the last things in his Conjecture. Thus <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>sawcy</hi> talk had crept into mens Prayers, under pretence of <hi>Holy Familiarity</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> nauseous impertinent Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berish, under the notion of <hi>Praying</hi> by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and all kind of <hi>irreverences</hi> in <hi>external</hi> demeanor, under the shelter of a pretended <hi>spiritual</hi> Worship.</p>
            <p>Thus had men <hi>subtilized</hi> Religion, till they had destroyed <hi>it,</hi> made it first <hi>invisible,</hi> and then <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now to gather up all, <hi>Religion</hi> being thus <hi>multiplyed, corrupted</hi> and <hi>debaucht,</hi> being made the <hi>Game</hi> of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> and the <hi>Frolick</hi> of <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; phantastick</hi> in its <hi>principles, sordid</hi> in its <hi>practices, separated</hi> from the <hi>foundation</hi> of a <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous life,</hi> and made to serve the <hi>ends</hi> of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Avarice</hi>; what was like to follow, according to the <hi>nature</hi> and order of things, but <hi>Atheism</hi> and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53426:20"/>
               <hi>contempt</hi> of all Religion? And when one sayes, <hi>here's Religion,</hi> and another sayes, <hi>there's Religion</hi>; a third will contemningly ask, <hi>where's Religion,</hi> and <hi>what's Religion?</hi> When the <hi>Heathen Deities</hi> were so multiplied, that <hi>every</hi> thing was made a <hi>God; Protagoras, Diagoras,</hi> and others, first began to <hi>question,</hi> and next to <hi>affirm</hi> that there was NONE. <hi>Religions</hi> have been multiplied in <hi>our dayes,</hi> as much as <hi>Gods</hi> in <hi>theirs</hi>; and we have seen much of the same fatal event and issue. <hi>They</hi> made their <hi>Gods contemptible</hi> and <hi>vile,</hi> by deifying things that were <hi>so,</hi> and we had no less detracted from the credit of Religion, by bringing it down to things of the lowest and vilest rank and nature. Our <hi>Idolized Opinions</hi> were no better than their <hi>Garlick</hi> and <hi>Onyons.</hi> The <hi>diseases</hi> of the <hi>Mind, Phrensie</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> which our dayes have <hi>worshipped,</hi> were no better than <hi>those</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> which <hi>they adored.</hi> And <hi>they</hi> never raised Altars to worse <hi>Vices</hi> than REBELLION, FRAUD, and VIOLENCE, which our Age hath <hi>hallowed</hi> and made <hi>sacred.</hi> So that notwithstanding all the <hi>glorious</hi> pretensions of those Times, Religion was, among many, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off all its <hi>Foundations,</hi> and the World prepared for <hi>Atheism.</hi> The <hi>Follies</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi> of <hi>one Age,</hi> make way for <hi>Atheism</hi> in the <hi>next.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus also briefly of the Condition of our RELIGION.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:53426:21"/>AND thus I have shewn how much RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SISTANCE of the <hi>Authority</hi> that is over us, is against our DUTY and our INTEREST. The <hi>former</hi> God hath plainly told us; and the <hi>lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> we have sadly <hi>felt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains that we humble our selves under the <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>publick guilt,</hi> as well as <hi>complain</hi> of the <hi>consequent miseries.</hi> That we may not draw down <hi>new judgments,</hi> by repeating <hi>old provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>; and adding our <hi>particular sins</hi> to the <hi>common score.</hi> And I think we shall do well to consider, what <hi>we,</hi> who abhorre <hi>Rebellion,</hi> have contributed to the fatal evils that followed it. We can perhaps be well enough content that the <hi>visible actors</hi> of of those mischiefs should be <hi>lasht,</hi> and <hi>exposed</hi>; and it may be, are well pleased and tickled with our reprehensions in which we think our selves not concerned. But if we will be <hi>just,</hi> if we will have this <hi>Fast</hi> to signifie, we must turn our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs upon our selves also, and with grief and shame acknowledge that our sins and Debauches, our contempt of <hi>God</hi> and scorn of <hi>Religion,</hi> have helpt towards the plucking down that sad judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Nation, which we lament this Day. And it must be confest, that there were those that fought <hi>against</hi> the KING, who yet spent their <hi>bloud</hi> in his <hi>service</hi>: and many by their <hi>vices,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:53426:21"/>
endeavoured to engage Heaven against that <hi>Cause,</hi> which themselves strove in another way, to less purpose to promote. And therefore we ought not to think; that this <hi>Fast</hi> is appointed to <hi>inveigh</hi> against the <hi>faults</hi> of others, and to make <hi>them</hi> and their <hi>actions odious</hi>; but to humble our selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the apprehension of our own, and to teach us to shew our love to the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>readiness</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> him, by <hi>subjecting</hi> our selves first unto <hi>God,</hi> whose <hi>Vice-gerent</hi> HE is. And we may be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that they that are not <hi>Loyal</hi> to the UNIVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAL LORD of all the World, can scarce possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be so to their <hi>particular</hi> SOVEREIGN. And 'twill need a great deal of Charity to help us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that those that make no scruple to <hi>blaspheme</hi> the <hi>Name</hi> of God, and to break the plainest, most earnest, and most express of his <hi>Laws,</hi> will be with-held by considerations of <hi>Duty</hi> or <hi>Conscience</hi> from <hi>rebelling</hi> against their <hi>King,</hi> or affronting HIS, when there is any powerful interest to oblige them to it. If therefore we would give any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a serious <hi>humiliation</hi> at present, or any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of a future <hi>loyalty,</hi> let us do so by confessing our particular sins, and forsaking them; and then there will be hope that the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>God</hi> may oblige us quietly and peaceably to submit to his MINISTER; and in doing so we shall be blest with his <hi>influence,</hi> and deserve his <hi>protection.</hi> And
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53426:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thus demeaning our selves like <hi>Professors</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> the <hi>Peace</hi> He left with his Disciples will be with us here, and <hi>everlasting Peace</hi> will encircle our heads with <hi>rays</hi> of glory in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Peace.</hi> And so the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> which passeth all understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, keep your hearts and minds in <hi>Christ Iesus</hi>: To whom with <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost,</hi> be ascribed all Glory, Honour, and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration henceforth and for ever. <hi>Amen</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>
