            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Doubt not (right hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) but the mynde of man is free, and hath the rule and power of him ſelfe throughe the vertue of hys libertye, and that the wiſe man by his reaſon, and reaſonable ſapience, hath domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ouer the ſtarres and their impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, namely ouer all naturall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and celeſtiall deſtnies, withoute any forced neceſſitie to do this or that, which commeth by the grace and gyfte of God, the gouernour of the vniuerſal worlde. Euen ſo Stilpo (by reaſon ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng him) auoyded whoredome, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were naturallye enclyned therevnto. Yet not withſtanding it is
<pb facs="tcp:19522:3"/>
moſt certayne, that men haue ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and complexions by nature which ſome men know either by Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>logie, or by coniecture of their nature, called Phiſyognomie, and thei that con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iecture are called in Greeke <hi>Phyſiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mones</hi> which tell by coniectures, notes, ſignes and tokens, the inclinations of mens affections. The Philoſophers in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed haue inuented and found out phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomy to the great commoditie of men, for to knowe to what vertue or what vice yong children were enclined to the end thei might amend their vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and faultie nature with good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, &amp; not to geue the brydle to their affections, but to moue them to ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, ſtudyes, and other qualities, whereunto nature moſte calleth them and maketh them moſte enclined. So Apelles and Zeuſis folowed and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned naturally the arte of painting. So Polyeletus and Praxiteles folowed the art of making pictures &amp; images. So Demoſthenes &amp; Cicero choſe the
<pb facs="tcp:19522:3"/>
art of Oratorie and eloquence, in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng matters in the law: So Homere and Virgil folowed poetrie: So Socra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes, Plato, and Ariſtotle handled Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie. And nowe all is altered and chaunged and almoſt cleane ouertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and goeth (as I might ſaye) ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwartly lyke the Crabbe. For he that ſhould be naturally a plowman, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the ſtudy of pleading, and to bee an Oratour or Philoſopher, or elles of ſome higher learning, ſnoring on his bookes, turning and returning himſelf this way and that way, as though he ſat vpon coales or hoate embers. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, they that are well borne, and called by the benefite of nature to all honeſty often times are conſtrained to ſeruyle doyngs. The knowledge then of Phiſiognomy is requiſite &amp; profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to men, ſo that men abuſe it not, as ſome fond people do (commonly called Egiptians) which are as it were raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Harpies, hunting after the gaine of money, which haue brought to paſſe
<pb facs="tcp:19522:4"/>
by their lyes, that this parte of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie is now in no eſtimation, which is to be lamented, ſeyng that euen Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters know by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iectures, notes, ſignes, draughtes, lineamentes, &amp; ſight of the body, the nature and propertie of dogs: And by the lyke meanes Horſecorſers do knowe the nature of Horſes, as the Poete Vergill deſcribeth in the thirde booke of his Georgykes ſaying.</p>
            <p>The good Colt by and by marcheth high vpon the grounde, &amp; orderly extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelf, or elles ſetteth down often tymes his ſoft thighes the one after the other: And firſt he dare goe in durtye wayes, or into great riuers, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vpon a bridge whiche he knoweth not: neither feareth he any vaine noyſe or cry. The good horſe hath a high neck, a lytle head, a ſhort belly, fat behinde, &amp; faire before, hauinge a full mane. The red is faire, faire alſo is the ſpeckled, faire is the browne baye: and euyll is a whyte colour in a horſe. And worſe is the colour betwene whyte and red.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19522:4"/>A good horſe can not ſtande ſtill at the ſounde of a trumpet that he heareth a far of. The eare we ſee waggeth vp &amp; down, euery member moueth, foming at the mouth, he breatheth out and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth in vnder his noſtrels fier &amp; hote breath. A thicke mane hangyng on the ſyde alonge downe all his necke: and a double chyne ending broade vpon hys back. He treadeth deepe in the ground, and in treadinge he aſtonieth it. His hard hoofe of horne ſowneth, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther qualities belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gyng to a good horſe.</p>
            <p>But nowe a dayes no man careth to coniecture, or to know by coniectures, or to referre mans naturall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſuch a profit. And though there were no other profite riſynge by it but onely to make a troubled mynde mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (whereunto we oftentimes ſee mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick applied which is one of the ſciences commonly called liberall:) this art of phiſiognomy ought not be contemned.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He maner to fynde oute the deſtnie and conſtella<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion is this. Fyrſt, if you wyll knowe the conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of any man, take his natural name which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monlye called his proper name and the proper name of his mother, in ſuche ſort as neither of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid two names in any wiſe be chaunged or depraued from the vulgare or proper callynge (as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tymes it chaunceth by the common apellation of mens names) but that thei be perfect and not diminiſhed. And for two cauſes the name of the mother is
<pb facs="tcp:19522:6"/>
taken and not of the father. Fyrſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the mothers ſyde is more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent then the fathers. Secondlye, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the father be the originall of the conception and generation of the childe yet the chylde touchyng the bodye hath more of the mothers matter and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce then of the fathers. Yea and as oftentymes it happeneth, ſome parte of the fathers ſeede doeth not entre nor ſerue touchynge the materiall compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For man is verely a thyng actiue, and by no meanes paſſiue, and touching him ſelfe can haue no action. Whereby it conſequently appeareth that the child concernyng the bodye hath more of the mothers ſubſtaunce then of the fathers. Wherevnto a thyrde cauſe maye be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that for as muche as the chylde is nouriſhed of the mothers ſubſtance and not of the fathers, that then the conſtella<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion enforſyng hys effect &amp; ſigne in the chyldes body, doeth rather conuert the ſame with the mother &amp; the bodye of the mother, then with the father and the
<pb facs="tcp:19522:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
body of the father. And therefore truely and determinatlye to know and learne the chyldes fate and conſtellation, hys proper name muſte be taken togethers with the natural and proper name of the mother. Then diligently conſider euery letter of the ſaid two names, and amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the ſame gather y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> numeral letters, ſuche as ſignifie a number, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the auncient accompt are ſeuen as .I. ſignifieth one .V. fyue .X. tenne .L. fiftie .C. a hundreth .D. fiue hundreth, M. ſignifieth a thouſand.</p>
            <p>Taking all and ſingular letters of the ſayde two names, as well the number as ſuch as ſignifie a number. Then ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the whole ſumme, which ſumme ſo collected, diuide if it be poſſible by .xxix. becauſe of the .xxix. conſtellations of the ſtarres, or becauſe of the particuler ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes celeſtiall whiche after the auncient maner is the firſte diuiſion of the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And hereby it appeareth that the principall partes of the particular ſtarres and ſignes celeſtial in number
<pb facs="tcp:19522:7"/>
are .xxix. as here after ſhall appeare. So that the number ſignified by the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall letters of the two proper names aforeſayd ought to be deuided by reaſon of the ſayde ſignes. And ſometymes the ſayde number doth amount iuſte to the ſumme of .xxix. and ſometyme it exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the ſame, wherein is to be noted that either the number doth excede or elles is equall.</p>
            <p>If it excede, then the number ought to be applied and diuided by theyr vnities to the ſayde ſignes addynge to euery of the ſignes their vnities begynnynge at the firſt ſigne which is the head of Aries and ſo of the reſte ſucceſſiuelye. And where ſo euer the laſt vnitie ſhall faile or ſhall be placed, there and in that ſygne and in the parte of that ſigne, the Infant (whoſe conſtellation you ſeeke to knowe) vndoutedlye is borne, and thereby you ſhal geue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and truely pronounce that in that ſigne the fate and conſtellation of the Infant conſiſteth. Not withſtandyng
<pb facs="tcp:19522:7"/>

And becauſe that the ſigne where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in certaynely the Infant is borne doeth not alone beare rule in the tyme of the byrthe, but all and ſinguler effectuallye doe concurre accordynge to the more or leſſe in euery nauitie. So that eftſones it chanceth that ſome ſigne diſtinct from that ſigne appropriat to the moneth doth more effectuallye rule and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentlye expreſſe his effectes. Therefore to the intent you maye perfectly beholde the fate and conſtellation of the partie that is borne, you muſt not onely looke vpon the ſigne allotted and appropriate to that moneth wherein determinatlye any is borne: but chiefely you muſt haue reſpecte to that ſigne whiche ſpeciallye hath dominion aboue others in the tyme of the byrthe, not withſtandynge that ſigne appropriate to the moneth hath the principall effect.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:19522:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>And whether one ſigne is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent or effectuall then another you may moſte certainlye and truely knowe by thys arte.</p>
            <p>Let vs retourne then vnto our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer propoſition, and ſaye that either the ſumme of the number ſignified by the numeral letters of the names aforeſayd doth not amounte to .xxix. or elles that it doth principally atteyne to that ſumme, or is equall, or elles excedeth the ſame. But nowe after the agrement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde of the number, take alſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation and aſſemble of the ſignes ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall, whiche are touchyng theyr par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler partes .xxix. as is aforeſayde, or xxx. as ſhalbe ſayde hereafter, begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng at the firſt particuler ſigne, which is the head of the ſigne Aries. And wher ſo euer the laſte vnitie of this number ſhall reſte or remaine, that is the ſpeciall ſigne and is of moſt force in the tyme of the nauitie. But if this number dothe not ſurpaſſe the number of .xxix. but therevnto is equall, then the laſte ſigne
<pb facs="tcp:19522:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whiche is the tayle of Piſces is the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſigne at the natiuitie. Semblablye yf this number doeth excede the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of .xxix. then this number is to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided ſo manye tymes by .xxix. tyll the number of .xxix. be founde out. And then for euerye vnitie one ſigne muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted yeldyng to euery ſigne his vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and then the laſte vnitie, whiche is xxix. is attributed to .xxix. and to the laſt ſigne whiche is the tayle of Piſces, as was ſayde a lytle before, and that ſigne chiefely hath dominion in the natiuitie of the infants. But if that number laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remainynge be within the number of xxix. then euerye vnitie of this number ought to be diſtributed to euerye parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer ſigne beginninge firſt at the head of Aries, and whereſoeuer the laſte vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre doth remaine the ſame is the principall ſigne, and chiefely hath gouernement at the byrth of the infant.</p>
            <p>Here alſo oughte diligently to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the celeſtiall ſignes maye be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken two wayes, that is to ſaye totally or
<pb facs="tcp:19522:9"/>
touchyng the whole effectes of the ſame and are in number but twelue. That is to wete: Aries (and is the firſt ſigne, at whiche you muſt begynne, and then fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe ſucceſſiuely tyll you come to the ſigne of Piſces whiche is the twelfeth) Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagitarius, Capricor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Aquarius, Piſces. Nowe eche of theſe ſignes in his whole effecte doeth eſpeciallye beare rule in that moneth whiche is appropriate to the ſame. And euery ſigne intierly hath dominion ouer euery moneth ſuche as therevnto is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted. As for example: Aries hath do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in Marche which is the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth accordynge to the computation of Aſtronomers. Lykewyſe Taurus in Aprill, and ſo the reſt conſequently ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedyng. And although the foreſayde ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſingulerlye and appropriatlye haue their monethes ſpeciallye aſſigned as is aforeſayde. Yet all theſe twelue ſignes in euery moneth at all tymes, euerye day and houre, euery moment &amp; minute
<pb facs="tcp:19522:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of an houre, do concurre in the nauitie of euery byrthe, although not equallye yet accordyng to the moore or leſſe. And that ſigne whiche chiefely hath domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the natiuitie, the ſame is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation of the Infant. Moreouer the ſigne wherein the Infant is borne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not that ſigne which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriat to the moneth but ſome other, yet it is eaſie to be knowen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſigne perticularly appoynted to the ſayde mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.

               <p>Who accordinge to the maner and ſtate of her body, ſhall haue a broad breſt and ſmall thighes which are tokens of bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ſtoutnes of ſtomack. She ſhalbe verye menſtruous and fertile inough, not withſtandinge ſhe ſhall haue but few Children, with certein other condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her bodye before declared in the iij. perticuler ſignes. After the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her mynde ſhe ſhalbe naturallye ſubtile wittie, &amp; deſirous of learnyng. She ſhalbe chaſte, ſhamefaſt, courtilike diligent and of good ſtomack, by reaſon whereof ſhe ſhalbe, very prone &amp; ſubden to angre &amp; yet ſhalbe ſoone again appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And not withſtanding her angre, yet in her owne houſholde very liberall, by whoſe meanes the houſe ſhalbe plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of meate &amp; drink. And becauſe of her natural ſubtiltie, ſhe ſhalbe very bolde,
<pb facs="tcp:19522:49"/>
for as muche as what ſoeuer ſhe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth or ſéeth if it ſeeme to compriſe anye ſubtiltie or difficulty of matter, imidiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe wil deſire to know it. She is libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral becauſe ſhe can not keepe cloſe ſuche things as ſhe hath. She is very lowly &amp; humble, &amp; if ſhe chaunce to be ſpotted w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any ſinne, imediatly ſhe will fall downe proſtrat vpon the ground, &amp; humbly aſke mercy &amp; forgeuenes of her Creator. Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerning her lyfe and maner thereof, ſhe ſhall ſuffer the lunatike paſſion &amp; a nota<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble payne of her hart &amp; ſtomack, which if ſhe eſkape, ſhe ſhal liue till ſhe be .lxxxv. yeres of age. She ſhall alſo be pained in her toes. She ſhall haue ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement vpon her enemies. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her euyll fortune ſhe ſhall haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fortunes. For firſt ſhe ſhal haue a fal from an high place, and her body hurt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> iron or fier. When ſhe is .xxiij. yeres old ſhe ſhalbe married, and by her huſband atteyn to promotion. Her huſband ſhall not lyue long, but ſhall die by meane of poyſon or witchecrafte. And at length
<pb facs="tcp:19522:49"/>
ſhall marry another who ſhall loue her derely. Of her neighbour ſhe ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue damage in her treaſure. When ſhe is .xij. yeres old vnleſſe ſhe take good hede ſhall be deceyued by oppreſſion vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her bodye, and ſhall leſe her maiden-head. She ſhalbe troubled in the water and in daunger of lyfe. Thurſday is her contrary day, and therefore let her do no notable thyng vpon that day, waſhe her head or put on any apparell. And here is alſo to be noted, that the beſt remedy to auoyde all her miſfortunes, is firſt to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe her ſelfe, by prayer to our Lorde GOD onelye, with all her heart. And to carye aboute her precious Stones ſuche as be orient and gliſterynge. And then eaſly ſhe ſhal ouercome al her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduentures by gods helpe.</p>
               <p>The .vj.

Such as be borne in the ſeruice of great men, the ſame this ſigne preſenteth to their ſeruice. He ſhalbe fortunat to gold braſſe, horſes, and to ſuche marchandiſe as be of colour red. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mid of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to the mid of Aprill, &amp; from the mid of Iuly to the mid of Auguſt, he ſhall proſper otherwiſe not.

Lykewyſe touchyng hys lyfe, he that is borne in this ſigne, and ſpecially yf he be borne in the .v. houre of the day, he ſhall naturally haue .iij. ſickenneſſes whereof the firſte ſhalbe when he is .xij. yeres old.

by reaſon he ſhalbe muche payned in the bellye, or by ſome other meanes ſhall be extremely vexed. He ſhall haue a ſtrype vppon hys Head, or hys Face, or vppon bothe, but notably in his priuye partes, where he ſhalbe greatly pained. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſhall haue many chyldren, yet fewe ſhal remaine on lyue, and in that poynt ſhalbe very infortunate.

That is to ſaye: Sonday, Tweſday, and Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. His infortunat day is Friday. And that day euer is ſomewhat infortunate. His good fortune is toward the South. And therefore let hym diſpoſe his affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res that waye, together with the doore and bedde. The ſame is naturally of the Melancolyke complexion, and is of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cold and drye.

               <p>The .vj. Chapter compriſeth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fortune of Virgo. Where is to bée noted that the borne in this ſigne haue their fortune in tillage, and in al things

generally thervnto apperteining, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in all things that be ſowen.

He that is borne in this ſigne, as is aforeſaide is melancholike, colde, and drie.

He ſhal die either by the ſtripe of a ſword or elles of the payne of the belly. He ſhal fall into a ryuer, but ſhall ryſe agayne, and ſhalbe in daunger of fier. And in the ende of his life ſhall ſuſteyn pouertie.</p>
               <p>The .iij.

He ſhall haue a naturall marke vppon one of his armes. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge the diſpoſition of the mynde. He ſhalbe a great fornicator, merye, holde, fortunate eſpecially vpon the water. He ſhall excogitate and ſerche out many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes, &amp; ſhalbe verye perylous. He ſhall be very deſirous to wander in the world to viewe the faſhions therein, and the ſundrie vanities and condicions thereof, and for that cauſe ſhall traiuell into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny countreys. He ſhalbe freatynge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by fittes, and by fittes alſo ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be quiet.

<pb facs="tcp:19522:59"/>
but towardes hys owne ſeruauntes, if thei be euill, he will vſe ſharpe and croked wordes. He ſhalbe ſuſpected of a great crime, but it ſhalbe ſo cloſe as it can not be proued. He ſhall ſuffer great paine in hys necke, ioyntes, and bellye, and ſhall haue .iij. eſpeciall ſickenneſſes. The firſte ſhalbe when he is .xv. yeres of age. The .ij. when he is xxxviij. And the .iij. when he is .lxxxx. at what tyme he ſhall dye. Concernynge his good fortune, in his youth he ſhall be neyther poore nor ryche, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes he ſhall accumulate vnto hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe great ſubſtaunce. He ſhall occupye and haue to do with other mens money. He ſhall triumph ouer his enemies.</p>
               <p>Touchyng his euyll fortune he ſhall be wounded with yron, a clubbe, or wyth a ſtone, emonges the reſt of his miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. He ſhalbe in daunger of a ſword, and therfore let hym beware thererf. He ſhall continue in the place where he was borne, not withſtandyng for a time he ſhall trauell into farre countreys,
<pb facs="tcp:19522:60"/>
whiche fortune maye be to him indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, he ſhal forgoe his firſt wife, whiche alſo is a fortune indifferent. Thurſday is his contrarye day, and therefore vpon that daye, let him not waſhe his head, and put on no new apparel nor beginne any notable enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>The .iiij.

Touchinge the diſpoſition of her mynde ſhe ſhalbe frendlye, amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, wittie, and a louer of her owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie. Concernynge her lyfe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thereof, ſhe ſhall ſuffer a naturall payne in her ſtomacke. She ſhall haue two diſeaſes. The firſte ſhalbe daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and when ſhe is two yeres olde. And the ſeconde when ſhe is .lxxviij. ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of age. After her good fortune ſhe ſhall haue in occupyinge a great maſſe of money. In her ſeconde huſbande ſhe ſhall greatly reioyce, and ſhall triumph
<pb facs="tcp:19522:60"/>
ouer her enemyes. Accordynge to her euyll fortune, ſhe ſhall haue a ſtrype or wounde in ſome place of her bodye. Shee ſhall haue twoo huſbandes, and by the deathe of her firſt huſbande ſhe ſhall bee vnfortunate.</p>
               <p>Thurſdaye is her vnluckye daye. And therefore let her not waſhe her head vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that daye, or begynne anye thynge notable.</p>
               <p>The fifte Chapter deſcribeth the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon and vniuerſall fortune of Libra.</p>
               <p>Where note that Libra hath hys for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in beaſtes equitable or apte to be ridden, eſpeciallye if thei be of colour white.

<pb facs="tcp:19522:61"/>
The good and fortunat dayes, are Mon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>day and Fryday. The infortunate daye is Wedneſday. The borne in this ſigne ſhall be troubled with infirmities &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the belly, as with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſſenterie, lienterie, grypynges, and other paynes procedyng of wynde, and chiefely about the backe bone.

If anye be borne in this ſigne in the tyme of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then his complexion ſhalbe effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. If he be borne in the Sommer then touchinge the diſpoſition of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy he ſhalbe beautifull, but yet groſſe and fatte vnder his apparell. Alſo if any woman be borne in this ſigne, ſhe ſhall be of an indifferent ſtature and beautie, her face faier, of ſmothe here and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her colde complexion ſhe ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre to weare much clothyng. She ſhall haue a blemiſhe in her eyes, and ſhalbe marked vppon her arme, fingers, and knee. If he be a man, he ſhalbe of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine complexion, and miſchiefuous in geuynge a blowe. He ſhalbe naturally enclined (not, withſtandynge it ſeeme merueylous) to contradictories, that is to ſaye, to iuſtice and vnrighteouſnes, to loſſe and gaine, to truth and falſhold,
<pb facs="tcp:19522:65"/>
and all by reaſon of the concurrence of the oppoſites and contrarye ſignes, and yet not withſtanding the ſigne that is of greateſt force, ſhall beare the chiefe rule touchyng the premiſſes. Touchinge iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, he ſhall be naturally geuen to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtye, he ſhall be iuſte and of muche e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and in all his affayres greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to iuſtice.

But yet the ſigne of moſte force as is aforeſayde doeth principallye beare rule in this natiuitie. And to ſaye anye thynge touchynge his lyfe, and maner thereof, touchynge his future inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we can not. For as muche as the

               <p>He ſhall haue thrée wyues, whereof the firſte ſhall bée a wydowe. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde and thyrde ſhall bée virgins, but the thyrde ſhall bury hym. And here is méete to bée knowen that by reaſon of the generalitie of this ſigne, and of the concourſe of the ſignes, thys natiue ſhoulde bee coupled to foure wyues, but yet the chiefeſt ſhall preuayle. He ſhall bée of power and libertie to doe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhe hys owne deſiers. Happye ſhal he be to the femine kynde, that is to ſaye, to thinges of that kynde, as cattaill and ſuch lyke. He ſhall bée twiſe bitten with a dogge or other beaſt vppon the ſhulder and on his noſe ornoſtrels ſhall haue a marke. He ſhalbe in daunger or thrall of men of power or authoritie. Hys laſte Wyfe ſhall burye hym by reaſon of the marke vppon his arme,

or the bytte of the Dogge as hys con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation doeth therevnto chyefelye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyne.</p>
               <p>The fourth Chapter deſcribeth the iudgement of Scorpio, touchynge the male. Where note that the Chylde borne in thys Sygne (touchynge hys bodye) vppon hys feete and handes ſhall haue a naturall marke. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge hys mynde, he ſhall bee bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and liberall, ſo that he ſhall not keepe ſecreate hys ſubſtaunce.</p>
               <p>In the ſeruyce of others, he wyll bee mearrye, truſtye, bolde and pleaſaunt. In his conditions ſtronge, ſtable, and not wauerynge, not deſiſtynge or lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng of from hys affayres beynge once begonne. Touchynge his lyfe, he ſhall haue three principall diſeaſes the tymes whereof bee not here noted, whyche yf he chaunce to eſkape he ſhal lyue .C.x. yeres and .x. monethes. And accordynge to the vertue of this ſigne ther ſhalbe no impediment in the conſtellation, except it happen by ſome perticuler cauſe.</p>

And yet his diligence ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken doeth include a certeyne doubte or duplicitie, by reaſon of the force and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catie of the worde.

He ſhall haue greate abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of money, and the ſame daylye ſhall encreaſe and multiplye. By mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a woman he ſhall be greatlye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, and ouer hys enemyes he ſhall haue the victorie. In forreyne places he ſhall exerciſe tillage, and at length ſhall retourne home into hys owne countrey wyth gayne. Of his betters by waye of rewarde, he ſhall receyue

And ſome affirme that he that is borne aboute the ende of thys Sygne, ſhall be of neyther kynde, or of bothe, that is to ſaye, as well male as female.</p>
               <p>The fifte ſigne declareth the effecte of Scorpio concernyng the woman.</p>
               <p>Who hath her recourſe to the partes of thys ſigne before mencioned in eche Chapter. Notwithſtandyng ouer and beſids the premiſes, thus much is to bée ſpoken. For fyrſte, you ſhall note that ſhe ſhall bée of a frendlye condicion, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſeruiceable, fearefull, and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſte. She ſhall bée wrathfull and haue him in deadly hatred that doth her anye diſpleaſure. She ſhall haue Chyldren
<pb facs="tcp:19522:68"/>
by three huſbandes, and wyth them ſhall lyue in greate felicitie. She ſhall vanquyſhe her enemies, but yet tylle ſhe bee thyrtye yeares of age ſhe ſhall ſuſteyne muche ſickenneſſe. Neuertheleſſe, of Cattayle ſhe ſhall haue haboundaunce, and manye people ſhall bee vnder her gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But yet in her youth ſhe ſhall ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe her bodye in playinge the Harlot, yf the force of the iminent conſtellation do take his effecten, bitte ſhe ſhall bee with a Dogge, and in the ende ſhalbe blinde. Of her brethren and parentes ſhe ſhall receyue much trouble. Saterday ſhalbe to her infortunat day, therfore vpon that daye let her not waſhe her head, put on any newe garmentes, or doe any other ſtraunge facte.</p>
               <p>The ſyxte Chapter entreateth of the generall fortune of Scorpio. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the borne in thys Sygne is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turallye moyſte, Phlegmatycke or

               <p>And ouer and beſydes the ſayde fyue Chapters, there is a generall rule nexte after the ſecond Chapter, not wythſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng the generalitie mencioned in the ende of this treatiſe.</p>
               <p>The firſte Chapter entreateth of the head of Sagitarius called Albaham, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the .xxij. particuler ſigne,<note place="margin">the 22. perti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>culer ſigne</note> &amp; hath viij. ſtarsfaſhioned in this

maner.<figure/> Where note that who ſo euer is borne in this Signe, firſte touchynge the diſpoſition of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
<pb facs="tcp:19522:70"/>
hath a beautifull bodye, comely to beholde, longe and talle, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beautifull, a lytle head, a thycke face, a fayre noſe, whyte téeth and ſhort. Vppon the lefte parte of hys Head he ſhall haue a ſtrype, and the lyke vppon the Crowne of hys Head, hys left Hand hys Fyngers, Armes, Teates, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt hys Heart. He is nymble, ſwifte on hys féete, and verye expedite in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng. He ſhall haue a naturall marke vppon hys pryuye members. He is of colour blacke, whoſe face ſhalbe lyke to them that haue the gréene ſickennes.</p>
               <p>Touchyng the diſpoſition of the mynde he ſhall by nature haue a good wytte, and a ſharpe, and therewithall conſtant and firme. He ſhall loue wyſe men, and ſhall embrace all ſuche as bee of diſcretion.</p>
               <p>Therefore touchynge thys parte of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the naturall conſtellation bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng rule in this natiuitie, he ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire vnto hym ſelfe poſſeſſion wyth wyſe men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19522:71"/>And althoughe that he haue a couetous mynde naturally diſpoſed to auarice, by reaſon of the concourſe of certain ſtarrs, yet by meanes of the dominion of thys Signe, he ſhalbe ſtudious of good thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and ſhalbe inclined to vertue, and eſpecially to the vertue of liberalitie.</p>
               <p>And therefore he ſhall not be muche in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the oppoſite or contrarye, nor yet to extorte other mennes goods. And becauſe principally he is bent to vertue, it will folow that he ſhalbe of great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, &amp; exalted in hygh degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Moreouer although he be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallye inclined to liberalitie, and not to rapine or extorcion, yet he ſhalbe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliue and giuen to many vices, that is to ſay, to pryde, couetouſnes, lecherie and glotonye, and chiefly to pryde lytle eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng other mennes doyngs or ſayings, very haultye, in ſo muche that what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer queſtion any do aſke of him, be ſhal get no anſwere at hys handes. And by reaſon of hys pryde aforeſayde, he ſhalbe a great Cauillour, Lyer, Chyder, and
<pb facs="tcp:19522:71"/>
full of contention. He ſhall haue a verye peſtiferous and venemous tongue. And although he be naturally inclined to a certeyne ſpice of liberalitie, for that he wyll couet to poſſeſſe nothyng vniuſtly, yet he ſhall bée deſirous to gette ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce, and couetouſly to enioye it.</p>
               <p>Whereby conſequently it appeareth, that wholly he is not gyuen to couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, but to a certayn ſpyce therof to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to haue. Lykewyſe he is inclined to Lechery. For with thrée women ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally he ſhall haue to do, but ſome tymes (by natures impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) he ſhal not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect his ſéed, although he be very deſirous therevnto. He is much diſpoſed alſo to glottony chiefly to catyng of herbes and in his meate doth greatly loue them.</p>
               <p>Furthermore note here that the premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes do not only belong to the man, but to the woman alſo ſubiect to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation. Concernyg hys lyfe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner therof. He ſhall bée long ſick, and ſhall haue a payne in hys heart. He ſhal haue thrée ſpeciall ſickenneſſes. The
<pb facs="tcp:19522:72"/>
firſt when he .xx. yeres of age. The .ij. when he is .xlvij. The .iij. and laſt, when he is .lxxx. Touchyng his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, he ſhall bée in great eſtimation and honour. He ſhall haue manye chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp; amongs al he ſhal haue a twinne or two borne at one byrthe, and of them he ſhall ſee the thyrd generation. He ſhal atteyn to his fathers enheritaunce. In all hys affayres he ſhall proſper and day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſhall ſée his goods encreaſe. He ſhal come into the worlde wyth his owne ſtarre, that is to ſay, he ſhall enioy all thyngs accordyng to the influence of his ſigne. He ſhall haue much trouble in the water. He ſhall fall into a riuer but he ſhall eſkape drownyng. He ſhall loſe the moſt part of all hys goods and ſhall fall into the hands of his enemie and ſometymes into handes of a woman a ſhe enemie. He ſhall bee bitten with a beaſt in the middeſt of one of his fingers of hys right hand, and ſhall dye an exile out of hys countrey. His moſt dereſt frend beloued aboue others he ſhal leſe,
<pb facs="tcp:19522:72"/>
and he ſhall bée wonderfully troubled with deuilles and euill ſpirites.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde Chapter deſcribeth the condicion of the tayle of Sagitarius, whiche is .xxiij. particuler ſigne called Albeyda,<note place="margin">the 23 perti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>culer ſigne</note> and hath

vij. ſtarres fixed in thys maner.<figure/> He that is borne in thys ſigne, firſte touchynge the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye. He ſhall haue a body comelye, a ruddye face, redde heare, narowe eye-browes, eyes lyke a Catte, he ſhall bee balde, and beautifull to beholde, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally marked vppon the head, his left ſide, and vpon hys ryght noſtrill.</p>
               <p>After the diſpoſition of the mynde he ſhalbe very ready to anger, and therein alſo ſhalbe very ſonbden, and the payne beyng paſt, he wyll ſoone be appeaſed.</p>
               <p>He ſhalbe of an excellent witte, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally geuen to the exerciſe of rydynge
<pb facs="tcp:19522:73"/>
and ſhotynge. He ſhall not he circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in hys doynges, nor yet foreſeyng in thynges that maye happen. He ſhall haue muche payne in his guttes, and in hys head, eſpecially he ſhall ſuffer thrée ſeuerall ſickenneſſes. The firſt when he is .xxj. yeres olde. The ſeconde when he is .lxij. yeres of age. And the thyrd when he is .lxxx. And touchyng his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, yf he doe not take away or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue the naturall marke which ſhalbée vppon his ryght buttocke, or right no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrell, then his Conſtellation ſhall bée proſperous. But yf the ſayde marke bée violently remoued from the place, then his fate ſhall bee hindered and empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. He ſhall bée valient in armes, and therein alſo victorious. But if the houre of Saturne doe concurre with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne in hys natiuitie, he ſhall be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent by reaſon of the influence of that planet, and therefore ſhal with great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour atteyne to anye commoditie, and with muche difficultie acquire his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer good lucke. But yet not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
<pb facs="tcp:19522:73"/>
the impediment of Saturne, yf the marks aforeſayd be not taken away yet he ſhall obteyne the victorious fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes aforeſayde. But yf his mother par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes do take awaye that marke from the places aforeſayde, ſome euyll happe may chaunce vnto hym. For he ſhall haue much a doe to repell the influence of Saturne. The ſayde markes doe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hementlye reſiſt the malyce of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net by reaſon of theyr notable vertue.</p>
               <p>So that Saturne ſhal do no great hurte although he doe ſome hynder. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge the euyll fortune of the borne in thys Sygne of Sagitarius. He ſhall bee in manye troubles. He ſhall bee hurte wyth whotte burnynge yron.</p>
               <p>He ſhall bee in daunger of Theues not onelye by traueylynge by the waye, but alſo in Cytyes. He ſhall alſo loſe and forgoe manye poſſeſſions purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by hym ſelfe, whyche ſhall bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate and taken from hym through the malyce of certeyne naturall markes, whereof one ſhall bee in hys ſtones.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19522:74"/>And another vppon hys lefte ſide, by force wherof, he ſhal not long after loſe hys ſyght.</p>
               <p>Lykewyſe thou ſhalt haue in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce this rule folowyng, touchyng the taile of Sagitarius, generally apper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teyninge to all men borne in this ſigne. And firſt thou ſhalt know that if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen he be borne in the ſeconde houre of the daye, not withſtandynge the premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he ſhall be foule and euill fauoured. He ſhalbe balde, and his Children alſo ſhalbe balde, by reaſon of the markes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſayde, whereof the one ſhalbe vppon his ribbes, and the other vppon his left ſyde. Alſo by force of this conſtellation, he ſhalbe very lecherous, and ſhalbe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed with a great infirmitie. but he ſhal recouer. In lyke maner touchynge hys good fortune, he ſhall haue two Chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren borne at one byrthe. Hys poſſeſſion and lyuynge ſhall bee indifferent, for ſometymes it ſhall bee diminiſhed, and ſometymes encreaſed. All theſe thinges thou ſhalte diligentlye note, ouer and
<pb facs="tcp:19522:74"/>
beſides the things conteyned in the two Chapters aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>In the thyrd Chapter entreatyng of Sagitarius iudgemente touchynge the male. There is to be noted that he that is borne in thys Sygne, ſhall haue a merye and pleaſaunt countenaunce.</p>
               <p>Lykewyſe, touchynge the diſpoſition of the mynde, he ſhall bee gentle, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, meeke, liberall mixte wyth ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burneſſe, by reaſon whereof, he ſhall bee of greate authoritie, gentle, kynde, courtelyke, and a great bankettour, by reaſon of whyche hys curteſye manye well repayre vnto him, and be geſtes at hys table. And by meanes of his libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie he wyll bee a bountifull geuer of Horſſes and other fourefooted beaſtes. He ſhall bee verye ingenious, wyttye, artificiall, ſobre, graue, paynefull, and carefull of his affayres. He ſhall bée ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and very ware aboute his doyings. So that he wyll not diſcloſe hys ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creates to no man, but ſecreatelye wyll keepe them to hym ſelf, &amp; the ſame wyll
<pb facs="tcp:19522:75"/>
very finely keepe hidde in his breſte, for that almoſt he is miſtruſtfull all men.</p>
               <p>He ſhall be with manye vices encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, becauſe he is naturallye gyuen to be a great fornicatour, and one that will be ſoone angrye, and yet ſoone appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againe, and when his anger is once done, then he wyll vtter muche fayre and gentle talke ſomewhat ioyned with couetouuſnes. He ſhall be ſkabbye and very full of ytche. He ſhall bee aflected wyth two notable &amp; ſtrong ſickenneſſes. The one when he is .xxxiij. yeares of age, whiche ſhall bee ſo vehement that he ſhall ſtande in greate hazarde of lyfe, whiche yf he eſkape, then ſhall he haue the ſeconde, whyche ſhall happen when he is foure ſkore and eyghte yeares of age, whereof he ſhall dye. Semblablye, touchynge hys good fortune. The firſt Chylde that he ſhall haue, ſhall bee a ſonne. He ſhall haue to his frend a Pier of a realme, with whome he ſhall dwell in houſholde and ſhall poſſeſſe other mennes gooddes. In lyke maner
<pb facs="tcp:19522:75"/>
chynge hys euyll fortune, he ſhall bee in daunger of three ſeuerall frayes, and her that ſhoulde bee hys firſte wyfe he ſhall not enioye. And by the malyce of others he ſhall bee in diſpleaſure wyth hys frende aforeſayde, and yet in the ende he ſhall ouercome theyr malyce, and bee reconſiled to hys frendſhyppe agayne. He ſhall be hurte wyth Iron vnleſſe warely he take heede thereof.</p>
               <p>Sondaye is hys contrarye daye, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vppon that daye let hym attempte no newe enterpriſe, nor waſhe his head, or put on any newe apparell.</p>
               <p>The fourthe Chapter of thys pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente Treatyſe deſcribeth the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of Sagitarius touchynge the female. And here to learne for to knowe the diſpoſition of her bodye, you muſte repayre to the Chapters of the head and tayle of Sagitarius (whiche is before recited) where you ſhall finde manye thynges ſpoken of the female borne in thys Sygne.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:19522:76"/>And touchynge the diſpoſition of the mynde, ſhe ſhall bee verye muche gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Artes of Magicke, and to Witchecrafte, and by reaſon of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teltie of her wytte, ſhe ſhall putte the ſame Artes in practyſe. She ſhall bee verye curſte, carefull, mercyfull, chylde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearynge and a great Lyer. She ſhall incurre great peryll, eſpeciallye for one offence that ſhe ſhall commytte, for whyche offence ſhe ſhall bée brought to Iudgemente: Whyche peryll yf ſhe eſkape, then ſhe ſhall lyue tyll ſhe bée three ſcore and .viij. yeres olde. She ſhall fullye accomplyſhe her fate.</p>
               <p>And althoughe ſhe bee ſubecte vnto muche malyce and daunger, yet ſhe ſhall obteyne the vyctorye ouer them all. She ſhall haue twoo huſbandes, whereof the ſeconde ſhall bée the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

But not wythſtandynge the vices aforeſayde, wherevnto he ſhalbe much apte and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, yet he ſhalbe a iuſte man and much inclined to iuſtice, a deſpyſer of euyll and a great louer of hys compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And where he ſhalbe naturally ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to be a drynker, yet in hys meate and dyet, he ſhalbe very ſpare and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat.

He ſhall alſo in his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bee troubled wyth a payne in hys Legge. Alſo he ſhall haue eyght ſpecial ſicknneſſes.</p>
               <p>The firſte, when he is fourtene yeares olde. The ſeconde, when he is twenty. The thyrd, when he is one and twenty.

               <p>Moreouer, touchynge hys good fortune he ſhall haue two ſonnes, and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue inheritaunce from his Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours. And hys ende ſhall bee better then his begynnynge. He ſhall bée na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turallye gyuen to the marchaundyze of Goates, and therein ſhall bée both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate and luckye, yf he wyll diligently folowe the ſame trafficke.</p>
               <p>Lykewyſe, touchynge hys euyll for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, he ſhall bée ſubiecte to the hande of hys enemies.

                  <pb facs="tcp:19522:82"/>The thyrd Chapter determineth the iudgement of Capricornus touchynge the male.

               <p>That is to ſaye, to the head of Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cornus, or elles to the tayle, and there the truth concernyng hys corporall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition maye bee founde.</p>
               <p>And yet not wythſtandynge (ouer and beſyde the premiſſes) ſuche one hath a lytle head, hollowe eyes, and a ſofte ſpeache.

And not withſtandynge the aforeſayde vices he ſhall bée naturallye geuen to be ciuile, honeſt, amiable, and pleaſaunt. Moreouer, touchyng hys life and maner thereof, he ſhall bée full of ſickennes.

               <p>The fourth Chapter of thys tenth Treatyſe deſcrybeth the Iudgemente of Capricornus, touchynge the female.

She ſhall atteyne to a good fate and conſtellation ioyned with muche ioye, and meane of her witte. She ſhall brynge her deuiſes to good effect.

concernyng the ſame, and in all weighty and ponderous matters touching earth, and that whiche is poſſible to bee done wyth earth, with ſtones with wodd, and wyth the hydes of the beaſtes before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.

               <p>Lykewyſe, touchynge hys lyfe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thereof. He ſhall haue two ſpeciall ſickenneſſes.

<pb facs="tcp:19522:90"/>
ſhall bée ſkylful in Arte and knowledge by reaſon whereof, he ſhall atteyne to preferment. He ſhall haue the charge and gouernement of manye and diuers ſommes of money, and by a ſtraunge man ſhall vnlooked for enioye muche treaſure. And concernynge hys euyll Fortune, hys abode ſhall not continue in the place of hys owne natiuitie, but wanderynge abrode ſhall perambulate ſtraunge places, and in them ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. And not withſtandynge thys hys peregrination and dewellynge in ſuche places is indifferente either to good or euyll Fortune. Therefore as ſéemeth to me, it tendeth indifferentlye bothe to good and euyll fortune. He that is thus borne, hys firſte wyfe ſhall not long tarye with hym, and after ſhe is dead, all thynges ſhall haue moore proſperous ſucceſſe wyth hym.</p>
               <p>And the loſſe alſo of thys Wyfe, as ſpeciallye I doe note, ſeemeth not to me to belonge to euyll Fortune, but to indifferente.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19522:91"/>Lykewyſe, vppon the water he ſhall bee very vnfortune, which by nature he ſhal abhorre. He ſhall bee enwrapped wyth many and ſundry daungers and amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges others ſpeciallye with his wyfe and woman. Saterday is his contrarye and vnhappy day. Therefore vpon that daye he muſt attempte no notable enterpriſe or facte, nor yet vpon that day waſhe his Head, put on newe garmentes, or doe other nouelties remembred and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the treatiſe before.</p>
               <p>The .v. Chapter of this .xj. treatiſe deſcrybeth the iudgement of Aquarius touchynge the woman. And here is to be noted, that the woman borne in thys ſigne touchyng the diſpoſition of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſhalbe delicate and tender, and by force of this conſtellation ſhall haue a marke in her ryght hande. She ſhall bee trewe, faythfull, conſtant, wyttye, and of a good complexion, and diſpoſed to all goodnes, ſpeciallye to mercye and pitie. Lykewyſe, touching her lyfe and maner thereof, ſhe ſhall haue a great diſeaſe in

her eyes, and ſhall haue two ſpeciall ſickenneſſes, whereof the chiefeſt and moſte daungerous ſhall bee when ſhe is of eyghtene yeares of age. And the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde ſhe ſhall haue (yf ſhe chaunce to eſkape the firſt) when ſhe is foure ſkore yeres olde, and then ſhall dye accordyng to the effect of this conſtellation.</p>
               <p>Alſo touchynge her good fortune, ſhe ſhall abounde in Chyldren. She ſhalbe enryched with other mens goodes, and ſhall atteyne to an indifferent wealthe. When ſhe is .xv. yeares of age, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſhal fauour her better, and ſhe ſhal enioye a better ſtate. Muche euyll For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſhall happen vnto her in her tyme, and amonges others, her good name ſhall be blotted with infamye, and ſhall be defamed with the corruption of her virginitie, and ſhall haue experience of ſtraunge places, and be verye odious to her enemyes. Her firſt Huſbande ſhall put her from hym. She ſhall be hurte wyth foure footed beaſtes, or ſhall bee very neare the ſame. But it ſeemeth to
<pb facs="tcp:19522:92"/>

Lykewyſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in buyldings, in earth, in ſtone, in wod, in hydes of beaſts, ſpecially the beaſts afore remembred. Furthermore, it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly and for the moſt part fortu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nate in thoſe things which be done with great labour and exerciſe. This ſigne is fortunat toward the weſt, therfore they muſte diſpoſe their affayres that waye. The Sunday is vnfortunate for them, therefore that daye let them not doe any newe notable worke, as is ſaide in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther treatiſes. They ſhalbe vexed with long feuers quotidians and cold. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the vertue of the conſtellation, their tyme is diuided into .xv. ſo that the firſt .xv. yeres going before, are good and

lucky, the .xv. yeres folowing are vnluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky and vnfortunat: and neuertheles in the good fortune of the firſt .xv. yeres the Sunday is alwayes vnfortunat.

He ſhall come into the handes of a puyſante man, from whome he ſhalbe delyuered. He ſhall loſe by violence muche ryches whiche he had gotten, without recouery or hope of recouerye.</p>
               <p>The thyrde Chapter determineth of the iudgement of Piſces for the male. The man chylde borne in this Sygne ſhall haue a naturall marke in his head ſhulder, or foote, and a ſcarre in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of his bodye, or ſome where elles.</p>
               <p>He ſhall bee a player, merrye, a diſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of Fortune, verye harde of beliefe, lecherous beyonde meaſure, and haue

               <p>He ſhall gette muche gooddes by hys labour, trauell, and notable induſtrye.</p>
               <p>He ſhall haue the reuenge of hys ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, and ſee the puniſhement of them.

                  <p>SEynge that the head is the part that is moſt ſéene of al the parts of mans bodye, Hypocrates in his .vj. booke of common ſickneſſes, not without cauſe ſheweth how to iudge of the whole bodye by the conſideration of the head. For that which is either grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or leſſer then it oughte to bee is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes faultie and not good, and they that haue this faulte or lacke, haue alſo thoſe thinges that do euidently appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the faulty &amp; hurted myndes. And now euen as the head whiche is litle, is neuer without faulte, ſo that whiche is great, is not altogether parfite and good: but ſometyme good and ſomtime yll. It is a ſigne of goodnes or of wickednes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:19522:110"/>But the beſt faſhion is the round head, and ſomwhat low on both ſydes, as yf you ſhoulde imagine a verye rounde Sphere made of Ware to bee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lowe of eche ſyde. The beſt forme then and ſhape of a head, is that whiche is meanely greate, and hath a comelye conuenient roundneſſe: whiche appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth before and behynde ſomewhat lowe. The principall cauſe why the head is lytle, is the lacke of matter or ſubſtaunce. And the cauſe of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of it, is the abundaunce and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie of the ſubſtaunce and ſeede man. But yf there bee lytle matter wyth the force of the firſte formatiue vertue, it ſhalbe of a good forme and ſhape, and leſſe euil, for as much as in the creature the noughtines of the faſhion is ioyned with ſmalenes of the head. The braine foloweth the forme and faſhion of the ſkull. For yf the ſkull bee corrupte, the brayne ſhalbe alſo corrupte. The head of man hath more brayne proporcional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye then all other beaſtes. The male
<pb facs="tcp:19522:110"/>
hath more braine then the female. The head of man hath moe ioynynges then all other thynges: and the male moe then the female. A well faſhioned head is lyke a mallet, whereof the fore parte and the hynder parte, be lofty and high. The forme or faſhion of the meane ventricle, muſte bee a lytle preſſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſo the cogitatiue is the more noble. If the forme before be lowe, the man hath no iudgement. And the hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der parte bee lowe, he hath no memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, and hath a weakeneſſe of mouyng hys ſynowes, and conſequentlye of all his bodye: for by the force of the braine is declared the force of the necke and ſynowes: and alſo the brodeneſſe of the ſhulders and of the breaſt, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the ſydes called Hypocondria, whiche be ioynynges to the lyuer and lunges. The head that is of a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faſhion augmenteth the witte and vertue, and declareth a magnificence in the man: but when it is euyll is faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it ſheweth the contrary.</p>

The head faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned lyke a Sugar lofe, declareth the man to be paſte ſhame, a deuourer, bold and raſhe, which thing commeth of the heat and dryneſſe of the brayne. It is a another thyng when the head is great and the other members are not great accordynglye. The head is of a good faſhion, when the ventricle before is alſo of a good faſhion, and moyſte ynoughe. For the takynge of the kindes commeth of the moyſture, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynyng commeth of drynes in the part behinde. The head with a meane ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle

                  <p>The head rounde ſignifieth, mobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, vnſtablenes, forgetfulneſſe, ſmale diſcretion and lytle wyſedome in the man, for ſometymes the mouing of the ſpirites ſtayeth.

                  <p>BLacknes in a man like a gliſtering horne is a token of aduſtion as wel in the members as in the heare. A blacke colour ſheweth the man to be of a ſmall courage in feates of warre fearefull and craftye and is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to them that dwell in the ſouthe. A greene colour, darke, or blacke, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth the man ready and prompte to anger. Men that haue a verye redde or redde headed in colour are ſubtile and craftie. As the common ſayeng among the Frenche men is <hi>l'ay veu bein peu de petites gens humbles, &amp; rouſſeaux fideles,</hi> that is to ſay I haue ſene fewe litle me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> humble or lowlye, &amp; fewe redde head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men faithfull and true. They that haue a pale and a dead face, and yet a redde forehead and lowe eyes, are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſhamefaſte. And to them you may attribute paſſion. The white co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour &amp; ſamewhat ruddye, ſignifieth the
<pb facs="tcp:19522:113"/>
man verye ſtronge and courageous. Suche are the northen men. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour that is verye whyte ſheweth the man to be contrarye to vertue. A pale coloure ſygnifyeth the man to be withoute courage in deedes of warre, fearefull, and a turner of his backe, yf ſyckenes be not the cauſe of thys pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. When a browne colour is myxed with a pale, it declareth the man to be a blabbe of his tonge and a prater, ſone angrye, and a ſpeaker without any tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perature. This colour then tendeth to an extreeme folly. They that be but a lytle red and freckled and haue quaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and moouinge lyppes and wyde noſtetrells be commonly couragious and readye to wrathe and anger: and to theym alſo is paſſion attributed. A meane redde colour noteth a readye and pregnaunt wytte and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge. They that be of a fyrye colour or verye neere, keepe theyr anger longe and are harde to pacyfye or to be ruled when they are angrye. When
<pb facs="tcp:19522:113"/>
the vaines of the braine and of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples be ſeene and the eyes ſanguyne, it is a ſygne that the man is ſubiecte to vehement wrath, and that ſometime he is folyſhe &amp; out of his wyts. When the face is redde, it is a ſygne of ſhame or dronkenneſſe you ſhall then knowe this colour by the ſygnes of the eyes.</p>

                  <p>THe heare ſmooth and thicke beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth meekenes, colde and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. The further that the brayne is from heate, the more hearye is the head. The heate of a man that goeth to the vpper partes percinge throughe from all partes goeth thorowe the ſkinne of the heade and maketh an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to comme oute of the holes that it maketh, and the fyneſt parte of this humour vanyſheth away but the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer remayneth wythin and is turned in to heare. Whyche is harder than the
<pb facs="tcp:19522:114"/>
ſkinne and that by the meanes of the outward colde, &amp; the heare is as bigge as the pore or hole, and as longe as the violence and force of thruſting it out is great. When the heare commeth oute ſlowlye, it is a ſigne of a moyſte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion and not ſanguyn. If they come a paſe the body ſhall enclyne rather to dryneſſe than to moyſture. And whan heate and drougth doe ioyne together the heare commeth out the ſooner, and therewithall groſſer. The multitude of heares declareth a hote man and the groſſneſſe of theym ſheweth him to be full of fumoſite. And therefore that happeneth more in yonge men than in yonge children. For in children the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce is more vaporous than moyſt. But in yong men it is contrary wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contraries folow their contraries. Abundaunce of heare in yong children ſheweth their complexion that encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and augmenteth, to tende to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancolines. The curlinge of the heare ſignifieth heate and drines, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of
<pb facs="tcp:19522:114"/>
the crokednes of the pores. The heares that be right vp in the head &amp; the heare alſo that ſtandeth vprighte in the reſt of the body betoken fearfulnes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man. The heares right or thicke declare the man to be cruell and whan they be rare then they ſhewe him to be a deceiuour and if they be curled and turninge vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it is a ſigne of a hoate complexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And they be faſt together appearing vp on the forehead they declare a myghty courage and a brutall as the courage of beares. The heares that be preſſed downe and couched together vpon the myddle of the forehead ryſing together vpon the toppe of the heade ſhewe the man to be hoate, and without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of honeſtye. The heares that be thine ſlender and fewe in number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the temples declare the man to be colde and without force. The reaſon is for in that place, are the great arteres &amp; that place ought naturally to be hoote, and conſequently to haue aboundance of heares for aſmuch as the generation
<pb facs="tcp:19522:115"/>

Therfore whan the heare is thin and ſlender in that place, there is lacke of heate, and this ought to be aſcribed vnto women for thei neuer haue a bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of heare in that place. The heare thinne and hard beſyde the temples de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the man to be colde and feareful. And when they be thycke in the ſame place and beſyde the eares it is a ſygne of heate &amp; whordome. And thei be there ſtable, blacke or yellowe they ſignify a viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mind or courage. If thei be groſſe and ſomewhat whiter, it is a ſigne that the man ſhall be indocible whom men ſhall not rule nor tame. The abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of groſſe heares &amp; preſſed downe, with the abundance of heare in all the reſt of the body, doe ſhewe in an infante a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancolines to come, that is to ſaye, that he ſhall fall into a furye or folly. When heares growe in a man that is already aged it is a token of great aduſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which engendreth folly &amp; priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wytte and ſenſe.

And yet for all that we may not ſay that generally they be cold but rather that their complexion is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye hote: for the heate is within them as it commeth to paſſe in winter &amp;c.

The blacke heare cometh of ſuperabundant coler aduſte or of bloode aduſte, redde heare ſygnifyethe heate whyche is not aduſte for they be of a diminiſhed heate The heares that be very redde declare the man to be a craftye deceiuour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of wytte colerycke, ful of wrath and furious withoute reaſon. The heares that be of a cheſte nutte colour declareth the man to be vpryght, iuſte and well beloued of men.

The abern coloured or yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe heare hold ſomething of cold, and the heate is dead in the moyſt, and this is referred vnto infantes.

The Noſe ſheweth the diſpoſytion, of the hart: yf it be great, it is a ſygne that the man is ſubiect to wrath. A lyttle noſe and a greate alſo declare the ſecrete partes of the man, and of the woman. The pryuye member of a man great, commeth of a groſſe and hote matter. Yet the foote of the woman declareth her matryce. A narrowe foote, longe leane ſheweth the lyke of the matryce of the woman, and ſo the contrarye. The meaſure of halfe the foote beyng bare, is the meaſure of the length of the matrice, yea in all women. Greate lippes declare the ſkynne or the lyppe of the gate to be great, and ſo contrary And ſpecially in a maide. The noſtrells of the Noſe ſhewe the ſtones of the man. If they be greate and wyde it is a ſygne that hys coddes be greate
<pb facs="tcp:19522:130"/>

Wherefore the rule cannot fayle (vnleſſe it be by accident) that is to ſaye by ſyckenes and yll rule, as dauncyng, or ſuche lyke. For tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle and labour encreaſeth the mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber. And ſo manye haue theyr righte hande greatter then the lefte bycauſe it laboureth more. A hawke Noſe ſygnifyeth magnanimytye and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, cruellty, rapacitye, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes whych thynge commeth of heate. And therefore they that haue thys hawke Noſe are commonlye angrye and full reuenge and gyue themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to vnlawefull thynges. A flatte Noſe ſygnifyeth violence whoredome and yet neuertheles weakenes.

A ſharpe noſe, a longe necke, and the voyce fayer &amp; ſhrill come of coleryke temperature.
<pb facs="tcp:19522:131"/>
When the noſe is broade in the middes toward the typpe, it is a token of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie of wordes, of lyeing of anger. I haue knowen ſuch men excéedinge in vices and chieflye in lyes. They that haue their noſe ſharpe at the ende are commonly lyars hurtfull, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.
