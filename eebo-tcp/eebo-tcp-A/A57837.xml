            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SIR BENJAMIN RUDDIERD
His Speech in Parliament.</head>
            <p>MAster <hi>Speaker,</hi> I did not think to have spoken again to this Bill, because
I was willing to believe that the forwardnesse of this Committe would
have prevented me, but now I do hold my self bound to speak, and to
speak in earnest.</p>
            <p>IN the first yeare of the King, and the second convention, I first moved for the
encrease and enlargement of poore Ministers Livings; I shewed how necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it was to be done, how shamefull it was, that it had been so long neglected.
This was also commended to the House by His Majesty. There was then, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow
many accusations on foot against scandalous Ministers. I was bold to tell the
House, that there were scandalous Livings too, which were much the cause of the
other: Livings of five Markes, or five pounds a yeare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that men of worth and of
parts would not be musled up to such pittances. And that there were some places
in England, which were scarce in Christendome, where God was little better
known then amongst Indians. I exampled it in the utmost skirts of the North,
where the prayers of the common people, are more like spels and charmes, than
devotions; the same blindnesse and ignorance is in divers parts of Wales, which
many of that Countrey do both know and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ment.</p>
            <p>I declared also, that to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ant good Ministers in good Livings, was the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
and surest meanes to establish true Religion, that it would prevaile more
against Papistry, than the making of new laws, or executing of old<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That it would
counterwork court-conscience and luke-warm accommodation. That though
the calling of Ministers be never so glorious within, yet outward poverty will
bring contemp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> upon them; especially among those who measure men by the
acre, and weigh them by the pound, which indeed is the greatest part of men.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I cannot but testifie how being in <hi>Germany,</hi> I was exceedingly
scandalized to see the poore stipendary Ministers of the reformed Churches
there despised and neglected by reason of their poverty, being otherwise very
grave and learned men. I am afraid that this is a part of the burthen of Germany
which ought to be a warning to us.</p>
            <p>I have heard many objections and difficulties even to impossibilities against
this Bill: to him that is unwilling, there is over a Beare or a Lion in the way. First
let us make our selves willing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then will the way be easie and safe enough.</p>
            <p>I have observed, that we are alwaies very eager and fierce against Papistry,
against scandalous Ministers, and against things which are not much in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
I should be glad to see that we did delight as well in rewarding, as in puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing,
and in undertaking matters within our own reach, as this is absolutely
within our power. Our own duties are next us, other mens farther off: I doe not
speak this, that I doe mislike the destroying or putting down of that which is ill,
but then let us be as earnest to plant and build up that which is good in the room
of it, for why should we be desolate. The best and the gentlest way to dispell
darknesse, is, to let in the light; we say that day breakes, but no man ever heard
the noise of it; God comes in the still voice; let us quietly mend our Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks,
and we cannot want lights.</p>
            <p>I am afraid this backwardnesse of ours, will give the adversary occasion to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97834:2"/>
say, that we chuse our religion, because it is the cheaper of the two; that we would
willingly serv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> God with somewhat that would cost us nought. Beleeve it Mr.
<hi>Speaker,</hi> he that thinkes to save any thing by his religion, but his soule, will be a
terrible looser in the end. We sow sparingly, that<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the reason we reap so sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and have no more fruit. Me thinkes whosoever hates Papistry, should by the
same rule hate covetousnesse, for that's Idolatry too. I never liked hot professions
and cold actions. Such an heat is rather the heat of distemper and disease, then of
life and saving health.</p>
            <p>For scandalous Ministers, there is no man shall be more forward to have them
severely punished, then I will be: when salt hath lost its savour, let it be cast out
upon the unsavory place, the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nghill. But Sir, let us deale with them, as God
hath dealt with us. God before he made man, made the world, an handsome place
for him to dwell in; so let us provide them convenient livings, and then punish
them in Gods name, but till then scandalous livings cannot but have scandalous
Ministers. It shall ever be a rule to me, that where the Church &amp; common-wealth
are both of one religion, it is comely &amp; decent, that the outward splendor of the
Church should hold a proportion, &amp; participate with the prosperity of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
estate: why should we dwel in houses of cedars, &amp; suffer God to dwel in skins?</p>
            <p>It was a glorious and religious work of King <hi>Iames,</hi> (I speake it to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
honour, and to the praise of that Nation, who though their Countrey
be not so rich as ours, yet are they richer in their affections to Religion) within
the space of one year he caused to be planted Churches through all Scotland, the
Highland and the Borders, worth 30. l. a yeare a piece, with a house and some
glebe land belonging to them; which 30. l. a yeare, considering the cheapnesse of
the Countrey, and the modest fashion of Ministers living there, is worth double
as much, as any where within an 100. miles of <hi>London.</hi> The printed Act &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
whereby it was executed, I have here in my hand, delivered to me by a
noble Gent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of that nation, &amp; a worthy member of this House, Sir <hi>Fran: Steward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, though Christianity &amp; Religion be established generally through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this Kingdom, yet untill it be planted more particularly, I shall scarce thinke
this a Christian Common-wealth. And seeing it hath been moved and shewed in
Parliament, it will lie heavy upon Parliaments, untill it be effected. Let us doe
something for God here of our own; and no doubt God will blesse our procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
in this place the better for ever hereafter. And for mine own part, I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
give over soliciting this cause as long as Parliaments and I live together.</p>
            <p>TO confirm the complaint of this worthy and religious Knight: there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
the testimony of two excellent men of God, whose piety and zeale
may move some to consider of the matter more seriously then they have done
hitherto, especially if they will please to reade what is written more at large in
their Sermons of this argument.</p>
            <p>The Reverend and learned Bishop <hi>Iewell</hi> in his Sermon before Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
on Psal. 69. 9. <hi>The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up,</hi> saith thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In England since
the Gospell hath been received, the maintenance of learning hath been decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and the lack of learning will be the decay of the Gospell. Loth I am to speak,
yet the cause so requireth, that it is needfull to be spoken: I trust I shall speake in
the hearing of them that will consider it. Maintenance of learning whereby an
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97834:3"/>
able and sufficient Ministry may grow and be established in all the Churches of
this Realme, is to be wished for. The good estate of this noble Kingdome, the
comfort of posteritie, the stay of Religion, the continuing of the Gospell, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
of darkenesse hangeth upon it. One asked sometimes how it was, that in
<hi>Athens,</hi> so good and great a Citie, there were no Physitians: to whom this answe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
was made, because there are no rewards appointed for them that practise Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick.
The same answer may be made for our times; the cause why the Church of
God is so forsaken, is the want of zeale in them that should either for their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,
or for their ability be fosterers of learning, and encrease the Livings, where
occasion is, and give hope and comfort to learned men. Which said I? encrease?
nay the Livings and provisions which heretofore were given, or taken away.</p>
            <p>Have patience, if any such be here (as I well know there are) whom these things
touch. Suffer me to speake the truth, it is Gods cause: the Livings of such, as are in
the Ministery, are not in their hands, to whom they are due. All other labourers
and arti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>icers have their hire encreased double as much as it was wont to be; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the poore man that laboureth and sweateth in the vineyard of the Lord of
hostes hath his hire abridged and abated.</p>
            <p>I spake not of the Curates, but of the Personag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> &amp; Vicarages, that is, of the
places, which are the Castles and Towers of fence for the Lords Temple. They
seldome passe now adayes from the Patron, if he be no better than a gentleman,
but either for the lease, or for present money. Such Merchants are broken into
the Church of God, a great deale more intollerable, then were they, whom Christ
whipped and chased out of the Temple. Thus they that should be carefull for
Gods Church, that should be Patrons to provide for the consciences of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and to place among them a learned Minister, who might be able to preach
the Word unto them, out of season, and in season, and to fulfill his ministery,
seeke their owne, and not which is Jesus Christs. They serve not Jesus Christ,
but their belly. And this is done, not in one place, or in one countrey, but
throughout <hi>England.</hi> A Gentleman cannot keepe his house, unlesse he have a
Personage or two in farme for his provision.</p>
            <p>O mercifull God! whereto will this grow at last<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Church: young men which are toward and learned see this, they see, that he
which feedeth the flock hath least part of the milke; he which goeth a warfare,
hath not halfe his wages; therefore they are weary and discouraged, they change
their studies, some become prentises, some turne to physick, some to law, all shun
and fly the Ministery. And besides, the hinderance that thus groweth by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
dealing of patrons, by reason of the Impropriations, the vicarages in many
places, and in the properest market towns, are so simple, that no man can live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
