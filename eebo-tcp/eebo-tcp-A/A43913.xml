            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'TIS to be hop'd that your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour will not take it ill, that a Soldier of Fortune here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes to appear before you; one who, with the Hero of the enſuing Hiſtory, has been Partaker of the Toils and Fatigues, which are inſeparable from the Art of War;
<pb facs="tcp:109100:3"/>
and who conſequently, has had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be an Eye-witneſs as well of the Amorous Exploits, as Military Atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, perform'd by him in ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; where either the King's Service, or the Glory of Arms, have call'd for his Preſence. I have conſider'd with my ſelf, MADAM, for a long time, about the choice of an Eminent Perſon, to whom I might properly Dedicate this Hiſtorical Commentary, without being able to come to a final Reſolution, as to that Particular: And indeed, there are different Motives, which induce Authors to act on the like Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions: For ſome do it, with a deſign to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for themſelves ſome powerful Patrons at Court; others, by way of acknowledgment for Favours already receiv'd; others, only to get the Name of an illuſtrious Perſonage prefixt before their Works; and laſtly, others, purely out of a Principle of Candor and Generoſity, without any manner of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation.</p>
            <p>MADAM, I have reaſon to boas<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, even without Vanity or Oſtentation, that I am of the number of theſe last; ſince it is
<pb facs="tcp:109100:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not to inſinuate my ſelf into your Favour, nor to ſollicit you to make uſe of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with the King in my behalf, that I have at laſt determin'd to make you a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of theſe Gallantries of the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers.</hi> I do not (Thanks be to Heaven) ſtand in need of any of theſe, or the like Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; but rather, on the contrary, am in a condition to ſlight the Court-Favours, and to look upon the capricious Events of Fortune with Contempt. The true Motive, that has excited me to Dedicate this Hiſtory to your Honour, is the diſ-intereſſed Deſire I have, to give you ſome ſort of Satisfaction, and to afford you in ſome meaſure, an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Diverſion for a few moments, in your Retirement at St. <hi>Cyr;</hi> by the Reading of a conſiderable number of very remarkable Adventures relating to a Hero, for whom you have a moſt cordial Affection, and whoſe Fortune you have taken care to advance, by cauſing him to be promoted to the principal Preferments in the Army, and very near, to the higheſt pitch of military Glory. Here your Honour may obſerve your Darling-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, ever ſince he was able to trail a Pike in the King's Service, till his advancement
<pb facs="tcp:109100:4"/>
to the Dignity of Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> and even till his Marriage with <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont;</hi> ſometimes expos'd to the greateſt Misfortunes that can be imagin'd; and ſometimes appearing Triumphant, as it were the moſt fortunate of all Mortals; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the variety of Accidents caus'd by the capricious Humours of the God of Love. Indeed the ſtrangeneſs of the ſurpriſing Events, of which we are inform'd by this not able Hiſtory, might at firſt ſight, give occaſion to ſuſpect it to be a kind of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance made at pleaſure, much rather than a Narrative of Matters of Fact; were it not that your Honour has divers faithful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to aſſert the Truth of the various Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences related in it. For you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd an Account of a conſiderable part of theſe Adventures, from Monſieur <hi>Bouffler</hi>'s own Mouth, altho' they are ſuch as have been hither to unknown to the World, and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of which, as I preſume, cannot but be very acceptable: Neither will it be any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Task to juſtifie ſome other particular Circumſtances, of which you may poſſibly doubt; ſince the Hero himſelf of our preſent Hiſtory, will make no ſcruple to
<pb facs="tcp:109100:4"/>
be my Voucher as to the reality of thoſe Events.</p>
            <p>However it may be taken, 'tis evident, that Truth may be diſcover'd by certain Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments, which cannot be hid from the ſight of the more judicious part of Mankind; not with ſtanding the Endeavours that ſome Authors have us'd of late, to conceal from the publick View, ſuch precious Fragments, which give us an <hi>Idea</hi> of the good and ill Fate that attends mortal Men in this ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary World. 'Tis well known, MADAM, that you are the moſt ſagacious, and moſt accompliſh'd Lady in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and therefore you may eaſily diſcern that this Hiſtory does not contain any thing that is fabulous or fictitious: Nevertheleſs, your Honour's Approbation will be of very great moment to recommend it to the World, and will not a little contribute to cauſe it to be ſought for, by all ingenious Perſonages; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by thoſe Honourable Ladies, who have a great Eſteem for <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers,</hi> and will not be diſpleas'd at the care I have taken to communicate to 'em a conſiderable number of private Love-Intriegues, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd

by a Hero, who is at preſent the <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and the greateſt Warriour that that Nation can boaſt of, ſince the Death of the famous Duke of <hi>Luxemburg.</hi> I ſhall no longer treſpaſs upon your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's Patience; only while I beg leave to ſtile my ſelf, with all poſſible Reſpect and Submiſſion,</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY Of the AMOURS Of the Marſhal de <hi>Boufflers.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SOME Perſons who eſteem LOVE as the Sweeteſt and moſt tender of all other Paſſions, have imagin'd it to be more eſpecially appropriated to the Female Sex: But whoever will take the pains to look back into the ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, may be ſoon convinc'd that it has extended its Conqueſts, not only over the Fair Sex, but alſo over the greateſt Men in all Ages; and that even the moſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Warriours amidſt their dangerous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, have too often felt its effects, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109100:6"/>
been forc'd to ſubmit to its Irreſiſtible Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Let us but look backwards upon thoſe great Heroes, <hi>Alexander, Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey;</hi> cou'd the greatneſs of their Deſigns ever make 'em abandon their amourous Intrigues? They ſcarce ever drew their Swords, but with an intent to pleaſe their Miſtreſses, and to make them to be ſharers in their moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Victories. Has not Love been too often the occaſion of Bloody Wars, and of the Deſtruction of whole Countries? Has it not undermin'd and over-thrown the Strongeſt Towers? Why then ſhou'd it be denied that it Sympathiſes in a moſt extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with <hi>Mars</hi> the God of War. I am apt to believe it to be an unqueſtionable Truth, that all Mankind feel the effects of <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; who does not ſpare a Throne, making even Scepters and Crowns ſubmit to his Empire. When the Glory of Martial Exploits and a well proportion'd Body meet in one Perſon, they are ſuch Powerful, or rather irreſiſtible Charms to a tender Heart, that nothing is able to hold out againſt 'em. The Hiſtories of all Ages are full of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to convince us, that even the moſt Illuſtrious Heroes in former Ages, as well as ours, have been carried beyond their Bounds by this Paſſion, even to that degree, that by the Inchantment of their Miſtreſes charms, they often become forgetful of their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109100:6"/>
Duty, having Sacrifis'd to their ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd Deities all their Glory and Renown, which with a Thouſand hazards and the loſs of their Blood, they had before accquir'd, under <hi>Mars</hi>'s Standard. There are never theleſs not wanting Examples of others, who having made it their chief aim to fight, and to Sacrifice their Lives for their Prince, have been able at leaſt for ſome time to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe and withſtand the Force of <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> whoſe amourous Adventures I am about to relate, is of this number: For tho' he had always a ſtrong Inclination to Pleaſure, and eſpecially to ſuch Love-intrigues as are uſual among Gentlemen, he has notwithſtanding all this, always kept ſuch a ballance between Love and Glory, that the firſt of theſe two Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, tho' otherwiſe the moſt powerful, has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been able to fully his Martial Glory; our General having ever ſhew'd himſelf as much a Soldier as a Gallant, as will more plainly appear from the following Relation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Love</hi> leads Mankind, even from their Youth thro' ſo many capricious Adventures, that it is always impoſſible to avoid its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting ſnares: Let us but conſider that we are all made of the ſame Clay, of which our fore-Father, <hi>Adam</hi> was created, who was not ſtrong enough to reſiſt the entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a Woman made either for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109100:7"/>
or pathaps for his comfort, why then ſhou'd we expect to excel him in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar? But to return to our Hiſtory, <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers</hi> had in his younger Years altogether addicted himſelf to Hunting, and Amourous divertiſements, the latter being never theleſs for the moſt part predominant; when after ſome time thus ſpent in amourous Delights, one of his Friends advis'd him to enter into the King's Service. He having for ſome time entertain'd this noble Deſign, his Mind was wholly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly'd in finding out means how to make a Figure in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> which cou'd not be done without very great expence: The Marſhal, who was born a Gentleman in the Province of <hi>Picardie,</hi> (where Gold is a pretty ſcarce Commodity) was put to a great <hi>non plus</hi> as to this Affair; when one Day walking all alone in his Garden, and muſing upon his preſent Circumſtances, the ſame Friend very ſeaſonably ſurpris'd him; and by offering him his Purſe and all his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, freed him from his preſent trouble; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withal, that by this means he might purchaſe the Royal Regiment of Dragoons, which was then to be ſold by the King's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The Marſhal receiv'd the Courteſy of his Kinſman with a great deal of Joy and thankfulneſs, and having by his aſſiſtance compleated his Deſign, he ſaw himſelf in a little while after at the Head of a Regiment,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109100:7"/>
which carries along with it Terrour and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, whereever it comes. The poor Proteſtants of <hi>France</hi> have been ſufficiently ſenſible of it to their coſt: But let us leave this doleful Subject, and return to <hi>Monſieur Boufflers,</hi> whom for the Reader's Diverſion I will draw to the Life, before I proceed: To ſpeak without vanity there is ſcarce any one that is better able to performe it than my ſelf, having had the Honour to know him, and to have been his Companion even from his Infancy, and having follow'd him in all his Martial Exploits, as well as Love-Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues. If any fault is to be found in the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, which I am about to draw, thoſe that eſpie it, I hope, will rather attribute it to the defect of my Pencil and Colours, than to any other imperfection. But let us ſee him as naturally drawn as can be, without any Diſguiſe. Our General, who was formerly a Marqueſs of the Marquiſate of <hi>Boufflers,</hi> is a Perſon of a mean Stature, but very well ſet, ſtrong and vigourous in all his Actions, even to exceſs at certain times. His Eyes are black, ſprightly and full of Fire, his looks fierce and ſomewhat ſtern among Men; but very ſweet and charming, when he ly's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate at the Feet of a beautiful Woman; where I have ſeen him making his Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip a thouſand times, with all the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imaginable. He has ſomething, I know

not what extraordinary in his Countenance and Behaviour, which begets him Reſpect and Veneration. His Face is ſmooth, of an oval Figure, his Fore-head high, and his whole Phyſiognomy the beſt compos'd that ever I ſaw; theſe are the advantages which bounteous Nature has beſtow'd upon him, let us obſerve thoſe for which he is beholding to his Sword, and whereby he has rais'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the greateſt Preferments in <hi>France.</hi> During his abode in <hi>Paris,</hi> he knew ſo well by what means to inſinuate himſelf into the favour of the chief Generals, who at that time commanded the Kings Armies, that they receiv'd him among the number of their moſt intimate Friends; On the other hand, he made his Court with ſo much Addreſs to thoſe Ladies who were then moſt belov'd by that Monarch, that by their favour he eaſily obtain'd whatever he wiſh'd for at Court; among the reſt he paid the moſt reſpect and moſt aſſiduous Viſits, to the two Marchion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſes of <hi>Monteſpan</hi> and <hi>Maintenon,</hi> but the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who at that time began to have the moſt Soveraign Aſcendant over the King, did recommend him ſo effectually, and in terms ſo obliging to that Prince, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he made his Fortune with the King. The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> firſt Prince of the Blood, and the Marſhal <hi>Schomberg,</hi> were not behind hand in advancing his Fortune,

thoſe two great Warriours having procur'd him the Advantage of being employ'd in the next Campaigne, which was in the Year 1678, where he ſignalis'd himſelf by his Valour at the Siege of <hi>Puicerda,</hi> which is one of the beſt Cities in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> ſituated in a fair Plain, on the River <hi>Segre.</hi> The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal and Duke de <hi>Navaille</hi> who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in chief before the Place, was ſo taken with his Bravery, that he lov'd him no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than a Brother, and commended his great Actions to all his Friends; for he never fear'd any Fatigue, being frequently accuſtom'd during the Campaign to ſleep in his Boots and Accoutrements, ſhewing by his example to the Dragoons, whoſe General he was, that by hardſhip and Toils, as by ſo many ſteps they muſt aſcend to the Pinnacle of Glory: He was always the laſt that diſmounted, and the firſt that moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Horſe. If his Troops reſted in any place, he himſelf was wont to go the rounds, and viſit the advanced Guards; if any Attack were to be made, you'd certainly find him at the Head of his Troops, with an undaunted Courage, animating them by his Example. Theſe are thoſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Endowments befitting ſo great a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that have rais'd him to that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious Poſt, in which we now ſee him; The King his Maſter having ſince

the Siege of <hi>Namur,</hi> where he defended that City, like a great Warriour, made him a Duke and Peer of <hi>France,</hi> not without hopes that his Majeſty will in time be pleas'd to make him <hi>Conſtable.</hi> Now let us take a view of his Amorous Exploits, theſe being the chief Subject of our preſent Relation. 'Tis not to be thought ſtrange that ſo famous a Soldier as the Marſhal de <hi>Boufflers,</hi> has often languiſh'd in the Arms of ſome Beauty or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, For he has been as Victorious in his Conqueſts of Love as in his Martial feats, and one may affirm, that he has been crown'd with Roſes and Lawrels as frequently in the Field of <hi>Venus,</hi> as in that of <hi>Mars.</hi> Part of the <hi>French</hi> Frontiers have been the Theater, where both his Amourous and Military Expeditions have been repreſented: The City of <hi>Puicer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> of which I have ſpoken before, will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with a Subject of this Nature.</p>
            <p>The Prince de <hi>Conti</hi> and the Duke de <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaille</hi> having made themſelves Maſters of this Placeby Capitulation, the Troops were for ſome time ſent into Quarters of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. At this time it was, that Love which ſeldom lets ſlip any Opportunity, did peirce the Heart of the Marſhal de <hi>Boufflers:</hi> The God of Love, who diſplays his Standard in the Field of Peace and Tranquility, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found it not impenetrable. In ſhort, the Marſhal was deſperately Wounded by the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109100:9"/>
bright Eyes of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Widow, whom he accidentally met in a Boat paſſing the River <hi>Segre.</hi> The name of this fair Lady was <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> who beſides that ſhe was very amiable in her Perſon, by her courteous Deportment to our General, and her charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and engaging Air conquer'd his Heart: As ſhe ſpoke very good <hi>French,</hi> ſo he offer'd her his Service in leading her out of the Boat with an intention to have accompanied her to her own Houſe; but ſhe notwithſtanding her Heart began to feel ſome emotions for him, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe his offer, telling him that the Cuſtom of her Country did not allow of ſuch a Civility; that it wou'd be thought very ſtrange if ſuch a Gentleman as he ſhou'd Conduct a Lady home to her own Appartment; that ſuch a thing wou'd be ſufficient to ruin her Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ever. A certain grave old Matron, whoſe name was <hi>Treſſa Alleva,</hi> (ſuch a one as they call in <hi>Spain</hi> the Guardians of Young Women,) taking notice of what paſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 'em, began to urge her to go home, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her with a very ſour Countenance, with her great Spectacles upon her Noſe, that her Diſcourſe was too long with a Stranger, Alaſs! my deareſt cry'd <hi>Olympia,</hi> (who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready began to feel ſome effects of Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Marſhal) my Heart does even now too much foretell me my Deſtiny of Loving one day this Stranger. Madam,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109100:10"/>
reply'd the old Woman Smiling, you are ſoon intangl'd in the Snares of Love, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making a due Reflection upon what you are going about to do: Your Love towards a <hi>Frenchman</hi> is too foreward; if your Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhou'd be inform'd of this matter you'—The Marſhal, who underſtood the threats of <hi>Treſſa Alleva,</hi> thought it time to quit his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and having ſqueez'd her fair hand, he whiſper'd her in the Ear, where he might ſee her again, if it were poſſible for him to live without her till after to morrow? <q>Juſt by that Seat, which you ſee built at the Foot of that Rock, ſaid ſhe, with a very paſſionate Air, I hope to have the good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to talk with you to morrow about ten a Clock at night, if my Paſſion do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of this Life before that time.</q> This was enough for the Marſhal, who did now fanſie himſelf the happieſt Man in the whole World; ſo that the reſt of that day and the next following, ſeem'd to him a Year, or (according to the Hyperbolical expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſions of Lovers) an Age, which he ſpent in making reflections upon his approaching Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity and Pleaſures.</p>
            <p>Which way, wou'd he ſay to himſelf, ſhall I begin to Court my Miſtreſs? What Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſhall I ask firſt? It muſt not ſaid he, Smiling, be toſee her Feet, for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lady's wou'd dye as ſoon as let any one ſee
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109100:10"/>
or touch them, they being commonly ſo very ſmall, that they appear like a Puppet's, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of thoſe of Men. Their own Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands muſt not pretend to ſuch a favour. Our General, who does not admire delays in Love, was extremely diſturb'd at firſt with his growing Paſſion; but whilſt he was ruminating upon the ſtrangeneſs of this Adventure, and by his amourous conceits, had ſet himſelf all over in a Flame. The appointed hour of the Rendez-vous drew near; he went to the place nominated by his Miſtreſs, and having paſſ'd ſeveral times by the Houſe, he perceiv'd no Body, which almoſt drove him to deſpair, having loſt all hopes of ever ſeeing again the Object which Tormented him with ſo much Violence. The Marſhal waited almoſt an Hour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting what wou'd be the iſſue of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture; when he by the help of the Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light perceiv'd a Woman at a Window, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her Fingers after a ſtrange manner: This is a certain way us'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> for Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thus to ſpeak to one another; in a mute Language, the Marſhal who was unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this odd way of Courtſhip, did not underſtand the meaning of it; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come nearer to the Window, which was pretty low, and having perceiv'd that it was his new Miſtreſs who call'd to him, he at that Moment made uſe of all the moſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109100:11"/>
tender Expreſſions, which are uſual with Men at the beginning of a moſt violent Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> was thereby touch'd to the very Heart; and told him in a languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tone: Sir, <q>pray don't ſpeak ſo loud, we dare not make uſe in this Country of our Liberty as we cou'd wiſh; and turning all what the General had ſaid into Raillery; is it poſſible, ſaid ſhe, that ſo lovely a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman as you ſhou'd have left <hi>France,</hi> the very dwelling place of Love, without ſome very ſtrong praeengagement? Alaſs! without Flattering my ſelf, I can ſcarce be perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that you are come hither, without having loſt ſome part of your Liberty. My caſe wou'd be deſperate, Madam, reply'd the Marſhal gallantly, to have loſt it before I had the opportunity to lay it at your Feet: The moſt miſerable Eſtate unto which you have reduc'd me, is a convincing Proof of it; you having depriv'd me of my own ſelf. I was not able to reſiſt ſuch dangerous blows as Yours; you have Wounded me in the moſt ſenſible Part; I did Love or rather adore you from the very firſt Moment I ſaw you. There is none but you, that can make me Fortunate or unfortunate; Pronounce therefore with your own charming Lips my Sentence of Life or Death.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> look'd upon her Lover with Eyes which ſufficiently declar'd her Paſſion,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109100:11"/>
and finding that Love began to overcome her Reaſon, ſhe reply'd not without ſome confuſion: <q>O Heavens! How weak do I find my ſelf at this Inſtant? What crime am I going to commit againſt my Duty? Sir, Sir pray have pitty upon me.</q> The Marſhal was vext to the very Soul, that he cou'd not make uſe of ſo Favourable an Opportunity as preſented it ſelf; he cou'd have wiſh'd that the Wall which parted his Beloved and him, had been of Paper or Cloth, that he might have made his way thro' it: He ſtruck with his Sword ſeveral times againſt the Window, the Enemy of his happineſs, but alaſs! in vain, for he found her ſo barricado'd up with Iron Grates, that he cou'd ſcarce put a Finger thro' it. His belov'd Angel, who was not inſenſible of his diſquiet, and wou'd very willingly have had a more ſecret interview with him, cry'd out to him, <q>take Courage, Sir, Fortune has always a kind chance for Lovers.</q> The Marſhal was ſo Tranſported with this charming Expreſſion, that he cou'd not forebear telling her: <q>Divine Creature, I dye a thouſand times a day by a moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Death, being uncertain of my deſtiny; if you be ſo Inhumane and Cruel as to deny me your pity, and prohibit me to enjoy the Pleaſure of ſeeing you in Private. Rather ſuffer, that after having declar'd my Paſſion and what Pains you have made me undergo,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109100:12"/>
I may dye for grief at your Feet: But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd he, I am reſolv'd to do it without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, and drawing his Sword, and putting the Point towards his Breaſt, I will ſayd he, dye in your Sight: He ſwore theſe Words in ſo Melancholy a Tone, that <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> fearing he was in earneſt, cry'd out all in Tears, hold, hold, for Heaven's ſake, don't let your Paſſion drive you into deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, don't make your ſelf the moſt Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of all Mankind; why will you make an attempt againſt your own ſelf, for want of a little Patience? Preſerve your ſelf for my ſake, and I promiſe that I will find out a more favourable Opportunity.</q> The Marſhal ſeem'd extremely pleas'd with the aſſurances he had receiv'd from his Miſtreſs, and glad that his feign'd attempt had made her believe that his intent of killing himſelf in her preſence was real; tho' God knows, it was the leaſt of his Thoughts, being not ſo much a Fool as to dye for her ſake. Nevertheleſs looking upon her with a very Paſſionate Eye, <q>Madam, ſaid he, I am infinitely oblig'd to your Goodneſs, for ſaving my Life, which was ready to be Sacrific'd before you, if you had not ſtopt my Hand, and thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the fatal Stroak, I ſhou'd have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly executed it without delay; but now ſince you flatter me with hopes of ſeeing you again in private; I will leave my moſt ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109100:12"/>
                  <hi>Olympia,</hi> to convince you of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Paſſion, which I have for you, and to ſhew you that an Age will not be long enough to ſatisfy my Deſires.</q> The fair <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> perceiving ſome of her Women to come that way, retir'd into another Chamber; and the Mar. who ſurmis'd that ſome body had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd her whilſt ſhe was talking with him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd ſomewhat backward from the Window, with a reſolution nevertheleſs to ſtay all Night to watch an opportunity of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Miſtreſs a ſecond time. Having thus walk'd up and down near the Ditch of an adjacent Caſtle, he ſaw at the very break of day, a Black-Moor coming from under the Ground out of a Vault, and making up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, who preſented to him the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Letter:

                     <p>I <hi>ſhou'd think my ſelf over happy if I cou'd find Words ſuitable to that Paſſion which I have for you. But alaſs! I find my ſelf quite at a loſs in this point of extremity, and if I may judge of your Love by my own; both are beyond Expreſſion. If Abſence were able to cure it, I wou'd make uſe of that Remedy, but I am too well convinc'd to the contrary. Wherefore let nothing diſturb your quiet, but reſt ſatisfy'd, that you ſhall ſee me ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhortly, that is to ſay to Morrow at the ſame Hour. The ſame Page who has deliver'd this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109100:13"/>
Letter to you, is to conduct you into my Chamber, by the ſame way that he came out to you: In the mean time be not Impatient; and remember that you are anſwerable to me for a Heart, which you have Robb'd me of in ſpite of all my reſiſtance; This ſhall be the reward of your Sufferings, if you continue to Love me.</hi>

            <p>The Marſhal who had not without ſome fear taken the Letter from the Black-moor, did imagine that perhaps it might be the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil who was come from the infernal Regions, on purpoſe do him ſome miſchief, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at ſome uncertainty what to reſolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he went back to his Lodgings, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd of his Land-Lady, as well as he cou'd in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue (which ſhe underſtood very well) whether ſhe knew that Lady who liv'd at the Foot of that Rocky Caſtle, which he nam'd to her. <q>Yes, very well, ſaid ſhe, ſhe is the Relict of a certain honeſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who is lately dead, his Name was that of the Marqueſs of <hi>Toledo;</hi> but good God! continu'd ſhe, how unhappy is that pretty Creature ſince the Death of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who lov'd her even to a degree of Folly? She is at preſent under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Brother, who Tyranniſes over her like his Slave, not allowing her the Liberty of ſpeaking one word to any Man. His name is <hi>Don Bilboano;</hi> he is Jealous even
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109100:13"/>
to a degree of Madneſs, and 'tis the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſcourſe of the Town, that he is in Love with his Siſter.</q> 
               <q>At that rate, reply'd the Marſhal careleſly, as if he had not known her; a Man muſt expoſe himſelf to no ſmall danger, if he ſhou'd go about to Court her for a Wife.</q> O Lord! cry'd the good Woman, being much ſurpris'd, <q>this cruel Man threatens to Sheath his Sword in the Breaſt of any Gentleman that ſhall have the boldneſs, ſo much as to think of his Siſter; he intending to be her only abſolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</q> Here the Marſhal interrupting her <q>ſaid, but for God's ſake do you believe that <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> entertains her Brother's Paſſion? I don't believe ſhe does, reply'd the Woman; for how can ſo charming a Creature as ſhe Love the moſt ill ſhap'd of all Men? for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, he is as ugly as the Devil; he has a hunch Back, enough to frighten Children withal, and his Legs are as crooked as a Hoop; tho' as to his internal Qualities, he is not inferiour to any Man, having accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd himſelf in all manner of Arts and Sciences.</q> Monſieur <hi>Boufflers</hi> being extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well pleas'd with the Womans Anſwer, which he found very agreeable; and purſuing the former Diſcourſe, ask'd her what was the reaſon that this Marchioneſs had chang'd her Name from <hi>Donna Toleda</hi> to <hi>Donna Olympia.</hi> Oh! reply'd ſhe, that is the contrivance of that
<q>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:109100:14"/>
ill favour'd piece her Brother, who will have it ſo. This evil Spirit cannot endure the name of his Brother in Law, his Head being fill'd with a fancy, that his Siſter is a Maid ſtill, and that he may enjoy her as ſuch.</q> This is an extravagant piece of Folly, reply'd the Marſhal, <q>ſuch a Fellow as this, if he liv'd in <hi>France,</hi> wou'd be ſent to the Houſe of Correction. It is not the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> faſhion, anſwer'd the Woman, to impriſon Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for being in Love with their Siſters; there are ſo many examples of this nature, that nothing is more common: Every one loves here what he likes beſt, without making any further Reflection upon the matter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Marſhal de <hi>Boufflers</hi> having ended this Diſcourſe with his Land-Lady, retir'd to his Chamber, ruminating with himſelf concerning what he had underſtood from her. His Thoughts were much diſtracted the whole Night, and the Day following: He began to conſider with himſelf to what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he was about to expoſe himſelf, if <hi>Donna Olympia</hi>'s Brother ſhou'd find him with her; <q>if this ugly Devil, this <hi>Aeſop</hi> ſhou'd, ſaid he diſcover our Intrigue, we are both undone without Remedy; Plague on him! that this Monſter ſhou'd have ſo good a Head-piece; but let it be as it will, the hopes of poſſeſſing ſo charming a Creature is a ſufficient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for a little danger.</q> Having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109100:14"/>
this Reſolution, he went towards the Rendez-vous, dreſs'd like an <hi>Adonis,</hi> and was no ſooner come near the Gate of the Vault, when he ſaw the ſame Black-Moor with a Pike in his Hand, ready to attend him.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing he did, was to demand the Marſhal's Sword, and what other Arms he had about him, which ſo ſurpris'd the Marſhal, that he made ſome difficulty of granting it. But the Black-Moor, who ſpoke good <hi>French,</hi> inform'd him that it was the Cuſtom of the Country, for any Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to leave his Sword at the Door, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he enter'd a Lady's Appartment. <q>I know very well, reply'd the General, that this is practis'd in your common Houſes, but the Caſe is otherwiſe here, where I believe my ſelf to be in a Perſon of Qualities Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. No matter for that anſwer'd the Moor with a Smile, give us your Sword, Sir, give us your Sword;</q> Love having by this time overcome his Reaſon; he deliver'd up his Sword to the Moor, with ſome <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis</hi>'s <hi>d'or,</hi> at which the Black-Moor being overjoy'd, aſſur'd our General of his Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, telling him that he needed fear nothing, ſince he was left to his care; <q>for ſaid he, <hi>Don Bilboaono</hi> the Brother of this Lady, is ſuch a Devil of a Man, that there is not one in the whole Houſe, that has not wiſh'd him to the Devil theſe ten Years: Well it's enough
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109100:15"/>
my Friend, reply'd <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers,</hi> come lead me to your Miſtreſses Chamber.</q> 
               <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> having over-heard theſe laſt words, open'd the Door of her Cloſet, and the Marſhal being enter'd, found her almoſt half undreſs'd, leaning upon a Couch em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broider'd with very fine Flowers. Her Complexion being very fair, and the Room where ſhe was, beautify'd with Black Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and illuminated with a great many Wax-tapers; ſhe appear'd to him more beautiful than an Angel.</p>
            <p>He did not approach without bearing the marks of a profound reſpect in his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and having ſet one of his Knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her on the Ground. <q>'Tis none but you ſay'd he, Divine Creature, that has the Power of Captivating my Reaſon. Your beauty has ſo far aſtoniſh'd me, that I am Tranſported even beyond my ſelf.</q> Then a charming bluſh cover'd her Face and Breaſts, which made our <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lady ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear without compariſon, the faireſt in the World. After ſhe riſe from her Couch, ſhe went to the Looking Glaſs, where ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſet in order ſome of the puffs of her Hair; which were interwoven with the fineſt Diamonds that ever were ſeen: The Marſhal then eſpying one of her little Hands whiter than the very Snow, he kiſs'd it for the ſpace of half an Hour without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109100:15"/>
This his paſſionate Behaviour made <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> bluſh; and caſting a very amourous look at him; <hi>Pray</hi> Sir ſaid ſhe, <hi>either moderate your Paſſion, or I am undone; Good God aſſiſt me! Where ſhall I find ſtrength enough to reſſiſt you?</hi> Ah! Madam, reply'd he, <hi>how is it poſſible for me, not to be ſenſible of your powerful Charms? It is you that inſpire me alone at this Moment, and I can ſwear and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to you, that in all my Life-time I never was ſo much enamour'd as now, having never met with any Object, which appear'd to me ſo ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as your ſelf, not only in point of Beauty, but alſo with reſpect to all other Perfections, which are able to charm a Mortal Man. Sir,</hi> anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer'd the Lady with a languiſhing Air, <hi>is it poſſible that a</hi> Frenchman <hi>can be ſincere? It is the general Opinion among us here, that their Amours are never real, but meer Compliments and ſatteries. By Heaven Sir, ſuch a ſort of Love wou'd not very well agree with my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: And ſhall never receive any Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Marſhal interrupted her with a Kiſs, <hi>I know very well</hi> ſay'd he, <hi>Madam, that I ought to offer you ſomething more Subſtantial than bare Words; but it is not always adviſable to be too forward; don't you know that when a Fort is to be Attackt, we firſt take a view of its Avenues and Out-works. Donna Olympia,</hi> who wou'd fain have perſwaded the Marſhal that ſhe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:109100:16"/>
did not underſtand his meaning, began to play with her little ſucking Pig, which was adorn'd with red Ribands. This Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had alſo Silver-Bells in his Ears and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Neck; nay, even at the Tail, which made a ſtrange kind of Harmony: This is the Faſhion among the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lady's, who chuſe rather to carry a little ſucking Pig under their Arm, than the fineſt Lap-dog; 'Tis their Cuſtom to make it ſqueek, when their Gallants ask 'em a Favour. Our Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, who perceiv'd her intent, took it from her, and put it into a little Hutch, made for that purpoſe. Then renewing his Courtſhip with a Thouſand amourous Sighs: He at laſt forc'd theſe words from her fair Lips, <hi>Oh!</hi> 
               <q>I Love you with a moſt violent Paſſion.</q> And what Proof, reply'd the Marſhal (em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing her) will you give me of your <q>Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? You will not grant me the leaſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; Ay, don't you know that Love is a Child, which pines after the utmoſt Favour? And what Sir, reply'd ſhe, muſt a Woman keep nothing to her ſelf, when ſhe is to prove that ſhe Loves? Are not Oaths ſtrong and convincing enough to Lovers?</q> Then lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Thumb a croſs one of her other Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and kiſſing it a thouſand times, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faſhion, ſhe told him, <q>I Love you above my Life; 'Tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me to believe you, Madam,</q> reply'd
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:109100:16"/>
the Marſhal in ſtealing ſome Kiſſes from her fair Lips, <q>its meerly impoſſible to believe it, except you grant me that which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pledge requir'd by Lovers,</q> 
               <hi>Surely</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd ſhe, with a very ſerious Countenance, <hi>I can ſcarce perſwade my ſelf that your Words are anſwerable to your Intentions, for ſhou'd I grant your deſire, you wou'd ceaſe to Love me as ſoon as you had enjoy'd me; don't you know that that Favour which you ſeek for with ſo much Heat, is the Grave of Love. How many gallant Heroes have we known who have been Bury'd under its ruins; and who have been loſt when they thought themſelves at the very Port of Felicity? The expectation of the Pleaſure, will far exceed the enjoyment it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Obſtacles made by <hi>Olympia</hi> againſt the Marſhal's Paſſion, did only ſerve to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame it and to quicken his deſire of making himſelf Maſter of that piece of Ground, which ſhe ſo Valiantly defended; and his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion growing more violent every moment, he cou'd not forbear telling her, that if ſhe let him languiſh thus any longer, he ſhou'd dye inſtantly at her Feet, <hi>Donna Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> then finding her ſtrength to fail her, and fearing that ſhe ſhou'd not be able to hold out much longer againſt her charming Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror (as ſhe was wont to call him,) very courteouſly deſir'd him to withdraw for that time, becauſe the day began to appear, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:109100:17"/>
that her Brother was accuſtom'd to walk the Rounds in the Houſe every Morning early, who if he ſhou'd find a Man in her Chamber, they both wou'd be in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their Lives. The Marſhal having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood her meaning, with a profound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence quitted the Room, promiſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his Viſit in a ſhort time, <hi>Yes, Sir</hi> ſaid ſhe, giving him her Hand (which he kiſs'd very Paſſionately) <hi>I promiſe it ſhall be ſo, my Heart is only too forward to give its conſent to ſo agreeable an Entertainment; don't fail to ſee me to morrow at the ſame Hour in my Chamber. You may believe Madam,</hi> reply'd the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, <hi>that I ſhall be overjoy'd to Execute your Commands, in which my Love is ſo nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, and that every Hour; nay, every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will ſeem an Age to me, till ſuch time that—Medina</hi> a Relation of this Lady coming towards her Chamber, and having made ſome noiſe in opening a door, ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd our General to Decamp, with his whole Army of Sighs and Languiſhing Expreſſions: He return'd to his ordinary Poſt: I mean to his own Lodgings where inſtead of Sleep, he was overwhelm'd with a Thouſand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourous Fancies: <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> flatter'd her ſelf with having gain'd a great Point, ſince by breaking off the Conference, ſhe had preſerv'd that which indeed ſhe was ready to part with. Her Heart was torn
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109100:17"/>
in pieces by two different Paſſions, for if her Vertue induc'd her ſtrongly to its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, on the other hand ſhe was apt to reproach her ſelf for not having been more favourable to her Lover. <hi>Medina</hi> having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Confuſion ſhe was in, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearer to her, ask'd her in very affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate terms the cauſe of her diſquiet. <hi>Alaſs!</hi> cry'd ſhe, <hi>my Deareſt, I am the moſt unfortun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate of all living Creatures. Nothing but Death can expiate a crime which I have committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my own ſelf; Vertue ſtrongly oppoſes my Inclinations; but Alaſs! I am in Love, to my eternal Confuſion, with the moſt dangerous of all Men, who from the firſt Moment, I ſaw him, has over-rul'd my Reaſon. I have reſiſted this Paſſion with all my Strength, endeavouring to ſtifle it in its Birth, but this too tender, too Paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Heart, has at laſt been forc'd to yield to its Conquerour. I am now no longer Miſtreſs of it; he triumphs over it in ſpite of all my reſiſtance. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> reply'd <hi>Medina,</hi> (ſhe being a Lady of a very ſubtil Wit) <hi>Who is that happy Mortal, that has ſuch powerful Charms? What is become of that graceful haughtineſs which never left you till this time? Oh!</hi> reply'd the Marchioneſs Sighing, <hi>I do not know my ſelf my Deareſt, there is ſomething fatal in the matter, I am conſtrain'd to ſubmit to the preſent influences of my Stars. Madam,</hi> reply'd the young Lady, <hi>take cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, I don't believe that Love is ſo dangerous
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109100:18"/>
and terrible as you deſcribe it. If Love be a crime, it is one of the moſt Innocent, and very few Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are exempted from it. Who can without injuſtice condemn a Paſſion taught us by Nature it ſelf? Eſpecially ſince we our ſelves are not the cauſe of thoſe Effects which ſhe produces; it is ſhe her ſelf who is the Cauſe of that Sin, which appears ſo hanious in your Sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He whom I love reply'd <hi>Donna Olympiae</hi> briskly, is rather the cauſe of it. My Paſſion has quite overcome my Reaſon.</q> Oh! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam reply'd <hi>Medina</hi> with a Smile, <q>this is the way to ſpoil all the pleaſures of Love; but pray tell me who is this happy Man?</q> He is a <hi>Frenchman</hi> my Deareſt, anſwerd the fair <hi>Spaniard</hi> with a bluſh; <q>he is a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman the moſt charming of all Men, who has robb'd me of my Heart, without the leaſt hopes of recovering it, this only way being left me to revenge my ſelf upon him to robb him of his again.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>'Tis very odd, reply'd the young Lady, and pray Madam, what is his Name, it may be I may know him?</q> Well my dear <hi>Medina,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> covering her Face with a veil, <q>ſince you are reſolv'd to make me confeſs the truth to my own Confuſion; know that it is the Marqueſs <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> Colonel of a Regiment of Dragoons, which are quarter'd hereabouts, and have lately ſerv'd in the Siege of <hi>Puicer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da;</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:109100:18"/>
his Courage and Bravery is very well known in theſe Parts. The Marqueſs <hi>de Boufflers</hi> Madam, reply'd <hi>Medina,</hi> as being ſurpris'd, Oh! I know him very well, I have ſeen him often at <hi>Paris,</hi> when I belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Queen's Retinue. And what Queen do you mean, ſay'd <hi>Donna Olympia?</hi>
               </q> (her Head running upon other matters.) How Madam, reply'd <hi>Medina</hi> (who cou'd not forbear laughing) <q>ſure you have not forgot that the <hi>French</hi> King has Marry'd the Siſter of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, the Infanta <hi>Maria Thereſia.</hi> Oh! you are in the right, reply'd the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, embracing her at the ſame time; I had quite forgot it; then you know that fair <hi>Thyrſis</hi> who has charm'd me, and what do you think of him?</q> I Madam, anſwer'd the young Lady very modeſtly, <q>I think him to be a very accompliſh'd Gentleman; but otherwiſe, I take him to be as fickle in his Amours as the reſt of the <hi>French</hi> are, who make it their buſineſs to Court one Beauty after another, to tell 'em of their Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, of their Sighs and Pains, which ſeldom are any where to be found but in their Compliments and <hi>Bilets Douces,</hi> which they are continually ſending to their Miſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes, and thoſe are fooliſh enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they are in Love with 'em. I had not long ago a Letter by me, the moſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109100:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
paſſionate in the World, which this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wrote to the Marchioneſs <hi>de Segnelay,</hi> Lady to one of the Secretaries of State, in which he had ſo lively painted the exceſs of his Paſſion, that one wou'd have believ'd a Man cou'd not live long under ſuch an Agony. He told her, that her Eyes did every day commit a great many Murders, for which ſhe muſt be accountable to God, and that it was Inhuman in her to diſpeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in ſuch a manner the whole Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> Cou'd any thing be more Hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, cou'd any thing be more Nicely contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd, to cajole a Poor Lady, who lov'd him in good earneſt?</q> Alaſs! my Deareſt, ſaid <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> don't draw the Picture of him, <q>who has robb'd me of my Liberty, ſo much to his diſadvantage; if thou wert convinc'd as well as I that 'tis to late for me to reſiſt his power, thou wou'dſt pity me. To be ſhort, I Love him, and 'tis? not in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to avoid it.</q> She had no ſooner ſpoke theſe Words, but ſhe flew out of the Chamber and lockt her ſelf up in her Cloſet, where amidſt a Flood of Tears: Alafs, cry'd ſhe; <q>Cruel Love, thou haſt aſſail'd my Heart at a time when it was leaſt a ware of thy moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Snares. Heaven that knows the ſecrets of my Heart, is my Witneſs that my Paſſion is ſuch that its impoſſible for Female pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to reſiſt it. Am not I the moſt unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:109100:19"/>
of all Women, to wiſh at this very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant for the ſight of him, who is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Enemy of my repoſe: I wou'd fain baniſh theſe Thoughts, which only ſerve to feed my Paſſion, inſtead of checking it, which I am ſenſible wou'd be much more to my Advantage. But good God! How hard it is for a Woman of my Age to take a firm Reſolution upon ſuch a Critical Conjuncture; and how much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult it is to put it in Execution! I can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay thus much, that I wiſh I cou'd do that which I am confident is not in my Power.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Lady having ſpent the greater part of the Day, and the next following Night, the Marſhal found her taken up with theſe Tormenting Fancies. As ſoon as he enter'd the Room, he renew'd his former Courtſhips; aſſuring her, (as he was always accuſtom'd to do) of the violence of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> receiv'd him ſomewhat coldly, and <hi>Monſieur Boufflers</hi> being ſurpris'd at this ſudden change, broke out into theſe Words, <hi>Divine Creature; unto what muſt I attribute this indifferency, which I meet with in you at this time? What crime have I committed that cou'd deſerve this Cruel Treatment from your Hands?</hi> He had no ſooner ſpoke theſe Words, but he fell inſtantly into a Swoon at the Feet of the Marchioneſs, who being
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109100:20"/>
extremely concern'd at this ſight, threw her ſelf upon him, embracing him very Paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately; for ſhe was afraid that as ſoon as he ſhou'd recover himſelf, he wou'd have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to his Sword, againſt his own Life, (as he had ſeveral times threatn'd he wou'd) but not finding his Sword at his ſide, ſhe was exceſſively Tranſported with joy, not doubting but that her Black-moor had taken it from him before he came into her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. In the mean time, ſhe was not ſpareing of her Careſſes nor Kiſſes, in hopes by that means to recover him out of his Swoon, which indeed was only feigned; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he held it out thus, as long as ever he was able, having ſince proteſted to me, that in all his Life-time, he never receiv'd ſo much Satisfaction and Pleaſure, as at that time, when he was thus entangl'd in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of this fair Lady, whoſe Paſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then without diſguiſe, did ſufficiently teſtify that ſhe Lov'd him in good earneſt. He continu'd for ſome Moments in this charming Extaſie, ere the fair <hi>Spaniard</hi> cou'd make him come out of his voluntary Trance, and that not without a Thouſand Amourous Kiſſes, when ſhe begg'd of him to ſit down by her, upon a Turky-work Carpet; where he perceiv'd a flood of Tears trickling down the Cheeks of his fair Miſtreſs: Being now very well recover'd; he began to renew his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109100:20"/>
former Addreſſes, and to give the moſt lively repreſentation of his Sufferings and Pains. <hi>You ſay you Love me,</hi> Madam, added he, looking upon her with a very Paſſionate Eye, <hi>and why will you then deny me that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which I have ſo often Su'd for? If you will not any longer delay to grant me the utmoſt Favour, I here Swear and proteſt to you, that nothing ſhall be able to ſeparate me from you, and that I will not Love any thing beſides you in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe that know the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> to be one of the moſt inconſtant Lovers in the World, who eſteems it the greateſt mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune that can befal a Gentleman, to Love one Object longer than a Month or two at the moſt; will eaſily imagine, that he did ſtrain the Point to the utmoſt, when he made this Oath. <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> on the other ſide, who had not forgot what her Kinſwoman had told her concerning his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy, propos'd a Match between 'em, which exceedingly ſurpris'd him, his Thoughts being very far from Marriage at that time, eſpecially in a Foreign Country. As ſoon as he had recover'd himſelf from this Surpriſe he endeavour'd to conceal his ſentiments, and to appear as gay in his Humour as before. He was not Ignorant, that if a Gentleman does expect the laſt Favour from a fair Lady in <hi>Spain,</hi> he muſt not deny her any thing;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109100:21"/>
wherefore turning the Diſcourſe another way, he promis'd to ſend her ſome of the beſt Pearls and Diamonds, and ſuch other valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things, as he cou'd procure in the City. This Generous offer inſenſibly overcame the rigour of the <hi>Fair Spaniard,</hi> and tho' her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had not at this time mention'd what ſhe moſt wiſh'd for, ſhe imputed it to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reſpect ſhe believ'd he had for her.</p>
            <p>The Marſhal, who is as great a Maſter in the Art of Love as in that of War, did not ceaſe to advance his approaches with vigour, and to lay a formal Siege to that place, which he was reſolv'd to Conquer; it muſt be confeſs'd, the acceſs to it was very difficult; but he beſieg'd it ſo cloſely, and Attck'd it ſo vigourouſly, that at laſt the White Flagg was put up, tho' <hi>Donna Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> for this time deferr'd to ſign the Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. She told him <hi>that ſhe was not as yet ſufficiently prepar'd for a total ſurrender; that ſhe expected to receive the Marks of his Generoſity, as to thoſe Preſents, which he had ſpoke of before; and that in the mean time ſhe wou'd preſent to him a very fine Scarff, which formerly belong'd to her deceas'd Husband, and which was curiouſly Embroyder'd, by her own Hands.</hi> The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal having receiv'd the Preſent, departed very well ſatisfy'd for that time. After he had Din'd, he went into the City, where he bought ſome of the fineſt Amethyſts and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:109100:21"/>
alds that he cou'd meet with, and having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termix'd 'em with ſome Diamonds of good value, ſent 'em a little after, by one of his Dragoons, who preſented 'em together with a <hi>Billet Doux</hi> from his Maſter to <hi>Donna Olympia;</hi> which ſhe having Kiſs'd a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, the Dragoon had much a do to forbear Laughing out, at the Fantaſtick Actions of this amourous Lady. But ſhe having open'd the Letter, found theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Lines:

            <p>The Lady was at firſt reſolv'd to have ſent an Anſwer to the Marſhal's Letter, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering with her ſelf, that Secrets of this nature ought not to be committed to the diſcretion of a private Centinel; ſhe forbore for that time. Not long after, Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to approach, the Marſhal did not fail to meet his <hi>Beloved</hi> at the appointed Hour. He had dreſs'd himſelf that Day as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:109100:22"/>
fine as cou'd be, and the better to pleaſe his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miſtreſs, he wore that ſame Scarff, which he had receiv'd as a preſent from her. The Lady, on the other Hand, had ſtrove to out do him in the Richneſs of her Apparel. Her Suit was all made of Cloath of Silver, trimm'd with a vaſt quantity of Green Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and a very rich Gold-Galloon all after the <hi>French</hi> Mode. Upon her Head ſhe wore green Feathers, which made a great Addition to her Face, which was extremely Beautiful. The Treſses of her fair Hair, which hung down to her bare Neck, whiter than Snow; appear'd the moſt charming in the World.</p>
            <p>The Marſhal at the ſight of her, was ſo overcome by his Paſſion, that he was not able to utter one Word; and ſhe ſeeing him ſo ſilent at a time when ſhe leaſt expected it, cou'd not forbear asking him the Reaſon of it; <hi>Monſieur Boufflers,</hi> anſwer'd with a heavy Sigh, Madam, <hi>Your Charms are the cauſe of my ſilence, they having taken from me the uſe both of my Tongue and my Reaſon. I am not the ſame Man I was, when I firſt ſaw you.</hi> Here the Marchioneſs interrupting, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing him; <hi>For God's ſake,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>My Lord, awake out of this ſlumber; I love you more than my own Life, and if you don't anſwer my Paſſion, I aſſure you that I ſhall not live any longer than your ſelf: ſo that if your Words be true, we ſhall be the Occaſion of one anothers
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:109100:23"/>
Death. Oh! my moſt adorable Deity,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal, <hi>fixing his lips upon her's, let us dye for one Moment both together. For God's ſake, Sir,</hi> anſwer'd ſhe very charmingly, <hi>don't put things ſo far, I am but too much afraid of that Death you ſpeak of, which often proves the ſpring of whole Rivulets of Tears. What fear is it</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Marſhal, all upon a ſudden, <hi>that has ſeis'd you, don't you look upon me as a Man of Honour? I aſſure you that I wou'd rather dye a thouſand times if it were poſſible, than be in the leaſt guilty of any Crime towards my ador'd Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.</hi> 
               <q>Oh Heavens!</q> cry'd ſhe, <q>can you ask, Sir What I fear? I fear your fickle Humour, your inconſtancy, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be an Hereditary Evil, incident to Gentlemen of your Nation, who think it a Crime to love any Woman long; Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs and Inconſtancy being their chief Delight.</q> And Madam, reply'd the Marſhal briskly <q>certainly you ſpeak by your own experience, that you can talk with ſo much aſſurance concerning their Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy;</q> No Sir, anſwer'd <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> as briskly as he; <q>I never was ſo unfortun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate as to fall under their clutches till now you being the firſt, who has made me ſenſible of Love.</q> The Marſhal perceiving with what Reſolution this Lady held out againſt all his Attacks, and being reſolv'd to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:109100:23"/>
bring the matter to a concluſion, told her with a great deal of ſeeming indifferency <q>Madam I wou'd adviſe you to break off with me, whilſt occaſion ſerves; to tell the Truth, the <hi>French</hi> are great Deſſemblers, and eſpecially the Officers, who ſeldom make a farther account than for one Day, leaving all the reſt to Chance and Fortune: Nevertheleſs I hope you'll not deny but that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are not behind hand with the <hi>French,</hi> as to the Point of Inconſtancy in Love. And to ſpeak ſincerely, that Variety which is ſo delightful in Love, is agreeable to all Men without exception. As to my part, I will not be ſo Preſumptuous as to be anſwerable for my own Heart, 'tis your part to preſerve it by the Force of your Charms. If by Chance, Time (which unties the hardeſt Knots, and breaks the ſtrongeſt Chains) ſhou'd make me ſhake off your Fetters; impute it to your own want of Strength and Deſerts, which were not ſufficient to keep me long under your Obedience; This indeed is a Suppoſition, which perhaps will never come to paſs, and you may well tell me, that I am not very Complaiſant at this time; but to confeſs the Truth, I will rather chuſe to ſhewleſs Complaiſance, and more Sincerity, than to be accounted a Diſſembler and a Perfidious Wretch: Theſe being the Titles
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:109100:24"/>
which your Sex uſually beſtow upon us, when for want of their own merit, they are no longer able to keep their Lovers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Subjection.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis impoſſible to find words ſuitable to the Surpriſe, which this Harangue of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal caus'd in <hi>Donna Olympia;</hi> ſhe took it ſo hainouſly, that immediately without ſpeaking one Word, ſhe flew out of the Chamber into another. The Marſhal ſeeing himſelf thus left alone, was juſt ready to leave the Chamber, when eſpying the Picture of his lovely <hi>Spaniard</hi> lying upon the Table, he cou'd not forbear to take it up, and to put it in his Pocket. He was no ſooner return|'d to his own Lodgings, and having order'd Candles to be brought up, but he began to look very earneſtly upon the Picture; which was the fineſt drawn that ever was ſeen, the Marchioneſs being painted in the Habit and Poſture of <hi>Diana,</hi> with a Quiver hanging over her Shoulders, and a Bow in her Hand. The Marſhal finding this Picture ſo lovely, <hi>What new Charm, do I diſcover,</hi> ſaid he to himſelf, <hi>now I begin to repent of thoſe Words, which the refuſal of her laſt Favour made me utter.</hi> He reproach'd himſelf thus for a long time; and ſo tormented himſelf both that Night and the next Day, that his grief ſeem'd to be pas'ſt Remedy. At laſt after a Thouſand Reflections, which diſtracted his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:109100:24"/>
Mind, he reſolv'd to go and renew his Viſits to the Marchioneſs, at the accuſtom'd time. <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> in the the mean while, who had not left the Marſhal, without a great conſtraint, was altogether over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd with Grief and Tears. <hi>Medina</hi> her dear Confident, found her in this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; and ſhe happen'd to come in, very Opportunely, for <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> was juſt ready to Kill her ſelf with the Marſhal's Sword, which he had left with the Moor, who had given it to his Lady as ſomewhat very precious, belonging to the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers;</hi> whereas it wou'd have prov'd fatal to this Poor Lady, if her Kinſwoman had not ſtopt her Hands, crying out to her, <hi>For God's ſake what are you going about to do? Conſider that you are a Chriſtian, and that you muſt be anſwerable for a Soul which you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, from Almighty God. What is it that cou'd put you upon ſuch a deſperate Reſolution? Can the ill uſage of a Lover be a Motive ſtrong enough to incite you to Murder your ſelf? Oh! con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and dread God's Juſtice, which never lets Crimes of this nature go unpuniſh'd. Donna Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> was not able to ſpeak one Word in anſwer to <hi>Medina,</hi> but all her ſtrength ſailing her, ſhe fell into a Swoon at the Feet of her Kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. This young Lady having lifted her up, and lay'd her upon a Couch; by the help of ſome ſtrong Waters, which ſhe held to her
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109100:25"/>
Noſe, brought her to her ſelf again. <hi>My Deareſt Coſin,</hi> ſaid ſhe, tenderly embracing her, <hi>what was it that cou'd induce you to take this raſh Reſolution of Deſtroying your ſelf? Alaſs! my Deareſt,</hi> reply'd the Marchioneſs, in a languiſhing Tone, <hi>What wou'd you have me tell you? That ungrateful Man, of whom I have ſpoke to you, has already made me feel the effects of his Inconſtancy; This Perfidious Creature has abandon'd me before he has enjoy'd the ſweet Fruits of our Love. Oh! you only ſpoke too true</hi> Medina, <hi>when you told me, that the</hi> French <hi>were Fickle and Capricious in Love. I am only too ſenſible that I ought to fly from him, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; my Paſſion forces me to ſet aſide all other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, which wou'd baniſh me from his Sight.</hi> Medina was about to make Anſwer, when <hi>Don Bilboano</hi> the Marchioneſs's Brother, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard the out-cryes of the Women in her Chamber, when ſhe Swoon'd away en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tr'd the Room with his Sword ready drawn. <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> having a quick Wit, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately hid the Marſhal's Sword under her Bed, to take away all manner of Suſpicion from her Brother, whom ſhe knew to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt mad with Jealouſie. She gave him to underſtand how all upon a ſudden ſhe felt her ſelf ſo ill, that ſhe Swoon'd away, but that thanks to Heaven, ſhe was now very well recover'd. <hi>Don Bilboano</hi> told his Siſter that he was overjoy'd to ſee her ſo well, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:109100:25"/>
having Careſs'd her in a more Paſſionate manner, than became a Brother, he left the Room. Night now began to approach, and our Lady, who was very impatient to ſee her Lover again, made her Black-Moor ſtand Centry at the ſame door, thro' which the Marſhal was wont to be conducted into her Appartment; having deſir'd <hi>Medina</hi> to ſtay with her, till ſuch time that he ſhou'd come in, whom ſhe expected with ſo much Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Our General did not fail to be there at the accuſtom'd Hour; but under the diſguiſe of a Dragoon, for fear of being taken too much notice of, if he always appear'd as an Officer. He preſented his Sword to the Moor, who refus'd to take it, not knowing him in this Diſguiſe. The Marſhal having convinc'd the Moor by putting ſome <hi>Lovis</hi>'s <hi>d'or</hi> into his Hand, that it was himſelf; he by that means ſav'd his Life, which he had elſe put in jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy for his Miſtreſs's ſake. Having enter'd his Miſtreſs's Chamber, he threw himſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately at her Feet, begging of her to pardon all what he had told her, proteſting <hi>that he was very ſenſible of his Fault, and that if ſhe thought fit, he wou'd expiate it, by making himſelf a Sacrifice at her Feet:</hi> He expreſs'd theſe words to naturally, and with an Air ſo engaging, that the Marchioneſs's anger was wholly appeas'd; ſhe reproachi'd him with his Inconſtancy and want of Love; She
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:109100:26"/>
call'd him Capricious fickle and Inconſtant <hi>Frenchman;</hi> and added many other Taunts, which ſhe imagin'd might affect him moſt ſenſibly. The Marſhal bore every thing, not with the patience of a Dragoon (for this is a quality not peculiar to 'em;) but like <hi>Job,</hi> for he did not ſo much as utter one word in anſwer to her Reproaches; On the contrary, to make ſome amends for his Fault, he did nothing but kiſs, ſometimes her Hand, and ſometimes the Hemm of her Garment; ſhe being that day Dreſs'd all in Black; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cuſtom in <hi>Spain,</hi> if a Lady looſes her Gallant, or believes ſhe has loſt him, to dreſs herſelf in Mourning Cloaths: 'Twas for this ſame reaſon that <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> had put her ſelf in Mourning, imagining that ſhe ſhou'd never ſee the Marſhal again; who was as yet reſolv'd not to quit her ſo, before he was come a little nearer to the Point. Conformably to this Reſolution, he preſs'd her very hard, not to let him ſuffer any longer, adding, that the Pains which ſhe made him endure, were beyond Expreſſion, nay, that they cou'd not be imagin'd by any Perſon but one who lov'd ſo Paſſionately as himſelf. <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> ſeeing what pains the Marſhal took to repreſent to her, his Love, cou'd not forbear laughing at it, when the Marſhal with a Smile told her, <hi>Madam,</hi> 
               <q>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you are very Cruel, thus to divert your
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:109100:26"/>
ſelf at the expence of your unfortunate Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, whom you make to languiſh at your Feet, without ſhewing the leaſt Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to 'em; when you go to Confeſſion I hope you'll not forget to tell your Father Confeſſor among other Sins, how you make it your diverſion to cauſe Mankind to dye a languiſhing Death, and how many Murders have been committed by thoſe fair Eyes.</q> I don't know <hi>Sir,</hi> reply'd the Marchioneſs, laughing outright, <q>I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver took any account of their number.</q> But continu'd ſhe, looking upon the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, who feign'd himſelf Ill, <q>Pray tell me whether you are Sick in good earneſt; Pray let me feel your Pulſe, truly it beats very quick.</q> Alaſs! my deareſt Creature, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> embracing her <q>how ſhou'd it be poſſible to be ſo near ſo lovely and charming an Object as you are, without the greateſt emotion of all my Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirits; certainly if you don't ſoon take pity of me, I cannot live much longer,</q> Oh Heavens! reply'd the Lady, keeping him at a little diſtance; <q>how you put me into a fright, in this habit of a Dragoon. How cou'd it enter your Thoughts, thus to diſguiſe your ſelf, that I am not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the ſight of it.</q> Madam anſwer'd the Marqueſs, <q>you know the Reaſon why I did it, 'twas becauſe I ſhall not be ſo much
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:109100:27"/>
obſerv'd, as if I ſhou'd appear every day in the ſame Equipage. Beſides this diſguiſe may prove very convenient upon another account; for I wou'd not for all the World that our Generals ſhou'd get the leaſt notice of our amourous Intreague. I am the greateſt admirer of ſecreſie that can be, but eſpecially in Love-concerns, where even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matters of the leaſt moment ought to be kept ſecret.</q> Here the fair <hi>Spaniard</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him, <q>then pray Sir, ſaid ſhe, give me leave to dreſs you in Womens Apparel; thus we ſhall have the conveniency of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying one another with more freedom. O Lord! Madam, reply'd he, don't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive a thing which cannot but be very much to my diſadvantage; I am ſo hard favour'd that in a Womans Head-dreſs I ſhall be only fit to frighten Children.</q> Let me for this time paſs as I am, and I <q>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you that I will return to morrow in another Equipage, which ſhall have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing terrible in it. In the mean while let us not looſe the enjoyment of a happy Minute.</q> 
               <q>To Morrow, to Morrow cry'd ſhe, Mr. Dragoon.</q> Oh! Madam, reply'd the Marſhal, <q>it is not without great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that I can deferr it till then. The Heat and vigour of Love ſlackens by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays; the Cannon is ready mounted, let us make a breach in the Walls, and enter
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:109100:27"/>
with our Swords drawn.</q> 
               <hi>Sir,</hi> reply'd the Lady, <q>the Duke <hi>de Navaille</hi> at the head of the <hi>French</hi> King's Army, cou'd have ſaid no more. If terms of War are the ſame with thoſe of Love, I don't as yet underſtand the Language, therefore I hope you'll give me ſome time to learn 'em.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It was not without very weighty Reaſons that the Marſhal was ſo eager, to come to the Concluſion of the whole Story; for he had but a little time to ſtay at <hi>Puicerda,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing receiv'd Orders to March towards the <hi>Rhine</hi> Where: The Counts of <hi>Schomberg</hi> and <hi>Choiſeul,</hi> and the Marſhal <hi>de Crequi;</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n'd to Beſiege <hi>Rheinsfeld,</hi> a Place Situated in a Plain. Theſe conſiderations caus'd no ſmall commotions in his Mind: Which was divided between the glory of Arms and the delights of Love. But at the preſent, being oblig'd by his Miſtreſses command, to retire, he did it with ſo much indifferency, that he not ſo much as afforded her one part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kiſs, which ſhe earneſtly wiſh'd for, as I have underſtood ſince. Being return'd to his Lodgings, he took a Reſolution not to viſit her in two or three days, in hopes that by this device he ſhou'd bring her over the ſooner, to grant his Requeſt. During the time of his abſence, he employ'd all his Wits in finding out ſomething or another, which might oblige her to cry for fair Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109100:28"/>
and at laſt he obtain'd his aim, as will appear from the ſequel of the Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Having conſider'd with himſelf that all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lady's are extremely taken with the vanity of rich Cloaths, tho' they themſelves are not very extravagant that way. He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd a Suit to be made, the richeſt that cou'd be contriv'd; it was trimm'd with Amarant and Gold Colour'd Ribbands (this being the favourite Colour of his Miſtreſs) his Waſte-coat was of the ſame Colour, fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embroider'd by a certain <hi>Mooreſs,</hi> who was very famous for that ſort of Work in thoſe Parts. He wore a green Feather in his Hat; his Legs being extraordinarily well ſhap'd, he put on that day a pair of black Silk Stockings, and a pair of very ſmall neat Shoe's, lin'd with Crimſon-Velvet, which was at that time the Mode at <hi>Puicerda.</hi> Whilſt he was dreſſing himſelf, he ſaid to his <hi>Valet du Chambre,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Champonniere,</hi> and who knew the whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, <hi>See what a Man is fain to do for a Miſtreſs, wou'dſt thou doe the ſame for thine? O Yes,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>If I thought ſhe deſerv'd it. Thou art in the right on't,</hi> ſaid <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers, he that will pleaſe the Women muſt take care to appear in a very fine Equipage.</hi> When he was dreſs'd, he thought it an Age ere the appointed Hour was come, which was ten a Clock at Night. He walk'd haſtily up and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:109100:28"/>
down his Chamber, being in a continual Study concerning his amourous Adventure. At laſt the wiſh'd for Hour drew near, when with all the ſpeed imaginable he haſtn'd to his Miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Medina</hi> by order from <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him into a certain Appartment, where he had never been before. This Room being adorn'd with very rich Tapeſtry, great Cryſtallin Looking Glaſſes, and good ſtore of Wax-tapers; ſo that any Perſons might view themſelves all over from Head to Foot. The Marſhal being for ſome time entertain'd by <hi>Medina,</hi> whom he did not know, tho' he had ſeen her before at <hi>Paris;</hi> look'd upon the Tapeſtry-work with a very diſcerning Eye, asking her ſeveral times the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of divers Figures which he ſaw, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, concerning that of a certain Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, repreſented there with a naked Sword which ſhe was about to deliver to her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, for him to Sheath it in her Breaſt <hi>What extravagancy is this,</hi> cry'd the Marſhal, <hi>Cou'd any thing be ſo barbarous, as to run a Sword in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Breaſt, of ſo lovely a Woman? Oh! Sir,</hi> reply'd the young Lady, <hi>If you were acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the whole Adventure, it wou'd not ſeem ſo ſtrange to you. This unfaithful Lady having at ſeveral times prov'd Treacherous in her Love; and being one day all overcome with ſhame and Confuſion, when he reproach'd her with
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:109100:29"/>
her perfidiouſneſs, at laſt ſnatch'd his Sword from his ſide, which ſhe preſented to him, begging of him to ſheath it in her Breaſt, to expiate her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer inconſtancy. But the Prince who deteſted ſo Villainous an Act, wou'd by no means comply with her demands. This is ſomewhat ſurpriſing to me Madam,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal, <hi>I cou'd ſcarce have believ'd that a Woman cou'd be ſo Treacherous to her Lover.</hi> He wou'd have continu'd his Diſcourſe, if he had not been interrupted by the coming in of <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> who appear'd to him as fair as an Angel. She had dreſs'd her ſelf, that day ſo advantageouſly, that ſhe quite amaz'd the Marſhal by her charms; he for ſome time not being able to doe any thing but to gaze upon her. Certain Treſſes of Hair which hung down to her Neck, were no ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to her charming Beauty. Her Gown and Petty-coat were of an Amarant and blew Colour, and her Girdle all cover'd with Diamonds of great value. Monſieur <hi>de Boufflers</hi> being at that inſtant more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd than ever, told her very tenderly <hi>that at this moment ſhe had quite ſubdu'd his Heart; and that ſhe appear'd to him ſo charming, that he cou'd not look upon her otherwiſe than his adorable Deity. Sir,</hi> reply'd ſhe; <hi>you are pleas'd to make ſport with me, 'tis you that appear more bright than a Star, and more charming than ever</hi> Adonis <hi>was. You have this day taken par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:109100:29"/>
care to ſet your ſelf off to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; 'tis poſſible you have ſome great deſign in hand. Yes Madam,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal, kiſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Snow white Hand, <hi>my deſign is to pleaſe you, and effectually to make you ſenſible of my Paſſion, all naked as it is. Oh! no Sir,</hi> ſaid the Lady, <hi>'tis poſſible you may frighten me, you had better cover it with ſomewhat or another. Medina</hi> who was unwilling to diſturb theſe two Lovers, retir'd out of reſpect to her Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman. The Marſhal being now left in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany only with his Miſtreſs, did ſo lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the vehemency of his Paſſion, in Terms ſo affectionate and obliging, confirm'd by a thouſand Oaths and Imprecations, that he wou'd Love her as long as he liv'd; that at laſt the fair <hi>Spaniard</hi> was vanquiſh'd, and having ask'd him with a very tender and Paſſionate Air; <hi>Will you never ceaſe to Love me? Will you never forſake me?</hi> She ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Place which had held out ſo long againſt the Marſhal's moſt vigourous Attacks. The Marſhal had no ſooner taken poſſeſſion of this ſtrong Hold, but he repented of the Bargain; having found her nothing near ſo amiable as he had imagin'd before.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lady's are generally Subject to a great Infirmity; for as ſoon as they have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſs'd the Age of Eighteen or Twenty Years, they are ſeiz'd with a continual Flux, which is not fit to be touch'd nor ſo much as nam'd,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:109100:30"/>
and the worſt is, that no Remedy can be found againſt it: This was more than ſufficient to put our General out of conceit with his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; he being the Niceſt Man in the World, as to Women. Indeed he was ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may'd at this Bloody Encounter, that he cou'd ſcarce conceal his diſpleaſure. The Lady was for having him renew the amourous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, but he excus'd himſelf as well as he cou'd, telling her that on a ſudden he was ſeis'd with a moſt violent Head-Ach: The Lady was therefore oblig'd to expect the ſecond Rencounter the next time; which is as yet to come, for he never came near her ſince that Day. He was nevertheleſs ſo generous, as to make her a Preſent of ſome Jewels, which he had brought along with him for that purpoſe, as a reward of that Favour, which he had receiv'd from this fair <hi>Spaniard. Donna Olympia</hi> with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reverence Kiſs'd her own Hands; which according to the Cuſtom of that Country, is as much as to ſay, I accept the Preſent: Nay ſhe appear'd extremely well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd at firſt with it, looking upon it as a Pledge of her Lover's Paſſion; but ſhe was moſt groſly miſtaken in her aim, for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal's Pasſſion was grown ſo cool by this time, that he wiſh'd himſelf at a great diſtance from the Place where he was. <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> in the mean while began to be more and more
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:109100:30"/>
ſenſible of the indifferency of her Lover, which made her break out into theſe Words: <hi>Did not I tell you before,</hi> Sir, <hi>that as ſoon as you had obtain'd what you ſo Paſſionately wiſh'd for, you wou'd not continue to Love me with the ſame Ardour as before; all Men uſually looſe a great part of their eager Deſires, as ſoon as they have taſted the pureſt and moſt delicious Pleaſures of Love. Oh! how much are you chang'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, what is become of that Paſſion, which the Univerſe was not able to contain? What is become of all your moſt ſincere Proteſtaions; what of all your Paſſionate Expreſſions?</hi> The Marſhal, who began to be afraid that the Lady might play him ſome ſcurvy trick or another, or perhaps cauſe him to be Poiniarded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cou'd get out of the Houſe, was fain to ſet on the beſt countenance he cou'd; and to Careſs her with a thouſand fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, of which he did not intend to keep the leaſt. By this Artifice he at laſt got clear of his Miſtreſs, having firſt made a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Promiſe to viſit her as often as ſhe ſhou'd think convenient. Promiſes, made in the Air, without the leaſt Proſpect of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment, except he had lik'd the Game better than he did; but what wou'd not a Man ſay to a Woman, when ſhe has loſt her charms, and is become Burdenſome? The Marſhal being return'd to his Lodgings, had now all his Thoughts employ'd how to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109100:31"/>
Decamp with privacy from <hi>Puicerda,</hi> which he now began to nauſeate as much as he had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admir'd it before. <hi>Have not</hi> I <hi>done very fine<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly,</hi> ſai'd he to himſelf, <hi>to have ſpent ſo much time i'dly in an Amourous Adventure, which was not worth the pains I took in looking after it? Madam</hi> Olympia, <hi>'twas not in your power to retain me long in your Service; I was very much miſtaken in your Charms. You are not engaging enough for a Man of my Humour, who hates to Swim in—But away with it, let us not think of it any more, for I begin to be Heart-ſick.</hi> Then calling his <hi>Valet du Chambre, Champon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>hadſt thou ever a</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs? Pray tell me your Adventures.</hi> The Marſhal's Gentleman finding his Maſter in a Humour to divert himſelf with him, ſome part of the Night, burſt out into laughter; having ſoon perceiv'd, how he had been treated by this <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lady. <hi>How now, Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal!</hi> ſaid the General, <hi>is this your way, to laugh at me as faſt as you can? Oh! Sir,</hi> reply'd the Servant laughing as heartily as he did before; <hi>You have order'd me to make a recital of my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourous Adventures, and when I reflect upon ſome paſſages of 'em, 'tis impoſſible for me to forbear laughing.</hi> If thy Miſtreſs were a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> ſaid Monſieur <hi>de Boufflers, without queſtion ſhe gave thee great ſatisfaction. Yes Sir,</hi> anſwer'd his Genteleman, <hi>I have had a touch with moſt Nations How,</hi> ſaid the Marſhal; <hi>then
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:109100:31"/>
thou haſt dipt thy Sword in that Current of the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Women. What doſt thou think of theſe running Rivulets? Truly Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I don't know what to ſay of 'em, but that they are not very Savoury. Thou art in the right on't,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the General, <hi>Let us have no more of 'em, or elſe I ſhall Spew my Heart out. Go bring me up ſome Wine, to recruit my Spirits, or elſe I ſhall Swoon in good Earneſt.</hi> The Gentleman thought that his Maſter had only been in jeſt, but he was extremely ſurpris'd when he ſaw him inſtantly fall from his Chair upon the Ground. Being in a great Conſternation, he call'd up the Land-lady, who having waſh'd his Face very well with fair Water, ſoon brought him to himſelf again, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caus'd him to be laid in his Bed he reſted pretty well for the remainder of the Night.</p>
            <p>Some days after, Monſieur <hi>Boufflers</hi> quitted <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and march'd with the <hi>French</hi> Army towards the <hi>Rhine,</hi> where he ſignalis'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſeveral advantageous Rencounters with the Imperialiſts. The two Marſhals <hi>de Crequi</hi> and <hi>de Navaille</hi> purſu'd their Victories againſt the Imperial Forces, having defeated a conſiderable Party of their Dragoons; and the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> gave great Proofs of his Valour in this Engagement, which was follow'd by the ſurrender of the Caſtle of <hi>Dortamburg</hi> and that of Fort <hi>Kell.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt theſe Martial Exploits, the Marſhal <hi>de
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:109100:32"/>
Boufflers</hi> did not lay aſide his tender inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the fair Sex, being as ſoon as he was a little at leaſure, as indefatigable in his amourous Engagements, as he had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his Warlike Enterprizes; as it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the ſequel of our Story: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we proceed, let us return to the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> who being quite ras'd out of his Memory, ſhew'd all the marks of a deſpairing Perſon, in tearing off her Hair, and committing all ſorts of Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies, without ſuffering any one ſo much as to Speak to her of Conſolation. <hi>Medina</hi> endeavour'd to perſwade her, that it was the common chance of Women in Love to be forgot and Slighted by their Gallants. But all in vain; for ſhe continually Exclaim'd againſt her ill Fortune, calling him at the ſame Moment ungrateful and perjur'd Wretch. <hi>Where art thou now,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>with all thy Oaths and deceitful Promiſes? Oh good Heavens! can you ſuffer that ſuch a Monſter as this, ſhou'd walk upon the Face of the Earth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having violated all that is Sacred to me? What ill Fate did over rule my Inclinations, when I granted him that, which ought to have been more dear to me than my own Life. This incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, Perfidious Wretch triumphs over my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Ah! I am reſolv'd to Travel all over the World in queſt of him, on purpoſe to reproach him with his infidelity, and if he refuſe to hearken to

my juſt Complaints, I will,</hi> ſaid ſhe, (taking up a Dagger which lay upon the Table) <hi>Stabb him to the Heart. Yes,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I don't doubt but this Arm of mine ſhall have ſtrength enough to diſpatch this faithleſs Wretch, who ought not to live any longer, ſince he has deceiv'd me.</hi> She had no ſooner ſpoke theſe Words, and being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether animated with Revenge, but ſhe begg'd of <hi>Medina</hi> to be her Companion in this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, ſaying that they wou'd both diſguiſe themſelves in Mens Habit, and find out the Marſhal in whatever part of the World he might be. But her Kinſwoman, who was more prudent in weighing the matter, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly rejected her Propoſal, as being ſo little agreeable to their Sex, repreſenting to her all the dangers, which muſt be the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Conſequences of ſuch an attempt, to Women of their Quality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Will you Madam,</hi> ſaid ſhe, very wittily <hi>act the Heroine Muſqueteer, will you be ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to imitate your Romantick Heroes, what gainer will you be by all this? But to make your ſelf a Laughing Stock to the World. Let your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Lover enjoy his own Peace, 'tis poſſible his Conſcience does already ſufficiently accuſe him of his Treachery. Your</hi> French <hi>Gentlemen, as I have often told you, ſeldom do otherwiſe than he has done; and I pitty thoſe poor Women who are ſo unfortunate as to believe 'em. Endeavour therefore to compoſe your Mind; that is the only
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:109100:33"/>
way left you to be even with him, for I don't que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion that but he is vain enough to believe that you are extremely concern'd at his Abſence: But if I were in your caſe, he ſhou'd never boaſt of that ſatisfaction. Oh! my Deareſt,</hi> reply'd <hi>Donna Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> all in Tears, <hi>he has now very little regard to me; yet he has gain'd what he aim'd at, and 'tis that which almoſt put's me into Deſpair. I ſhall never ſee again that Conquerour, who has triumph'd over my weakneſs in ſpite of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance I was able to make; I was too too ſoon overcome by his flattering Promiſes. Good Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens! you that know my diſgrace, Revenge me upon this perfidious Man. Madam,</hi> reply'd <hi>Medina, if I ſhou'd tell you, that theſe things ought to have been conſider'd before you entertain'd the Marſhal ſo far, I ſhall perhaps looſe ſome part of the advantage of comforting you, wherefore I think the beſt Office I can do you at this time, is to deſire you to take comfort, to forget what is paſs'd, and to be more Circumſpect for the future. Donna Olympia</hi> ſo well approv'd the Advice given her by her Kinſwoman, that ſome time after, as we have been ſince inform'd, ſhe threw her ſelf into a <hi>Nunnery</hi> of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Converts, where ſhe ſpends the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of her Life-time in doing of Penance; eating of nothing but wild Roots, and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but fair Water, in Atonement of her former ſenſual Pleaſures: And <hi>Medina</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd her Example, to mortifie herſelf, for
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:109100:33"/>
ſome former Love-Intreagues in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> Thus we are come to the concluſion of the Hiſtory of our two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lady's.</p>
            <p>'Tis now time to return to our Marſhal, who has not been Idle in <hi>Germany;</hi> having already found out a new Miſtreſs, whoſe Charms have render'd him her Captive. Here you muſt not imagine that 'twas a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of that Country, who was ſo dexterous in engaging his Heart: no, they are very rarely ſo ingenious at Love-Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues in thoſe Parts, being ſomewhat unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſuch languiſhing deſires, which are the conſtant attendants of Lovers. The Beauty which Captivated him, was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlewoman, whom chance had brought to the ſame Inn where he Lodg'd. This Lady whom we will call my Lady <hi>Stone,</hi> was the Wife of a certain <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentleman, who being accus'd of High-Treaſon, was forc'd to quit <hi>England,</hi> and finding no redreſs in his Affairs, had ſought for a Sanctuary in <hi>Germany,</hi> as his Wife was inform'd; who had undertaken this Journey, in hopes to find him out there; but not having got any farther Information concerning him, notwithſtanding her utmoſt endeavours, was extremely uneaſie in the Inn where ſhe Lodg'd, for fear that ſhe ſhou'd not be able to learn any news relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her ungrateful Husband, who had
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:109100:34"/>
left her without giving her the leaſt notice, ſince his departure, of the place of his Abode. The Marſhal, who was inform'd before hand of her Circumſtances, ſhew'd her all the reſpect due to a Lady of her Quality and Merits, who labour'd under great afflictions. It will not be a-miſs here to give you a Character of this <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lady. She was moſt delicately ſhap'd, very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and affable in all her Behaviour. Her Hair was Black, her Complexion very fair, and her Skin very ſmooth; her Eyes very bright and ſparkling; ſhe had the prettieſt Mouth in the World, and ſhe laugh'd moſt charmingly: As for her Teeth, they were none of the beſt; this being a general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect among the Lady's of this Country, who commonly ſpoil 'em with eating Sweet-meats too plentifully. She had beſides thisa, certain Majeſtick Air, which was ſurpriſing at firſt ſight, tho' ſhe was extremely Obliging and Courteous in Converſation. Her Neck and Hands were very fair and plump, and to comprehend all in a few words, ſhe appear'd ſo adoreable to our Marſhal, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſtrongly enamour'd with her Beauty. The firſt Proof he gave her of his Love, was one Morning, when he found her all in deſpair in her Chamber; ſhe had torn her Hair, and was juſt ready to make a way with her ſelf. If in any other Country
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:109100:34"/>
but <hi>England</hi> a Woman ſhou'd commit theſe extravagancies, ſhe wou'd be thought only fit for a Mad-Houſe. But it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd that in no other place in the World theſe violent attempts are ſo frequently put in Execution as there. I don't know what hard ſentiments they have concerning themſelves, but this is certain, that for a ſmall diſappointment, 'tis often known that they Hang, Poyſon, or Piſtol themſelves without any ſenſe of thir crime. Our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral being touch'd as much with compaſſion as with Love, threw himſelf ather Feet, entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to tell him the truecauſeof that afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which had inſpir'd her with ſo deſperate a Reſolution, the mark's of which plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in her Countenance. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lady being ſomewhat of a haughty temper, cou'd at firſt ſcarce reſolve to diſcover the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of her Affairs to Monſieur <hi>de Bouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fflers,</hi> looking upon it as a thing very unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming herſelf, and as ſomewhat which cou'd not but moſt ſenſibly affect her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: Nevertheleſs, conſidering with her ſelf in what a generous and obliging manner ſhe was treated by the Marſhal, ſhe at laſt determin'd to make an ingenuous Confeſſion in theſe Words: <hi>Is it poſſible,</hi> Sir, <hi>that my ill Fortune ſhou'd drive me to this point of Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, in which you ſee me at preſent: My Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who ſcarce deſerves that name, having
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:109100:35"/>
left me without Mony, and without any proſpect of receiving aſſiſtance from any Perſon? I have been for ſome time in this Inn, with my</hi> Valet du Chambre, <hi>and my waiting Woman; and beſides other Neceſſaries requiſite for a Perſon of my Quality; I have not wherewithal to ſatisfy my Hoſt, whom I cannot expect to entertain me</hi> Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, <hi>I am quite beyond all Patience, to ſee my ſelf reduc'd to this extremity, by the neglect of an ill Husband, who</hi>—She cou'd not proceed, the Tears which trickl'd down her Beautiful Cheeks, having quite ſtopt her Speech. The Marſhal was ſo touch'd with compaſſion, that immediately he offer'd her his Purſe, deſiring her to make uſe of it, as if it were her own; and to ſhew her that his Words were not bare Compliments, as 'tis the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cuſtom of a great many, but that his Offers were real, he went immediately down to the Hoſt, whom he ask'd how much that <hi>Engliſh Lady</hi> who with her Servants Lodg'd in his Houſe, was indebted to him. The Inn-holder having brought him her Bill, he immediately pay'd him what he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; telling him, that he had receiv'd Orders from her Husband Mr. <hi>Stone,</hi> to pay him his Mony, and to engage his Word for what ever ſhe ſhou'd have occaſion for in his Houſe, for the future. In a few Moments after, Monſieur <hi>de Boufflers</hi> ſent to his new Miſtreſs a Purſe full of <hi>Lovis's d'or,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broider'd
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:109100:35"/>
with fine Pearls on both ſides, and trimm'd with Ribonds of all ſorts of Colours, to ſupply her ſelf with ſuch little Neceſſaries as ſhe might have occaſion for at that time. The Marſhal diſcovering in this fair Lady every day new charms, was extremely glad of this Opportunity, hoping that his Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality wou'd be repaid him in another Coin, that is to ſay, by his Miſtreſſes Favours. <hi>Is it poſsible,</hi> ſaid he to himſelf, <hi>that any Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band can be ſo unworthy, thus to abandon a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her merit, and who is ſo Charming and Amiable in outward appearance? Truly I don't know what may be in the bottom of this matter, which perhaps is paſt my finding out; if ſhe ſhou'd perhaps,</hi> continu'd he with a Smile, <hi>have ſome reſemblance to my</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Miſtreſs, what a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment wou'd that be? but let it be as it will, I don't repent of having given her ſome aſsiſtance, at a time when ſhe was juſt at the point of Deſpair; I have at leaſt done a work of Charity, if her Charms ſhou'd not prove anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werable to my expectation.</hi> If Monſieur <hi>de Boufflers</hi> was thus employ'd in reaſoning with himſelf, my Lady <hi>Stone</hi> did make no leſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon the Liberality, which ſhe had receiv'd from an Officer, whom ſhe did not know, before ſhe had ſeen him in the ſame Place where ſhe Lodg'd. <hi>Oh!</hi> cry'd ſhe, being all alone in her Chamber. <hi>I inſenſibly engage my ſelf to I know not whom: Perhaps this Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:109100:36"/>
will ſcarce be contented with a bare Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement; he appears to me ſo Paſſionate, that I have all the reaſon to believe he aims at no leſs than my Heart. Without this proſpect, which is natural to all Men; what cou'd have induc'd him to ſhew his Generoſity to me? Oh cruel Husband,</hi> cry'd this Lady ſighing; <hi>If I part with ſomething which only belongs to you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, remember that you your ſelf are the cauſe of it: For when I reflect upon your Behaviour towards me,</hi> I <hi>find a ſtrong Inclination in me to grant it. I beſeech thee good God, to give me Vertue and Strength enough to reſiſt ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful a Temptation. I foreſee by ſome ſecret Inſtinct, that I ſhall not be able to come off a Conquerour in this Engagement.</hi> My Lady <hi>Stone</hi> was thus Tormenting her ſelf, when the Marſhal came into the ſame Room, where ſhe was, and after having pay'd his reſpects and Saluted her, he ſet himſelf down by her; <hi>What is it Madam</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that occaſions all theſe troubles: Why do you ſtrive to render your ſelf unfortunate in Reflecting too much upon your preſent Condition? Don't let the Spring-ſeaſon of your Life paſs away without Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo charming a Perſon as you ought to be made ſenſible of the ſatisfaction, which attends the full enjoyment of the happy Minute. If you have the leaſt inclination to Love, I know a certain Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſo violently charm'd with your engaging Air, that he declares he loves you more than his own
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:109100:36"/>
Life. And how come you to know this,</hi> anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer'd the Lady, in a Melancholy Tone, <hi>are you the Guardian of this Gentleman's Heart? Yes Madam,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal with a very Paſſionate look, <hi>I know him as well as my own ſelf, and I will be anſwerable for his Paſſion and Conſtancy, and that he ſhall proteſt to you that he will Love you as long as he lives. You ſurpriſe me Sir,</hi> reply'd the fair Lady, <hi>pray tell me who is this Gentleman, that has ſuch advantageous Thoughts of me, do I not know him? Madam,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal, caſting on her a very amourous look; <hi>He is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to you, 'tis the ſame whom you ſee before you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Declaration of the Marſhal's, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lady to the bluſh, he continu'd to make to her all the moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Proteſtations of a violent Paſſion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cuſtom of moſt Men, at the firſt riſe of their Love. The Marſhal was ſo extremely delighted with his grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paſſion, that he proteſted with a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Oaths at the Feet of his Miſtreſs, that he Paſſionately lov'd her; that he ador'd her; that he was Inchanted by her power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Charms, and a Thouſand ſuch like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Expreſſions. <hi>Is it poſible,</hi> reply'd my Lady <hi>Stone</hi> coldly, <hi>that you ſhou'd Love me ſo much as you pretend you do? May one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon your Words? Commonly Perſons of your
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:109100:37"/>
Character are in Love with moſt Women, more out of a Principle of Civility than Love. But,</hi> continu'd ſhe, <hi>what is it that I ſay, I cannot but be perſwaded that you have ſome kindneſs for me, ſince you have dealt ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly with me; I will take it then for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it will ſerve at leaſt to pleaſe my Fancy; What advantage cou'd you purpoſe to your ſelf in deceiving an unfortunate and afflicted Perſon, who deſires nothing but Compaſſion. Oh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam!</hi> reply'd the Marſhal, ſqueezing her fair Hands between his own. <hi>'Tis I that rather ſtand in need of Compaſſion; my Love encreaſes every Moment, and if you don't find out a Remedy to appeaſe my pain, I am infallibly undone. Sir,</hi> reply'd the Lady Smiling, <hi>I have a certain Chamber-Maid belonging to me, who has a Soveraign Antidote againſt Love; I'll engage as ſoon as you do but look upon her you'll be cur'd of your Diſtemper. O Madam!</hi> cry'd the Marſhal being impatient to ſee her, <hi>pray let her come, that ſhe may apply ſomewhat to aſſwage my Pain. The Plaiſter which ſhe uſes</hi> reply'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lady, facetiouſly, <hi>is very large, it will cover your whole Body. This is a Plaiſter for the Devil,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>but pray let us ſee it,</hi> he had no ſooner ſpoke theſe Words, but the Lady call'd <hi>Betty,</hi> which was the name of her Chamber-Maid, who was ſo ugly that ſhe was only fit to make a Bugg-bear to frighten Children withal.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:109100:37"/>
Her Mouth was ſo big that it reach'd from one Ear to the other; her Noſe was very ſmall; her Fore-head very low and flat; her Eyes vaſtly large; her Hair and the grain of her Skin very courſe, if you touch'd her ſhe felt like a Nutmeg grater; beſides that ſhe was as Black as a Tawny-moor, and her ſhape was all awry: But notwithſtanding all this, ſhe had a moſt admirable Head-piece, having a ready and well refin'd Wit, and was moſt excellent at Repartees. When one heard her talk, ſhe made an ample a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the Deformity of her Body and Face; and 'twas by this means that ſhe inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated herſelf into the favour of her Miſtreſs, who had a particular kindneſs for her. The Marſhal, at firſt ſight of her, went two or three ſteps backwards, on purpoſe to ſhew his ſurpriſe. This young Woman, who as we have already intimated, had a very ready Wit, and was well acquainted with this ſort of Divertiſements, was not at all balk'd at it, but on the contrary, told the Marſhal very briskly; <hi>that this was a certain Proof of her Merit, becauſe ſhe had been powerful enough to cauſe ſo ſudden an Emotion in a Perſon ſo brave and Galiant as the Marſhal. 'Tis very true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,</hi> reply'd Monſieur <hi>de Boufflers, pray come nearer to me, and make me ſenſible of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt Love, which your Lady has told me, that you always carry about you. Alaſs!</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:109100:38"/>
reply'd <hi>Betty</hi> with a Smile, <hi>Sir my charms are not powerful enough to cure you of your Love, I want that advantage, except in ſeeing me ſo ill ſhap'd and ſo ugly, you might take a general antipathy againſt Women: They are not all of 'em ſo ugly nor ſo ill ſhap'd,</hi> reply'd her Miſtreſs, <hi>as thou art</hi> Betty, <hi>wherefore I don't believe that the Marſhal is reſolv'd as yet to renounce his Paſſion for the fair Sex. I conjecture I know a certain Perſon in the World, whom he does not altogether look upon with an indifferent Eye. And ſo do I,</hi> reply'd <hi>Betty</hi> laughing: <hi>For that I know it may be your own ſelf, it being very likely that the Marſhal is not inſenſible of your Charms. You jeer me,</hi> reply'd Madam <hi>Stone</hi> pleaſantly; <hi>what do you ſay to the cajoleing Language of my Maid,</hi> ſaid ſhe to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, <hi>I ſay Madam,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>that ſhe is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely in the right on't, and that ſhe has ſpoke nothing but what is due to ſo adorable and ſo amiable a Perſon as your ſelf. Alaſs! I am only too well convinc'd of the truth of it, my Heart having been Wounded by your irreſiſtible Charms. O Sir,</hi> reply'd Madam <hi>Stone</hi> careleſly, <hi>why then don't you wear it in a Scarff? I am afraid this poor Heart of yours is ſo mangl'd ever ſince you firſt ſaw me, that it will not hold long toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. How can it be otherwiſe, Madam,</hi> anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer'd <hi>Betty,</hi> who was very ſmart upon the Marſhal, ſo that he was extremely taken with her Converſation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:109100:38"/>
They were about to continue their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, when Dame <hi>Helenemberg</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of the Houſe came in to tell her Gueſts that in the Evening there wou'd be a Ball at the Houſe of the Bailiff of the Town. The Marſhal knew ſo well how to perſwade my Lady <hi>Stone</hi> to go thither with him, that ſhe eaſily granted his Requeſt, according to the Inclinations of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Women, who are naturally addicted to Pleaſure. This <hi>German</hi> Ball was compos'd of the chief Magiſtrates of the Place, who after they had Eat and Drunk very plentiful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, and their Muſick, (which was rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd Noiſe, than any thing relating to Har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mony) having begun to Play, they danc'd according to their own Country-Faſhion, with their Wives and Daughters. The Marſhal being ſomewhat concern'd, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately departed, and at his return brought along with him ſome Haut-bois and Pipers belonging to the <hi>French</hi> Regiments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, who play'd very ſweetly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him and his Miſtreſs to the Ball, where they danc'd with ſo admirable an Air, that the whole Company ſtood amaz'd at the graceful performance of theſe two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Perſons. Dame <hi>Helenemberg,</hi> who had ſqueez'd her ſelf up in ſome corner, for fear of being known, did rub her Hands for joy, being not a little Proud, that ſhe had
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:109100:39"/>
the good Fortune to entertain ſuch Gueſts in her Houſe. At laſt the Ball being ended the Turn-Spits, as I ſuppoſe, all on a ſudden made ſuch a clattering noiſe amidſt the Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and Frying-Pans, and with the Fire Sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, Tongs and other Kitchen-Inſtruments, that the Marſhal and his Lady being fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it, got away as faſt as they cou'd to their own Lodgings. It was about four a Clock in the Morning, when they return'd from the Ball; and our Lovers beginning now by degrees to be more and more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Pleaſures of their growing Love, reſolv'd not to go to Bed that Night, but to paſs it away in thoſe amourous Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations, which are uſually the effects of a moſt tender Paſſion. The Marſhal, who wou'd fain in ſome meaſure have moderated the Vehemency of his Love, found his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours ſo weak, and his Miſtreſs's Charms ſo engaging and powerful, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd abſolutely to give way to his Paſſion. He thought her at that time more charming than ever, which ſerv'd for nothing elſe but to render him more unfortunate, and to entangle him the more in a Paſſion, which it wou'd not be eaſie for him to ſhake off ſo ſoon. He grew at laſt Melancholy to that degree, that he avoided all manner of civil Society and Converſation.</p>
            <p>One day the Lady having reprehended
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:109100:39"/>
him for his ill Humour, telling him that he was ſtrangely alter'd in his Temper, from what ſhe had known him before: <hi>Alaſs! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what good can you expect from the preſence of a Man-hater, who thinks the World too little for him to range in?</hi> The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals <hi>de Crequi</hi> and <hi>de Navaille</hi> did alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times check him upon account of his cloudy Temper, without knowing the true cauſe of it, ſo that the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> at laſt beginning to grow weary of leading ſuch a diſconſolate courſe of Life, and having communicated his Thoughts to the Count <hi>de Choiſeul,</hi> he was ſoon reliev'd by his good Advice. <hi>How,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>my Friend, is it come to that paſs with you, that you cannot make a Woman Love you, for whom you have a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? You may now eſteem your ſelf a ſorry Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low indeed. For my part,</hi> reply'd the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, ſtriking with his Hat upon the Table, <hi>I know not what I am my ſelf, yet I am ſure I am not the ſame I us'd to be: I durſt not ſo much as ſue for a Favour from the Lady I Love. I cannot believe but that ſhe has bewitch'd me to be ſilent, and to bear every thing with an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reſpect. Theſe are the true marks,</hi> reply'd the Count, <hi>of a Man in Love: But why ſhou'd you complain, ſince you have ask'd nothing of your Miſtreſs, and that you have no reaſon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe her of being Inſenſible, Cruel or Indifferent. Go, go, take my advice, lay aſide this dull way
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:109100:40"/>
of Courtſhip, and puſh on your Point as cloſe as you can: The</hi> Engliſh <hi>Ladies are not ſo averſe to the</hi> French <hi>as you imagine.</hi> The Marſhal cou'd not forbear laughing at the Count's jolly Humour, who advis'd him to make uſe of his middle Point to advance his Amourous Deſign, <hi>Courage, Courage my dear Friend,</hi> cry'd the Count, clapping him upon the Shoulder; <hi>'tis a very good ſign when a Love Sick Perſon begins to laugh; I'll engage, that before you are a Weak older, you'll be cur'd of your Diſtemper:</hi> It ſeems, that when we diſcloſe our Heart to a Friend, we ſhare with him one half of our troubles. This was very obſervable in the Marſhal, who after having freely deliver'd his Mind to the Count his Friend, found himſelf half cur'd of his Pain; having therefore embrac'd and return'd him a thouſand thanks for his good Counſel he went to renew his Viſit at my Lady <hi>Stone's,</hi> who had been very uneaſie during his abſence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What have I done to you my dear Marſhal,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that you thus fly from me as you do; it ſeems as if I were become your Enemy?</hi> 
               <q>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</q> Madam, anſwer'd he, looking upon her with a languiſhing Eye, <q>in ſome meaſure you are ſo, having bereav'd my Heart of all its Repoſe and Tranquillity; ever ſince I had the firſt ſight of you, I am not the ſame Perſon I was wont to be; I have given you
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:109100:40"/>
ſome hints of my Paſſion, but I am apt to believe you ſcarce ever thought of it ſince.</q> More than you think for, Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd ſhe, <q>I love you better than you can imagine.</q> 'Twas not without ſome Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that ſhe ſpoke theſe Words, but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that he had not very well apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her meaning, ſhe repeated 'em ſeveral times very pleaſantly. The Marſhal, who underſtands a little of moſt Languages, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially as to Love-Terms, fell into an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſy of Joy upon hearing theſe charming Words, which ſounded very prettily in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> from his fair Lady's Mouth. She having ſeveral times after repeated theſe Words, <hi>I Love you, I Love you;</hi> the Marſhal did no longer queſtion his own happineſs, and having embrac'd his charming Miſtreſs, he gave her freſh aſſurances of the violence of his Paſſion, which he told her was rais'd to that height that it muſt prove mortal to him, except ſhe wou'd vouchſaſe to prevent it. <q>Is it poſſible, Divine Creature, ſaid he, that at that moment, when I look upon you, there ſhou'd be any thing wanting to accompliſh my Felicity? Alaſs! flattering Fancies! deceitful Imaginations! I am very ſenſible what it is that is wanting to compleat my happineſs, 'tis that you my incomparable Fair, wou'd Love me as well as I do you.</q> I will Sir, I will from
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:109100:41"/>
the very bottom of my Heart, anſwer'd ſhe. Now I leave it to the Reader's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to imagine what effects theſe Words proceeding from the Mouth of his moſt ador'd Miſtreſs, had upon the Marſhal: Indeed he was quite tranſported beyond himſelf, he Kiſs'd her a thouſand times, and that ſo cloſe as if he were in a Trance. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lady giving him ſome weak Repulſes; they ſerv'd only to add Fuel to his Fire, and to inflame his Paſſion, and not being able to contain himſelf any longer; he with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of his Fair One, who was as hard put to it as himſelf to preſerve her Honour, took a walk in an adjacent Wood. When ſhe found her ſelf alone, <q>I expoſe my ſelf to no ſmall danger, ſaid ſhe, in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a Perſon who appears very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to a tender Heart. Alaſs Heavens! I am only too ſenſible of his lovely Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, he has ſomewhat ſo charming in him, that my Liberty is in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſuffering Ship-wrack. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour will in time Triumph over my Weakneſs, if I don't oppoſe him with all my Strength.</q> Having made theſe Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which her almoſt dying Vertue did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire her withal; ſhe took her Pen, and having underſtood by a certain Friend, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was going into <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> that her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band had been ſeen in that Country, ſhe wrote him theſe following Lines:

                        <hi>YOU appear ſo deſpicable to me at this time, that your neglect ſhall not cost me ſo much as one Sigh. What cou'd induce. you to leave your faithful Spouſe without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe? There need no great queſtion to be made concerning the difference of our Sentiments, they are ſo oppoſite to one another, that they are paſs'd all Reconciliation on my ſide.

My Vertue has hitherto defended it ſelf againſt thoſe Temptations which daily preſent themſelves before my Eyes; But alaſs! How difficult it is to be aſſur'd of an entire Victory over ones own Inclinations.

            <p>No ſooner had ſhe diſpatch'd this Letter, but ſhe went to take the Air in an adjacent Foreſt, where ſhe knew that the Marſhal was gone before accompany'd only with his Gentleman. Sympathy, which ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guides Lovers in their Actions, had ſoon drawn the Marſhal to the ſame Place
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:109100:42"/>
where ſhe had ſet herſelf down; thus muſing upon her amourous Adventure; and eſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Flock of Sheep feeding not far off, ſhe cou'd not forbear ſaying, (as if ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy'd their happineſs) <q>O you innocent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, how happy are you! You feed here without care and Anxiety; thoſe Paſſions which continually afflict us Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, never diſturb your Tranquillity; you follow the inſtincts of Nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Crime or Puniſhment: Your deſires never exceed the bounds preſcrib'd by Nature: <hi>Love,</hi> which never diſturbs your contented Mind, follows among you its own Laws, O you Peaceable Creatures! You are more happy than we Mortals.</q> 
               <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers,</hi> who had hid himſelf behind ſome Trees, over-heard all that ſhe ſaid, agreeably ſurpriſing her. Oh! <hi>Sir,</hi> cry'd ſhe bluſhing, <hi>who thought to have found you here? You are ſo dextrous at a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe when leaſt expected, and eſpecially when one is employ'd in ſuch matters as ought to be kept from your Knowledge. I was juſt admiring the Sweetneſs and Tranquillity which theſe Creatures enjoy, nothing vexes 'em, nothing diſturbs 'em. Alaſs! why was not I made like them? Madam,</hi> ſaid the Marſhal, <hi>it lies in your own Power to enjoy the ſame Tranquillity; you may make your ſelf happy whenever you pleaſe, and all ſuch of your Friends, upon whom you ſhall vouch

ſafe to beſtow your Favours. Do but Love, do but Love,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>this is the only Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Life.</hi> He wou'd have proceeded in his diſcourſe, but our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lady having made ſigns to him, that her Gentleman, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd her cloſe, underſtood a little <hi>French,</hi> the Marſhal did not enlarge any further upon this Subject; and tho' their Conference laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomewhat longer, they where wholly employ'd in diſcourſing about indifferent matters. Thus as the Marſhal and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy were walking along with a ſlow Pace, they found themſelves inſenſibly got very far into the Wood, when they eſpy'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar off a kind of Cottage thatch'd with Straw and very neatly Built; inſomuch that their Curioſity inſpir'd 'em with a deſire to know who it ſhou'd be that dwelt in ſo ſolitary a Place, therefore my Lady <hi>Stone</hi> ſent Mr. <hi>Game,</hi> her Gentleman to informe himſelf of it: Upon his Return, he told our Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that this little Houſe belong'd to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain honeſt old Man, aged above a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Twelve Years, and that he had with him one of the moſt Beautiful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the World, which he ſaid was his Daughter. This News ſeeming ſomewhat ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lady, ſhe enjoyn'd her Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to return to the ſame Place, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ask him how old he might be when he begot this Daughter, and to make ſome
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:109100:43"/>
other particular Enquiries concerning the whole courſe of his Life. While the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was gone to execute his Miſtreſſes Commands, ſhe had ſet her ſelf under a Tree, where ſhe expected his return: The Marſhal having here Proſtrated himſelf at the Feet of his Goddeſs, began to renew his former Proteſtations. <hi>Hold your Tongue you pratling Fool,</hi> ſaid ſhe, giving him a gentle blow upon one Cheek; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done with a very gallant Air, it ſo ſenſibly touch'd the Marſhal, that he was ready to expire for Joy. In the mean time Mr. <hi>Game</hi> being return'd drew near and told 'em, that the Country-Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to anſwer his Queſtions, imagining that he was come to play upon him, and that he had ſhut himſelf up in his Hutch. <hi>Let us go Madam,</hi> ſaid the Marſhal ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from his Seat, <hi>and make him open the Door, that we may have the Satisfaction to ſee that handſome Damſel, whoſe Beauty has ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd Mr.</hi> Game. <hi>What reaſon is there</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd my Lady <hi>Stone,</hi> (being jealous that this Damſel might ſurpaſs her in Beauty) <q>to diſturb theſe poor People in their peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Enjoyment? come let us go Home to our own Lodgings.</q> The Marſhal, who always ſhews the utmoſt Complaiſance to Lady's, was unwilling to contradict his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, tho' he had a great mind to ſee this
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:109100:44"/>
Country-Beauty, therefore he thought it moſt convenient to deferr his Curioſity till a more favourable Opportunity, when he ſhou'd be alone. Having reconducted the Lady to her Lodgings, the remainder of the Day was ſpent in playing at Cards, and ſuch ſort of Sports. Neither was Love laid aſide, but had a ſhare in the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and our Marſhal wou'd have been very willing to play another Game, but he cou'd not prevail at that time.</p>
            <p>It is ſcarce to be imagin'd how this <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Lady, who ſaw herſelf reduc'd to the utmoſt extremity, cou'd defend her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour with ſo much bravery. She endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to detain her Lover with fair Words from one Day to another, in hopes that her Husband in the mean time might come to aſſiſt her in this Critical Conjuncture: Not but that ſhe had a very favourable Opinion of the Marſhal, whom ſhe lov'd extremely, nay, even to that degree, that ſhe herſelf deſpair'd of reſiſting his Charms much longer. For he that is once Maſter of the Heart of a Lady, need not much queſtion all the reſt Our preſent Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive will furniſh us with Examples of this nature. But let us return to our General, who notwithſtanding this praeengagement, went in ſearch of a new Paſſion. He cou'd not forget what he had heard the other day
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:109100:44"/>
in the Wood concerning the Country-Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, whom he had not as yet ſeen, except it were in the <hi>Idea</hi> of his own Fancy, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to him very pleaſing; therefore he aroſe one Morning early with the Sun, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd to the Wood, without letting any one know his Deſign, ſteering his Courſe directly towards the Cottage, where he found the old Man and his Daughter buſie in making your Basket-work Umbrello's, by which they got their Lively-hood; who ſeem'd to be much ſurpris'd at the ſight of him. The Marſhal was no leſs amaz'd at them; for he proteſted ſome hours after, that tho' he had Travell'd over a great part of the World, he had never in all his Life-time met with any thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to this Country-Beauty. He took particular notice of the exact features of her Face, her delicate ſhape, very propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the ſize of her Limbs, which were not as yet come to their full growth and perfection; ſhe then not having attain'd to above Sixteen or Eighteen years of Age: The whole Ornament of her Body being a ſmall Jacket of pure white Linnen. The Marſhal wou'd have enter'd into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with her, but he found her ſo Savage and ill Humour'd, that ſhe flew away from him directly into her Cottage. In the mean while her Father took the Liberty to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:109100:45"/>
tell him in the <hi>German</hi> Tongue, that he had beſt go about his buſineſs, or elſe he wou'd not long be pleas'd with his Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Marſhal ſeeing himſelf threatn'd by a plain Country-Fellow (who by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Skill in Magical Arts, was not ſo ignorant as he imagin'd) deſpiſing his threats drew his Sword at him, telling him, <hi>you old Sorcerer, I'll make you know, at leaſt to let me ſee your fair Daughter:</hi> He did not believe that he had call'd him by his right Name, but was ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the Truth of it; for in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, he ſaw three or four great black Fellows, like ſo many Infernal Fiends fall upon him, ſometimes pulling him by the Noſe, which they Pinch'd ſoundly, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the Ears, which they ſtretch'd with ſuch a force, as if they wou'd have pull'd 'em off. This Game being over, which was nothing to what was to come, they drew him up into the Air, and with his own Sword gave him innumerable Blows; from hence they convey'd him quite to the other end of the Foreſt, upon a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice ſurrounded with Water: The Marſhal as brave as he is, was heartily afraid that theſe Devils wou'd have thrown him down head-long from thence into the Pond, but it ſeems it was not his fate to be Drown'd. At laſt, after he had been well drub'd
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:109100:45"/>
again, they threw his Sword at his Head and ſo left him. The Marſhal return'd as faſt as he was able to his Lodgings, where he did not ſpeak ſo much as one Word of his Adventure, but he was forc'd to keep his Bed for ſeveral Days, and <hi>Champonniere</hi> his <hi>Valet du Chambre</hi> was fain to bath his Limbs, (which were extremely batter'd) with Spirit of Wine, and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soap. My Lady <hi>Stone</hi> not being able to gueſs at the cauſe of this ſudden Diſtemper of her Lover, was almoſt out of her Wits; ſhe came every Day to his Bed-ſide, to ſhew him her Affection, and how much concern'd ſhe was for his Ilneſs: The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal on the other hand, acknowledg'd her Civilities in the moſt Obliging manner in the World. As ſoon as he was recover'd, he did not fail to give her the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of his Love as before, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſhe ſoon perceiv'd that the vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Paſſion was ſomewhat abated. The Beautiful Country-Damſel whom he had ſeen in the Wood, notwithſtanding the ill Treatment he had receiv'd, had ſo enchanted him, that his Thoughts cou'd not be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd any where elſe, My Lady <hi>Stone</hi> appear'd much diſſatisfy'd at his Shyneſs, not knowing unto what cauſe to attribute this indifferency. <hi>Shou'd it not perhaps be,</hi> ſaid ſhe to her ſelf, <hi>becauſe I have deny'd him
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:109100:46"/>
thoſe Favours which he ſu'd for ſo earneſtly? But how cou'd I do otherwiſe? Why ſhou'd I at once betray my Vertue and my Husband, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the Brutiſh inclinations of a Man, who perhaps when he has obtain'd his aim, will make me a Laughing Stock to his Companions? No, No, I'll never conſent to it. Not but that my Husband, who has play'd me ſuch a prank ſo lately, deſerves it very well; but I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to ſubdue my Paſſion, for my own ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction's ſake, and not to looſe the pleaſure of Triumphing over all thoſe flattering Temptations which daily lye in my way. Nevertheleſs I muſt own, that I have vaſt Obligations to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, who did ſo generouſly aſſiſt me when I was in extremity: a bare acknowledgment will be ſcarce a ſufficient Recompence for his Liberality. neither am I ignorant that all Men are guided by Intereſt, and that they never oblige a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man without a Proſpect of Reward.</hi> Thus our beautiful <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lady was reaſoning with her ſelf, when Monſieur <hi>de Boufflers</hi> (who was by this time pretty well tir'd with the thoughts of his Country-Beauty) ſurpris'd her upon a ſudden: <hi>What is it Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that diſturbs your Mind, what is it that makes you ſo penſive? Truly Sir,</hi> reply'd the Lady not without ſome diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, <hi>I am ſo, and that too upon very good Grounds: For is it not cauſe enough of trouble to ſee my ſelf look'd upon by you with all the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:109100:46"/>
imaginable, even at the ſame time when I can hear no News from my Husband? Don't you think that all this is ſufficient to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm me with Grief. Alaſs! Sir, to my Misfortune I have plac'd you too near my Heart.</hi> She cou'd not proceed without ſhedding ſome Tears, which very ſenſibly affected the Marſhal, who very dextrouſly attributed the effects of his Diſcontent and Indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to her Shyneſs; telling her that it was becauſe ſhe had ſet light by his Paſſion. Indeed, reply'd ſhe, <q>I might eaſily Conjecture this to be the true cauſe of your indifferency; but can you imagine Sir, that without a great deal of trouble we can reſolve to grant your Sex thoſe Favours, which you aim at. I am apt to believe you ſay right, Madam,</q> anſwer'd the Marſhal, <q>but if a Woman meets with one whom ſhe knows to be a Perſon of Honour and Diſcretion, what has ſhe to fear? As for my own part, continu'd ſhe, I wou'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Thouſand times fall upon the point of my own Sword, than brag of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour receiv'd from a Lady. He muſt needs be deſtitute both of Honour and Integrity that does it. If this be the only Scruple remaining, which troubles you, I can quickly free you from it, by aſſuring you that as to this particular I am invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Love me therefore my Deareſt, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:109100:47"/>
don't any longer refuſe to give me that moſt precious Pledge of your Love, which I beg of you.</q> The Marſhal expreſs'd theſe words in ſo Paſſionate a manner, that even at that very Moment the Lady was overcome. I have underſtood ſince, that our General, who never attacks any Place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs; luckily hit at that time on the very Critical Minute, and he made uſe of it with diſcretion, like a Man of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, this is to ſay, without boaſting of it, as a great many Gentlemen do, when they meet with a good chance. The ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which the Marſhal receiv'd in the enjoyment of this <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lady, far ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed what he had from his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miſtreſs at <hi>Puicerda.</hi> He continu'd his amourous Engagements for ſome time with the latter, as a Perſon of much Honour and Bravery; till being order'd to ſome Warlike Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he was fain to reſolve to quit his Miſtreſs. While theſe two Lovers were la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting that cruel ſeparation which was ſo near at Hand; the Husband of this fair <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lady, having receiv'd her Letter, and fearing not without Reaſon, that a Coronet was preparing for his Head, had made all the ſpeed he cou'd to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Germany.</hi> The Marſhal was over-joy'd at the News, finding his Miſtreſs to grow ſomewhat burdenſome to his Purſe, be.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:109100:47"/>
ſides that he was oblig'd to pay her more than ordinary reſpect, in regard of her Quality.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> was extremely well ſatisfy'd to meet his Wife, whom he believ'd to have been very faithful to him; but poor Man, he was very much miſtaken, he muſt have come a little ſooner, if he wou'd have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented her from entring him in the Cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old's Order. However, matters paſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 'em with a great deal of Love and Amity. The Marſhal treated the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman no otherwiſe than his Friend, aſſuring him by ſeveral Oaths that he wou'd be ready to ſerve him, whenever any Occaſion ſhou'd preſent it ſelf. But the Lady was greatly afflicted at the Approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing departure of her Lover, who was ſo complaiſant to ſtay with her as long as poſſibly he cou'd, even ſome time beyond his Orders, during which, they let ſlip no opportunity to ſtrengthen the good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Horns, who was not ſenſible of what pains they took for him, or if he was, did conceal his Reſentment. However, one Evening, after the Marſhal was juſt gone out of her Appartment, he cou'd not forbear telling her, that he thought ſhe had a little too much kindneſs for the Marſhal. <hi>What wou'd'ſt thou have me do my Dear,</hi> reply'd ſhe, <hi>you know what vaſt
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:109100:48"/>
Obligations I have receiv'd from him; he has dealt ſo generouſly with me, that 'tis impoſſible for me to forget it as long as I live. Alaſs! if it had not been for him, I had not been now among the Living.</hi> This was ſufficient to perſwade the poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, that all the kindneſſes which ſhe had ſhewn him, were the bare effects of Gratitude. At laſt <hi>Monſieur Boufflers</hi> was forc'd to leave his Poſt, and to depart conformably to the poſitive Orders of the Count <hi>de Montal.</hi> I will not undertake here to give you a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of what paſs'd in the Field during the reſt of the Campaign, this not being my preſent deſign, but I ſhall rather follow the natural courſe of our Hiſtory, which will lead us to ſome new Love-Intreagues of our General; who being return'd after the Campaign was finiſh'd, to <hi>Paris,</hi> ſoon provided for himſelf a new Miſtreſs: This was a young Damſel, the Daughter of a certain rich Merchant, whom he ſaw one Morning going to Maſs at <hi>Clermont,</hi> where he went to hear a Sermon preach'd by a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, who contrary to the Cuſtom of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, was at that time to treat of pure Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. Tho' the Marſhal ſeem'd to be very attentive to the Doctrine preach'd by this Jeſuit, who diſcours'd like a very good Chriſtian, yet Love did not ceaſe to inſinuate it ſelf into his Heart, and to make
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:109100:48"/>
him ſenſible of its Force. <hi>Mademoiſelle Landy</hi> was the name of this Beauty, that had charm'd him at Church: She wore that day upon her Head one of your little black Feather-Caps, that were then in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, which was ſo becoming to her, that tho' ſhe was otherwiſe but an indifferent Beauty, yet the Marſhal cou'd ſcarce keep his Eyes from her. She ſoon perceiv'd it, and knowing her ſelf to be in a Place, where every thing ought to be done with a great deal of Modeſty, ſhe pull'd her Hood ſomewhat lower over her Face. Sermon being ended, the Marſhal took care to go out with her, and with a very gallant Air to ask her, if ſhe wou'd not allow him the Honour to wait upon her to her Houſe. This young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman who was very well bred, and did not want Wit, quickly perceiving by his Behaviour that he was not a Man to be deſpis'd, accepted of his Civility; nay, ſeem'd well pleas'd to be Conducted home by ſo gallant a Gentleman.</p>
            <p>The next day, the Marſhal made her a Viſit; he found her in her Chamber, where ſhe was playing very Sweetly and Charmingly upon the Lute. The ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her Voice and the skill with which ſhe expreſs'd her Words to Admiration, were ſuch Powerful Charms to him, that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:109100:49"/>
he ſeem'd to be quite Enchanted. But he was forc'd to carry on this Love-intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue with a great deal of Precaution; for her Father and Mother were Perſons of good Repute, whoſe chief aim was to preferr their only Daughter to ſome good Match or another. They flatter'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for ſome time with the hopes that <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers</hi> viſited their Daughter upon this account, but they were much miſtaken, for his only buſineſs was to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert himſelf, and to ſpend his leiſure-time in amourous Adventures. <hi>Monſieur Landy</hi> began at laſt to diſcover his Deſign, and coming one day from the Exchange, met with the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> upon his Knees before his Daughter, Kiſſing her Hands: Upon his departure, he check'd her very ſeverely, and in a Week after ſent her to a <hi>Nunnery.</hi> The Marſhal having perceiv'd that he was the cauſe that the Father had ſo unkindly treated his Daughter, gave him a Viſit on purpoſe to upbraid him with his ſeverity. <hi>Will you marry her Sir,</hi> ſaid the Merchant briskly to <hi>Monſieur Boufflers, if you will, I'll give her Thirty or Forty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns, ready Mony for her Portion. No Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Monſieur Boufflers, my intent is not as yet to entangle my ſelf in Wedlock; all that I did, was only to paſs away ſome Melancholy hours in admiring thoſe perfections, which I found in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:109100:49"/>
her. You ſpeak like a Gentleman,</hi> ſaid <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Landy</hi> ſmiling, <hi>You have tht</hi> Opera <hi>and Play-Houſe in this Town, which I ſhou'd think might be ſufficient to divert you, without haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Houſes, on purpoſe to Debauch our Daughters. I have found my Daughter</hi> Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon <hi>quite alter'd from what ſhe was wont to be, ſince ſhe has convers'd with you. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of your Kidney have a ſtrange Influence over ſuch young Maidens, which is not much admir'd among us Citizens: We are not very am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of having 'em turn Wanton or Impudent Houſe-wives: We willingly leave theſe Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to your Lady's of Pleaſure, who don't think it any conſiderable Crime to Cuckold their Husband's. You are not in the wrong of it, Sir,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal with a Smile, <hi>to take care of your Pullets, leſt ſuch Game-Cock's as we ſhou'd Sport with 'em; I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we ſhou'd be apt to teach 'em another ſort of Game; but at the ſame time you treat your Daughter with too much Rigour, thus to thruſt her into a</hi> Nunnery: <hi>As for my own part, I'll ſwear to you by St.</hi> Urbot, <hi>that I never ſpoke twice of Love to her. Don't you know Sir,</hi> reply'd the Merchant, <hi>that St.</hi> Urbot <hi>is the Patron of all Treacherous and Perjur'd Perſons, and what wonder is it, if you Soldiers chuſe him to be your Protector? You take us Soldiers then to be Deviliſh ſtrange Creatures, my Friend,</hi> anſwer'd the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:109100:50"/>
               <hi>but I wou'd have you know, that if it were not for us, our Enemies wou'd have cropt your Ears long ago. No, no, Sir, you are miſtaken,</hi> reply'd the Merchant, <hi>if matters were come to the utmoſt extremity, I believe we might be able to defend our ſelves as well as you. And</hi> continu'd he, Swearing a great Oath, and pointing at an old Cimetar that hung up in the Hall, <hi>with this very Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon I dare undertake my ſelf to diſpatch Thirty Soldiers at one ſtroke. O brave Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,</hi> reply'd Monſieur <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> taking him by the Hand; <hi>I find now that you are a Man of Courage, if our Enemies ſhou'd ever come to enter</hi> France, <hi>we ſhall be ſure not to want brave Soldiers to aſſiſt us upon all Occaſions. I'll take care that his moſt Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Majeſty ſhall be inform'd of your Bravery. O good Sir,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Monſieur Landy, I hope you will not play me ſuch a ſcurvy trick; to tell you the truth, I am the greateſt Coward in the VVorld; if any one takes me at a word; my Courage and Riches both are only in Conceit. Indeed,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal, <hi>you have done very well to undeceive me, for elſe I ſhou'd have certainly made you paſs with the King both for a</hi> Croeſus <hi>and a</hi> Caeſar: <hi>See now,</hi> ſaid the Merchant, <hi>how dangerous it is to have more Reputation than is convenient. 'Tis very probable that for this Opinion which the VVorld wou'd have conceiv'd both of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:109100:50"/>
my VVealth and Bravery (tho' far from Truth) I might have paid dearly one time or another. VVell Sir,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal, <hi>you are the beſt Judge of both;</hi> Adieu, <hi>I leave you to your ſelves, but I wou'd have you ſhew your ſelf more kind to your Daughter, who does not deſerve this ill treatment from your Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers,</hi> after having left the Merchant, return'd to his own Houſe, to reflect upon his amourous Widdow hood which indeed was ſo burdenſome to him, that he was not able to endure it long: He wanted ſome new Love-engagement, let it coſt what it wou'd. Opportunity, which always was favourable to him, ſoon preſented a Paramour to his view. This was the Wife of a certain Counſellour of <hi>Paris,</hi> one of the moſt beautiful Women in this famous City. Their firſt Acquaintance happen'd at the Play-Houſe: He being then plac'd in one of the Boxes, this Lady who was in the Pitt, caſt ſuch killing looks at him, that he cou'd not forbear going in, and to ſet himſelf down by her. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to be further acquainted with her, he ſent his Servant for ſome dry Sweet-meats, China-Oranges and ſome Lemonade, which he preſented to her: The fair Lady, who was accuſtom'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive great Preſents, did nevertheleſs not refuſe the ſmall ones; She accepted 'em
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:109100:51"/>
very chearfully, returning a thouſand thanks to the Marſhal, who told her at the ſame time; Madam, <q>I am over-joy'd at this happy Hour, which has procur'd me the advantage of your Acquaintance, It is a conſiderable time ſince I have been ambitious of this Honour.</q> How Sir, reply'd the Gentlewoman very Merrily, <q>cou'd you know me before I ever had an Opportunity of ſeeing you. Yes, Madam, reply'd he very ſeriouſly, it is certain that a great while ago I had the advantage of knowing you, but looking upon you as a Perſon of extraordinary Beauty and Merits, I never had the boldneſs to approach you.</q> The Lady finding her ſelf out-done in Compliments, turn'd the Diſcourſe upon the Players, who Acted their part very well, ſo that ſhe wou'd fain have made theſe the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Subject of the preſent Conference, but <hi>Monſieur Boufflers</hi> interrupted her. <q>This is not, ſaid he, the Point in Queſtion, you don't anſwer me to what I ſpoke to you of, concerning the Honour I have obtain'd of your Acquaintance. Truly Sir, reply'd ſhe very ſmartly, I know not well what anſwer to make, you tell me that you have known me for ſome time, and I was born in a Province which I believe you ſcarce ever ſaw in your Life-time,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:109100:51"/>
that is to ſay, <hi>Normandy;</hi> and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not been above two Months in <hi>Paris,</hi> I cannot take it any otherwiſe than that you are pleas'd to Jeſt with me. Oh! Madam, anſwer'd the Marſhal, I rather wou'd be my own Executioner, than to conceal my ſentiments on purpoſe to divert my ſelf at the expence of ſo lovely a Creature. I ſhou'd be aſham'd of ſuch ſiniſter Proceedings, neither can my Heart conſent to ſo baſe an Action: Indeed it is not accuſtom'd to deal perfidiouſly with any Perſon, and much leſs with one who is ſo beautiful as you; it wou'd be eaſy for you to reduce its Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to its Duty, if it were not in its own ſelf capable to Act with ſincerity, even in matters of the leaſt Moment. Oh! that pretty loving Heart,</q> cry'd the Lady, as if ſhe had been ſurpris'd, <q>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this to be the only one in the World. How! always true, always ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and without diſguiſe; this is the firſt of this kind, that ever I heard of, and eſpecially of ſo brave a Cavalier as you, who eſteems it commonly no Sin to ſay to a Woman whatever you think fit, tho' you ſcarce ever retain any thought about it afterwards; much leſs that you ſhou'd have an inclination to performe it.</q> Then you take me, Madam, ſaid the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:109100:52"/>
Marſhal looking earneſtly upon her, for a <q>Diſſembler and one that pretends to quite different things from what he thinks. Is this the Honour you are pleas'd to beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tow upon me at firſt Sight? At this rate I have but little hopes of inſinuating my ſelf into your Favour; it is not likely that you will ſet much value upon a Man of ſuch a Character. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all theſe infirmities, reply'd ſhe, 'tis not impoſſible but that I might Love you, provided that—Oh! Madam,</q> ſaid the Marſhal, being impatient to hear the reſt, <q>don't ſtop here, elſe you'll leave me in the greateſt Diſtraction imaginable.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Play being juſt ended, every one departed out of the Houſe, and our Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, who had found this Lady's Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion very agreeable, wou'd needs conduct her Home, tho' ſhe had in her Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of her Brothers, who being a Student in the Jeſuits College, was not very well acquainted with ſuch amourous Repartees. He when he had his Siſter alone, began to argue the Caſe very handſomely with her, telling her, <q>that ſhe was now Marry'd, and therefore did not ſtand in need of a Gallant, and that if her Husband ſhou'd get the leaſt knowledge of it, he wou'd be very angry with her;</q> he told her beſides, that your Soldiers of all Men
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:109100:52"/>
ought not to be regarded, ſince their only aim was to impoſe upon the poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and afterwards to laugh at 'em. <q>Go, go, Brother, anſwer'd the Lady, with your Advice another way, you have too much Senſe for your Age. They that will taſte the pleaſures of Love, muſt not argue ſo cloſely as you do. <hi>Monſieur Nigueſe</hi> my Husband is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to know any thing of our Intrigue; it wou'd be a hard Fate upon us poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, if we were to employ all our time and pains only to pleaſe a Husband: For my part, this does not at all ſuit with my Humour.</q> The more pity for you Siſter, reply'd <hi>Monſieur Landrirette,</hi> (which was the name of the fair Lady's Brother) you'll <q>make but a very indifferent Houſe-Wife if you don't intend to make that your chief buſineſs, as becomes an honeſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, ſuch a one as you have been Educated at home; what can,</q> continu'd he, <q>be more Reproachful to a Woman that values her Reputation, than to hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify a poor harmleſs Man, who has not deſerv'd it? And how doſt thou know <hi>Landrirette,</hi> anſwer'd his Siſter briskly that he does not deſerve it, his Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-Law I am ſure has great Occaſion for a luſty Pair to rouſe up his dull Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and to clear his cloudy Brains.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:109100:53"/>
               <q>Truly Siſter, reply'd <hi>Landrirette,</hi> you either intend to make ſport with me, or elſe I believe you are not in your right Wits; if I thought you were in good earneſt, I wou'd be the firſt that ſhou'd give notice of it to your Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who I don't queſtion, wou'd find out a way to prevent his being dignify'd with Horns by you.</q> Indeed, reply'd his Siſter ſcoffingly, I don't know whether he <q>cou'd or not; a Woman is a ſtrange ſort of Creature to deal with, when ſhe has once ſet her Reſolution upon ſuch a thing.</q> I am only too apt to believe it, anſwer'd <hi>Landrirette,</hi> as he was going away, <q>but pray Siſter be mindful of your Duty, and conſider that you have a Husband, unto whom you are accountable for your Actions.</q> Come hither you Block-head, reply'd Madam <hi>Nigueſe,</hi> calling back her Brother, <q>canſt thou believe me to be ſuch a Fool, as not to tread in my Mother's Foot-ſteps. I have heard my Parents ſay that when I was born, my Mother per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded my Father, who is as thou knowſt a good honeſt Man, (I ſuppoſe thou doſt apprehend my meaning) that ſhe was big with me Ten or Eleven Months, which is contrary to the courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: My Father, who was willing to be abſolutely ſatisfy'd in this matter, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:109100:53"/>
been abſent theſe Eleven Months, took Counſel of a Phyſitian, who had had more than half a ſhare in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting me, whether it were poſſible for any Woman to go ſo long with Child: You may eaſily imagine that the Doctor told him it might very well be, partly out of ſelf-intereſt, and partly mov'd by the entreaties of my Mother, who was ſorely afraid that the Plot might be diſcover'd. If any Siniſter Accident ſhou'd happen to me, I warrant you we ſhall go near to find out means to clear that miſtake. Is this your way to rectify your Errors, reply'd her Brother, for ſhame bluſh at theſe Reproachful Deſigns; <hi>Adieu</hi> I cannot endure to hear you talk at this rate any longer.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Her Brother having thus left her, ſhe enter'd her Cloſet, where ſhe began to Reflect upon her Paſſion, which ſhe felt for <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers,</hi> who had appear'd in her Eyes the moſt charming and moſt accompliſh'd Man in the World, and as ſhe ſaid to herſelf, who deſerv'd to poſſeſs the Heart of a Beautiful Woman, <q>Oh! what a Satisfaction is it, ſaid ſhe, to make ſuch a Conqueſt: His whole Air is charming, and I have obſerv'd that all his Actions tend to honourable Deſigns; but ſuppoſing he ſhou'd not be ſo nice
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:109100:54"/>
in his Honour, as I cou'd wiſh for, what hazard can I run in the Caſe? I am a Marry'd Woman; if I were a young Maid, he might (after he had deceiv'd me) expose me to his Scorn, but as I am, I need not inſiſt upon theſe Trifles, I ſhall enjoy a Thouſand happy Minutes, without any farther charge to my ſelf than a little Complaiſance: As to the Horns, which my Husband is likely to get by the Bargain, I matter it not, knowing that he well deſerves 'em; beſides, that there are a great many others who think themſelves fine Fellows, becauſe they have the Honour to be admitted into that Order. 'Tis at preſent the grand Mode of <hi>Paris,</hi> a fine buſineſs indeed, to make ſo many Scruples about; is there not ſuch a Multitude of Perſons who are content to wear 'em, that their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is not to be expreſs'd?</q> 
               <hi>Monſieur Nigueſe</hi> her Husband coming into the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, prevented her from making any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reflections for that time, being come to lead her to Supper.</p>
            <p>The next Day the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> who ſeldom looſes a prize, gave a viſit to this Lady, who very joyfully bid him welcome to her Houſe, and her Husband, who as I have told you before, was a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour, deſir'd our General to come into
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:109100:54"/>
his Study, which was furniſh'd all over with Baggs of Writings. <hi>Monſieur Boufflers</hi> was at that time actually engag'd in a Law ſuit, and having occaſion for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of a Lawyer, he deliver'd his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings to our Counſellor, who return'd him a Thouſand Compliments for the Honour he did him, in making uſe of him in this Law Suit: He promis'd that he wou'd peruſe 'em all over, and not be wanting in his endeavours to gain him the Cauſe. <hi>I ſhall think my ſelf very much oblig'd to you, Sir,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers,</hi> putting two or three Golden <hi>Loviſes</hi> into his Hand: <hi>I will deſire your Lady to put you in Mind of my buſineſs. She is your Servant Sir,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Counſellor, leading him into his Wifes Chamber, who had left 'em by themſelves, not queſtioning but that the Marſhal wou'd give her a Viſit in private before he departed. <hi>Pray obſerve Sir,</hi> ſaid the good Man, peeping his Wife in the Face, <hi>ſhe has more Intereſt in the Courts of Juſtice than my ſelf. When my Lord chief Preſident comes to our Houſe, Come hither my Deareſt,</hi> will he ſay, <hi>take you my Robe and Cap, and do you give Sentence as you think Convenient.</hi> 
               <q>O dear Sir, ſaid the Marſhal Smiling, I hope this may turn to my great Advantage, Come Madam, Come,</q> ſaid he, making a ſhew as if he wou'd embrace
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:109100:55"/>
her, <q>if you will but take my buſineſs in Hand, I don't queſtion but we ſhall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Cauſe to very good purpoſe. But Sir, continu'd he, ere I forget it, are not you a Native of <hi>Normandy;</hi> if I don't miſtake, I have heard 'em ſay that you have great skill in the tricking part of the Law, as moſt of your beſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of that Country have.</q> No, Sir, reply'd <hi>Monſieur Nigueſe,</hi> 
               <q>I was born near <hi>Paris,</hi> but <hi>Normandy</hi> is the Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of my Wife.</q> O you then are the Perſon who is beſt skill'd in that part, reply'd the General in a Familiar manner, <q>it is to you that I muſt make my applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and give you Inſtructions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my whole Buſineſs.</q> No queſtion Sir, reply'd the Counſellor, but that we <q>ſhall find it out in time, I will leave you with my Wife to open the Cauſe; whilſt I go to a certain Abbot one of my old Friends, to draw up a Petition for him of great Conſequence. I cannot but tell you before I go, that this Abbot having got a young Wench with Child, ſhe now Sues him for a Maintenance both for her ſelf and the Child, for their Lives. My Deareſt, do you relate the reſt of the Story to <hi>Monſieur Boufflers.</hi>
               </q> O yes, yes, ſaid the Lady, being very uneaſie that he was not gone before, <q>my dear ſweet Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:109100:55"/>
I will notfail to do it, do but yno go to the Abbot <hi>du Gret,</hi> 'tis poſſible he may elſe employ another Lawyer. O Plague! ſaid he, putting on his Cloak, I ſhou'd not like that, for he is a pleaſant ſort of a Fellow; beſides, he has always ſome Law-buſineſs or another, eſpecially relating to Women, being a particular admirer of the fair Sex, and is always buſie in grafting in their Gardens. For that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſaid <hi>Monſieur Boufflers,</hi> this is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Spark: <hi>Adieu</hi> reply'd <hi>Monſieur Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe,</hi> my Wife knows him better than I.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Counſellor's Lady being thus rid of the troubleſome Company of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, immediately enter'd upon her Love-concerns, which was what the Marſhal wiſh'd for. The Parly was ſoon over, and in a little time they began to examine matters, piece by piece, but eſpecially thoſe of the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers;</hi> which this fair Lady handl'd almoſt without Intermiſſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to him ingenuouſly, <hi>that ſhe had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver touch'd any thing ſo well proportion'd in her Life-time. But Madam</hi> reply'd he, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that ſhe was no novice at the Trade, you have forgot my Lord Preſident's, are not his Parts ſuperiour to mine? Oh! there is a great deal of difference my Dear,</hi> reply'd ſhe with a little Confuſion, I <hi>never met with a more diſagreeable Man in the whole
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:109100:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
courſe of my Life, than he is from Head to Foot; for his Natural Parts both above and below, are ſo inconſiderable, that one wou'd ſwear he had been clipt on all ſides.</hi> This was enough for our Marſhal to ſatisfy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in what he was deſirous to know, concerning this Lady, with whom he had been ſo lately engag'd, and whom he had found alſo very defective as to what he had imagin'd her to be at firſt Sight: Wherefore after ſome farther Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion altogether relating to Love Affairs, he was for taking his leave, but the Lady, who was not ſo ſoon cool'd as he entreated him to ſtay a little longer, which the Marſhal excus'd, under pretence that a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Fit of the Colick had ſeis'd him; ſo that without any farther delay he departed from thence, to give a viſit to one of his Relations, who liv'd in the Suburbs of St. <hi>Germain,</hi> to whom he gave an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this whole Adventure, without mincing the matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O brave!</hi> cry'd this Lady, laughing at him, <hi>now you have catch'd a Tortois indeed, you have beſtow'd your Love upon a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Creature, whoſe chief Reputation is, that ſhe proſtitutes herſelf to all ſorts of Men,</hi> viz, <hi>Prieſts, Monks, Hoſtlers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>nothing comes amiſs to her, even to the Curate of</hi> Meudon, <hi>and he you muſt know is a brave
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:109100:56"/>
Fellow indeed. And what is this terrible Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low pray,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> deſiring her to continue her diſcourſe. <hi>What he is,</hi> reply'd Madam <hi>Garenne, Ill tell you my Dear Kinſman, he beſpatters the reputation of all the Women and Maids in his Pariſh, except ſuch as he knows to be willing to comply with his Brutiſh Luſt. That Impudent Raſcal,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ought to be ſous'd, as well as all the reſt of the Religious Orders, that cannot keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their bounds. I know one my ſelf, whom I make uſe of ſometimes for a Father Confeſſour, who oftner talks of Love, than of Penance to thoſe Ladies, who come to him to Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of the Lady's Gentlewomen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Room, broke off the Diſcourſe, telling her that the Counteſs of—was come to pay her Honour a Viſit. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal very earneſtly looking in the Face of of this Gentlewoman, found her as fair as an Angel, beſides that ſhe had a moſt Charming ſweetneſs in her Speech and whole Deportment; <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers</hi> having been inſtantly touch'd with her Charms, told his Couſin, <hi>that for certain Reaſons he wou'd not be preſent while the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs paid her Viſit, but that in the mean while he wou'd ſtay in her Chamber.</hi> Madam <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi> who had always a great deal of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:109100:57"/>
Complaiſance for him, ſaid to her wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Woman, <hi>Janneton, do you in the mean time entertain my Couſin with the pleaſant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of the unfortunate She Lover,</hi> which was at that time a new Novel much in Vogue, and which her Gentlewoman had got by Heart. She had no ſooner begun to relate the firſt Intrigue, when the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal Squeezing her Hands between his: told her with a very Paſſionate look. <q>I wiſh you wou'd rather tell me ſomewhat concerning your own Love-concerns, than of others, In which I have not the leaſt ſhare.</q> How Sir, reply'd <hi>Janneton</hi> with a bluſh, <q>ſhou'd I relate to you my own Love-Adventures, who never Lov'd in my Life-time?</q> Is it poſſible my faireſt, anſwer'd the Marſhal, <q>that ſo charming a Creature as you ſhou'd not have been made ſenſible of the force of Love. You wou'd Madam, ſaid he, give, but will not take.</q> I don't in the leaſt believe reply'd ſhe, with a very becoming Modeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <q>that it is in my Power to engage any one in Love.</q> Oh! Madam, reply'd the Marſhal ſmiling, <q>you are but only too powerful, for at this very Moment you, have made me your Slave.</q> 
               <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neton</hi> who was unacquainted with ſuch Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Expreſſions, eſpecially coming from the Mouth of ſuch a Gentleman as the

Marqueſs <hi>de Boufflers;</hi> return'd no anſwer to what he ſaid, but riſing from her ſeat, was about to leave the Marſhal alone not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding her Miſtreſſes orders, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him during her Abſence.</p>
            <p>But the Marſhal ſtopping her Paſſage, <q>whether will you fly, ſaid he, my dear Child, pray don't deny to hear my ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</q> What wou'd you have me ſay Sir, reply'd the young Gentlewoman with a bluſh which had ſpread it ſelf all over her Face <q>I don't underſtand your Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and I am much ſurpris'd that you'll ſtoop ſo low as to make it your buſineſs to wheedle ſo inconſiderable a Perſon as I am, who am altogether ignorant in the Love Cards, as in the Art of <hi>Algebra.</hi>
               </q> Thou art in Jeſt ſure my Deareſt, reply'd the Marſhal, going to Kiſs her Mouth which was very ſmall, and as red as Coral; <q>Love, is Natural to both Sexes, and I can read it in thy fair Eyes, that thou art not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of it.</q> Oh! thou pretty Rogue, let me embrace thee, elſe I dye without delay, Dye if you pleaſe Sir, reply'd <hi>Janneton,</hi> puſhing him from her, <q>you are full of your Tranſports and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarities, which are in no wiſe agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my Humour; how long have you known me, thus to call me, <hi>thou</hi> at every turn, you may call your Servant-Maids
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:109100:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo if you pleaſe: As for me, I was born the Daughter of the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fleur,</hi> who is deſcended of a noble and ancient Family in <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> tho' ſomewhat decay'd and under a Cloud at this time. Madam <hi>Garenne</hi> has been pleas'd to take me into her Houſe and does not treat me like a Servant but as a Friend.</q> The Marſhal having conſider'd with himſelf, that his Couſin at her going out of the Room had deſir'd her to entertain him; which Office does not belong to Chamber-maids, he told her, throwing himſelf at her Feet; <q>Madam I beg your Pardon, I was not ſo happy as to know you before, beſides 'twas the exceſs of my Paſſion that made me take too much liberty; but I find you Cruel and Inexorable to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. As far I can ſee, you wou'd let whole Troops of Lovers dye at your Feet, without the leaſt Compaſſion on your ſide; certainly Madam this is a crime of the higheſt Nature, to be ſo Inhuman.</q> I take it to be a greater Crime in you Sir, reply'd <hi>Janneton,</hi> laughing at his being in this Poſture, to endeavour to perſwade <q>us, if we were ſo Fooliſh as to believe it, that you are moſt Paſſionately in Love with all ſuch Perſons, to whom you addreſs your Courtſhips; but as for my part, you muſt excuſe me, if I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:109100:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
give Credit to your Aſſeverations, I know a little too well the true Character of you Courtiers, not by Experience, but by the Relations of others, who have had the Opportunity to try 'em. And what do thoſe pretty incredulous Creatures ſay of us, reply'd the Marſhal careleſly. O Sir, ſaid <hi>Janneton,</hi> they'll tell you of a thouſand Diſſembling and Perfidious tricks, ſuch as are altogether unbecoming a great Soul: I wonder how Gentlemen of Quality can condeſcend to make uſe of ſuch mean ways to deceive our Sex; I ſhou'd think that Love, being the moſt innocent Commerce among us Mortals, ſhou'd be founded upon honourable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</q> You have ſpoke very well, my moſt adorable <hi>Janneton,</hi> cry'd the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal Tranſported with Paſſion; <q>but you muſt conſider that theſe Lady's of whom you ſpeak, deal ſomewhat unjuſtly with us, in repreſenting all Men of one and the ſame Temper: There are ſome that are Lovers of Honour and Integrity, and wou'd ſcorn to deal upon other Terms with your Sex; thanks to my Stars, I am of the number of theſe, and I wou'd ſooner,</q> added he, drawing his Sword out of the Scabbard, <q>thruſt this thro' my Heart than deceive a Lady that Loves me. Then Sir, reply'd the young Lady ſmiling, one
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:109100:59"/>
muſt Love you, if one wou'd make ſure of your Heart. Yes Divine Creature, ſaid Monſieur <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> that is the only way to Conquer it and to make it your Vaſſal.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Madam <hi>Garenne,</hi> who had re-conducted the Counteſs to her Coach, coming in, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted 'em, otherwiſe our General wou'd not have broke off ſo ſoon; But this Lady as ſoon as ſhe was enter'd <q>well Couſin ſaid She, has <hi>Mademoiſelle de la Fleur</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd you with ſome ſatisfaction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the unfortunate She-Lover?</q> Yes Madam, reply'd the Marſhal, caſting a tender look upon <hi>Janneton,</hi> 
               <q>but I have in my turn, entertain'd her with that of the Unfortunate He Lover, who cou'd not perſwade his Miſtreſs of his ſincerity, upon which ſubject I have enlarg'd to the utmoſt of my Ability. Your <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle</hi> there, is the moſt unlucky, unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Creature in the World, ſhe will not believe a Word one ſays; except you forſwear your ſelf to the Devil, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perſwade her of the leaſt thing that can be.</q> 
               <hi>O dear Couſin,</hi> ſaid Madam <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne, don't Swear; you are not ignorant that the fair Sex is always incredulous, and that they take a particular Pride in making their Gallants languiſh for 'em. Plague! on this way of making Love;</hi> reply'd the Marqueſs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, I <hi>wou'd have 'em take my Word at
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:109100:59"/>
firſt. Oh! my dear Kinſman,</hi> anſwer'd the Lady, <hi>this wou'd abate a great deal of the pleaſure; you know that every thing that is bought dear pleaſes beſt: If a Woman ſhou'd at firſt ſight ſurrender her Heart, you wou'd be deprivd of the moſt charming part of your Paſſion: What is eaſily obtain'd, ſoon looſes its Vigour, and fades as faſt as it grows. But come, let us talk of other more ſubſtantial matters; one cannot live upon Love, and in my mind, Love is but a ſlender Diet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No ſooner had the Lady broke off this Diſcourſe, but ſhe order'd that a good Collation ſhou'd be got ready; in the mean time, the Marſhal who appear'd very penſive, retir'd into another Room, where having fix'd his Eyes upon ſeveral Pictures repreſenting ſome Rural Nymphs, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted himſelf with ſome Paſtoral Songs; which his Kinſwoman having taken notice of; <hi>Come, Come, Couſin,</hi> cry'd ſhe, <hi>awake out of your Amourous ſlumber, come taſte whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Wine be good. By my Faith Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> anſwer'd the Marſhal, <hi>I am ſo drunk with Love, that all other Food is inſipid, every thing elſe is indifferent to me: Not very long ago,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>being at Supper with the two Marſhals,</hi> de Crequi <hi>and</hi> de Navaille, <hi>and my Thoughts being taken up with a certain amourous Aſſignation at a place where I had been entertain'd ſome time before, with a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:109100:60"/>
great deal of Delight and Satisfaction; theſe Gentlemen finding me thus penſive, were ſo ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as to ſlip upon my Plate a great piece of a Candle, which I ſwallow'd ere I was aware of it, and when this was done, you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they jeer'd me very handſomely. What a Fool doſt thou make thy ſelf,</hi> Boufflers, ſaid Madam <hi>Garenne, thus to put thy ſelf into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourous Raptures; if a compleat Hiſtory of thy Love-adventures were to be committed to Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, it wou'd undoubtedly make a very large Volume. When you have drunk this Glaſs of Wine,</hi> (which ſhe preſented to him,) <hi>be ſo Complaiſant,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>as to tell me who it is that at preſent has Captivated your Heart. And wou'd you have me tell you ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely my dear Kinſwoman,</hi> reply'd the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, <hi>'tis</hi> Mademoiſelle de la Fleur, <hi>who has chain'd me ſo cloſely, that I ſhall ſcarce be able to bear it long, except this lovely Child will take ſome pitty on me: She appears to me the moſt amiable Perſon in the World; her pretty little Mouth, her roguiſh Eyes, which ſend forth their Rays like ſo many Darts every moment: Lord! I ſhall run Mad, if I think any longer of 'em: Come, Truce in Love for ſome time; Come let us drink once,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a hearty draught of Wine, which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary good: Here is to your beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; here is to your charming Eyes,</hi> ſaid he, to <hi>Mademoiſelle de la Fleur,</hi> who was juſt
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:109100:60"/>
coming into the Room. <hi>Come Janneton,</hi> ſaid Madam <hi>Garenne</hi> laughing, <hi>Pledge the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal that ſame Health. Madam,</hi> reply'd the young Gentlewoman very modeſtly, <hi>I have buſineſs of greater moment than to pledge the Marſhal's Health to my Inclinations, which as I am apt to believe are not agreeable to his ſentiments, who admires good natur'd and ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Lady's. and thoſe too muſt be as ſweet and tender as young Mutton. Thus I wou'd wiſh it to be</hi> Mademoiſelle, reply'd the Marſhal, taking her by the Hand. <hi>Pray Sir,</hi> ſaid <hi>Janneton</hi> very gravely, <hi>let me go, I am juſt now about to paint you one, which I am ſure will pleaſe you. Provided ſhe be like you,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers, I am ſure I ſhall like her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mademoiſelle de la Fleur</hi> being gone out of the Room, our General, who was really in Love both with her Wit and engaging Air, ſpoke concerning her with a great deal of earneſtneſs to his Couſin, who gave him to underſtand that ſhe was a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman of good Quality, and that out of Reſpect, ſhe had made her her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. <hi>Indeed ſhe told me ſo,</hi> anſwer'd the Marſhal, <hi>and ſhe did not forget to mention the great Obligations ſhe had to you: I have a great deal of Compaſſion for her upon that ſcore,</hi> reply'd the Lady; <hi>truely I know her to be a young Woman of a good Reputation, and I
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:109100:61"/>
hope ſhe has Wit enough to keep it. And ſo do I Madam,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal, <hi>if ſhe will take my Word for it, I aſſure you I Love her as much</hi>—The Lady having ſoon underſtood the Marſhal's meaning, <hi>Pray Couſin,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>don't you go about to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch this young Gentlewoman, for whom I have a particular kindneſs; it is a ſtrange thing that you Gentlemen cannot employ your time better, than to put Love-tricks into the young Womens Heads, who of a ſudden turn Fools, and are undone by it. Your Amourous Intreagues are as dangerous as your Martial Exploits: You talk of nothing when you are together, but of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming of Hearts as well as Villages by Fire, and by your good will you wou'd reduce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing to Aſhes: Come employ you Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks in another Place, than in my Houſe which you ought to Honour and Reſpect. But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal briskly, <hi>ſuppoſing this Fire you ſpeak of ſhou'd firſt break out in your Houſe, may not a Man complain of 'it, or make himſelf ſatisfaction? Ay, Ay, you are never unprovided for a Repartee,</hi> reply'd the Lady, <hi>but let me deſire you, if you will oblige me, not to talk of Love to</hi> Janneton, <hi>whenever you ſee her. Then the Devil take me my dear Couſin,</hi> ſaid <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers</hi> haſtily, <hi>if any thing in the World can make me do that; at that rate</hi> I <hi>muſt go and cut out my—I dare not name it. Oh!</hi> cry'd
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:109100:61"/>
the Lady laughing, <hi>you are not half ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as you wou'd make us believe. Farewel, you are only ſick in Fancy,</hi> I <hi>leave you to your ſelf. But Madam,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal pleaſantly, <hi>and ſhall I not have the liberty to love</hi> Mademoiſelle de la Fleur, <hi>and to tell her—No, No, not her,</hi> cry'd the Lady, <hi>Declare your Paſſion to ſome Body elſe, where it will turn to better Account:</hi> Janneton <hi>was not made for ſuch Sparks as you. You may ſay what you pleaſe my dear Couſin,</hi> ſaid the Marſhal, juſt as he was going, <hi>but this I am ſure of, I am reſolv'd to adore her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No ſooner was the Marſhal gone, but Madam <hi>Garenne</hi> call'd for <hi>Janneton,</hi> who was at that time making a piece of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery-work, which was the Figure of <hi>Diana,</hi> wrought with Silk and Gold; ſhe had repreſented this Goddeſs ſo lively, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting juſt upon the Banks of a ſmall Current, that it was charming to behold, and one cou'd not chuſe but extremely admire both the skill of the Work-Woman, and the exactneſs of the Work. When ſhe was come down to Madam <hi>Garanna,</hi> ſhe began to give her a very ſober Leſſon concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> whom ſhe told her, ſhe muſt by no means hearken to, but fly from his preſence, as that of her greateſt Enemy; <hi>if you did but know my Deareſt,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>unto what danger a young
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:109100:62"/>
Woman expoſes her ſelf, whenever ſhe lends an Ear to the flattering Courtſhips of your Soldiers, it wou'd make you ſtand amaz'd; nothing but what is terrible and frightful belongs to 'em, and a vertuous Woman muſt inevitably looſe her Reputation, if ſhe be converſant with 'em; if they happen to meet with any one that is ſo fooliſh as to be catch'd in the Snare, ſhe will be ſure to be rewarded with a certain loathſome Diſtemper, which is not fit to be nam'd, and makes a great many Women undergo the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trydom of Love. Young Women, who deſign to make their Fortune in the World, muſt not ſet up for light Houſe-Wives, but fly from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Men, as it were ſo many evil Spirits; this is the ready way to advance themſelves the ſooner by a good Match. I remember that the firſt time that I ſaw my Husband, I had not till then ſpoke to any other Man; in ſomuch that he was more taken with my innocent Behaviour than with my Beauty and Portion, tho' both of 'em (if I may ſay it without Vanity) were not deſpiſeable. I having at that time the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being one of the moſt beautifull VVomen in</hi> Paris. <hi>You have ſtill a great ſhare of it,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Janneton</hi> ſmiling, <hi>you are ſtill worthy of the ſame Character. Let us ſet jeſting a ſide,</hi> reply'd the Lady, <hi>and let us return to</hi> Boufflers, <hi>who is one of the moſt dangerous Men in the World; to hear him talk of his Paſſion, you wou'd imagine that the whole Univerſe was not able
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:109100:62"/>
to contain it, which often comes to no more than a Viſit. I don't know Madam,</hi> reply'd <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle de la Fleur,</hi> with a very ſerious Countenance, <hi>why you ſhou'd give ſuch a Leſſon to me, who never knew any thing of the General, but what I heard you ſpeak, and to whom I never ſpoke in my Life before, till now. Well, Well,</hi> Janneton, ſaid Madam <hi>Garenne, that advantage is not very great on your ſide: For to tell you the true motive, which makes me talk thus to you; you muſt know that he has declar'd to me, that he is fall'n in Love with you: Jeſus Maria,</hi> reply'd <hi>Janneton,</hi> much ſurpris'd <hi>is it poſſible that he ſhou'd be ſo Silly, as to tell you a thing of this nature, which I am apt to believe he ſcarce ever dream'd of? Madam if you will take my opinion in the matter, it was only to divert himſelf; don't you obſerve what delight he takes to banter the Women. He banters 'em often to ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi> ſaid the Lady laughing, <hi>he has by theſe bant'ring Tricks got many a young Soldier to defend our Frontiers. 'Tis not above two Months ago that a young Country-Damſel brought forth at one Birth two luſty Boys of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting which I believe lye a little hard upon him at preſent, becauſe he is oblig'd to take care as well of the Mother, as of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whom he ſays, he will make his Foot-men, as ſoon as they are able to wear a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very-Coat. He does very well,</hi> reply'd <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:109100:63"/>
de la Fleur, to find out ſo honourable an Employment for 'em in time,</hi> Madam, <hi>I wou'd have you be at reſt as to this Point, for I aſſure you that I never ſhall love</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Boufflers.</p>
            <p>But Alaſs! how difficult a task it is for a young tender Heart to forſwear Love, which by degrees Triumphs over all the World. This fair One was no ſooner got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up into her Chamber again, but ſhe began to feel ſome extraordinary Emotions for the Marſhal, whoſe <hi>Idea</hi> was firmly fixt in her Mind, tho' ſhe had ſpoke of him with ſo much indifferency to her Lady: It ſeem'd as if the Leſſon which ſhe had receiv'd from her Mouth, had only ſerv'd to raiſe ſome kind of tenderneſs in her Heart, of which ſhe was not ſo ſenſible before. <hi>I Love him in ſpite of what reſiſtance I can make,</hi> ſaid <hi>Janneton,</hi> while ſhe was ruminating upon the matter; <hi>the</hi> Idea <hi>I have conceiv'd of him, begins to be very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable to me; if I had not been ſo much Tutor'd about it, perhaps I ſhou'd never have lov'd him: What ſtrange Fatality! They deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe him to me as a Man equally terrible both in Love and War, but good God! notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all this, I am not able to controll my growing Paſſion, I am ſenſible I ſhou'd ſtifle that ſecret Voice which calls to me,</hi> Love, Love, <hi>and I ſhou'd not make the leaſt return to the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:109100:63"/>
Marſhal's Proteſtations, which like Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claps ſoon ſtrike down to the Ground a Heart ſo feeble as mine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She was making theſe Reflections with herſelf, when Madam <hi>Garenne,</hi> who began to repent of having ſaid ſo much to her upon that Subject, coming up into her Chamber, ask'd her, <hi>whether her Work went on a pace? Yes Madam,</hi> reply'd the young Gentlewoman, in a very Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Tone, <hi>I do what I can to bring it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward! What is the matter with you</hi> Janne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, ſaid the Lady, looking in her Face, <hi>you ſeem to be much diſcompos'd; what is it that diſturbs you? Nothing Madam,</hi> reply'd ſhe, <hi>'tis impoſſible for any Perſon always to retain an even Temper; there is none that is not out of Humour at certain times. I don't deny that my Dear,</hi> anſwer'd the Lady, <hi>but at the ſame time, a young Woman as you are, muſt not give way to Melancholy Fancies, What can be the cauſe of it? Janneton</hi> made no further anſwer, but under pretence of looking about for ſomething that ſhe had miſ-laid, ſhe got free of her Lady, who began to be troubleſome to her at that time; for the Lady imagining that her ſilence proceeded from being to over diligent at her Work, left her to her ſelf in her Chamber, and went down into her own, where ſhe ſpent her time in reading a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:109100:64"/>
Book of Devotion, which bears the Title of <hi>Moral Reflections upon the Lives of the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us leave theſe two Lady's for a little while, and ſee what is become of our Marſhal, who went to his Lodgings as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amour'd as ever he was in Life-time: He repreſented to his Imagination the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Mademoiſelle de la Fleur,</hi> which had ſuch an influence over his Spirits, that he did neither Sleep nor Eat, as he us'd to do, becauſe he never went either to Bed or Table, without being diſturb'd by his amourous Diſorders: He appear'd always penſive, being overwhelm'd with a thouſand diſtracting Cares, which almoſt reduc'd him to the extremity of Deſpair, when he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd with himſelf all the obſtacles which he was to ſurmount before he cou'd have the leaſt hopes of obtaining his aim; for Madam <hi>Garenne</hi> his Couſin had peremto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily declar'd that ſhe wou'd not allow of the leaſt Intercourſe between him and his Miſtreſs, from whom he as yet had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd but very ſmall encouragement;—but that which afforded him moſt Conſolation was, that he had obſerv'd in her whole deportment a natural inclination to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, tho' ſhe feign'd in ſome of her Actions a great deal of haughtineſs and cruelty. This hope (the common atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:109100:64"/>
of Love) made him ruminate a long time what means might be moſt expedient for the accompliſhing of his Deſign, which was contrary to the Will of his Friend; to whom he ow'd infinite obligations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was her Husband who had lent him the Mony, with which he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd the Royal Regiment of Dragoons, which he commanded as Colonel at that time. However, all theſe conſiderations were not ſtrong enough to divert him from purſuing his former Intentions.</p>
            <p>But before he went again to his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin's, he took a Reſolution firſt to go and give a Viſit to his Counſellor, <hi>Monſicur Nigueſe,</hi> being now reſolv'd to break quite off with his Wife, for whom he cou'd not any longer have either Love or eſteem: When he came to the Counſellor's Houſe, he ask'd him for his Writings, at which the Lawyer being much ſurpris'd, told him that he ſcarce had time enough to peruſe'em, deſiring him to let him know the reaſon of his calling for 'em ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly. <hi>No other Reaſon Sir,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal, <hi>but that both Parties have agreed the matter; pray let me know how much I am indebted to you for your trouble. Monſieur Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> who was a Maſter at his Trade, as moſt of that Profeſſion are, made him a Bill; which amounted to as much as if
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:109100:65"/>
he had manag'd the whole Cauſe from the beginning to the end. <hi>What the Devil,</hi> ſaid the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> whilſt he was paying the Mony; <hi>Do you thus manage all your Clients Purſes? I think he was in the right on't that was wont to compare you Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors and Sollicitors to Familiar Spirits, who uſually get all the Mony they can, to carry it along with 'em to Hell into</hi> Lucifer's <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury.</hi> The Lawyer perceiving an Affront to be put upon him by this Expreſſion, told him <hi>that he cou'd find a way to make him hold his Tongue,</hi> and taking him by one Arm, was ready to thruſt him out of the doors. <hi>How now Block-head,</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Monſieur Boufflers, I'll make you know whom you have to do withal,</hi> and no ſooner had he ſpoke theſe Words, but he ſeconded 'em with his Sword, which he very ſmartly laid over the Counſellor's Head; <hi>take this for your Pains,</hi> ſaid our General, <hi>Mr. Cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old, take this, it may ſerve to poliſh your Horns a little, which as yet are ſomewhat rugged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam <hi>Nigueſe</hi> the Counſellor's Wife having heard a ſudden noiſe in the Entry, came running out with all ſpeed to ſee waht might be the matter: She happen'd juſt at that time to be in Company with a Frier, who as 'twas ſuppos'd, was accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to kiſs her in Private, and being ſurpris'd at the Scuffle, had forgot to put down her
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:109100:65"/>
Petty-coats, which were ſtill up as high as to her Knees: When ſhe ſaw her Husband and Gallant thus engag'd, ſhe was ſo extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely amaz'd, that ſhe was not able to ſpeak one Word, but ſeeing the Marſhal lay his Sword over her Husband's Horn's without intermiſſion, ſhe cou'd do nothing elſe but make a moſt lamentable out-cry, which ſoon brought the Frier out to her aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but in as bad a Condition as her ſelf: For the good Father had forgot in the fright to put up his Buſineſs in its right place, which was all expos'd to the view of the Spectators; <hi>Monſieur Boufflers</hi> as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry as he was (having receiv'd ſome blows from the Counſellor) cou'd not forbear laughing out aloud; <hi>How now,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Religious Father, if a Man may call you ſo, are you not aſham'd to act thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove board? You pretend to teach us Chaſtity, and you appear in our ſight juſt recking from your unchaſt Embraces; fy! what a ſhameleſs ſight is this! And pulling him by the Sleeve, at leaſt Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>put up your Concerns.</hi> The Frier and the Lady being in the mean while recover'd from their firſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, began now to be ſenſible of their miſtake, but being put all into confuſion, they run away as faſt as they cou'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making the leaſt anſwer. The poor Counſellor was no leſs ſurpris'd than the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:109100:66"/>
other two, becauſe he had ſeen his Horns in their Natural ſhape, without diſguiſe, which made him retreat as faſt as he cou'd to his Study, after he had been ſoundly drub'd by the Marſhal, who thus remaining Maſter of the Field of Battel, decamp'd immediately from thence with his Writings in his Poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>A few days after, being now pretty well recover'd of his Paſſion, which he had had for the Counſellor's Wife, he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make a viſit to Madam <hi>Garenne,</hi> to give her an account of this laſt Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but conſidering with himſelf, that ſhe wou'd only laugh at him, he deferr'd it till a more convenient Opportunity. The next day, paſſing by chance by her Houſe, about four a Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and the Door being juſt open, he eſpy'd <hi>Janneton,</hi> who was conducting out one of her Acquaintance: The Marſhal perceiv'd her to bluſh at the ſight of him, and as he was drawing nearer to accoſt her, ſhe made away with all the haſte ſhe cou'd. <hi>Boufflers,</hi> who never wants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Mind, upon ſuch an occaſion as this, follow'd her cloſe, <hi>and why,</hi> ſaid he, Mademoiſelle <hi>do you ſhun me, what is it that is ſo frightful about me? Yes Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neton</hi> not with out ſome diſturbance, <hi>I dread you in a moſt terrible manner, and that too not
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:109100:66"/>
without a great many weighty Reaſons; but for Heaven's ſake don't force me to declare 'em to you; if your Kinſwoman ſhou'd happen to ſee us together, ſhe wou'd not think very well of it. I am not ignorant of that matter, my dear Child,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal, <hi>but for God's ſake ſtay but one Moment: Never any Mortal ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd ſo much as I have done, neither Lov'd to that degree as I do. All thoſe pathetical Expreſſions commonly us'd by Lovers to make their Miſtreſſes ſenſible of the Vehemency of their Paſſion, fall far ſhort of what I can ſay of mine. You have robb'd me of my Liberty my fair An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and I must be the moſt unfortunate of all Men living, except you take compaſſion of my Sufferings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He cou'd not utter theſe laſt Words without ſhedding ſome Tears, which wrought no ill effect upon the the fair One, that was the occaſion of 'em, and who anſwer'd in Terms ſo obliging, and with ſo charming an Air, to what he had ſaid to her, that the Marſhal was no longer Maſter of himſelf, but reſolv'd to proſecute his Deſign in ſpite of his Kinſ-woman's endeavours to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, But <hi>Janneton</hi> who conſider'd that if this Lady ſhou'd return ſooner from Viſiting than ſhe expected, ſhe wou'd be chid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, and be in danger of utterly loſing her Favour, begg'd with all the Civility ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, her Lover to leave her for that time
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:109100:67"/>
which he did, not thinking it reaſonable to diſoblige her, who run ſo much hazard for his ſake. Among the reſt of the Servants of the Houſe, there was an old Maid, whoſe name was <hi>Toinette,</hi> ſhe was the Governeſs of the Kitchen, and having obſerv'd our two Lovers prattling together, ſhe adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd Madam <hi>Garenne</hi> of it as ſoon as ſhe came Home, who being tranſported with Anger, chid <hi>Janneton</hi> moſt ſeverely, which ſhe wou'd have endur'd patiently enough if this Lady had not ſeconded her Words with ſuch a ſound Box on the Ear, that ſhe tumbl'd down upon one ſide; calling her at the ſame time wanton Slut, an impudent and diſſembling Wretch, &amp;c. <hi>You will e're long find the effects of his Courtſhip,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>if you are Fool enough to hearken to 'em: He is the moſt fickle Man in the World; he never loves above one Moment; he has as many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes as he has Shirts to his Back, and he changes 'em twice or thrice a Week. Is this your modeſty? Is this your Conduct, which made you to be ſo much reſpected among People of vertuous Principles?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mademoiſelle de la Fleur</hi> who cou'd not well digeſt the box o'th' Ear, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn one Word, but pretending that ſhe wou'd go up into her Chamber, ſhe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately pack'd up all her Goods and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, and paſs'd immediately thro' the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:109100:67"/>
from whence ſhe got out at a Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door, which open'd directly into the ſame Street where the Marſhal lodg'd, who ſaw her come forth as he was looking out of the Window. He was never more ſurpris'd in his Life time, than when he perceiv'd her Eyes all Red and Swell'd with Tears. <hi>What can be the matter</hi> Mademoiſelle, ſaid he, coming towards her; <hi>dare I be ſo bold as to ask you, what makes you weep thus? Alaſs! Sir</hi> Said ſhe, <hi>I am undone.</hi> The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, who was juſt by his Lodgings, made her a ſign to follow him, not thinking it a proper place there, to talk of matters of Moment. <hi>It is not very Convenient,</hi> reply'd ſhe with a bluſh, <hi>to go with you into your Lodgings, but what matter is it, I am deſperate and care not what becomes of me? That is all but a Jeſt,</hi> anſwer'd the Marſhal, taking her by the Hand, I <hi>will tell my Land-Lady you are my Siſter,</hi> which he did, and the good Woman believ'd it for a conſiderable time. Our fair one being gone up with the Marſhal into his Chamber, burſt out all in Tears, giving him an account of what had paſs'd between the Lady and her: <q>To give a box on the Ear to a Gentlewoman of my Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> and that too, for no other reaſon but becauſe I had diſcours'd with a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of Honour, certainly is the moſt unbecoming Action that ever cou'd be
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:109100:68"/>
done by a ſenſible Woman. I am quite out of all Patience, <hi>reply'd Boufflers,</hi> if I were to follow my Inclination, I ſhou'd go and ſtick that old Witch, who inform'd her of it to the Wall; ſhe often paſſes by here, and I'll have her Baſtonado'd by one of my Servants, ſhe ſhall have the Strapado till the Blood follows. Have a care of that, <hi>reply'd</hi> Janneton, for that wou'd be the way to undo me without Redreſs. And what my Deareſt, <hi>ſaid the Marſhal embracing her,</hi> wou'd you not have me revenge your Quarrel, I aſſure you that I ſhall always be ready to hazard my Life for your ſake. 'Tis I who am the cauſe of theſe extravagancies which my Couſin has committed againſt you, and I ask your Pardon a thouſand times upon that account.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe his amourous Proteſtations were accompany'd with ſuch Paſſionate Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and intermingl'd with ſo many ſweet Kiſſes, which he ſtole from his fair Angel, that ſix or ſeven Hours paſs'd thus away no otherwiſe than if it had been one Moment; in the mean while Night began to approach, and <hi>Mademoiſelle de la Fleur</hi> reflecting upon the matter, how unbecoming it was for a modeſt Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be thus late in an Officer's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who was one of the greateſt Gallants
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:109100:68"/>
about the Town, and ruminating hovv ſhe ſhou'd beſt diſpoſe of her ſelf; becauſe her Lover had not in the leaſt taken notice of it, ſhe was not a little ſurpris'd to ſee the Land-Lady come in, who immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told her that if ſhe pleas'd there was a Chamber ready for her in the Houſe, not far from the Marſhal's, which he had caus'd to be furniſh'd very handſomely for her uſe. <hi>You need ſay no more Mrs. Borgne,</hi> ſaid the Marſhal, <hi>my Siſter whom I have not ſeen a great while, will ſtay here for ſome time; Pray let Supper be got ready.</hi> The Land-Lady went down to look after Supper, leaving the Brother and Siſter at their own Liberty, who did not live long toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame condition; as you'll find by the ſequel of the Story: Supper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready, <hi>Monſieur Boufflers</hi> order'd it to be brought up into his Chamber, becauſe he intended to Sup in private, and poor <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neton</hi> ſat there like a <hi>Carthuſian</hi> Frier, that is to ſay, without ſpeaking one Word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhy of the Marſhal's Servants who waited at Table, and look'd upon her as a chance-Lady, the Marſhal obſerv'd it as well as ſhe, but there was no Remedy for it.</p>
            <p>Having Supp'd and diſmiſs'd the Servants, he conducted her into the Chamber which was prepar'd for her, where ſhe ſtay'd a good part of the Night, which was ſpent
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:109100:69"/>
at the Feet of his Miſtreſs, and in reiterated aſſurances of the ſincerity of his Paſſion. 'Tis eaſie to be imagin'd, what ſort of Language two Perſons, that lov'd one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did make uſe of, at a time when all the World was at reſt. <hi>Janneton</hi> being now ſomewhat weary'd with the Careſſes receiv'd from her Lover, was willing to go to ſleep, notwithſtanding the continual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties of the Marſhal, who has ſince proteſted to me, with all the ſincerity imaginable, that he never met with any young Lady ſo Lovely, ſo Modeſt, and ſo worthy of his Heart as ſhe was: Having at her deſire quitted her Room, he went likewiſe to his own Chamber, to take ſome reſt after his Love-toils, which by this time had caus'd him to endure no ſmall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues.</p>
            <p>Let us leave theſe two Lovers for a little while, to enjoy their Reſt, whilſt we go and obſerve how Madam <hi>Garenne</hi> takes the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopement of her Companion: This Lady having miſs'd her, caus'd Candles to be lighted immediately, and order'd the Houſe to be ſearch'd from top to bottom. <hi>What is become of this Impudent Baggage,</hi> wou'd ſhe cry, being ſometimes in the Garret, and anon in the Cellar, after ſhe had look'd long enough for her in all the Chambers of the Houſe; <q>I hope, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> ſhe has
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:109100:69"/>
thrown herſelf into the River or ſome Pond, what an unfortunate Woman was I, when I took upon me the charge of this wanton Slut, who has play'd me a trick that I did not in the leaſt dream of? What can become of her? If the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> ſhou'd get the leaſt ſcent of this miſchance, he will quickly be with her.</q> I believe Madam, <hi>ſaid Toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette,</hi> 
               <q>that that is not to be done now, for I am almoſt ſure that ſhe is with him already: If you had been an Eye-Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe Careſſes which he ſo Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally beſtow'd upon her, you wou'd not queſtion it any more than I do. Alaſs! a perfidious Man as he is, <hi>reply'd the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> he loves all handſome Women; but God is my Witneſs, that it is ſeldom for above two or three Weeks, to obtain his aim, and then he wiſhes 'em in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother part of the World. Don't let us talk any more of the Paſſion of a Man whoſe inclinations are ſo fickle and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant; 'tis impoſſible that he can have any real Friendſhip for any one living; I am convinc'd of it by the treatment I have receiv'd from him: After my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band has done for him what he has, he was ſo much indebted to me; that he ought to have Sacrifis'd every thing in acknowledgment of ſuch a Friendſhip, inſtead of which, he cauſes me theſe Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:109100:70"/>
               <q>But pray, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> tell me, in what manner did he careſs her, who never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood any thing of theſe matters, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarce ever ſeen a Man in private ſince ſhe was a Child, when her Father gave her into my Charge? Sure Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam you are not in earneſt, <hi>anſwer'd the old Maid laughing,</hi> theſe things are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to us, they are learn'd without much exerciſe. But pray tell me, <hi>ſaid Madam</hi> Garenne, what did he do to her? What ſhou'd he do to her Madam? <hi>reply'd</hi> Toinette, he kiſs'd ſometimes her Hands, and ſometimes her Lips; he lay down at her Feet juſt like a Fool; he embrac'd her, calling her at the ſame time his Deity, his Angel, and a thouſand ſuch like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies. Oh! that idle Baggage! <hi>ſaid the Lady,</hi> ſhe will like this ſport mightily for ſome time, till ſhe be put out of taſte with it.</q> Madam <hi>Garenne</hi> wou'd have continu'd her diſcourſe, if her Domeſtick Affairs had not call'd for her preſence another way, where we will leave her, and return to our two Lovers.</p>
            <p>The Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> now in full poſſeſſion of his Miſtreſs, was not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give her every day new Proofs of his Love; aſſuring her that it ſhou'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be inviolable, which promiſe; he made a ſhift to keep for ſome time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng very generous to her in all reſpects:
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:109100:70"/>
But as all things are ſubject to change, ſo it happen'd here; for our General being order'd to march into the Field, he was ſoon forc'd to quitt his Miſtreſs; There it was that he provided a Husband for her, having found out a certain Gentleman of his Acquaintance, who was willing to wear that Coat of Arms, which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal had prepar'd for him, provided he wou'd encourage him with his Favour.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de la Garenne</hi> his Kinſwoman, who not having had the opportunity to ſpeak to him before his departure, and therefore had writ ſeveral ſmart Letters to him, was overjoy'd at this Match, but poor <hi>Janneton,</hi> as I am to believe, was of a quite contrary Opinion, who now was to be made ſenſible that the Promiſes of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are as wavering as the Billows of the Sea. It is to be known that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal in the height of his Paſſion, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to marry her, and to confirme it the more, had ſign'd this Engagement with his own Blood: I have alſo been credibly inform'd that when he was upon concluding the intended March in the Camp, he rode Poſt from thence to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> where having found out his Miſtreſs at her Lodgings, <hi>my Deareſt,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>let me ſee the Contract which I ſign'd, I am come on purpoſe to alter ſome particulars in it, which are not done as they ought to have been;</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:109100:71"/>
He had no ſooner ſpoke theſe Words and having receiv'd the Paper from her Hands, who took him upon his Honour, but he tore it in a thouſand peices; <hi>Mademoiſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le de la Fleur</hi> being horribly ſurpris'd at theſe Proceedings, ask'd him all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd with Grief and Tears, <hi>what was the reaſon of his ſo doing? Only for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which I told you before, my Deareſt,</hi> ſaid he, giving her a Kiſs; and finding her to take the matter ſo much to Heart, the better to cover his deſign, he put the point of his naked Sword to his Breaſt, feigning a Reſolution to kill himſelf, tho' he had not the leaſt thought of it: The poor ſilly Gentlewoman, who doted upon him, ſnatch'd his Sword from him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that ſhe wou'd rely upon his Word, which ſoon after was tranſmuted into that Marriage we ſpoke of before.</p>
            <p>Some Years after, which was <hi>A. D.</hi> 1683. His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty upon ſome Complaints receiv'd of ſeveral Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities committed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> againſt his Subjects, order'd the Marſhal <hi>de Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mieres</hi> to beſiege <hi>Courtray,</hi> where alſo were preſent the Princes <hi>de Conti</hi> and <hi>De la Roche ſur yon,</hi> the Count <hi>de Verman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois</hi> Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> and ſeveral other Perſons of Quality: I have not been able to learn whether the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> at his return into the Dominions of his
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:109100:71"/>
moſt Catholick Majeſty, was for making another Conqueſt among the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lady's, who are only charming to the Eye. We will let this Year paſs by in ſilence, and proceed to the next, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by ſeveral Acts of Hoſtility forc'd the <hi>French</hi> to a total rupture with <hi>Spain:</hi> But <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Boufflers</hi> ſoon made 'em ſenſible of their Error by ravaging thro' all the Villages between the Fort of St. <hi>Margreat</hi> and the City of <hi>Mons,</hi> where having eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py'd a certain Gentlewoman, the Widow of a <hi>Dutch</hi> Officer, who had been kill'd in a late Engagement; ſhe alone was able to move him with Compaſſion.</p>
            <p>This Lady was wont to go every Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Evening to viſit the Place where her Husband was bury'd, which ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew'd very frequently with her Tears. The Marſhal, who had taken ſome liking to her before, going one Morning the Rounds according to his uſual Cuſtom every Day, found her at her Husband's Grave, at three a Clock in the Morning, and ask'd her <q>whether ſhe had ſeen that Ghoſt ſhe look'd for. Alaſs! no Sir, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> my dearly Belov'd has not as yet appear'd to me, but I very impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently deſire to ſee him. Sure Madam, <hi>reply'd the General,</hi> you cannot be ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as to expect the Dead to come back into this World; and tho' it be the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:109100:72"/>
general Opinion, for my part I cannot believe it: Wherefore young Lady, I wou'd not have you thus beſtow your time in running after a ſhadow, which has nothing Solid in it: I wou'd have you look after the Living; you ought much rather to conſider of one who may be able to comfort you for your loſs.</q> The Lady not diſliking the Marſhal's Propoſal, began to hearken to his diſcourſe, <q>and Sir, <hi>ſaid ſhe very briskly,</hi> do you know one that is willing to ſupply the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant place? Yes, <hi>ſaid</hi> Monſieur Boufflers, (who meant otherwiſe than ſhe) I know a certain Cavalier, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may give you more ſatisfaction than he, whoſe loſs you ſo much bewail.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Madam <hi>Backenbroodt,</hi> (this was the Name of the Lady) having ſoon underſtood the Marſhal's meaning gave him no anſwer, at all, either out out of Modeſty or Fear, the latter being a common infirmity among Women of that Country. <hi>Boufflers,</hi> who at firſt ſight judg'd very right of her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſpoſition, did in very obliging Terms ask her where ſhe Lodg'd, which ſhe told him. The Marſhal who is never backward in paying his viſits to Lady's for whom he has ſome kindneſs, went to ſee her, and repreſented to her his Paſſion ſo ſincerely, that ſhe receiv'd his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes without much reluctancy, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:109100:72"/>
that ſhe had now got another Hus<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>band; but poor Creature ſhe was not well enough acquainted with the <hi>French</hi> Faſhion. They continu'd their amourous Commerce thus for ſome time, till one Evening, when the Marſhal being in a very good Humour, after having drunk plentifully with ſome of the Generals in their Tents, was reſolv'd to have ſome reliſh as well of the ſweets of <hi>Venus,</hi> as he had had of thoſe of <hi>Bacchus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to proſecute his Deſign, he went to viſit Madam <hi>Backenbroodt,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd him very Courteouſly, and after ſome little time ſpent in amourous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations and paſſionate Expreſſions, he at laſt begg'd of her the utmoſt Favour. The Gentlewoman (according to the practice of a great many Women of that Country, who think they have made a fair ſtep towards Marriage, if they refuſe not to beſtow every thing upon their Lovers) made no great reſiſtance, but upon that Condition, granted him all what he deſir'd This was enough to put our General out of Conceit with his Amour, he not being in the humour to Marry at that time But to come to the Concluſion of the matter, he found no great ſatisfaction in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Stranger; for tho' after he had done this gallant Exploit, he continu'd to pay her ſome few viſits out of Compliſance
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:109100:73"/>
and in acknowledgment of the favour receiv'd, yet they did not turn to that account which the Lady did propoſe to her ſelf: ſhe wou'd ſometimes upbraid him with his indifferency, but he excus'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as well as he cou'd, laying all the fault upon his Military Employments, which as he ſaid, took up ſo much of his time that he had not leiſure to ſee his Friends. No other Lady beſides her, wou'd have been ſo eaſily ſatisfy'd with theſe Reaſons, but as good luck wou'd have it for her, ſhe had been engag'd with a Perſon who ſeldom leaves any Proofs of his Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, ſo that in conſideration of that, ſhe had the more reaſon to comfort her ſelf for the loſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers</hi> went ſoon after to be preſent at the Siege of <hi>Luxemberg,</hi> which was undertaken in the ſame Year; the Marſhal <hi>de Crequi</hi> who commanded that Army in chief, having inveſted it in the Month of <hi>April, A. D.</hi> 1684. Here the Marſhal again ſignalis'd himſelf by his Valour, as well as the Counts <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> and St. <hi>Geron,</hi> as did alſo a great many other brave Captains, who gave very remarkable Proofs of their undaunted Courage, nevertheleſs a great number of excellent Officers were loſt during that Siege; among whom was the Marqueſs <hi>de Humieres,</hi> Colonel of a Regiment of Foot,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:109100:73"/>
only Son to the Marſhal <hi>de Humieres,</hi> who was kill'd at the very beginning, in a Sally made by the Beſieged. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> was ſo griev'd at the Death of his Friend, whom he always lov'd extremely, that he ſcarce cou'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy himſelf all the remainder of that Year. He wou'd needs put himſelf in Mourning Apparel, which prov'd a means to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate himſelf into the Favour of his deceaſed Friend's Father, who was in great eſteem at Court.</p>
            <p>Winter drawing near, ſome of the Officers repair'd to their reſpective Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the reſt to <hi>Paris</hi> or ſome other Prices. I cannot ſay any thing here to our Marſhal's amourous Adventures, for ſome time after, becauſe I know that he then made a reſolution to take ſome reſt, and inſtead of purſuing the ſports of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> to apply himſelf entirely to the Art of War, and the ſtudy of ſome other Sciences, for two or three Years; during which time, he became ſuch a Proficient in every one of 'em, that he attain'd to the higheſt perfections, ſurpaſſing even his Maſters, eſpecially in the Mathematicks, to which his <hi>Genius</hi> was naturally inclin'd. The King having made him ſoon after, a Knight of the Order of the Holy-Ghoſt, he was all of a ſudden inſpir'd with ſo much Devotion, that he went every day

to Maſs, and to hear Sermons, of which he never miſs'd one. He was wont alſo frequently at that time, to pay his viſits to the Jeſuits in the Profeſſed Houſe of <hi>Paris,</hi> who by that means became his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friends, and they prevail'd with him to make a Vow to St. <hi>Amable,</hi> who is in great eſteem in the City of <hi>Rion</hi> in <hi>Auvergne,</hi> both for his antiquity, and the great number of miracles which he is ſaid to have wrought. This Saint is to be ſeen in the great Church of that City, and it is reported of him, that if any one does but touch, (with a true faith) a certain great Tooth which he has, it ſecures him from ever dying of his Wounds receiv'd in the Wars, or otherwiſe, as well as from any others, got by the biting of mad Dogs or Venomous Beaſt.</p>
            <p>The Reader may eaſily judge from thence, that the Marſhal had rais'd his mind to the higheſt pitch of Devotion, and ſome began to be of Opinion, that he was in a fair way of turning an abſolute Bigot, if Love, which is not a fit Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for ſuch ſort of People, and which had always the chief Aſcendant over his Heart, had not quickly made him change his Inclination, and oblig'd him to re-aſſume his former Liberty. Let us now ſee him go to the Battel of <hi>Fleurus,</hi> which happen'd in the Year 1690 in the Month of <hi>June,</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:109100:74"/>
under the Command of the Duke <hi>of Luxemburg,</hi> who. was then General over the King's Forces in <hi>Flanders.</hi> No ſooner were the Enemies beaten out of the Field, but <hi>Monſieur Boufflers,</hi> who had had an ample ſhare in the Victory, took his reſt in the Arms of a new Miſtreſs, who poſſeſs'd all his thoughts for ſome time. This was one Mrs. <hi>Montberg</hi> the Daughter of a certain <hi>Flemmiſh</hi> Officer, who had been kill'd in the ſame Battel. It muſt be ſaid to her advantage, that never was ſeen a more beautiful Woman of a brown Complexion in the World, and who had a more grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full haughtineſs in her whole Behaviour than ſhe; and it was not without a great deal of trouble that the Marſhal cou'd find an opportunity to addreſs his Courtſhip to her. The loſs of her Father, who was one of the beſt Officers the Allies had in the whole Army, had afflicted her to that degree that ſhe refus'd to admit of any Conſolation, having by his Death been bereav'd of all, what ſhe cou'd call her own, as having no other Subſiſtance but what depended abſolutely upon her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers</hi> having been inform'd concerning her preſent Condition by one of her Acquaintance, according to his generous inclination, which extended it ſelf more particularly towards the fair Sex, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:109100:75"/>
her his Purſe. It was not without great reluctancy that ſhe accepted the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of a Man, whom ſhe ſuſpected did not make his Preſents for nothing; and the truth is, why ſhou'd any Man, ſhew ſo much kindneſs toward a Woman, unleſs with a proſpect of receiving ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours? They ought not to take the Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of their Gallants in any other ſenſe, becauſe they very often pay dearly for 'em. Our Marſhal has often found it ſo, by his own experience, and to his Coſt. But let us return to Mrs. <hi>Montberg,</hi> who by her paſſionate and Engaging Air had ſo Captivated the Heart of our General, that he has proteſted to me ſince, that he never was ſo much in Love in all his Life-time before; ſhe appear'd to him ſo full of charms and ſweetneſs in her whole Deportment; beſides her Beauty, which tho' it was always extraordinary, yet appear'd at certain times with ſuch a luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, that it quite dazzl'd his Reaſon; ſo that in a little time he turn'd ſtark Fool, and her perfect Idolater, as he one day, when he lay at her Feet, was pleas'd to tell her himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You then Love me indeed, my dear <hi>Boufflers, ſaid ſhe very pleaſantly.</hi> Yes my incomparable, <hi>reply'd the Marſhal embracing her,</hi> but I intend to diſcount with your Heart for all the ſufferings it makes me
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:109100:75"/>
endure. You have Complaiſance enough to make me a return of ſome ſmall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, but you will not grant me—What is it you wou'd have me grant you, my dearly Belov'd, <hi>anſwer'd the young Lady laughing, and interrupting his diſcourſe,</hi> If I had in my gift the moſt eminent Offices in the State, or any thing elſe that is worth your acceptance; nay, if it lay in my power, <hi>continu'd ſhe with a charming Air,</hi> to put a Crown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Head, I proteſt to you, that you ſhou'd not ſtay for it till to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. The weight of that Madam, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Marſhal modeſtly,</hi> wou'd be too heavy and troubleſome for me. It is in your power to make me, a Preſent no leſs precious than that: That agreeable Throne environ'd with Purple, the ſweeteſt ſeat of Love, <hi>added he all tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with Paſſion,</hi> is that to which my Ambition leads me. This is that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty which is in your poſſeſſion, and which if you will put into my Hands, I'll make you my Queen, and all my deſires ſhall center in you: My Scepter ſhall only be touch'd by your fair Hands, and you alone ſhall have the whole ſway and management of all the Affairs of State.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Montberg</hi> cou'd not forbear laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out as loud as ſhe cou'd, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:109100:76"/>
interpretation which her Lover had made of her Words, to whom ſhe anſwer'd with a ſmile; <q>Sir it is a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent peculiar only to the <hi>French</hi> Gentle men to expreſs themſelves in ſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary a manner; other Nations cannot pretend to that ſubtilty of Wit. And pray Madam, <hi>reply'd the Marſhal with a great deal of feigned ſincerity,</hi> what great Subtilty can there be in Expreſſing things naturally as they are. Is there any thing more common among Men than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be happy? And as it is in your power my Divine Creature, to make me the moſt Fortunate of all Mortals; I come here to embrace your Feet, and to pray you not to delay any longer my Happineſs. There is another Thought, <hi>reply'd the young Lady,</hi> no leſs witty and pleaſant than the former, I cou'd wiſh my ſelf now a larger ſhare of Wit than I have, that I might have the ſatisfaction of giving you a ſuitable return to theſe excellent Expreſſions. Madam, <hi>anſwer'd the Marſhal,</hi> you'll certainly make me a ſuitable return, when you ſhall vouchſafe to grant my Requeſt. And what is it then Sir, <hi>reply'd the Lady abruptly,</hi> that you deſire, for that I ſee, you are not very eaſily ſatisfy'd. Yes my lovely Creature, pretty eaſily, <hi>ſaid the Marſhal kiſſing her fair Hands,</hi> you are not ignorant what it is that will content
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:109100:76"/>
me. I don't know, <hi>reply'd</hi> Mrs. Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg <hi>with a bluſh all over her Cheeks,</hi> you Cavaliers have a very nice taſte and—</q> here ſhe ſtopt, which made her Lover preſs her very earneſtly to proceed in her <q>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and to let him know his doom, how long he was to live in this languiſhing Condition, before ſhe wou'd let him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy thoſe tranſcendent Delights which he ſo earneſtly long'd for.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Lady having for a conſiderable time in moſt obliging Terms oppoſs'd his <q>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourous inſinuations, was at laſt conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to tell him in a languiſhing tone, that as ſoon as that piece of Work, <hi>which ſhe ſhew'd him,</hi> was compleated ſhe wou'd do what ſhe cou'd do to make him leſs unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate.</q> Then make haſte my Deareſt, cry'd the Marſhal ſqueezing her cloſely between his Arms, give me one half of it to finiſh. The young Lady taking him at his word, gave him the hinder part of a Cornet of <hi>Point la Reine</hi> which ſhe had begun to work upon, <hi>No, No,</hi> anſwer'd the General ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and feigning as if he were about to throw it away <hi>I muſt have the fore part, there I can work to ſome purpoſe. Well, well, Sir,</hi> reply'd ſhe as pleaſantly, <hi>you ſhall have it, when I have gone on a little further with it, then you ſhall have it to finiſh. Madam,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Boufflers, I believe I ſhall do more work there with my Needle in one moment, than all
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:109100:77"/>
your Work-women can in a very conſiderable ſpace of time: I am very expeditions in all my buſineſs, but eſpecially in the ſervice of the fair Sex. Well, well, Sir, ſince you are ſuch a nimble Work man,</hi> reply'd the young Lady, giving him a Needle and Thread, and all the other Implements belonging to the Work, <hi>take notice that you are to have nothing for your pains before it be quite finiſh'd; and likewiſe that you are to have no pay till mine be brought to perfection as well as yours:</hi> Thus having kept the hinder part of the Cornet to work upon herſelf, ſhe gave the fore part to the General accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his deſire, which he got finiſh'd in eight days.</p>
            <p>But the Lady, who was reſolv'd to let him languiſh for ſome time longer, was ſo mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as to unrip at night (as formerly <hi>Penelope</hi> did) what ſhe had done by Day; ſo that when our Marſhal thought himſelf almoſt ſure of his pay, according to her promiſe, he was as far off as ever. <hi>O Cruel Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny! O unaccountable Fatality!</hi> cry'd he one day proſtrating himſelf at her Feet; <hi>Alaſs! when I think that I am arriv'd at the very Goal of Felicity, I find my ſelf at the greateſt diſtance from it.</hi> He had ſcarce utter'd theſe words but a paleneſs overſpreading his Face, he fell into a Swoon. Mrs. <hi>Montberg</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtartl'd at the ſuddenneſs of the thing threw cold Water in his Face, which prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frutleſs, ſhe rub'd his Hands and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:109100:77"/>
with the Queen of <hi>Sweden's</hi> Balſam, which is accounted moſt powerful againſt ſuch Love-Fits. But neither was all this efficacious enough to cure him of his Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he wanted another ſort of Remedy to be apply'd to him, which Lovers term in their Language, <hi>the extreme Unction of Love, or the charming Viaticum,</hi> which makes 'em dye the moſt pleaſant Death that can be.</p>
            <p>Our fair Lady, who did not know which way to turn her ſelf, having no body to aſſiſt her, at laſt reſolv'd to unbutton his Coat and Waſte-coat, and to lay her Hand upon his Stomach, which felt ſomewhat cold; and having back'd her tender Careſſes with a douzen or more hearty and ſweet Kiſſes, theſe had the wiſh'd for effect, having ſoon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken'd our General out of his Love-trance, ſo that now he began to open his Eyes, which were half ſhut before. <hi>Then you are return'd from the other World,</hi> cry'd his Miſtreſs, looking in his Face, <hi>if you were ſenſible how you have frighted me, you wou'd have prevented your Swooning thus: I did verily believe that you were gone to the</hi> Elyſian <hi>Fields, but I now perceive your Hour was not yet come. Alaſs! my fair Angel,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal with a very deep ſigh, <hi>I am juſt ready to expire at your Feet, except you take pity of me.</hi> While he was ſpeaking theſe laſt Words, he drew out a Knife all Bloody, which he had put in his Pocket on purpoſe, feigning that he
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:109100:78"/>
was about to thruſt it into his Heart. The Lady having ſnatch'd the Knife out of his Hands, and perceiving it all Bloody, was ſo extremely terrify'd at the ſight of it, that ſhe actually fell into a Swoon, out of which ſhe did not recover till ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time after; ſhe turn'd as pale as Death, not having the leaſt ſenſe left her, ſo that the Marſhal, who was only in jeſt, had now made work enough for himſelf in good earneſt. Having firſt try'd all poſſible means to recover her, which prov'd ineffectual, he was forc'd to call for aſſiſtance, and while they were coming, he did not let ſlip the opportunity of taking more freedome than her haughty temper wou'd have let him ſo much as ſue for, at another time.</p>
            <p>The Lady having been oblig'd to keep her Bed for ſome time, by reaſon of the weakneſs it caus'd in her, enquir'd after her Gallant, who being come, ſhe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd him with the moſt tender Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the World: He who had now the Opportunity to rove about his Miſtreſſes Boſom, to play with her two lovely plump Bubbies, and whiter than the very Snow, and to advance even as far as to the little Mount of <hi>Venus,</hi> where Love keeps its Throne, did anſwer to her obliging Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in ſo Paſſionate a manner; that ſhou'd any one have been an Eye-witneſs to 'em,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:109100:78"/>
they wou'd have believ'd him bewitch'd or turn'd Fool; and this was as I take it, the occaſion of a rumour then ſpread all about <hi>Paris,</hi> that the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> after the Battel of <hi>Fleurus,</hi> was ſo deſperately fall'n in Love with a certain young Lady in <hi>Brabant,</hi> that he was quite Diſtracted; 'Tis probable that the General in one of his amourous Tranſports, had been the Occaſion of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this jeſt put upon him, it being then the common diſcourſe of the Town.</p>
            <p>But to return to our charming young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who being now recover'd pretty well from her ilneſs, did receive every day more evident Proofs of the Marſhal's Love. One After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon having been oblig'd to leave her ſooner than ordinary, becauſe he was to aſſiſt at a Council of War, he was ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted in his Mind, that when the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> ask'd his Advice concerning the buſineſs in hand; he anſwer'd him as if he had not been in his right Wits, at which the Duke having laugh'd heartily, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſure your Thoughts are ſo taken up with ſome Amourous Intreague, that it diſturbs your Brains. By my Faith Sir,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> being much aſham'd that they had diſcover'd his Diſtraction, and taking the Duke by the Hand, <hi>you ſpeak truth, I am in Love with the moſt amiable Perſon in the VVorld, who has robb'd me of my Liberty. And who for God's ſake,</hi> reply'd the Duke <hi>of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:109100:79"/>
Luxemburg, is this fair Lady,</hi> ſmiling. <hi>It is,—It is—It is</hi>—ſaid <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers</hi> jeſting, <hi>it is one Miſtreſs Pretty Mount,</hi> ſome Spies coming into the Tent at the ſame time, broke off their further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>The next day, the Marſhal <hi>de Luxemburg,</hi> and ſome other Officers came to give him a Viſit in his Tent, where they began to jeer him about his new Miſtreſs, whoſe true Name he was unwilling to declare to 'em. But <hi>Monſieur de Luxemburg</hi> told 'em, <hi>Let me alone Gentlemen, I'll engage that to Morrow you ſhall ſee that Beauty, whoſe Name you are ſo deſirous to know.</hi> And he was as good as his word, for I know not by what ſort of Magick, Mrs. <hi>Montberg</hi> appear'd there, asking for the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers.</hi> The dreſs ſhe was in that day, made no ſmall addition to the luſtre of her Beauty, ſo that all the Generals were as much dazzl'd at the ſight of her, as if ſhe had been an Angel. This poor young Lady being incited by ſomething ſhe knew not what, to go and ſeek after her Gallant; at the ſight of the Company, bluſh'd for ſhame; which having rais'd her Colour to its utmoſt perfection, it was ſo great an addition to her natural Complexion, that they were all ſtrangely ſurpris'd at it. The Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> being not inſenſible of the Confuſion ſhe was in, and much vex'd
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:109100:79"/>
that ſhe ſhou'd have committed ſuch a fault, told her, as he was Conducting her home; <hi>VVhat was it my Deareſt, that cou'd induce you to come and enquire for me in this crow'd? They are a Company of unlucky Birds, that always make it their buſineſs to ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, about thoſe little Favours you are pleas'd to beſtow upon me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For GOD'S ſake Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Mrs. Montberg,</hi> being vex'd to the very Soul, <hi>talk no more of this fatal moment. Some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known evil Spirit did hurrye me on; I fanſy'd that ſome Ghoſt or another did drive me to the place where you were, and I cannot deviſe what ſhou'd be the Original cauſe of this Inchantment; I may very well call it ſo, for I am ſure I was forc'd to act contrary to my own Inclination. Good God!</hi> ſaid ſhe, ſhedding ſome Tears, <hi>that I ſhou'd go after a Man, and eſpecially in that place where you were. Certainly I cou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be guilty of ſuch indiſcretion if I might gain the VVorld by the Bargain, and tho' I love you very affectionately, yet my Paſſion cou'd never have made me commit ſo irreparable, a fault. Now I think on't, there was the Duke</hi> of Luxemburg <hi>in your Company, who has the name of being the greateſt Sorcerer in the VVorld, ſhou'd it not perhaps be that old Necromancer, who has play'd you this Game, on purpoſe to divert his Friends. Boufflers</hi> having ruminated for ſome time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what his Miſtreſs had ſaid, and being convinc'd that ſhe had hit the Nail upon the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:109100:80"/>
Head, the Duke being taken for ſuch a one, throughout the whole Army; did not think it convenient to put her any further into a fright; on the contrary, he endeavour'd to reſettle her Mind, which was quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compos'd by this unlucky Accident.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am apt to believe my Child,</hi> continu'd the Marſhal Careſſing her, <hi>what you did was only out of an ardent deſire to ſee me. No indeed my Dear,</hi> reply'd ſhe ſmiling, <hi>I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that my Paſſion ſhou'd never be capable of carrying me ſo much out of the way of my Duty. If you are an Admirer of Secrecy in Love-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, ſo am I in no leſs a degree. What in the name of God, will theſe Gentlemen be apt to ſay about my enquiring after you with ſo much earneſtneſs? Let 'em ſay what they pleaſe,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Boufflers</hi> much vex'd, <hi>one thing is, they don't know you. But for that reaſon I wou'd not have you do ſo again another time. Oh! great God!</hi> cry'd the young Lady much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd, <hi>I wiſh rather that I may dye the moſt cruel Death that can be invented, than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a ſecond time ſuch an horrible Fault; for God's ſake, don't tell me any more of this fatal Accident, or I muſt leave you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Marſhal perceiving the great diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance his Miſtreſs was in, chang'd his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe into a Thouſand amourous Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations, and having again aſſur'd her of the Vehemency of his Paſſion, he left her and return'd to his Company. <hi>O brave</hi>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:109100:80"/>
Boufflers, ſaid they laughing, <hi>thou art the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt Man living, to enjoy ſo charming an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as this. I never ſaw,</hi> added <hi>Luxemburg, ſo Beautiful and engaging a Creature in my Life-time, and who deſerves better to be ador'd by Men.</hi> The Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> made no anſwer to what they ſaid, on the contrary, he appear'd very Penſive and Melancholy; his Thoughts being wholly taken up with this ſpiteful trick of that old Devil the Duke <hi>of Luxemburg,</hi> unto whom he had hitherto bid defiance with all his Works. This General was ſo overjoy'd at the Victory obtain'd in the Plains of <hi>Fleurus,</hi> againſt the Prince of <hi>Waldeck,</hi> General of the Conſederate Army, who had been forc'd to quit the Field of Battel; that he play'd a great many of theſe tricks, which were ſurpriſing to all that ſaw 'em; but they not having any relation to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Subject, I will paſs 'em by in ſilence: I ſhall only mention this by the by, that he was ſo confident of his ARt, that he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to reſtore to Life ſome of the chief Officers, who were Slain in the Battel, and among the reſt the Marqueſs <hi>de Verderonne,</hi> whom he lov'd as dearly as his own Soul; but all his Magick was not powerful enough to reach ſo far, Almighty God having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to himſelf that power of raiſing the Dead.</p>
            <p>But it is time to return to our Marſhal,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:109100:81"/>
who being extremely afraid leſt the old Duke ſhou'd play him ſome other Game about his Miſtreſs, was fain to carry matters very ſwimmingly with him; which the Duke having taken notice of, told him one Day, <hi>That he was ſenſible that he ſtood in awe of him, but that he needed fear nothing farther; for he was ready to give him his parole of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that he wou'd never be an Obſtacle to his Amours, or engage in any thing elſe, which he thought might be troubleſome to him.</hi> The Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> being very well ſatisfy'd with theſe aſſurances receiv'd from the Duke, afterward pay'd his Viſits to his Miſtreſs, without any diſturbance, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he had done before.</p>
            <p>But as all Human Affairs are Subject to perpetual change, ſo things did not remain between theſe two Lovers long in the ſame Station. Winter began to approach and <hi>Bou.</hi> cou'd no more than the reſt of the Generals, avoid going to <hi>Paris;</hi> being therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to part from his dearly Beloved Mrs. <hi>Montberg,</hi> he took his leave of her with the greateſt marks of grief imagnable; he wou'd fain have perſwaded her to have paſs'd five or ſix months away in <hi>Paris,</hi> but ſhe wou'd by no means conſent to it, pretending that ſhe was oblig'd to viſit that Winter, an Aunt of hers at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> who was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſee her. Our Lover was ſo ſenſibly afflicted at his approaching Separation, from
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:109100:81"/>
a Perſon whom he lov'd with ſo much Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that he fell Sick; but being by the care and aſſiudous Viſits of his belov'd Miſtreſs, ſoon reſtor'd to Health, he cou'd not think of parting ſo ſoon; it being a common Principle among Lovers, who Paſſionately Love one another, not to be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a long Separation: But alaſs! within a few Weeks after, this young Lady, who had given ſuch extraordinary Proofs of her Love to our General, fell Sick of a violent Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, of which ſhe dy'd not long after. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did any Man ſhew ſo much concern for a Miſtreſs, as the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers:</hi> He did not ſtir from her one moment, and tho' her Diſtemper was not without ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, nevertheleſs, as if he had been chain'd to her Bed-ſide, he was continually giving her what Comfort he cou'd, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing care that ſhe took every thing exactly, according to the preſcription of two or three Phyſicians, who came to Viſit her every day: Finding her at laſt, paſs'd all hopes of recovery, he had ſo much influence over her, that he prevail'd with her ſo far as to renounce the Proteſtant Religion, and to embrace the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick; when ſhe was juſt ready to expire in his Arms, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending her Body to his diſpoſal after Death. But the Marſhal, who was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take upon himſelf a charge of that Nature, gave orders to the Ghoſtly Fathers
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:109100:82"/>
who attended upon her, to take care that her Funeral Rites ſhou'd be decently So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnis'd as ſoon as her Friends cou'd be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. In the meanwhile, not being able to ſee the Interrment of a Perſon whom he had ſo dearly lov'd: He ſet forward on his Journey the very next Morning early: The only thing he ask'd for, before his departure, from a <hi>Jacobine</hi> Father, whom he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with all her Moveables, was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Picture of her's, enamell'd very finely, which he did not part with, for a long time after.</p>
            <p>Upon his arrival at <hi>Paris,</hi> every one was for putting hard upon the Marſhal, with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to his late Gallant Adventures, but he not being of a humour to be much diſturb'd at a Jeſt, was forc'd to join iſſue with 'em in their Raillery; ſo that finding him inſenſible as to that point, they quickly grew weary of the Sport. He wore for ſome time, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Mourning Suit, very neatly trimm'd in remembrance of his Miſtreſs, which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd him the Favour of all the fine Lady's at Court, who were extreme'y well ſatisfy'd to ſee him ſhew ſo much eſteem to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of one of their Sex. For a conſiderable time after, if Madam <hi>de Maintenon,</hi> and Madam <hi>de Guiſe</hi> did but mention her, he wou'd ſigh and burſt out into Tears like a Child; ſo that 'twas not without great perſwaſions that at laſt they made him ſtop
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:109100:82"/>
the Current of his Tears. The Winter paſs'd thus without any further diſturbance on the Marſhal's ſide, his Heart ſtill keeping the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his late belov'd Miſtreſs, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing precious, and not to be rac'd out in ſo ſmall a ſpace of time: For tho' there were ſeveral Lady's of Quality in <hi>Paris,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to make him wear their Chains, yet he ſo vigourouſly oppos'd their Deſigns, that he gain'd the Victory over thoſe, who wou'd willingly have conquer'd him, to make him their humble Adorer.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the next Spring, his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty having given Orders to his Generals for the beſieging of <hi>Mons;</hi> the Capital City of the Province of <hi>Hainault:</hi> And being to go thither in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, moſt of the Nobility at Court were to follow him: The Marſhals and Dukes <hi>de Duras, de la Feuillade, de Luxemburg;</hi> the Princes <hi>de Soubiſe,</hi> and <hi>de Conti;</hi> the Dukes <hi>de Vendome</hi> and <hi>de Bourbon,</hi> the Marqueſſes <hi>de Joyeeuſe, de Villars,</hi> and <hi>de Boufflers</hi> open'd the Campaign before the ſeaſon the Year, was ſcarce fit for Travelling; the moſt Lady's of note wou'd not ſtay behind, but follow'd the Court. Then it was, that the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> was enamour'd with the Counteſs <hi>de</hi>—I hope the Reader will excuſe me for not mentioning her name, for very weighty Reaſons: This Lady hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhew'd ſo much aſſiduity in her Love en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:109100:83"/>
with the Marſhal, that ſometimes they ſcarce gave themſelves leaſure to eat or to drink. In the mean time <hi>Monſieur de Buo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fflers,</hi> whom nothing ever was able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from his Prince's ſervice, was oblig'd to go where Honour call'd him; he ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned neither Dangers nor Fatigues, to ſignaliſe himſelf upon all occaſions, where Glory was to be purchas'd at the expence of his Blood. It was in one of thoſe Engagements which was fought with a great deal of obſtinacy on both ſides, that he was Wounded with a Muſquet-Ball in his Thigh, as well as the Duke <hi>de Montfort,</hi> who having ſecretly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven notice of it to the Counteſs his Couſin, ſhe took it ſo to Heart, that it ſeem'd as if ſhe wou'd not have liv'd one Moment longer: But being a little recover'd from her firſt ſurpriſe, ſhe was for revenging (with Sword in Hand) her Gallant's Quarrel; and as ſhe was as dextrous at handling a Piſtol and Sword, as one of the beſt Officers; ſhe diſguis'd her ſelf in the Habit of an Officer, to come and viſit the Marſhal in his Tent: She was there three or four Days, before he had the leaſt Suſpicion of it, imagining that it was ſome young Officer, who upon this Occaſion, was willing to purchaſe his Favour by his Services</p>
            <p>One Day, our General's Wound being in pretty good Condition, he took a reſolution to write two or three Lines to his new Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:109100:83"/>
whom he ſuppos'd to be at her own Lodgings near <hi>Mons,</hi> with the reſt of the Lady's of her Acquaintance: When he had writ the <hi>Billet doux,</hi> he caſt his Eyes upon that young Officer, who had been ſo ready about him, to carry it to this fair Lady: While he was writing, he cou'd not forbear to look upon him from time to time, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with himſelf: <hi>Can any thing be more like my Counteſs than this young Gentleman? He has the ſame charming Eyes, the ſame Features, and the very ſame Beautiful Complexion.</hi> Having made theſe Reflections to himſelf, he ask'd him, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he knew Madam de—. Yes,</hi> reply'd the Counteſs, who was ſo well diſguis'd as not to be known by any one. <hi>I know her as well as my ſelf, and I can aſſure you in her behalf, that ſhe Loves you as well as her own Life.</hi> This Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ſavouring of ſo much Familiarity, ſomewhat ſtartl'd our General, who told him, whom he took to be a Man, <hi>and pray Sir, who cou'd tell you this, has ſhe made you her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident? She has not told me in ſo plain Terms as I ſpeak Sir,</hi> reply'd the Counteſs, <hi>but I might eaſily perceive by the trouble which your wound occaſion'd in her Mind, that ſhe was as deeply Wounded as your ſelf; and tho' her wound appears to be but ſlight outwardly, her Heart is nevertheleſs moſt ſenſibly touch'd by a more dangerous Weapon, and</hi>—. Here the Marſhal interrupting the young Officer, (according to outward appearance) <hi>ſince you know,</hi> ſaid
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:109100:84"/>
he, <hi>the Counteſs ſo well, pray deliver to her this Letter, which I give you; and tell her from me, that I moſt impatiently deſire to ſee her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lady, who admir'd her own dexterity in Perſonating herſelf ſo well as ſhe did; took the Letter with a great of Reſpect, to carry it to his Miſtreſs. But ſhe was not gone far from the place, where ſhe had left the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> e'r ſhe retir'd into an adjacent Wood, where having unfolded the Myſtery of Love, with which ſhe was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted; ſhe read theſe following Words:

                     <p>IF <hi>the rigour of my Deſtiny keeps me one day longer from your ſight, I muſt reſolve to embrace death, but a death a thouſand times more cruel to me, than that which my Wounds cou'd have procur'd to me Heaven has againſt my will reſtor'd me a Life, that I might love you more now than ever before: But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs! how can I be ſure whether you Heart continues ſtill the ſame as to me? It's poſſible it has chang'd it's inclinations, and parhaps ſome fortunate Rival poſſeſſes—But oh! I dare not enlarge farther upon that Subject, leſt the very thoughts of it ſhou'd Kill me in an inſtant; I will rather flatter myſelf with ſome ſweet hopes, which may prolong my Life at leaſt for ſome time. Don't therefore put me out of your Remembrance, my moſt incomparable Queen; conſider with your ſelf, that you have Captivated a Heart which adores and loves you, even to an exceſs of Paſſion: When I receiv'd my Wound in the Heat of the Engagement, I than believ'd I ſhou'd never have ſeen you again; but ſince I begin to grow better, and that I am likely to ſtay ſome time longer in this

            <p>After the Counteſs had read this Letter, which was altogether agreeable to her wiſhes; <hi>Is it poſſible,</hi> ſaid ſhe to her ſelf, <hi>that thou my Deareſt ſhoud'ſt not know me? It is four or five days, ſince I have been with thee in the ſame Tent; and does not thy Heart tell thee, that it is ſhe that Loves thee? Alaſs! I have a great deal of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for thee, and I attribute this want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, wholly to thy Diſtemper, which appears to me very violent, altho' it ſeems as if thou woud'ſt inſinuate the contrary. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the pains thou endureſt, thou ſtill keepeſt me in Remembrance; nay, thy Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance is founded upon ſincerity, I am my ſelf an Eye-witneſs of this ſecret, which nevertheleſs, thou haſt put into the Hands of an unknown Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Thy Integrity and eager deſire of hearing news from me, have made thee hazard all; but doſt thou not O Soveraign King of my Heart, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider unto what dangers thou haſt expos'd me, and that if my Husband ſhou'd diſcover the leaſt of this Paſſion, that I have for thee, I am infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly

undone: Thou know'ſt that he abominates Horns, and that nothing in the World cou'd touch him ſo ſenſibly, as to find himſelf a Cuckold, and eſpecially to be ſo dignify'd by the means of ſuch a one as thee, whoſe ſingular merits and charms he ought moſt to dread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Counteſs was making theſe and ſuch like other Reflections, when the Marſhal, who had taken a walk into the Wood for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>little Air, and being come by chance near the place where ſhe had ſeated herſelf, underſtood ſome part of what ſhe had ſaid. Never was any agreeable Surpriſe greater than this, he having immediately known her Voice, which was then without diſguiſe. Having embrac'd her ſeveral times, <hi>Is it you</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is it you my adorable Angel? Unto what dangers do you expoſe your ſelf for my ſake? Alaſs!</hi> I <hi>am at preſent in an unſpeakable pain for you. You ſee my Deareſt,</hi> reply'd ſhe with a languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tone, <hi>what one is willing to do to enjoy the ſight of an Object one Loves, and how a genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Paſſion triumphs over all the moſt frightful Obſtacles. I have hazarded all to ſee you, and I have Sacrifis'd even my Honour for your ſake: I am ready to own it Madam,</hi> ſaid the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral kiſſing one of her pretty Hands, which ſhe had given him without a Glove; <hi>And I proteſt to you, that I at the ſame time acknowledge my ſelf unworthy of theſe Favours you beſtow upon me. I Will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to give you the moſt ſenſible and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:109100:85"/>
Marks of my Gratitude.</hi> Some Officers, who were at the ſame time walking in the Wood, and knew <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up towards 'em, broke off the Intercourſe of our Lovers for that Time. The Counteſs, who was afraid of being diſcover'd, made the beſt of her way to her own Lodgings, being well ſatisfy'd that ſhe had ſeen and ſpoke to her Gallant, who was not long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repaying her Viſit. When this Lady went firſt from her Lodgings, ſhe told her Gentlewomen and the reſt of her Domeſtick Servants, That ſhe was going to ſee one of her Acquaintance, who was in a Monaſtery near <hi>Mons;</hi> which was the Reaſon, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her Stay with our General, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Five or ſix Days, they were not diſturb'd at her Abſence. She had made one of her Waiting Gentlewomen, whoſe Name was <hi>Gviſſon,</hi> and one whom ſhe had a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Reſpect for than all the reſt, her Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Buſineſs; ſhe waited upon her in one Corner of the Wood, with her Woman's Apparel, which ſhe had there chang'd for the Man's Cloaths he had worn before. Thus our Heroine Lady return'd Home to her Lodgings, accompany'd only by this Damſel, leaning upon her Arm as if ſhe had been the moſt harmleſs Creature in the World, and as if, during her Stay, ſhe had employ'd her Time in nothing elſe but pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:109100:86"/>
with thoſe Religious Siſters for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of her Husband, from the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Dangers of War.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Marſhal de Boufflers,</hi> after he had got clear from the other Officers that met him in the Wood, ſpent all that Night under moſt terrible Agonies, not knowing what was become of his Miſtreſs, whom he had ſearch'd for all over the Foreſt; but no ſooner did the next Morning appear, but to eaſe himſelf of the Trouble which diſtracted his Mind, he mounted on Horſe-back, ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Courſe directly to the Place where he knew his <hi>Beloved</hi> lodg'd all that Time. He found his lovely Counteſs as yet in Bed, who having receiv'd him with incredible Joy, and clos'd him between her Arms, told him a thouſand paſſionate things, in Terms ſo engaging and charming, that they are paſt all Expreſſion, except by him who had the good Fortune to be made ſenſible of 'em. Nothing cou'd appear more Charming than ſhe did, as ſhe lay in Bed: A careleſs Head-dreſs, ty'd behind with a Carnation Ribbon, in the nature of a ſingle Top-knot, together with a ſweet engaging Air, which was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to her, made her appear the moſt lovely Woman in the Univerſe. The <hi>Marſhal</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now met with a favourable Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to enjoy the happy Minute, told <hi>Guiſſon,</hi> who had introduc'd him that Morning to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:109100:86"/>
the Counteſs, <hi>Mademoiſelle, Let me be with your Lady for two or three Hours in private, becauſe I have ſome Matters of Moment to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to her.</hi> This young Damſel, who very well underſtood his Meaning, ask'd her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, <hi>Whether ſhe wou'd have her withdraw? Yes,</hi> ſaid the Lady, <hi>and if any ſhou'd come to enquire for me this Morning, tell 'em, That I am indiſpos'd and not to be ſpoke with at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Young Woman, having receiv'd her Lady's Orders, left the Room, and our <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal</hi> finding himſelf now at liberty, threw himſelf upon the Bed, by his fair Lady, kiſſing and embracing her without Intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and finding nothing that was likely to obſtruct his Paſſage, if he advanc'd farther, he, in very paſſionate Terms, begg'd of her, to grant him the laſt Favour. <hi>Alas!</hi> cry'd ſhe, half vanquiſh'd, and entangl'd in his Embraces, <hi>Who can deny you any thing, my Dear? Alas! I am ready to faint, pray pity my Weakneſs! Oh! what raviſhing joys, my Soul, my Soveraign!</hi> The <hi>Marſhal,</hi> now in the midſt of his Enjoyments, thought himſelf the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt Man in the World, and keeping her ſtill in his Arms, proteſted to her with a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Oaths, <hi>That he never in all his Life-time had receiv'd ſo much Satisfaction as with her.</hi> He deſir'd her, after having by a thouſand Oaths aſſur'd her of his Fidelity, and that he
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:109100:87"/>
wou'd love her for ever, <hi>To keep their Intriegue ſecret, and to let no Body in the World know of it, leſt that if the Count</hi> de—<hi>ſhould get the least ſcent of it, it might prove of dangerous conſequence both to her and himſelf, who cou'd not ſuffer her to be miſus'd by a Jealous Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</hi> The Counteſs told him, with a Kiſs, <hi>That he needed not in the least fear her; that ſhe did not admire Confidents in Love,; that ſhe was ſo tender as to this Point, that ſhe ſcarce truſted her own Heart, lest it ſhould betray her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Aſſurances were ſign'd by both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſeveral times over, and the poor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, who was of a very tender Conſtitution, ſeal'd 'em with ſome Drops of her Blood, in hopes that their mutual Promiſes ſhou'd outlaſt their Lives.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Marſhal,</hi> now more contented than a Prince, left his <hi>Beloved</hi> in Bed, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated his Promiſe, to come and ſee her often. But before a few Days were paſs'd, the King being diſſatisfy'd with the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Liege,</hi> who had by ſome Acts of Hoſtility incurr'd his utmoſt Diſpleaſure, order'd, That ſome Batteries ſhould be rais'd againſt that City, and the whole Management of this Affair being left to the Conduct of the <hi>Marſhal de Boufflers,</hi> he prepar'd himſelf to put his Orders in execution againſt <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſontide.</hi> Our General having therefore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Leave of his Counteſs, and repeated his
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:109100:87"/>
former Aſſurances of an everlaſting Love, Bombarded the City of <hi>Liege</hi> for Two or three Days, cauſing a great Conſternation among the Inhabitants, very many of whom were ruin'd by it. But, while he was taken up in this Expedition, the Count—carry'd his Lady back to <hi>Paris,</hi> and tho' he ſhew'd her all the Complaiſance imaginable, yet ſhe, who cou'd not think upon, nor be pleas'd with any thing but her Gallant, receiv'd all her Husband's Careſſes very coldly. The Count, who was not inſenſible of her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, and lov'd her extremely, was ready to dye with Vexation, not imagining that ſhe cou'd love any one but himſelf, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ſo much advanc'd her Fortune; he having marry'd her not for her Portion or extraordinary Quality, but merely for her Beauty; ſhe being, by Birth, the Daughter only of a Private Gentleman in <hi>Poictou.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, to return to our Lady, who never having had any great Love for her Husband, was eaſily comforted for his Death, which happen'd ſoon after; pleaſing her ſelf with a Fancy, That the <hi>Marſhal de Boufflers</hi> wou'd marry her, conformably to thoſe paſſionate Proteſtations he had often made to her: But ſhe was much deceiv'd in her Aim; for having notify'd to him the Death of her Husband, in ſuch Terms as were convincing enough to the <hi>Marſhal,</hi> That ſhe lov'd him
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:109100:88"/>
ſufficiently to inveſt him with the ſame Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; he turn'd the whole into Raillery, and anſwer'd her in Terms full of Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; which moſt ſenſibly afflicted her: And the <hi>Marſhal,</hi> who after the Campaign was ended, return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> told her with his own Mouth, <hi>That he cou'd not as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to Marry; but that this ſhou'd not hinder him from loving her as well as if ſhe were his Wife, and more; for,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Marriage often ſuppreſſes the vehemency of Love, and ſometimes quite extinguiſhes its Flame.</hi> But theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were not cogent enough to make her lay aſide the Thoughts ſhe had of Marrying him. On the contrary, ſhe conceiv'd ſuch an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion toward him, perceiving her ſelf thus deſpis'd, after ſhe had done ſo much for him, that Hatred ſucceeded in her Heart inſtead of Love, to that degree, that ſhe refus'd to ſee him; nay, ſhe wou'd not ſo much as hear him ſpoke of, as if his very Name were terrible to her: Which vex'd the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal</hi> to the very Heart, who lov'd her to the higheſt degree, notwithſtanding he cou'd not reſolve to make her his Spouſe.</p>
            <p>One Day, as he was walking in the King's Gardens at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> it being a very fair Day, he eſpy'd from far his Counteſs's Coach; and drawing nearer, and finding no Body in it but one of her Footmen, he ask'd him where his Lady was; who having told
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:109100:88"/>
him, That ſhe was taking a Turn in one of the Walks of the Gardens, with the Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs <hi>de lae Mothe,</hi> the <hi>Marſhal,</hi> with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible haſte, made up to the Place where his fair Lady was: But being willing to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hear their Diſcourſe, he hid himſelf behind ſome Trees, hard by where they were walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and heard the Counteſs <hi>de</hi>—who was wiping her Tears away with her Handkerchief, ſay thus to the Marchioneſs: <hi>My deareſt, let us bury my Misfortune in Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion; 'tis paſs'd Expreſſion, when I conſider what I have done for that ungrateful Man; the very Thoughts of whom now are frightful to me. This perfidious Wretch has not only given me his Word, but ſworn a thouſand Oaths; That, if the Chance of War ſhould happen to take off my Husband, I ſhou'd alone diſpoſe of his Deſtiny. But, good God!</hi> continu'd ſhe, <hi>what is become of all thoſe Oaths? He ſays he loves me more than ever, and yet refuſes to keep his Promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>You are a very good-natur'd Lady indeed,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Marchioneſs <hi>de la Mothe,</hi> laughing, <hi>are you to learn yet, that Promiſes made by Lovers have nothing of Reality in 'em, they being founded upon a Paſſion which goes as faſt as it comes; and conſequently all the Oaths they make return to their first Principle; which is next to nothing, being only a Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and what Woman of any Senſe would
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:109100:89"/>
lay the least ſtreſs upon 'em? As for my part,</hi> continu'd ſhe, <hi>I ſhou'd make no more of loſing a Gallant, than to part with one of my Ribbons. I hope you are not in earneſt thus to torment your ſelf for a Loſs, which is not worth taking notice of. Come, come, Madam, ſo beautiful a Lady as you need not want Gallants, if you have a Mind to be troubl'd with 'em. This is not enough, Madam,</hi> reply'd the Counteſs, ſighing, <hi>but all Men don't pleaſe us alike. I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble what a difficult Task it was for me to ſhew ſo much Complaiſance as I did, to my deceas'd Husband, whom I lov'd but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently; and therefore I wou'd fain, if I cou'd, avoid to undergo the ſame Trouble. But how ingenious I am at tormenting my ſelf,</hi> cry'd ſhe, looking towards the Place where the <hi>Marſhal</hi> had hid himſelf, <hi>Let us ſtrive, my Heart, to do Violence to our own Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, let us not think any more of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſher of our Liberty. Oh Heavens! what do I ſee?</hi> ſaid the Lady all on a ſudden, <hi>Is not that this faithleſs Man, whoſe Love hss cost me ſo many Sighs?</hi> The Marchioneſs perceiving the <hi>Marſhal</hi> coming up towards her, follow'd the Counteſs, who run with all Speed towards her Coach, and having order'd the Coachman to drive as faſt as he cou'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhe with a diſdainful Frown drew up the Glaſs, and away they went.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:109100:89"/>
The Marſhal thinking himſelf above her Scorn, and being by this time got on Horſe-back, rode cloſe after the Coach, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſented one of his Piſtols at the Coach-man, <hi>Stop,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſtop you Dog, or elſe I'll ſhoot you thro' the Head.</hi> The Poor Fellow, being extremely terrify'd, leapt out of the Coach-box, leaving the Coach to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal's Diſpoſal; who having put one of his Servants, who had been with him at <hi>Boulogne,</hi> (a ſmall Village near <hi>Paris,)</hi> in his Place, made him ſtop at the next Inn. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that hitherto had not ſeen who it was that purſu'd 'em, and had made moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Outcries, all a-long the Road, were much ſurpris'd when they ſaw the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers;</hi> for imagining that it was ſome of their Gallants, who intended to carry 'em away, they had not had the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage till now to lift up their Eyes. At that ſame inſtant, all the Counteſs's Hatred ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly vaniſh'd; ſhe gave her Hand to the Marſhal, who led her out of the Coach into one of the beſt Appartments of the Houſe. The Marchioneſs perceiving this ſudden Change in her Friend, did not ſay one Word, but pray'd one of the Footmen, who had been all-a-long behind the Coach, to drive her away to <hi>Paris,</hi> and that he might return immediately afterwards to fetch his Lady.</p>

Thus the Marſhal having got his Miſtreſs by himſelf, cou'd not forbear laughing at this bold ſtroak he had made, knowing that it had often ſtood him in good ſtead before, upon the like Occaſions: <hi>Well, Madam,</hi> ſaid he, looking upon her ſtedfaſtly, <hi>you are now in my Power; cou'd you imagine that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have been ſo cloſely acquainted you might diſintangle your ſelf with ſo much Eaſe? La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that love Gallantry as well as you do, ought not to carry Matters ſo haughtily; your manner of Proceeding appears very unſeaſonable. And, after all, what is it I have done to you?</hi> continu'd he, with a ſomewhat more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd Countenance; <hi>I have lov'd you very tenderly, and love you ſtill, in ſpite of all your Scorn. You have propos'd Marriage to me, and you don't know the Reaſons why it was not in my Power to comply with your Deſires in that particular. You may poſſibly tell me, That where there is a great deal of Love, Reaſon ſeldom takes Place, but as my Circumſtances are at preſent, I am oblig'd to conſult Reaſon, and to tell you, That I cannot Marry at this Time. If you have the least Kindneſs for me, you'll eaſily perſwade your ſelf, That all that was in my Power to do for you, I have done already.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Counteſs was not capable of giving him one Word in anſwer, her Speech being ſtopt by a Torrent of Tears, which ſhe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:109100:90"/>
ſhed: Notwithſtanding all theſe diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, ſhe ſtill appear'd to the Marſhal one of the moſt lovely Women in the World, And as he has always a great Tenderneſs for the fair Sex, ſo he cou'd not but endeavour to allay her Grief. He threw himſelf at her Feet, and embracing 'em, <hi>My Angel, my Dearest,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>'tis impoſſible for me to ſee you thus torment your ſelf, let us par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don one another all thoſe Crimes which have made us both culpable. Grant me your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and I will grant you mine, and freely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give thoſe charming Eyes of yours which have ſet me all in a Flame, and do you forgive theſe tender Expreſſions, which were the true Interpreters of my Heart; it did not addreſs it ſelf to you, moſt charming Creature,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he, in a very paſſionate Tone, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it had conſulted yours, which it found ſo worthy of its Choice and Affection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lady, whom the great Surpriſe ſhe was in, had kept ſilent till now, was not able to hold out any longer againſt the Power of ſuch Charms and tender Careſſes of a Lover, who was belov'd by her, but was forc'd to yield, in ſpite of all her Indifferency, which ſhe had ſhewn to him in outward Appearance. <hi>'Tis in vain, my Dear,</hi> reply'd ſhe at laſt, <hi>that I endeavour to hate thee; thou know'st how to diſarm me by thy most engaging Charms,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:109100:91"/>
and my Heart, as ſoon as it ſees thee, loſes all its Force, which it ſhou'd make uſe of againſt thee. Away, away,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>with all my Haughtineſs and Scorn, you only ſerve to add Fuel to my Flame, and to render my Paſſion more violent than before. To be ſhort, my illuſtrious Lover,</hi> added ſhe, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf about his Neck, and ſqueeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him between her Arms, <hi>I love thee, and all the Conſiderations in the World ſhall not be powerful enough to ſeparate us for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>By this time, Night beginning to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, the Counteſs began to be unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, not becauſe ſhe was with her Gallant, who entertain'd her with ſo much ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but becauſe ſhe heard no News of her Coach, and that ſhe thought it wou'd look very ill in her, not to return to <hi>Paris</hi> that Night; ſhe was juſt a talking of it, as much as ſhe thought convenient to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, when putting her Head out of the Window, by chance, ſhe ſaw one of her Footmen coming, who told her, That the Coach was ready at the Door; <hi>And what is become of</hi> Adventure? (which was the Coachman's Name who run away out of the Box before) cry'd the Lady very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:109100:91"/>
               <hi>What is become of that Coxcomb? I can't tell, Madam,</hi> reply'd the Footman, <hi>we have heard nothing of him ſince his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſty Flight. Certainly,</hi> reply'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs with a Smile, <hi>he did not act very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, in leaving me thus; but 'tis you, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that is the occaſion of all. By my Faith, Madam,</hi> reply'd <hi>Bouſflers, if your Coachman has no more Courage than he has ſhewn to Day, he is a moſt damnable Coward; is it poſſible that a ſingle Piſtol ſhould frighten a Man out of his Wits? If I ſaw an hundred Fire locks diſcharg'd at me at once, they ſhould n'er make me ſhrink. All the World has not ſuch a warlike Soul as you, my Dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,</hi> ſaid the Counteſs; <hi>you were born to conquer the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, and to make every thing ſubmit to you; your Power even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelf over me and</hi>—Here ſhe ſtopt, not thinking it convenient to proceed in her Diſcourſe, by reaſon of the Footman, who ſtood by, and heard what they ſaid; but having order'd him to withdraw, ſhe renew'd her Love-Proteſtations, and began to prepare for going; but the Marſhal, who did not intend to part with her as yet, detayn'd her for ſome time longer, telling her, That ſince he had frighted her Coachman away, he wou'd ſupply his Place himſelf; which he accordingly did: For having pay'd the Reckoning, he wrapt himſelf up in his
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:109100:92"/>
Scarlet-Cloak, and drove the Coach to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> as well as if the Coach-man himſelf had been in the Box; it being dark Night ſhe was not diſturbed at the Frolick, but being come to her Lodgings, ſhe entreated the Marſhal to ſtay with her at Supper. All her domeſtick Servants were extremely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd at this ſudden Change: <hi>What an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration is this,</hi> ſaid they to one another; <hi>our Lady, not long ago wou'd not ſo much as hear him nam'd in her preſence, nor wou'd allow us to ſpeak of him, and now he ſeems to be as much in her ſavour as ever.</hi> But Mrs. <hi>Guiſſon,</hi> her Lady's Confident, gueſs'd without much difficulty at the true reaſon of it, not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning but that there had been a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between 'em.</p>
            <p>After Supper, the Marſhal ſtay'd for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time with his Miſtreſs, in her Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber; where they began afreſh to argue the true Reaſon of their Quarrel; they being now at Liberty to talk with more freedom, than they cou'd do at <hi>Boulogne,</hi> where they were in danger of being overheard by every one belonging to the Houſe. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy then, no longer making any difficulty of diſcloſing her Heart to the Marſhal, and their mutual Reconciliation, having been Seal'd by ſome Kiſſes, he left her to her Repoſe. But, alas! in vain; the poor La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was not capable of enjoying one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:109100:92"/>
Reſt. The ſurpriſe of this laſt Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that too by a Man whom ſhe had reſolv'd to Baniſh from her Heart for ever; together with the behaviour of the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>de la Mothe,</hi> who had left her to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a Gentleman, whom ſhe cou'd not but know to be very dangerous to her Repoſe, had moſt horribly diſtracted her Mind: She made a thouſand Reflections upon the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Accident, and not being able to be at reſt at home, ſhe went the next day to pay the Marchioneſs a Viſit, who did not fail to upbraid her with her wanton Humour. <hi>How,</hi> ſaid the Marchioneſs, in a moſt ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner, <hi>are not you that ſame Lady, who wou'd never ſee Monſieur</hi> Boufflers <hi>any more; nay, that wou'd not ſo much as hear any one ſpeak of him; and ſcarce had you caſt one Eye at him, but without any further conſideration, you threw your ſelf into his Embraces? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny it, Madam,</hi> reply'd the Counteſs, not without ſome Confuſion; <hi>but what is it one will not do when one is in Love; alas! Love makes us all ſubject to Frailties, and that to ſuch a degree, that we ſcarce know what we do. Alas! good Heavens! the Marſhal, at his firſt ſight, diſarms me entirely and makes me, in ſpite of all my anger, recal all my former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, which immediately vaniſh in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. I know, Madam,</hi> reply'd the Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs, <hi>that he will prove very dangerous to your
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:109100:93"/>
repoſe, and therefore you ought to force your tender Inclinations; you ought not to ſurrender your Heart upon ſo eaſie Terms, after he has had the boldneſs to carry you away along with me, who did not know him any farther than by ſight. His manner of proceeding ſavours of too much familiarity, and a Perſon of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ought to have treated us with more Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. My greateſt trouble, my Deareſt,</hi> ſaid the Counteſs, interrupting her, <hi>was, that you ſhou'd leave me to the management of a Man of his Humour. Come, come, Madam,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Marchioneſs maliciouſly, <hi>I was well enough ſatisfi'd that you were very well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him before; and that his Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips were not diſagreeable to your Inclinations: 'Tis not ſince Yeſterday, that you have perceiv'd his Amourous motions: You are not ignorant of his intentions; you are not inſenſible how far he is likely to carry it; and whatever you may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the contrary, I am not bound to take your word as to this particular. When any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are in Love, they ſeldom think themſelves oblig'd to ſpeak truth; they take delight in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſing the matter, and upon the whole, I am of opinion, that no account ought to be made of any thing that they aſſert.</hi> The Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>de la Mothe</hi> wou'd not have ſtop't here, but that one of her Acquaintance coming in, very earneſtly entreated her to go with her to hear a Sermon at <hi>Verſailles.</hi> The
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:109100:93"/>
Counteſs, who wou'd rather have ſtaid at home, went along with her more out of Policy than Devotion, and in the evening, being return'd to her Lodgings, the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> after he had for ſome time enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd her with his Paſſion; told her, that his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty deſign'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege <hi>Namur</hi> (the Capital City of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of that Name) this Year, which was that of 1692. and that, to facilitate this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; his Majeſty intended to go thither in Perſon, with the Dauphin and the reſt of the principal Officers of his Court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You will, without doubt, my Dear,</hi> reply'd ſhe very Sorrowfully, <hi>have your ſhare in this glorious Enterprize; and perhaps I may be ſo unfortunate as to hear of your Death, which will unavoidably haſten my own: What wou'd you have me do, Madam,</hi> reply'd the General, with a ſerious Countenance, <hi>I am oblig'd to obey my King's Orders; If it ſhou'd be my fortune to periſh in this Campaign,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>I ſhall dye your Lover; and I hope you will take care that Prayers may not be wanting for my poor Soul, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will be fluttering about in the airy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, without finding any repoſe: O good Sir,</hi> reply'd the Lady, <hi>don't be prepoſſeſs'd with any ſuch thoughts, that cannot but be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to your own welfare. We Religious Siſters will take care of you, we'll prepare
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:109100:94"/>
your Soul for Paradiſe: O Lord! Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I hope you'll pardon me, If I can ſcarce believe it; how is it poſſible that ſuch a Devil as I, whoſe whole practice has been the deſtruction of Mankind by Fire and Sword, ſhou'd be ſav'd from Hell; tho' I have heard ſome ſay, that there is a particular place of Reſt appointed for us Soldiers, but who can rely upon ſuch fantaſtick Notions? I am afraid I ſhall be leiſurely Roaſted by the heat of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, the Flames of which as they tell me, ſurpaſs in fierceneſs all the artificial Fires in the World. How fooliſh you are,</hi> Boufflers, anſwer'd the Counteſs, <hi>thus to fill your head with ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Thoughts: Don't you know that our good Works will deliver us both from the Fire of Purgatory, and of Hell? And as you have done more good than bad Deeds, I don't ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that you'll paſs directly to Paradiſe. But let us have no more of this; pray who are to be the General Officers, that are to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand this Year under the King and Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal, <hi>theſe are to be; the Count</hi> d' Auvergne, <hi>the Marſhal</hi> de Humieres, <hi>the Princes</hi> de Soubiſe <hi>and</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, <hi>and his eldeſt Son, the Duke</hi> de Villeroy, <hi>and a great many more, whom it wou'd be ſuperfluous to name to you, in regard that you have not the leaſt concern with 'em. 'Tis true, my Dear,</hi> reply'd the Counteſs ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:109100:94"/>
               <hi>I don't pretend to any intereſt, but what I have in you, and good God! what a trouble wou'd it be to me, if I ſhou'd chance to loſe you? Are not you a very pretty Gentlewoman?</hi> ſaid the Marſhal ſmiling, <hi>I'm ſure I know the time, when you wou'd not have ſaid ſo: How often have you, when you were in your freekiſh humours, wiſh'd that the Earth might open to ſwallow me up; how often have you call'd me ungrateful Wretch, Monſter, Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, and ſuch like fine Names? Theſe are the Weapons of an angry Woman. Oh! how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely does your Sex take delight in Revenge? If you had the ſame ſtrength in your Arms, that you have in your Tongue, you wou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat an Army of ten Thouſand Men, in an hours time. I take it to be a very great misfortune for a Man to have a Woman for his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; as for my own part, I wou'd rather be oblig'd to fight againſt a whole Battalion of Enemies, than to ſtand the brunt of ſo Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Lady as you, when put into a Paſſion. Do but ſee how cruelly you deal with us; you are not content to overthrow us by the force of your Charms, but you wou'd alſo trample upon us by your Threats, and drive us to the utmoſt Extremity of Deſpair. But e're I leave</hi> Paris, <hi>I'm reſolv'd to make you lower your Topſail, and to bring you to more reaſonable terms.</hi>

               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:109100:95"/>
               <hi>Your preſence alone,</hi> ſaid the fair Lady with a charming Air, <hi>is capable of making me do whatever you ſhall think fit. I can compare it to nothing ſo appoſitely, as to that Head of</hi> Meduſa, <hi>which Metamorphos'd every thing, and chang'd its Situation: I have often taken a reſolution to hate you as long as I ſhou'd live, and no ſooner had I ſeen you, but all my Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to your Perſon, and my ſeemingly firm Reſolutions immediately vaniſh'd. 'Tis not long ago, ſince the Marchioneſs</hi> de la Mothe <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided me with this frailty: How, Madam,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal briskly, <hi>that remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginſt Love, durſt ſhe talk thus to you? Certainly,</hi> continu'd he laughing, <hi>a Man muſt be very hard put to it for a dainty Bit, that wou'd venture to thruſt his Dagger into her Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, Vah! that naſty hole, if I may believe the deſcription which the Abbot</hi> de la Trape <hi>has given me of it. This Prior has ſworn to me, that he never met with ſo ugly, black and deep a Gap in his Life-time. Fie, Boufflers,</hi> ſaid the Counteſs, as if ſhe had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd at his Diſcourſe; <hi>are not you aſham'd thus to repreſent that pretty retiring Place of the Marchioneſs, as ſhe her ſelf uſually calls it when ſhe is in a good humour; and truly, if ſhe knew you thought otherwiſe of it, I can aſſure you, you wou'd be but a very unwelcome Gueſt to her. She told me one day, that the Abbot</hi> de la Trape, <hi>of whom you ſpoke juſt
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:109100:95"/>
now, had indeed once ſet up his Candle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Altar, and had Sacrifis'd upon his Knees in her preſence.</hi> Then <hi>Monſieur Boufflers</hi> interrupting her; <hi>'tis a pleaſant ſubject to inſiſt upon,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the Devil take me, if this Lady wou'd let me—I wou'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe a Cow for a Play-fellow: But away with it, let us talk no more of it, for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be ſick at the very Heart. It is you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>my lovely Creature,</hi> embracing her, <hi>that carry about you that ſweet retiring Place, which is the very Seat of Delight and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: I am very ſenſible of the tenderneſs of your Heart, which rewards it's Friends with ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſatisfaction. 'Tis true what you ſay,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd ſhe, <hi>this is the chiefeſt Ambition which I ever pretended to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Conference wou'd have laſted long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if one of the Marſhal's Servants had not come to tell him, that Madam <hi>de Maintenon</hi> was deſirous to ſpeak with him, as 'twas ſuppos'd by the King's Order, he having been wholly employ'd for ſeveral days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in aſſiſting at the frequent Councils of War, that were then held at <hi>Verſailles.</hi> A few Weeks after, he was oblig'd to enter upon the Campaign, which began very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Year. The King to encourage his Generals, march'd in Perſon at the head of his Army; and <hi>Namur</hi> was Beſieg'd in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> in the Year 1692. as it has
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:109100:96"/>
been already intimated; and the Trenches being open'd before it, between the Twenty ninth and Thirtieth, the Place was carry'd by Capitulation. The Marſhal did ſignaliſe himſelf there at ſeveral Times, as did alſo the Marqueſs <hi>de la Valette</hi> and <hi>de Gaſſe,</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals de Camp; after the ſurrender of the Town, both the Armies remain'd for ſome Time without Action; during which Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> was captivated by the Beauty of a certain young Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was retiring, with her Mother, into a Nunnery, and by the King's expreſs Command paſs'd through the Camp, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to go to a certain Abby of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Siſters. At the very firſt Sight of this young Lady, who was of good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and extraordinary Beautiful, he was touch'd with ſo tender Love and Reſpect for her, that for a conſiderable Time he cou'd not be at reſt; and that which vex'd him moſt was, that ſhe was in a Place where he had not the Opportunity to ſee her, when he had a Mind to it. At laſt, being grown impatient, at the Abſence of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd Miſtreſs, and conſulting more his Paſſion than his Reaſon, he reſolv'd to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe himſelf in Woman's Apparel, on purpoſe to give her a viſit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:109100:96"/>
Having in this Diſguiſe met her in the Parlour of the Nunnery, he did not delay to declare his Paſſion to her; unto which ſhe anſwer'd with ſo much Modeſty, that he was extremely charm'd with it. After his Departure, his Miſtreſs thought it moſt adviſable not to ſpeak any thing of her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd Lover, either to her Mother, or the reſt of the Religious Siſters, for fear of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome Jealouſie into their Brains, by which means ſhe might loſe the Advantage of entertaining him another Time. The next Day our General, being advertis'd that her Mother wou'd be abroad, had the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to viſit his Miſtreſs in her Chamber, which was juſt at the Entrance of the Abby; and the reſt of the Nuns believing it to be ſome particular Acquaintance of her's, did not concern themſelves any farther, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the Freedom of enjoying the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his <hi>Beloved</hi> for the ſpace of Two Hours. I leave it to the Judgment of the Reader to determine, whether he did not make uſe of all the affectionate Expreſſions, which his Paſſion cou'd ſuggeſt to him; but this I have underſtood ſince, That one of the Religious Siſters, whoſe Name was <hi>Coline,</hi> and who ſupply'd the place of an Apothecary in the Abbey, had eſpy'd (in paſſing by her Chamber into the Garden, where ſhe was going to gather ſome Herbs)
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:109100:97"/>
the Marſhal kneeling down before her, and kiſſing her Hands. For this Reaſon it was that this Bigot, ſuſpecting ſomewhat of the Matter, let the Marſhal, who in two or three Days return'd to renew his Viſit, ſtand at the Door almoſt an Hour, without opening it; the Marſhal, ſuſpecting the Truth, made ſuch a Noiſe, with the Bell, at the Abbey-Gate, that all the Religious Siſters came running down Stairs, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily demanded what his Buſineſs was? <hi>I wou'd willingly reply'd he,</hi> counterfeiting his Voice, <hi>ſpeak to Mademoiſelle Orton</hi> (which was the Name of his Miſtreſs.) The young Lady, being then call'd for, receiv'd him very courteouſly, but with ſome Reſtraint, her Mother, and Siſter <hi>Coline</hi> being preſent. The Marſhal, after a little Stay, finding himſelf ſo narrowly watch'd, thought it beſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp for that Time, and to defer his Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip till a more favourable opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was he gone, but Madam <hi>Orton</hi> ask'd her Daughter, How ſhe came acquainted with this Gentlewoman? <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> reply'd ſhe, <hi>ſhe is a certain young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a very good Family of</hi> Namur, <hi>who has a great Affection for me.</hi> Siſter <hi>Coline</hi> ſtanding by, began to ſmile at her Anſwer, which made her Mother ask the Name of this Lady. This Queſtion put her to a
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:109100:97"/>
great <hi>Non plus,</hi> becauſe the Marſhal and ſhe had not agreed upon any certain Name; yet having a good preſence of Mind, ſhe told her Mother, not without bluſhing, That her Name was <hi>Mademoiſelle de Bouffline,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Kinſwoman of the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> of whom they had receiv'd ſo many Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, during the Siege of <hi>Namur.</hi> Her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having as yet in freſh Remembrance the great Obligations receiv'd from the Marſhal, ask'd no further Queſtions, being well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd with this Anſwer. If Siſter <hi>Coline,</hi> that ſpiteful Baggage, wou'd have been as much contented, Matters were likely to go very well upon <hi>Mademoiſelle Orton</hi>'s Side. But that Demi-Devil, having taken notice that he was a Man in Woman's Apparel, communicated her Thoughts to two or three more of the Religious Siſters, who unanimouſly reſolv'd at his next approach to have him ſearch'd, by a certain ancient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron belonging to the Nunnery, who ſhou'd watch his coming to adore his Goodeſs; and indeed, they were no worſe than their Words, for he had not long been there, but he ſaw a grave old Woman entring the Room, with a great pair of Spectacles upon her Noſe, and a large pair of Sciſſors in her Hand, follow'd by a goodly Train of Nuns of the ſame Abbey. The Marſhal ſeeing himſelf deſtitute of all Arms, even ſo much as a
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:109100:98"/>
Stick, began to be afraid of their Motion, and made what haſte he cou'd to get to the Door. Being got pretty well clear of 'em, <hi>No, no, good Matrons,</hi> ſaid he to himſelf, <hi>I am not as yet fond of being gelt. I know what your Deſign was, you wou'd have cut off what you found did not belong to the Female Sex, becauſe I had been ſo bold as to come in without your Leave: Otherwiſe, I'm ſure, if a Gentleman gives you a private Viſit, with your own Conſent, you wou'd not upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count treat him ſo unkindly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mademoiſelle <hi>Orton</hi> ſeeing her ſelf, by this Contrivance, bereav'd of the Sight of her Gallant, appear'd much diſcontented at his Abſence, and having no other means left her, ſhe went one Morning to Maſs to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Abby, where ſhe had the good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to meet with him: She told him all that ſhe had endur'd ever ſince ſhe ſaw him laſt; adviſing him to come and ſee her in the Nunnery, without a Diſguiſe: Adding, That her Mother wou'd be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely glad to ſee him, to pay her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments for the great Obligations ſhe had receiv'd from him. <hi>You muſt be ſure,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>to talk of Love to the reſt of the Siſters, for they take great Delight in having a Man touch upon that String.</hi> The Marſhal, after having parted with his <hi>Beloved,</hi> began to conſider with himſelf, for ſome time,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:109100:98"/>
whether it were expedient for him to return to the ſame Place, where he had been ſo lately in danger of ſuffering an irreparable Loſs; but Love ſoon prevail'd o'r all other Conſiderations, eſpecially being animated by the Hopes of obtaining his Aim, if he went without Diſguiſe, inſomuch that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his Sword, he took care to provide a Pair of Pocket-Piſtols, and having taken along with him a luſty Fellow, his Servant, arm'd Capapee, he enter'd the Abby with an undaunted Courage. The Nuns quickly taking notice of a Man of ſo gallant and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging an Air, came all to receive him, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him Preſents of diverſe Relicks and <hi>Agnus Dei</hi>'s, and among the reſt one of the Religious Siſters, as fair and bright as the Day, preſented to him, a Heart made of her own Hair, which was all over pierc'd with Darts.</p>
            <p>The Marſhal having diſcover'd the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of this Charming Beauty, which had enchanted him even at the very firſt Sight, ſoon became forgetful of Madem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oiſelle <hi>Orton.</hi> He frequently repair'd to the Nunnery, where he wou'd entertain ſometimes one, ſometimes another, but his <hi>Franſſon</hi> (which was the beautiful Nun I ſpoke of before) was all his Delight and Comfort. Her Companions were ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with Jealouſie, that one Day they
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:109100:99"/>
threw an Ink horn full of Ink in her Face, on purpoſe to diſguiſe it; which being told to the Mother Abbeſs, ſhe made 'em do Penance for their Treſpaſs, enjoyning 'em for Eight Days together to dig the Ground, and to manure it with their bare Hands till it ſhou'd be as fine as Aſhes. Beſides this, they were to draw out of a deep Pit ten Tuns of Water into a leaky Veſſel, which run out as faſt as they pour'd it in. The Marſhal was overjoy'd to ſee what Satisfaction his Miſtreſs had receiv'd for the Affront put upon her, but to counterballance his Joy, he was much ſurpris'd to hear the Mother Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs (who was above Threeſcore Years of Age) tell him, That ſhe was fall'n deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately in Love with him. Indeed he was ſo amaz'd at it, that he ſtept two or three Paces backward, and if he had not been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by a Table that ſtood behind him, he wou'd have ſcarce been able to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upright. The good Woman took ſo much Pains to repreſent to him the vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of her Paſſion, in Terms ſo lively and natural, that he ſtood quite aſtoniſh'd at it. Perhaps it will not be improper to give you a Character of this old Hag. She was of a very ſmall Stature, and crooked; her Noſe very ſhort; her Eyes and Mouth big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than all the reſt of her Face; her Fore-head about the Bigneſs of a Finger's Breadth,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:109100:99"/>
and two great Teeth ſtuck out of her Mouth before; but for the reſt, ſhe was very inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, and had an extraordinary Wit. She made a very fine Sonnata concerning her Paſſion for the General, which begins thus, I having forgot the reſt.</p>

               <l>Incomparable <hi>Boufflers!</hi> let me ſing</l>
               <l>Thy Praiſe, thou greatest Herce of the Age:</l>
               <l>All things on Earth and Sea do dread thy Rage,</l>

            <p>The Marſhal was very hardly put to it how to manage ſo unuſual a Love-concern with this old Beldam, whom he was unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſoblige, in regard that ſhe was the ſupreme Governeſs of the Nunnery; when one Day, not being able to have any longer Patience to expect his Reſolution, ſhe laid hold of him in a Corner, as he was going to a Chamber of one of the Nuns, where ſhe hugg'd him ſo cloſely with her two raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon'd Arms, which were as tough as Sticks, that 'twas impoſſible for him to get looſe from her Embraces. The Marſhal being afraid that ſome of the Siſters might ſurpriſe 'em told her, <hi>Pray, good Mother, do your Matters a little more in private, for fear of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:109100:100"/>
giving Scandal. You are in the right on't, my Son,</hi> cry'd ſhe, drawing him by main Force into a Cloſet, hard by, where ſhe begg'd him, <hi>Not to deny her any longer that Favour which ſhe ſo much wiſh'd for. And what Favour is that?</hi> ſaid the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> laughing. <hi>That is my Son,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd ſhe, ſhaking her Head, <hi>to put your Sword here, after I have beſprinkl'd it with Holy Water, to drive away the Evil Spirit</hi> (for ſo the Nuns of <hi>Namur</hi> uſually call Love) <hi>that thus torments me.</hi> The Marſhal, who cou'd not but underſtand her Meaning, and being uncertain what to reſolve upon. <hi>You ſtrangle me! don't ſtrangle me!</hi> and ſo having ſhut his Eyes, <hi>Come,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>let us enter the Breach, in the Dark; all Cats are Grey.</hi> The Mother Abbeſs, who was extremely well ſatisfy'd, deſir'd him to renew the Attack the next Day; but he was not ſo well pleas'd with the firſt, and therefore having made the Sign of the Croſs all over him, he ſaid, in a Language unknown to her, <hi>Away from me Satan.</hi> The good Woman being exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated at this Repulſe, flung her ſelf about his Neck, laying her Fiſts about his Ears: All which he took very patiently, but perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe was about to vent her Anger up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Perriwig and Ruffles, he turn'd up her Back-ſide, and having ſoundly clapp'd her Buttocks, which were as red and lean as
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:109100:100"/>
an Ape's; the whole Nunnery was alarm'd at the Outcries: The Nuns came running, with all poſſible ſpeed, to the Chamber of their Abbeſs, whom they found crying like a Child, whilſt the Marſhal was not able to forbear laughing, and to ſave himſelf was oblig'd to tell the whole Story. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Old Beldam took it ſo heinouſly, that not being able any longer to bear the Confuſion ſhe was in, and the Reproaches which muſt needs attend ſuch a Diſcovery, ſhe hang'd her ſelf for Grief the next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Night. The Marſhal taking the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of theſe Diſorders, hunted about the Nunnery till he met with his belov'd <hi>Franſſon</hi> whom he had debauch'd; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving afterwards caus'd her to be diſguis'd in the Habit of a Page, ſhe follow'd him in the Camp, and was preſent at the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of <hi>Steenkirk,</hi> which was fought in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</hi> Under this diſguiſe ſhe waited upon him in his Tent, and in all other places, without the leaſt ſuſpicion of her being a Woman, except that the Prince <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſome few hours before he was ſlain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſuſpect the Truth, who without doub't wou'd have diſcover'd the whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, if Death had not prevented him. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Boufflers</hi> was ſo careful of his Page, that he went no where without him, and he was call'd by no other name in the Army, than <hi>The handſome Page.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:109100:101"/>
During theſe intrigues, the Marſhal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Letters from the Counteſs of—whom he had left at <hi>Paris,</hi> and from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle Orton,</hi> who was as yet in the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery near <hi>Namur.</hi> Theſe two fair Ladies were not ſparing in upbraiding him with his Indifferency and Fickleneſs. But, alaſs! theſe are weak Efforts againſt Men of ſo changable a Temper as our General then was, who ſeldom are concern'd at the Reproaches of an abandon'd Miſtreſs. He receiv'd very frequent Letters from both, which were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſacrifis'd to the Flames without ſo much as reading 'em. <hi>Franſſon,</hi> was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a Spectatrix of it, and had the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to hear him ſay, that it was done for her ſake. Winter approaching, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was divided and ſent to the Garriſons, the Marſhal taking his way <hi>(incognito)</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to <hi>Paris,</hi> attended by his Page: The Counteſs, who had got Intelligence that he had been ſix or eight Weeks in Town, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing her, at laſt came to find him out at his Lodgings; where ſhe upbraided him in a moſt outragious manner: But he did not anſwer her one Word, and having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd one of his Servants to ſhut the Door upon her, he look'd above to ſee her depart, without being in the leaſt diſcern'd by her. This Lady having ſomewhere or another got notice that he was in love with a young
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:109100:101"/>
Woman who liv'd with him under the diſguiſe of a Page, happen'd juſt to meet her upon the ſtairs as ſhe was going down, playing with a little Dog, one of the fineſt that ever was ſeen, which the Marſhal had brought along with him from the Campaign. This Dog, after ſhe had firſt had ſeveral ſlices with a Knife at the beautiful Page's Face, ſhe threw out at Window, which was next to her, and ſo made the beſt of her way. The poor young Gentlewoman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus miſerably handl'd and calling to mind what befel her not long ago, as to the Ink-horn in the Nunnery, <hi>Alas Heavens!</hi> cry'd ſhe, <q>am I not very unfortunate, that every one has a deſign againſt that little Beauty which Nature has beſtow'd upon me.</q> The Marſhal, who ſoon knew the Voice of his female Page, opening the Chamber-door, run out with all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpeed to ſee what accident had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, and found her all over cover'd with Blood. He had never been more hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily vex'd in all his Life-time, but all that cou'd be done at that inſtant, was to ſend for an able Surgeon who heal'd her Wounds in a little time, with ſo much Skill, that not the leaſt Scarr ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:109100:102"/>
However, the Marſhal conceiv'd ſo great an Averſion toward the Counteſs, that all the World was extremely ſurpriz'd at it, conſidering to what a degree he had Lov'd her before. One evening during the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naval, the Marqueſs <hi>de Boufflers</hi> came in Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade, to a Ball, made by the Order of the Duke <hi>de Villeroy;</hi> of which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs having had ſome notice, ſhe alſo went thither in a diſguiſe, and took out our General to Dance with her; but he by ſome ſecret inſtinct, ſuppoſing it to be her, excus'd himſelf, and to avoid any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confuſion, immediately left the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. The next Night was wholly ſpent by him in running thro' the Ball diſguis'd in the Habit of a Satyr, with his Page, who with her fair Hair ſpread all over her ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Danc'd to the admiration of all the Spectators; every one being amaz'd at the becoming Air and Meen of <hi>Franſſon,</hi> who paſs'd for a young Man among thoſe that did not know her; to the great ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our General, who cou'd not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear laughing at it.</p>
            <p>Not long after, Madam <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, of the Marſhal <hi>de Luxemburg</hi> fell deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately in Love with her, which was a moſt pleaſant Scene to <hi>Boufflers,</hi> and ſerv'd as an agreeable Diverſion to him for a long
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:109100:102"/>
time after. She never made him a Viſit, but all her Diſcourſe run upon the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this Page, whom ſhe thought as fair as an Angel; <hi>beſides</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that there is ſomewhat ſo uncommon and ſo amiable in his Air, that 'tis impoſſible for a tender Heart to reſiſt ſuch engaging Charms; 'tis very well for you Men that he was not born a Woman, for he wou'd certainly have ſet you all in a flame, and burnt you to aſhes; I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, Madam,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal with a ſmile, <hi>a Beauty ſo fair as my Page, might cauſe great diſorders in the World, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prudent Nature having foreſeen this evil, judg'd it most expedient to make him a Man, as he appears to be: But Sir,</hi> ſaid Madam <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> interrupting him, and caſting a very Paſſionate look upon <hi>Franſſon, Don't you believe that a Man who is endow'd with extraordinary perfections, may cauſe as many Commotions among our Sex, as a fair Lady does among yours? Yes very well Madam,</hi> ſaid our General, <hi>I am throughly convinc'd that your Hearts are as tender as ours, nay that you out do us in certain reſpects. You Love with more conſtancy and reality, whilſt we Men are continually upbraided with Levity in changing our Miſtreſſes as often as we pleaſe: For my part, if I were oblig'd to ſpeak ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, I muſt confeſs that I have ſeen great
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:109100:103"/>
variety of Countries in the Empire of</hi> Venus, <hi>and have made thoſe Ladies ſufficiently ſenſible of it, with whom I have had any Love-concerns for ſome time. For I never ſet up for much Conſtancy, it being a thing I never was ambitious of. An Engagement which laſts above two or three Months becomes burdenſome; and variety is moſt agreeable to my Humour, eſpecially in matters of Love; which, nevertheleſs, ſeldom ſuits with the Temper of the Female Sex, who take a particular Delight, and make it a point of Honour to preſerve the remainders of an old Paſſion, almoſt quite worn out, meerly to have the ſatisfaction to ſay,</hi> 
               <q>Such and ſuch a one ſtill continues to Love me, a convincing proof, that my Charms have been ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful as to keep him in Chains even to this very Day.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Truly Sir,</hi> reply'd the Lady, <hi>you ſpeak very favourably of our Sex, when you tell us,</hi> That you take 'em to be more Conſtant than yours. <hi>We are at least as fickle as you; and if it were not for a certain kind of Modeſty, inſeparable from our Sex, believe me, we ſhou'd be as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſeek for new Gallants, as you are to find out freſh Beauties. I know not what to ſay to it, Madam,</hi> ſaid the Marſhal, laughing; <hi>this I ſee plainly, that none in this World can be free from Faults, if Changeableneſs is to be counted ſo. Franſſon,</hi> who was almoſt tir'd
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:109100:103"/>
with hearing her thus Prattle without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and knowing that <hi>Monſieur de Bouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flers</hi> paid her a great deal of Reſpect, more out of Policy, than any thing elſe, went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Room over head, from whence, through the Clefts of the Planks, ſhe pour'd ſome dirty Water upon her Head-Dreſs, of which ſhe was the niceſt Woman in the World, and which was always exactly ſet in the Quills, whilſt ſhe affected to imitate the motions of a Puppet.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>de Boufflers</hi> ſeem'd to be very angry with his Page, chiding him, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him an awkward Fool. But the Lady im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately took <hi>Franſſon</hi>'s part, telling the Marſhal, That 'twas of ſo little conſequence, that he ought not to chide ſo pretty a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as that, about it; eſpecially ſince it was done by miſchance, without any malicious Intent. <hi>No, Madam,</hi> reply'd the Page with a great deal of affected Simplicity, <hi>It was my Maſter's Ape, that in running after me, overthrew the Water-bowl: We are Play-fellows together, and I often ſuffer for his Tricks, of which 'tis impoſſible to break him.</hi> She ſpoke all this, with ſo much ſeeming In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, that ſhe charm'd Madam <hi>Chatillon</hi> to the higheſt degree, who went home more amorous than ever. She had no ſooner enter'd her own Houſe, but having firſt
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:109100:104"/>
chang'd her Head-cloaths and Linnen, ſhe lock'd her ſelf up in her Cloſet, to make Reflections upon her growing Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>The Marſhal, after ſhe was gone, ask'd <hi>Franſſon,</hi> Whether ſhe had ſpilt the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi>'s Siſter on purpoſe? <hi>Yes, my Dearest,</hi> reply'd ſhe, embracing him, <hi>I had only a mind to be rid of this prattling Creature, who is continually Talking without intermiſſion. You are an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Baggage,</hi> reply'd the General with a Smile, <hi>thus to abuſe a poor Gentlewoman, who ſhews ſo much Affection towards you. O,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Franſſon, that is, becauſe ſhe verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves me to be a Man; but if ſhe ſhou'd go about to ſearch me, ſhe wou'd ſoon be convinc'd to the contrary, ſo that is behoves me to take a great deal of care not to let her come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts; for in regard that ſhe has no great ſhare of Diſcretion, it wou'd not be long e're ſhe wou'd divulge the Matter to all the World. I only wonder that the Marſhal, her Brother, has not found out the Myſtery before this time, by the help of his Magical Art: Indeed I am ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afraid of that old Devil, as often as I ſee him. My pretty little Creature,</hi> ſaid the Marſhal, <hi>he has the misfortune to be a Scare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crow to the handſome Ladies; he never has had any ſucceſs in Love concerns. I don't know by
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:109100:104"/>
what means he inſinuated himſelf into the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Counteſs</hi> de Soiſſons, <hi>ſhe being the only Woman that ever lov'd him in his Life-time; as he has often told me with his own Mouth, not without much regret, he being a great admirer of the Fair Sex. But my dear</hi> Bouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flers, anſwer'd <hi>Franſſon,</hi> with a languiſhing Air, <hi>I have been told that the Duke</hi> de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency <hi>and the Count</hi> de Luce <hi>are very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd Gentlemen, and very dextrous in the Art of Courtſhip. That is true enough,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Marſhal, <hi>but they have not ſuch a dangerous Head piece as their Father, they are of a ſweet and agreeable Temper; they are not for ranſacking Heaven and Earth to find out their depth, and to dive into the moſt abſtruſe Secrets of Love; neither is there any need of all that ſtir, ſince the Charms of this Paſſion are altogether founded upon Innocence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Franſſon</hi> was accuſtom'd frequently to diſpute thus with her Gallant, and that too in ſo charming a manner, that ſhe for ſome time was the abſolute Miſtreſs of his Heart; when, upon a ſudden, he took a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either to Marry her, or elſe to put her into ſome Nunnery for the remainder of her Life. The laſt of theſe two Means was more eaſie to be accompliſh'd than the former, wherefore he propos'd to her this Retirement, as the moſt honourable and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:109100:105"/>
moſt advantagious in her preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. The Gentlewoman was in the greateſt Agony in the World e're ſhe cou'd reſolve upon it, becauſe ſhe lov'd him ſo affectionately, that ſhe cou'd rather have dy'd than live without him. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all her Sighs and Tears, Monſieur <hi>Boufflers,</hi> who was reſolv'd to be rid of her, having in view a moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Match for himſelf, of which we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak hereafter, put her into a Nunnery in the Suburbs of S. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi> without having made any one privy to the Buſineſs, except the Abbeſs, whom he had perſwaded that ſhe was his Kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; having preſented her beſides this, with a conſiderable Sum of Mony, in recompence of her former good Services. Thus this fair Lady once more put on the Habit of a Nun. But before ſhe did it, ſhe was deſirous to be upon tryal for ſome time, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that it was expedient for her to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve whether that courſe of Life wou'd agree with her Conſtitution. But this was not the true reaſon of her delay; ſhe was in hopes ſtill that her Lover, before this time was expir'd, might repent of having ſhut her up in a Nunnery, and that he might be prevail'd upon to Marry her, conformably to ſome ſlight Promiſes which he had made her
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:109100:105"/>
to that effect, during the height of his Paſſion. But Words ſpoken by a Lover to a Woman, when they are in the heat of their Paſſion, cannot be compar'd to any thing more appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely than to the floating of the Sea, which depends upon the variableneſs of the Winds.</p>
            <p>Our General, finding himſelf now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engag'd from all his Miſtreſſes, began to lead a very regular and ſolitary courſe of Life, ſo that Madam <hi>de Maintenon</hi> having obſerv'd him ſo much alter'd from what he had been before, made no difficulty to ſpeak in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half to <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont,</hi> Daughter of the Marſhal of the ſame Name, who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving formerly commanded the King's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, had ſignaliz'd himſelf on ſeveral Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. The Abbeſs of St. <hi>Cyr</hi> did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to give her an Account of all his rare Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, unto which the young Lady reply'd but very little, being not unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſome of his amorous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigues, and believing him only to act the Hypocrite like a Jeſuit. But our General, being a great Favourite of Madam <hi>Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>'s, had often an opportunity to ſee her there; and having always ſhew'd her a more than ordinary deference and reſpect, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan by degrees to have a better Opinion of him and his Actions. One Day being left
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:109100:106"/>
alone with her, he began to declare his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to her by halves, but was ſo extremely over-aw'd by her Preſence, that he was not able to proceed in his Diſcourſe; the exceſs of his Love made him ſtammer almoſt at every Word; which caus'd <hi>Mademoiſelle</hi> to laugh at his Tranſports. He ſoon after, had a Quartan Ague for three Months, which was commonly call'd the Intervals of his Love; inſomuch that he was oblig'd to take a good Quantity of <hi>Quinquina,</hi> or <hi>Jeſuit's Powder,</hi> which cur'd him of his Ague, but occaſion'd a moſt violent Head-ach, for which he was advis'd to have recourſe to the Waters of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> as he did. He was juſt upon the point of getting a new Miſtreſs upon the Road, but having recollected himſelf, how prejudicial ſuch an Intrigue might prove to his preſent Deſign, he thought it more adviſeable in this juncture, to keep a ſtrong guard over his Heart, which wou'd willingly have made an Elope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and to fortifie it ſo well, as not to fear any Attack, except from <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont,</hi> unto whom all its Avenues and Paſſes were to be open'd.</p>
            <p>Thus he ſpent ſome time in this Solitude, but he cou'd not hold out long, for he ſoon after, began to fix his Eyes on a young Laundreſs, who was wont to bring his Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen

every Day to his Chamber; and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that ſuch an Intrigue might be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd on privately, without any noiſe, he was reſolv'd to try his Fortune; which prov'd very favourable to him, ſhe having, without much reluctancy, hearken'd to his firſt Propoſal. His <hi>Valet du Chambre,</hi> who always found his Bed tumbl'd after he had made it, not in the leaſt ſuſpecting that his Maſter had any concerns in it, made a Complaint to the Landlady. <hi>I have obſerv'd,</hi> ſaid the good Woman of the Houſe, <hi>that as often as</hi> Judith <hi>comes, I find the Bed in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; God forgive me, if I wrong her. You are not in earnest,</hi> Dame <hi>Roux,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Valet du Chambre,</hi> laughing: <hi>Do you imagine that my Maſter wou'd meddle with ſuch a Drab as this, who has kiſs'd ſo many fine Ladies? Thou art a good honest Blockhead,</hi> Champonniere, ſaid the Landlady, laughing as hard as ſhe cou'd, <hi>Dost thou not know, that a mad Dog falls upon every Thing that lies in his Way? Well,</hi> reply'd the Servant, joking, <hi>when all is done, no Body ſhall e're perſwade me, That 'tis not a much greater Pleaſure to kiſs a fair Lady of Quality than a dirty Drab. Oh! when I think of thoſe pretty Buttocks, thoſe Hands, thoſe white and delicate Bubbies, which I have taken notice of in my Maſter's Ladies, it tickles me all over the whole Body, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:109100:107"/>
here about the Middle—Oh! I am quite beſides my ſelf, I ſhall run ſtark mad, if I think on't any longer. As far as I ſee,</hi> anſwer'd the Dame of the Houſe ſcoffing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>your Skin is mightily tickl'd with this Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which has ſet you all on a Flame. But, prithee, tell me, thou great Fool, Doſt thou believe me ſo ſimple as to imagine that thy Maſter wou'd make thee privy to his Miſtreſſes Beauties? May the Devil take me,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd he, <hi>if I have not often ſeen 'em, in going and coming, in and out of the Chamber, when he was buſie in—and was not at Leiſure to take notice of me. Plague! on thee for a Beast,</hi> cry'd the Landlady, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as loud as ſhe cou'd; <hi>Come Spark, I'll acquaint the Marſhal</hi> de Boufflers <hi>with it, who I believe, will give thee a good Reward for the Pains thou takeſt to divulge his Amours. You'll have a care of that, Dame</hi> Roux, reply'd <hi>Champonniere,</hi> blowing the Smoak of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco in her Face, <hi>or elſe I ſhall go near to have your white Top knot dy'd Black, as</hi> Apollo <hi>ſerv'd the Sexton, who was officious in relating to him, what he had heard others ſay concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him.

                        <hi>AMong all the Mortals who have ador'd you, none e're lov'd you with ſo tranſcendent a Paſſion as my ſelf, beyond all that ever can be conceiv'd tender, for ſo adorable a Perſon as your ſelf. I am at preſent reduc'd to ſuch a Condition, as I never knew before; that is to ſay, I am the moſt unfortunate of all Men that ever were made for Love, except yon take Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of my Sufferings.

            <p>Mademoiſelle <hi>de Grammont</hi> happen'd to be at Madam <hi>Maintenon</hi>'s, when ſhe receiv'd this Letter, and after having perus'd it, ſhe fell a laughing, and told Madam <hi>Maintenon; I muſt acknowledge that the Marſhal</hi> de Boufflers <hi>has a very pretty way of writing. I cou'd ſcarce have believ'd that a Soldier cou'd be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd with ſo much Gallantry. Sure Mademoiſelle,</hi> reply'd Madam <hi>de Maintenon, you are not in Earneſt; does not Love take its Riſe even in the very midſt of Arms, and is not Gallantry the most eſſential Character of a Warriour? Don't we ſee your</hi> Alexanders, Caeſars <hi>and</hi> Pompeys
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:109100:108"/>
               <hi>inclin'd to this tender Paſſion in the midst of their Conqueſts, deſpiſing to reap the Fruits of their most glorious Victories, without the ſoft Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their beloved Miſtreſſes? Love has been in all Ages the Delight of Great Men, and is of all other Paſſions the moſt innocent, provided it be us'd with Moderation and Diſcretion, which indeed, are the Two Foundation-Pillars of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Felicity. What is more natural than to love that which is amiable? The very irrational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves, if they ſee any thing ſurpriſing, cannot avoid looking upon it; and can it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſtrange to you, Mademoiſelle,</hi> ſaid the Lady very pleaſantly, <hi>that our Marſhal</hi> de Boufflers, <hi>who has a very diſcerning Judgment, ſhou'd ſtand amaz'd at your Beauty, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other engaging Qualities, too too powerful for him to reſiſt? Madam,</hi> anſwer'd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle <hi>de Grammont, you ſhew as much Generoſity as the Gentleman himſelf of whom you ſpeak, thus to conceal my Faults. I cou'd wiſh my ſelf Miſtreſs of thoſe Perfections, which you are pleas'd ſo freely to attribute to me. Ah! fair Creature,</hi> reply'd the Lady, <hi>don't oppoſe a Truth which is really due to your Merits, Poor</hi> Boufflers <hi>is only too ſenſible of it, 'tis that which has touch'd his Heart to the Quick. And do you really believe it, Madam,</hi> reply'd the young Lady coldly, <hi>Is it poſſible that the Heart of ſo genteel and ſo gallant a Man as he is,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:109100:109"/>
can be wounded at this time? Oh! I much doubt it. And why ſo, 'pray?</hi> reply'd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Maintenon; thoſe that have ſo many Miſtreſſes don't always part with their Liberty, but commonly keep their Heart to their own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. There is a vaſt difference between that ſort of Love which is beſtow'd upon a Miſtreſs, and that which belongs to a Wife. An unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd Perſon, without ſome little Love-Exerciſe, grows dull and good for nothing. It ſeems as if ſome little Love-Intrigue ſerves to animate his Vital Spirits, and renders him more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble among Women. I will allow it you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> ſaid Mademoiſelle, <hi>provided theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues are not carry'd on to that height as the Marſhal</hi> de Boufflers <hi>has been accuſtom'd to do; there is none that can be ignorant of his Love. Adventures. And what extraordinary Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is there in all this, Mademoiſelle,</hi> reply'd the Lady, ſmiling, <hi>he will be the better able to find the way that leads him to the Glory of pleaſing you, a Man cannot be too well skill'd in the Art of Love. But, Madam,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>ſometimes theſe conquering Gentlemen pay dear for their Knowledge. Soft, ſoft, my Darling,</hi> cry'd Madam <hi>de Maintenon, don't you believe that the Marſhal has very good Skill in Women? Indeed I know him to be ſo nice in this point, that I dare engage for him. Madam, your Surety is without Exception,</hi> anſwer'd Mademoiſelle, <hi>and I will rely upon all that you have ſaid, and hope
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:109100:109"/>
you'll give me Leave to depart for this Time, that I may be at Leiſure to give him a ſuitable Anſwer to his Civilities. In ſhort, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle,</hi> ſaid Madam <hi>Maintenon,</hi> riſing from her Seat, <hi>you'll do very well; for he is a very worthy Gentleman, who does not deſerve to be ſlighted. You do not know what Time may bring to paſs, perhaps he may one Day become your Husband. Mademoiſelle de Grammont</hi> had no ſooner left the Abbeſs of St. <hi>Cyr,</hi> but retiring into her Chamber, ſhe wrote the Marſhal theſe following Lines.

                        <hi>IS it poſſible to believe, that you ſhou'd be ſo much in Love, as you pretend, after you have Travell'd through ſo many Countries? Perhaps, all thoſe Ladies whom you have hitherto met with, wanted ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Charms to engage your Heart: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, you wou'd induce one to believe, to your Advantage, that you have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible Stock of Affection for thoſe, whom you wou'd perſwade they deſerve it. But, if one may take the boldneſs to tell you, that ſince that Fire you ſpeak of, as often as it is tranſplanted, loſes every time ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of its innate Vigour, it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity

I am willing, nevertheleſs, to believe thus much for your ſake, that there may be left ſome ſmall remainders of your Heart, which you are ready to offer me as a ſecond-Hand Sacrifice. In return of this your fine Preſent, I will alſo promiſe to you ſo much of my Inclination as is ſuitable to it; I mean ſo far as to accept it: This ought to be taken as ſomething not fit to be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis'd; for you know, Sir, that even the leaſt Boon that a Lady grants to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, immediately is dignify'd with the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of a Favour, which is commonly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented through a magnifying Glaſs, much bigger than it is really intended: But let it be as it will, I am willing to beſtow ſomewhat upon it, to have the ſatisfaction of hearing it ſaid, that you have ſome Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for me, and that at preſent I am the ſole Miſtreſs of a Heart, which formerly was ſhar'd among ſo many Beauties.</hi>

The Marſhal having read and kiſs'd the Letter a thouſand times over, found it very witty, and extremely well writ. <hi>How!</hi> cry'd he, laughing, <hi>who has made you ſo well acquainted with my former Amours? You have a very pretty way of upbraiding me very wittily with all my former Miſtreſſes. Ha! I don't diſlike this Humour of yours, for out of what you ſay, I am ſufficiently convinc'd, that you don't hate me: And the laſt Reſerve which you offer me of ſome part of your Inclinations, tho' but very ſmall at preſent, is nevertheleſs very acceptable to me; Time, I don't queſtion, will provide for the reſt, and abate much of your Cruelty.</hi> While the Marſhal was thus talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Judith</hi> came into his Chamber with a pair of Point <hi>de Venice</hi> Ruffles, which were ſome Days before torn in pieces in one of their amorous Skirmiſhes. <hi>Here,</hi> Mr. Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goon, ſaid ſhe, throwing 'em at his Face, <hi>theſe are the Remnants of your fine Ruffles, which I have ſticht together as well as I cou'd. How now, you little ſawcy Baggage,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Boufflers, where are you Manners? Is this your way of ſpeaking to a Gentleman? I will promiſe thee, that to break thee of this famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity, I'll make uſe of a good Birch-broom: I am not ignorant that when a Man and a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man have been ſo cloſely acquainted as we, Love
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:109100:111"/>
knows no inequality; nevertheleſs, I wou'd have you keep your ſelf at ſome diſtance, for very good Reaſons. And I Sir,</hi> reply'd the young Wench, <hi>wou'd have you do the ſame thing with reſpect to me: Pray have a care, another time, not to make me Dance ſtark naked, without a Shift, round your Chamber, and then to pretend to put in backwards ſomething which I did not care ſhou'd—O what a pretty ſort of Clyſter you were about to apply to me! And what great matter is there in all this, you wanton Slut,</hi> cry'd the General, <hi>I was applying it in the right place, and where it does most good: I know very well whereabouts thou art now, thou wou'dst have me put it in another place: No queſtion,</hi> reply'd <hi>Judith, becauſe that is the proper place where ſuch Applications ought to be made. Well, well then,</hi> ſaid the Marſhal, throwing her upon his Bed, <hi>let us try whether I can Syringe you right there or not. Hold, hold, a little, Sir,</hi> ſaid <hi>Judith,</hi> giving him three or four good Poults with her double Fiſt upon his Back, <hi>What the Devil are you going to do? Your Tools are ſoon ready; you might have ask'd first whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mine were ſo too. You Gentlemen of the Province of</hi> Picardy, <hi>are ſo brisk and forward; but I wou'd have you not be ſo over-eager.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Marſhal, in the mean while, little minding what ſhe ſaid, advanc'd a-pace, and that ſo furiouſly, that he drew Blood from
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:109100:111"/>
the poor Girl, who then began to cry for her Maiden head, which, as ſhe ſaid, ſhe had kept entire till that time. The Land-lady coming ſome Hours after, into the Chamber to make the Bed, found upon the Sheets ſome few Drops, or Spots, the Marks of a loſt Virginity, which made her not doubt any longer but that Monſieur <hi>Boufflers</hi> was wont to kiſs his Laundreſs. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, being acquainted with <hi>Judith</hi>'s Mother, told her all that ſhe knew concerning the Matter, and that ſhe believ'd the General had debauch'd the ſilly Wench. Her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was a Herb-woman in the leſſer Green-Market, and who pretended to be very careful of her Daughters Honour, left all her Herbs and Seeds, running the ſame Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directly to the Marſhal's Lodgings, with one Hand on her ſide, and a great Stick in the other, where ſhe thus began to accoſt him: <q>I wou'd fain know, good Sir, with what Impudence you cou'd attempt to debauch my Daughter, whom I have brought up with ſo much care. I wiſh that S. <hi>Martin,</hi> who hears me, may puniſh me ſeverely for all my Sins, if I don't tickle your Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, except you reſtore my Daughter's Honour; a Pox! on your damn'd Tricks.</q> The Marſhal burſt out a Laughing very heartily; <q>
                  <hi>And Mother</hi> Gobille (this was the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:109100:112"/>
Herb-woman's Name) <hi>ſaid he,</hi> which way wou'd you have me reſtore your Daughter's Honour, whom you believe I have—Truly theſe ſorts of Breaches are never to be repair'd.</q> 
               <q>I know that as well as you, good Sir, <hi>ſaid ſhe, raving for Madneſs,</hi> but then I'll make your Purſe pay for it. What! ſhall I ſee my Child turn Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and get nothing by the Bargain? No, before <hi>George, added ſhe, lifting up her Stick,</hi> be you never ſo much a Marſhal over the King's Armies, I'll lay this over your Head, except—</q> 
               <q>Hold, hold, Dame <hi>Gobille, cry'd the Marſhal, taking hold of her Arm,</hi> don't be ſo furious; how much do you demand for your Daughter's Maiden-head? You muſt let me have a Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, becauſe perhaps I had it not all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely.</q> 
               <q>Then you own you had it, my good natur'd Friend, <hi>reply'd the Woman with her Eyes rolling in her Head,</hi> I'll ſwear you ſhall pay for't, or elſe I ſhall ſeiſe on your Field-Equippage, which is all you are worth in the World.</q> 
               <q>And how doſt thou know, <hi>my dear Bird, anſwer'd</hi> Bouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flers, that that is all what I am worth? Who has given thee an account of my Circumſtances? Thou art very impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to treat a Gentleman of my Quality ſo rudely. Get thee gone for an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:109100:112"/>
Piece as thou art, thou deſerv'ſt to be ſoundly cudgell'd with the ſame Stick thou haſt the Impudence to lift up againſt me.</q> 
               <q>Pay me, <hi>ery'd the Herb-woman as loud as ſhe cou'd,</hi> pay me for my Daughter's Maiden-head, or elſe I'll go to my Lord Arch-biſhop, who will make you pay dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for it. This Holy Man knows the true value of a Virginity. You, Soldiers, are ſo inur'd to pillaging and raviſhing whilſt you are in the Army, that you make no Conſcience of it at home.</q> She cou'd not utter theſe laſt Words without a whole Flood of Tears, ſo that our Marſhal taking ſome Compaſſion of her, threw her a golden <hi>Louis,</hi> telling her, <q>That he thought he had paid dear enough for ſuch a Bit.</q> But ſhe threw the Piece at his Head, ſaying, <q>Is not this a very fine ſort of Payment for ſo dainty a Morſel? You ſhall not come off thus, for I expect above Thirty of theſe, and you may be glad if I am contented ſo. You that pretend to be ſo fine a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, are you not aſham'd to offer a Piſtole for a Maiden-head? Fie for ſhame! let no body hear of it. If all the Ladies of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in this Town have no better Pay, it will ſcarce afford 'em Water to waſh their Hands. And truly that is the reaſon why I was ſo careful of my Daughter's Maiden-head,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:109100:113"/>
till now; but ſince ſhe has let the Cat taſte of the Cheeſe, I ſuppoſe ſhe will be no more at my diſpoſal There, Dame, ſaid <hi>Boufflers, who was quite tir'd with her Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies,</hi> there are four Piſtoles for you; Decamp immediately, or elſe I will order the Cannon, which I have ſent for, to be diſcharg'd upon you.</q> The poor Woman, being frighted at theſe Words, was about to pack up her Awls; but the Marſhal repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that he had not giv'n her ſomething more for her Daughter's Virginity, threw her down two other Piſtoles, bidding her to be gone, without any further delay, which ſhe did.</p>
            <p>Our General being left alone in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and having recollected in his Mind all that had happen'd concerning <hi>Judith;</hi> he began to accuſe her of Indiſcretion in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Mother, of what had paſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 'em; not dreaming that it was his Landlady that had made this Diſcovery. When therefore ſhe came the next Day to ſee him, according to her uſual cuſtom, he upbraided her with her Fooliſhneſs: But the young Wench ſwore that it never enter'd her Thoughts; telling him, <hi>That he ought not to take her to be ſo ſottiſh, as to let her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know her Love-concerns, from whom ſhe cou'd not expect any encouragement upon ſuch
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:109100:113"/>
an Account. And who cou'd ſpeak of it elſe but you?</hi> reply'd <hi>Boufflers</hi> briskly. <hi>This Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture will ſhortly be the whole Town-talk, and I ſhou'd be vex'd to the very Heart, if ſome of my Friends ſhou'd come to hear of it, partly for your own ſake, it being certain that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but to your great diſadvantage.</hi> I fanſie, <hi>my Lord,</hi> reply'd <hi>Judith,</hi> having mus'd for ſome time upon the matter, <hi>that this News came firſt out of your own Lodgings, and it is your Land lady whom I moſt ſuſpect; ſhe having obſerv'd me frequently to go to your Chamber, and that too ſometimes at unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable hours: I know her to be an old Make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate that is always ready to thruſt her Noſe every where. Beſides, ſhe is a particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of my Mother's, who ſerves her with Sallets and Herbs at a cheap rate. I believe it to be true,</hi> ſaid the Marſhal, much vex'd; <hi>but 'tis abſolutely neceſſary to break off our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe even at this very inſtant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I charge you to forbear coming to me any longer for very weighty reaſons. Not that I ever ſhall have the leaſt averſion to you, but on the contrary, I ſhall Love you better for the future than ever I did before, and I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to ſee you from time to time</hi> incognito; <hi>but ſo, that no body ſhall have the leaſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it; in the mean while take this,</hi> ſaid he, (putting ſome Mony into her hands)
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:109100:114"/>
               <hi>make the beſt uſe of it you can till we meet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. But above all things I expect you ſhou'd make me a ſolemn promiſe, that you will carry matters on with diſcretion, and that you will not ſpeak a word of it to any Perſon living, but let all be bury'd in ſilence, otherwiſe you'll have cauſe to repent it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Laundreſs having given her conſent to every Article which the Marſhal propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s'd, was juſt ready to leave the Room, but before ſhe was well got out of the door, ſhe turn'd back again ſaying: <q>But, Sir, if I ſhou'd prove with Child, what muſt I do then? Who will Father it? Who knows but ſuch a thing may happen? Go, go, my Child, <hi>anſwer'd the General laughing,</hi> that fear is is needleſs, as for what I have done to thee; if ſome body elſe has got thee one, thou muſt lay it to his charge; for my part, I waſh my hands, knowing my ſelf innocent as to that particular. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, Sir, you are in a very pleaſant Humour, <hi>reply'd the young Laundreſs,</hi> have not you taken true pains for it, that you are ſo willing to excuſe your ſelf? Yes, my Dear, <hi>ſaid the Marſhal,</hi> but I am ſure of what I have done. You have done as much as others can do, <hi>reply'd ſhe, going out of the Room;</hi> Adieu, till the next mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meeting. And art thou ſure of that,

            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers</hi> having thus got rid of his Laundreſs, he pretended to his Landla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that he was oblig'd to ſtay away from his Lodgings for ſome ſmall time, but in effect to have another hard by <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont:</hi> He gave orders to all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that if <hi>Judith</hi> ſhou'd come to enquire for him, they ſhou'd tell her, that he was gone out of the Town. His next buſineſs was, to purſue with all poſſible care his Courtſhip to <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont,</hi> Who, by one of her Gentlewomen who was related to the Marſhal's Landlady, had got ſome notice of his laſt Adventure? <hi>How,</hi> ſaid ſhe very wittily, <hi>Monſieur Bouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flers, are you ſo hard put to it, as to be forc'd to take up with your Laundreſſes, who publickly proclaim your Feats, and boaſt of ſuch a Gallant as you? If I were to adviſe you, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you will give me leave to be ſo much your Friend, I wou'd have you break off this Intrigue as ſpeedily as poſſibly you can. Madam,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Marſhal with ſome Confuſion, <hi>You are every thing what you pleaſe to me: I am entirely at your diſpoſal; I confeſs my Crime, which is no longer to be hid, ſince it is come to your Knowledge. I muſt own I had ſome engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:109100:115"/>
with my Laundreſs, who was not worthy of it; But what wou'd you have me ſay, my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Lady, but that a Man is a Man in ſpite of all his endeavours to the contrary. If I were ſo happy as to have a Spouſe, my Fleſh wou'd not be ſo Rebellious, and I ſhou'd not want means to appeaſe its fury. But now I am trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl'd with a continual itching which</hi>—Here <hi>Mademoiſelle</hi> interupting him with a ſmile: <q>But <hi>ſaid ſhe</hi> Monſieur Boufflers, you know what our Holy Fathers teach us, that it is better to Marry, than to do worſe. And ſince it is a Sin to have an amourous Commerce with other Mens Daughters or Wives, why don't you provide one for your own ſelf, that may be able to bridle the Luſt of your Fleſh, and take away the cauſe of ſuch frequent Inſurrections? What advice I give you is both for your own and the publick Good.</q> 
               <q>'Tis very true,</q> my adorable Lady, <hi>ſaid the Marſhal kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before her,</hi> 
               <q>But if I durſt take the boldneſs to tell you, that if—</q> 
               <q>Go on, go on, Sir in what you were about to ſay,</q> 
               <hi>cry'd the young fair Lady,</hi> 
               <q>I give you free leave to ſpeak; What are your Words ſtopt in their very paſſage? I will take courage then, <hi>reply'd he with a loud Voice,</hi> Since you give me leave to explain my Thoughts. Yes very well, Sir, <hi>reply'd</hi> Mademoiſelle
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:109100:115"/>
                  <hi>with a ſerious Countenance,</hi> I have not laid my Hand upon your Mouth, as the Pope does to his Cardinals; you have full liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to deliver your mind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Having receiv'd aſſurance from your own Mouth Mademoiſelle, <hi>reply'd the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal,</hi> that I ſhall not offend you in freely diſcloſing the Sentiments of my Heart, I muſt tell you that I ſhou'd certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my ſelf the moſt happy of all Mortals upon Earth, if Heaven had deſign'd me for a Spouſe ſo accompliſh'd as your ſelf; but being always miſtruſtful of my good Fortune, I am afraid that this ſo much wiſh'd for happineſs, will not fall to my ſhare. It is a conſiderable time, ſince I firſt ſtiffl'd this thought in my Heart, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daring to let it come to light, for fear it might be in any wiſe diſpleaſing to you. Pardon therefore at this time the boldneſs I take thus to lay open to your view, even the inmoſt receſſes of my Heart, which will at leaſt eaſe it of ſome part of its pain, and don't refuſe to give one word in anſwer, which ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways moſt dear and acceptable to me, provided it proceeds from your own Sweet Lips.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont,</hi> being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſurpris'd at the ingenuous Confeſſion
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:109100:116"/>
of her Lover, and being willing at the ſame time to ſatisfy him that ſhe had no averſion toward his Perſon, made no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to tell the Marſhal with a moſt char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Air; <q>Sir If I were at my own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, I wou'd conſult my own Heart as to what might be expedient for me to do in this Caſe; But, you are not ignorant, that I am to be guided by my Kindred, eſpecially by my Brother the Abbot, who, without doubt will provide ſuch a Match for me, as he ſhall find ſuitable to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. Beſides, you know very well, that it wou'd be very unbecoming a young Virgin in my condition, to doe any thing of this nature diſagreeable to the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of my Relations. I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict you in this particular, Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle, <hi>reply'd the Marſhal,</hi> but at the ſame time I hope you'll grant me, that your Kindred ought not to pretend to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of your Heart; You being the ſole Miſtreſs of it, as well as of the reſt of your inclinations. Pray Sir, let us talk no more on this Subject, <hi>reply'd ſhe not without ſome diſturbance;</hi> I have given you ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Reaſons. I am then a very unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Creature, <hi>reply'd</hi> Boufflers <hi>full of deſpair,</hi> in regard that I cannot obtain the favour to be heard ſo much as for one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the Perſon I adore, who ever
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:109100:116"/>
refuſes me the Liberty of declaring the real Sentiments of my Heart. I call all you Saints to witneſs, whether ever any Sufferings were comparable to mine. I perceive very well, <hi>cry'd</hi> Mademoiſelle de Grammont <hi>laughing,</hi> that you are very much out of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, good Sir, I believe it will be beſt to ſend for a Phyſitian, Alas! cruel fair one, <hi>cry'd the Marſhal ſmiling,</hi> you are the Phyſitian, if you pleaſe, that can alone reſto<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

Don't you believe that you muſt be anſwerable for this cruel Uſage, and give account for all thoſe Pains you have caus'd me to endure? If you ſhou'd make a real Confeſſion of it to your Father-Confeſſor, I cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that he wou'd grant you Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſo heinous a Crime.</q> 
               <q>Nay, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd</hi> Medemoiſelle, if we ſhou'd acquaint our Father-Confeſſor with the flattering Expreſſions and Lies, which you Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are pleas'd to tell us, we ſhou'd e'n make a pretty Story of it: What Anſwer wou'd theſe Religious Men make us, but to ſay, That theſe, being Venial Sins of ſmall conſequence, we may eaſily be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd in not believing you, who ſo ſeldom

or never ſpeak truth, when you pretend to make Love? For ſometimes you ſhall meet with one, who immediately runs deſperate or mad; whilſt another is juſt at the point of Death, and talks of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Daggers which are to pierce his Heart: Others are continually Whin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Pineing all in Tears, ſo that they can do nothing but ſigh and talk of their Sufferings and Pains, which (as they give out) can never ceaſe but with their laſt Breath. This is a ſhort Panegyrick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Love-Paſſion, which is always Languiſhing, and is Variouſly repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by you to ſerve your turn, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly as you ſhall find a fit opportunity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Very well then,</q> 
               <hi>Mademoiſelle, ſaid the Marſhal, feigning to be ſurpris'd at the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned words of his Miſtreſs,</hi> That the Pains of Love did not ceaſe till Death; <q>And who can pretend to procure the Death of ſo Powerful a Deity? Marriage, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raige, <hi>Sir, reply'd the fair Lady:</hi> I ſay, the Conjugal Union will quench the moſt violent Flames of Concupiſcence, and anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate their force. What is become of thoſe moſt violent Paſſions, what of thoſe great efforts of Love, which once appear'd in our great Monarch <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. towards a <hi>la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere,</hi> a <hi>Monteſpan,</hi> and ſeveral others, whom
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:109100:117"/>
he has quite abandon'd ſince, as if he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had had any knowledge of 'em. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam de Maintenon</hi> told me the other Day, that the King wou'd not ſo much as ſuffer 'em to be ſpoken of in his preſence. Alas! take my Word for it, there is nothing in this Sublunary World, but what is continually ſubject to change. You ought not, Madam, <hi>anſwer'd the Marſhal,</hi> to reflect upon theſe matters at your Age; this part of Morality is too ſolid for you at this time, to take up your Thoughts: You ought rather, to endeavour to make uſe of the advantage of your blooming Years, in making one of your Adorers happy by the ſweet enjoyments of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial State, to your mutual Comfort and Satisfaction. This is that which you ought to apply your ſelf to, without loſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Moment longer.</q>

            <l>For Time flies faſt, and Pleaſures glide away.</l>
            <p>
               <q>No matter for that, <hi>Sir reply'd</hi> Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle de Grammont, we ſeldom have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to repent of having been too Wiſe or Diſcreet. Do you believe that there is any real Felicity in the enjoyment of the Pleaſures of this World? I can aſſure you,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:109100:118"/>
that I never thought my ſelf leſs happy, than ſince the time I left the Nunnery, where I was before, and where I enjoy'd a moſt delightful Tranquillity both in Body and Mind, which in the management of Worldly Affairs, is continually diſtracted by a thouſand troubleſome Contingences, which are daily incident to us poor Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, during our abode in theſe Terreſtrial Manſions. If my Brothers had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd me to come and live with an Aunt of mine, who upon her Death-Bed made me promiſe her to Marry, I wou'd never have left it, <hi>O cry'd the Marſhal embracing her,</hi> I am overjoy'd my moſt lovely Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to underſtand from your own Mouth, that you are reſolv'd to Marry. What a happy Man will he be, added our General tranſported with paſſion, who ſhall be the poſſeſſor of ſo incomparable a Lady? Therefore I muſt go to conſult the Oracle at Verſailles <hi>(Madam</hi> Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non) to know whether this ſhall be my Deſtiny.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont,</hi> who very well underſtood his meaning as to this familiar Oracle which is very advantagious to its Favourites, cou'd not forbear laughing, and ſaid ſhe to her Lover, <q>You have free acceſs to this <hi>Sibyl</hi> without the aſſiſtance of any Mediator; you are more in her favour
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:109100:118"/>
than any one at Court; and no Queſtion, ſhe will tell you your Deſtiny without diſſimulation. May Heaven be propitious to me, I will go to conſult her to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Madam, <hi>anſwer'd the Marſhal</hi> de <hi>Boufflers,</hi> but it muſt not be without your good Company, you ſhall alſo learn your Deſtiny from this Oracle.</q> That is the leaſt of my Concerns, <hi>reply'd</hi> Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Grammont, <hi>careleſsly,</hi> 
               <q>let Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven diſpoſe of me as it thinks fit. O what a good Chriſtian! O what a pretty Child is this! <hi>ſaid the General,</hi> who leaves her ſelf altogether to the diſpoſal of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; there are but very few Perſons in our Age, who are ſo careful of the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of their Souls, and are diſpos'd to take ſo good a Reſolution. I muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute it in ſome part to your Holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſelines,</hi> among whom you have been educated, and who have inſpir'd you with theſe noble Sentiments. When I ſee the Abbot <hi>de Bonne Avanture,</hi> I will not forget to acquaint him, how prudent and devout you are.</q> I ſuppoſe he will not be diſpleas'd at it, Sir, <hi>reply'd the young Lady, as ſhe was juſt ariſing to meet</hi> Mademoiſelle de Pontriant, <hi>one of her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, who was come to give her a Viſit.</hi>

The manner of Converſation being in an inſtant chang'd with the Company, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be much more Jovial than before: For this Young Lady, being of a very fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickſome Humor, wou'd needs divert 'em with a Story of a Servant-maid of hers, who being Heart-ſick for a Sweet-Heart, the young Lady told her, <q>Yes, yes, <hi>Echa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte,</hi> he will ſhortly come to ſee thee: For I have been told, that he is already up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Road, coming on purpoſe to give thee a Viſit.</q> 
               <q>I pray God that the Holy <hi>S. Miclotie</hi> may ſafely conduct him hither. Do you ſay ſo, Madam, <hi>reply'd the poor Wench, and holding up her Hands,</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>I will, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> ſay a <hi>Pater Noſter</hi> and an <hi>Ave Mary</hi> for him;</q> which ſhe actually did, and that too, with ſo much Innocence and Devotion, that every one was amaz'd at it. A little after ſhe came to her ſelf, I left her, and they tell me ſince, that ſhe is pretty well recover'd.</p>
            <p>The Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> and Mademoiſelle <hi>de Grammont,</hi> looking at one another, laugh'd heartily at the Story of <hi>Mademoiſelle de Pont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant,</hi> who having diverted 'em for ſome time longer, with ſuch like Adventures, took her Leave of our Lovers, whom ſhe left at liberty to renew their former Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe. But the Marſhal having ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:109100:119"/>
recall'd to memory his intended Journey to <hi>S. Cyr,</hi> left his Miſtreſs, and went direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from thence to pay a Viſit to Madam <hi>Maintenon:</hi> No ſooner had he enter'd this Lady's Cloſet, introduc'd by Siſter <hi>Nicolle,</hi> but, ſaid he, <q>Madam, I am come hither to conſult you, no otherwiſe than an Oracle or ſome great Deity, whoſe Power it is to diſpoſe of me, my whole Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny being ſolely put into your Hands. Pray, tell me, whether I ſhall be happy or unhappy, and whether I ſhall obtain for my Spouſe a certain charming Lady of your Acquaintance, who relies upon your Deciſion of her Fortune, looking upon you as her Governing Planet, from whence ſhe expects nothing but a favourable Aſpect and benign Influences.</q> 
               <q>And, pray Sir, <hi>reply'd Madam</hi> Maintenon, who is this Perſon, who puts ſo much Confidence in me? I'm extremely oblig'd to her for the good Eſteem ſhe has of that mean Ability I have to ſerve her, but I am not ſo skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as you imagine, I did not at my Birth receive that Gift of Prophecy.</q> 
               <q>How, Madam, <hi>reply'd the Marſhal,</hi> can you be ignorant of that Beauty, over which you have ſo powerful an Aſcendant? ſhe does nothing without your prudent Counſels, and you are the very Soul that guides her
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:109100:120"/>
Inclinations. Don't you know <hi>Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle de Grammont?</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>Yes, Sir, <hi>ſaid the Lady,</hi> ſhe is a very charming Perſon, for whom I have a moſt ſingular Reſpect, and whom I ſhou'd be ready to ſerve upon all occaſions.</q> 
               <q>Is it her then, <hi>continu'd ſhe,</hi> my dear Child, whom you are deſirous to have for your Spouſe. Truly I ſee you are endu'd with a diſcerning Judgment; I can aſſure you, that you have made a Choice not unbecoming your ſelf, for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that ſhe is vaſtly rich, ſhe is very well look'd upon at Court, for her extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Endowments, which make her to be admir'd by every one.</q> 
               <q>Madam, <hi>ſaid</hi> Boufflers, <hi>with ſomewhat of Impatience,</hi> all my Felicity depends upon your Favour, in regard that ſhe has ſent me to you to know whether this Match is like to be proſperous on my ſide. She referrs her ſelf entirely to your Determination. You are in Jeſt, Sir, <hi>reply'd Madam</hi> de Maintenon, <hi>with a ſmile,</hi> you ſpeak thus to ſatisfie your own Inclinations, which are wholly bent upon this Lady. <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont</hi> is a young Lady, who has a great deal of Wit, and perhaps told you this, to free her ſelf from your amorous Importunities. Believe me, Sir, ſhe her ſelf is not deſtitute of Subtilty, ſhe knows
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:109100:120"/>
very well what ſhe has to do, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting me as her Oracle If, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, it lies in my Power to do you any Service with her, I am ready to do it with all my Heart, for ſeveral Reaſons. You muſt manage her ſoftly and by degrees, ſhe being of a ſweet and quiet Diſpoſition, don't overload her with Complements, as it is natural for you Gentlemen to do when you make Love to Women, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, whether it be ſuitable to their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour or not. I give you this Advice, as to a Friend, for whom I have ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. You know that you have the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to have play'd the Gallant a little too much, in your younger Years, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſomething of it may be come to her Ears, as well as your late Adventure with the Laundreſs. She has given me once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready a Touch as to that, <hi>reply'd the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal,</hi> but I am in good Hopes, that this unfortunate Accident will not make any great Impreſſion upon her Mind, and that ſhe will bury in Oblivion the reſt of my Amorous Treſpaſſes, which I have unluckily committed in former Time.</q> 
               <q>I much que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion it, Sir, <hi>reply'd the Lady,</hi> for ſhe has always been educated among the Religious <hi>

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:109100:121"/>
which they look as ſo many Monſters, that ſtrive to devour Mankind, and to exclude 'em from Paradiſe. If you are dextrous enough to inſinuate your ſelf into her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, you are a happy Man; but you'll find the Conqueſt not very eaſie. Above all things, I wou'd adviſe you, to deal ſincerely with her, ſhe being a great Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of that Vertue.</q> 
               <q>I will endeavour, Madam,</q> 
               <hi>reply'd the General (having made firſt a profound Reverence to her)</hi> 
               <q>to follow your wiſe Counſel, and I will ſtrive to gain the Affections of this Beauty, by all the moſt ſincere and honourable means that can be found out.</q> Madam <hi>de Maintenon</hi> having given ſome further Advice to the Marſhal, concerning his Marriage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd his humble Thanks; he return'd to his Lodgings, where he began to meditate upon the event of his intended Marriage.</p>
            <p>The next Day, after Dinner, he gave a Viſit to <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt a little before, gone to S. <hi>Cyr,</hi> and he not thinking it convenient to interrupt the Diſcourſe that might paſs between this fair Lady and the Abbeſs, ſtaid at ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Abby. But ſhe making a longer ſtay than he expected, and being on Horſe-back, follow'd only by one Footman, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

He had not been there long, e're he eſpy'd the Livery of Madam <hi>de Maintenon</hi> afar off; and not queſtioning but that his Miſtreſs was with her in the ſame Coach, which went on with a very ſlow pace, he, with a Hand-gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, advanc'd nearer to 'em. <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont</hi> being plac'd at the ſame ſide where he came, let the Glaſſes down, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him not without Bluſhing; which Madam <hi>de Maintenon</hi> having immediately taken notice of, ſhe made a Sign to our Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, to make him ſenſible, that this ſudden Emotion cou'd not be interpreted otherwiſe, than to his advantage. He ſoon underſtood the meaning of the Sibyl of <hi>Verſailles,</hi> and being unwilling to ſurpriſe his Miſtreſs, he look'd another way, as if he had not obſerv'd this change of her Colour.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Maintenon,</hi> who was ready up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions to ſecond his Love, told him; <q>And what, Sir, makes you come hither?

               <q>You have gueſs'd it to a Hair's Breadth, Madam, <hi>cry'd he,</hi> and I proteſt to you upon my Faith, That nothing elſe has brought me into this ſolitary and delightful Place. The Marſhal, <hi>ſaid</hi> Mademoiſelle de Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,

               <q>Madam, <hi>reply'd the fair Lady,</hi> I cannot think otherwiſe than that you judge in favour of the Marſhal: 'Tis a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter peculiar to a gallant Man, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways tender and complaiſant in Lady's Company; and tho' he ſhou'd not be ſo in good earneſt, yet he ought at leaſt out of a Principle of Gallantry, to make 'em believe ſo. But, as to flatter my ſelf ſo far, as to believe that it is in my power, by any means, to diſturb the Repoſe of Monſieur <hi>Bouſflers,</hi> I am well ſatisfy'd 'tis much
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:109100:122"/>
beyond what I can pretend to.</q> 
               <q>Ha! what do you ſay, <hi>Mademoiſlle, cry'd the Marſhal tranſported to that degree, that Madam</hi> de Maintenon <hi>cou'd not forbear laughing,</hi> there never was any Perſon living upon the Face of the Earth, who cou'd be more capable of making me unfortunate, than your ſelf? Pray look, <hi>Mademoiſelle, reply'd the Abbeſs of St.</hi> Cyr, <hi>in a very obliging manner,</hi> what effects your Charms have produc'd upon the Marſhal: Alaſs! how much alter'd he is ſince the time that—</q> 
               <q>'Tis very true, <hi>reply'd the Marſhal</hi> de Boufflers, I don't reſt Day or Night; and from that very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I began to be in Love, I found my Heart ſo continually diſtracted and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that all whatever I felt before in my Life-time, is not comparable to it. I know who is the cauſe of it, and it's for this reaſon that I cheriſh thoſe Evils, which, when I rightly conſider 'em, cannot but be very charming to me.</q> 
               <q>As far as I ſee, <hi>ſaid Madam</hi> de Maintenon, you are both happy and unhappy at the ſame time, and I don't queſtion but that <hi>Mademoiſelle,</hi> who is all Goodneſs, will take ſome care not to let you ſuffer ſo much for the future: She will undoubtedly take ſome Method or another to make you more fortunate. Do you not give your Conſent to what I ſay,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:109100:123"/>
incomparable Lady, <hi>added Madam</hi> de Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenon, <hi>taking our young Lady by the Hand?</hi> I'll ſee, I'll ſee, Madam, <hi>reply'd ſhe with a Smile,</hi> I believe the Pain which the Marſhal talks of, not to be ſo violent, but that he may have a little patience, till ſome body elſe apply a Remedy to appeaſe it; I am not ſo skilful in giving Relief to ſuch Gentlemen as he, who are continually in want of the Aſſiſtance of fair Ladies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Marſhal wou'd certainly have made ſome gallant and agreeable Reply to his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, if Madam <hi>de Maintenon</hi> and <hi>Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle de Grammont,</hi> had not both ſtept out of the Coach, on purpoſe to take a Walk upon the Graſs, which was very green and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant at that Seaſon of the Year. <hi>Boufflers</hi> walk'd conſtantly by his fair Miſtreſſes ſide, to whom he told a thouſand tender and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Things. At laſt he entreated 'em to go and refreſh themſelves at a fine Country-Seat hard by, belonging to a particular Friend of his, which he made uſe of his own. But Madam <hi>de Maintenon</hi> not being willing to go, they agreed to defer it till another Opportunity. <q>The care of the Abby, which lies altogether upon me, <hi>ſaid ſhe, after a very devout manner,</hi> (not to ſpeak now of the Engagements I have to uſe a great deal of Complaiſance to the King,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:109100:123"/>
who has his particular Humours) does not allow me ſo much time, as to think of Pleaſures: Not but that he is a very good natur'd Prince, but his Majeſty very often inſiſts upon doing Things which I ſhou'd not approve of, if I had the liberty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain my felf; ſo that being frequently oblig'd to paſs a great many things by in ſilence, it cauſes me many a vexatious Hour.</q> 
               <q>I cannot but admire at what you ſay, Madam, <hi>reply'd</hi> Mademoiſelle de Grammont, the whole World looking upon you as the moſt fortunate Lady in <hi>Europe.</hi> You are belov'd by a great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, who does nothing without your Advice, and who does every thing to pleaſe you: In ſaying thus, I avouch nothing but what is allow'd of by all the World.</q> 
               <q>O <hi>Mademoiſelle, ſaid this Lady,</hi> conſider, that all that gliſters is not Gold. I often think of a certain Proverb, which was in uſe a long time before I was born, and which I find to hold true ſtill, That no Condition of Men is free from Troubles and Anxieties.</q> 
               <q>It is very true, what the Princeſs <hi>de Conde</hi> told me the other Day, That a mean Shepherdeſs, often receives more ſatisfaction in the enjoyment of her innocent Pleaſures, than the greateſt Lady in the Kingdom.</q>
               <q>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:109100:124"/>
It is not always Worldly Grandeur and Luſtre, that makes us happy in this Life; or that we ought to look upon as our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Good. I don't diſagree with you, Madam, <hi>anſwer'd the young Lady,</hi> but I hope you will not alſo deny, but that an eminent Station in this World, is very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Mankind. And I tell you, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle, ſaid the Marſhal abruptly,</hi> to put an end to your moral Doctrin, which carries us too far from our purpoſe, that of all the Pleaſures that this Life affords, Love is the ſweeteſt; I mean when one Loves ſincerely, and is belov'd again; for if Love be not reciprocal, I am not for it, as knowing that it is ſo far from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, that it is nothing elſe but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Miſery. All the World is for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>reply'd Madam</hi> de Maintenon; we Mortals ſcarce think of any thing elſe, not conſidering that both they and we paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way like a Dream, and that one day we muſt all be accountable for our Actions; and you Gentlemen of the Blade, don't think that you will be exempted from it. Good faith! <hi>anſwer'd the Marſhal with a great deal of indifferency,</hi> I don't overload my ſelf with thoſe things, I lay 'em all, as often as I go to Confeſſion, upon my Father-Confeſſor's Back, and that is broad
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:109100:124"/>
enough to bear 'em. This good Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Father, as ſoon as he finds the Pence come in, tells me always, that he will find out means to cleanſe me from my Sins, that I ſhall appear as white as Snow, tho' I were as black as a Chimney-ſtock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You are very happy in your Father-Confeſſor, <hi>reply'd the Lady,</hi> for our Father <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> does not tell us ſo: He talks of nothing elſe to us but Penances and Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, and at laſt of all perhaps he will tell you, <hi>We are uncertain what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of us.</hi> But pray where cou'd you find out ſuch a Father-Confeſſor, who is ſo favourable to you Soldiers, who ſeldom believe Heaven or Hell? Madam, <hi>reply'd Boufflers,</hi> I found him out by good chance; yet he belongs to the Profeſs'd Houſe of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits in <hi>Paris,</hi> and for my part, I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo curious as to enquire after his Name, provided he does but grant me Abſolution of what they call Sin, I don't trouble my Head any farther. This is truly living like a Cavalier, <hi>anſwer'd</hi> Mademoiſelle de Grammont, <hi>laughing outright;</hi> Madam may very well ſay, that you Officers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, believe neither Heaven nor Hell. O Lord! Sir, into what Errors do you run
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:109100:125"/>
head-long; the very thought of it makes me tremble: O Mademoiſelle, <hi>ſaid</hi> Bouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flers, we are not ſo irreligious as you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; 'tis a ſort of vulgar Error which has prevail'd throughout the World to our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage. I hope to ſee Heaven as ſoon as one of your moſt Religious Zealots. I have a good ſtock of Indulgences, which I have pick't up in all Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſerve my ſelf and all my Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons. Make much of 'em Sir, <hi>anſwer'd Madam</hi> de Maintenon, for they may ſtand you in good ſtead, when you are in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, where you may be in danger to burn all your life-time, without a good Preſervative. I mean your Soul, which will never periſh. By my Faith! Madam, you frighten me, <hi>ſaid the Marſhall, ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome paces backward,</hi> pray let us talk no more of theſe everlaſting Flames, they put me in a fright: Theſe little pretty Devils that poſſeſs our Hearts, are far more agreeable. I acknowledge it, Sir, <hi>reply'd the Lady,</hi> but theſe are often the occaſion of our eternal Sufferings. In the mean while let us implore Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to preſerve us from them, and let us alter the Scene, for I perceive that this too much diſturbs you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:109100:125"/>
Our Ladies then being again gone into their Coach, and our Marſhal having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted his Horſe, they return'd to <hi>St Cyr;</hi> from whence Monſieur <hi>Boufflers</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd his Miſtreſs to her own Houſe, where having taken his leave of her, he went to ſup that evening with ſome of his Brother-Generals. They having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a certain paleneſs in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ever ſince he courted Mademoiſelle <hi>de Grammont;</hi> the Count <hi>de Montal,</hi> who was among the reſt at the Table, began thus to addreſs himſelf to the Company. <hi>If Men were ſubject to the Green-ſickneſs, I ſhould be apt to believe, that the Marſhal</hi> de Boufflers <hi>was troubled with it. But ſince this Diſtemper is not incident to us Men, I will ſpeak no more of that. I am rather inclin'd to believe,</hi> ſaid the Duke <hi>de Villeroy, that it is his Maiden-head, which ſending up ſome Vapours to his Brain cauſes this paleneſs in his Face: 'Tis high time to marry him, leſt his Diſtemper ſhould prove mortal. It is a great while, Gentlemen,</hi> reply'd the Marqueſs <hi>de Boufflers, ſince my Maiden-head is flown up into the Air, and if it be there ſtill, I believe it to be a good way off. The Devil take me if that be the cauſe of my pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; or elſe I am ſtrangely deceiv'd in my ſelf, for I am ſure I have given it over and over a thouſand times: if I ſhould ſhew you a Liſt of all my Miſtreſſes, you would be convinc'd of the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:109100:126"/>
truth of it. O the very thoughts of it tickle my fancy at this very moment,</hi> continued he with a paſſionate Air. <hi>I am tranſported with the very conceit of it, Sir, Sir,</hi> ſaid the Count <hi>de Montal,</hi> addreſſing himſelf to the Duke <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> and pulling him by the ſleeve, <hi>let us deal a little more charitably with our friend, I ſee his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour change, our diſcourſe may put his Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits into ſuch a ferment, as to make him faint away: Some Wine here,</hi> ſaid he to one of his Footmen, <hi>ſome Wine here for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal</hi> de Boufflers: <hi>come, Sir, drink to your own inclinations. Well then,</hi> reply d the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, pulling off his Hat; <hi>Here is a Health to that charming Beauty which I admire. You ſhould rather have ſaid,</hi> reply d <hi>Valleroy</hi> laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>a Health to all thoſe fair Ladies you love, for I am of opinion, that you have a good many of them in all Parts; and I am alſo apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that ſince you have ſerved the King, you have never been preſent at the beſieging of any Town, but that at the ſame time you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd a Heart and forc'd it to pay you Hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal, <hi>you are pleas'd to honour me beyond my deſerts, in enrolling my Name among thoſe of your great Conquerors: My amorous and warlike Expeditions are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them ſo conſiderable as you think fit to repreſent 'em, and my moſt glorious Love-exploits have terminated in the Conqueſts of certain pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:109100:126"/>
young Damſels, who were not undeſerving of what pains I took for 'em. But I have now laid aſide all theſe former ſlight Engagements; I am reſolved to be wiſer for the future, and wholly to devote my ſelf to one Miſtreſs, whom I intend for my Spouſe, if I can attain to that good fortune. I know that the ſighs of an old Lover ſeldom find good reception among Ladies. They are commonly look d upon as your ancient Slaves, who have nothing to do but to wear their Fetters, rarely meeting with the lucky minute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ha! Now you ſpeak of the critical minute,</hi> ſaid the Duke <hi>de Villeroy; if I had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to make uſe if it, a very fair opportunity preſented it ſelſ three or four days ago, when walking over the new Bridge, a pretty young. Fan-flap, pulling me by the Sleeve, whiſper d me,</hi> 
               <q>Have you a mind to be merry to night, my Lord: <hi>I had a great mind to do it, but—</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>That But, Sir,</hi> ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> laughing, <hi>stopt your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. Yes indeed ſo it did,</hi> reply d the Duke, <hi>I was afraid I ſhould be pepper d off for all my Life-time: We often pay at too dear a rate for ſuch ſorts of Commodities. Nevertheleſs, ſhe was the beſt humour d Wench that ever I ſaw. Surely,</hi> anſwered the Count <hi>de Montal, if ſhe were ſo charming a Creature, I wonder how you could forbear; I believe you were fain to put a great force upon your inclination: I ll lay you a Wager, if the Marſhal</hi> de Boufflers <hi>had been
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:109100:127"/>
in your place, he would not have been ſo cautious as you; and I am apt to believe, that this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be the cauſe of his pale countenance. No, indeed, Sir,</hi> reply'd he very ſeriouſly, <hi>it was never my humour to meddle with ſuch ſort of Cattel, I had always an averſion to them becauſe I cannot endure to go into the Country upon that account. If all Mens ſtomachs were turn'd againſt 'em as much as mine is, they would be all thrown over the Bridge into the</hi> Seine, <hi>without taking the trouble to ſend them to the Plantations in</hi> Canada, <hi>and other places, where they communicate their peſtilent Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to thoſe poor Wretches who have the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to deal with 'em.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time the intended Match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Marſhal <hi>de Bouflers</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle <hi>de Grammont,</hi> began to make a great noiſe among the peeple of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt quality at Court. Our two Lovers frequently received Viſits of the Ladies, where the chief entertainment was of nothing but Gayety and gallant Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: Repartees, one of the beſt exerciſes of Wit, were not wanting in thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſes, which ſometimes were put ſo cloſe, that it turn'd to ridiculing one or another of the Company; and tho ſome of them were very ſmart, yet were they ſo well manag'd, that none could take any exception. One day, among the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:109100:127"/>
reſt, the Count <hi>de Surlaube</hi> had his ſhare of it. He had marry'd Mademoiſelle <hi>de...</hi> Daughter to the Marchioneſs <hi>de Breſe,</hi> who was not above 12 years of age when ſhe was engag'd to her Husband: A very tender age indeed, to endure the fatigues (eſpecially the firſt night) of a Husband of ſuch a bulk as the Count was, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the fatteſt and moſt robuſt Gentlemen in <hi>France.</hi> The Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> having a mind to divert the Company, and addreſſing himſelf to the Count ask'd him: <hi>How he could poſſibly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo difficult an enterprize? Sir,</hi> anſwer'd the Count, <hi>As great a General as you are, I am very well convinc'd, that if you had been in my place, you would have ſooner choſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the Conqueſt of one of the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Forts in</hi> Flanders.</p>
            <p>At theſe words all the Ladies that were preſent, burſt out aloud into a'laughter. But the Count, who is a very pleaſant Companion, thus continu'd his Diſcourſe; <hi>Monſieur</hi> Boufflers, <hi>we ſhall have ſhortly the opportunity to ſee which way you'll go about it; if you'll permit me to teach you ſome Leſſons, as to this particular, I only deſire your leave to hold the Candle, whilſt you perform the operation. If you ſhould perhaps be deficient in ſome forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, I promiſe you I will be your Aſſiſtant, if it may be without offence to Madamoiſelle</hi> de
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:109100:128"/>
Grammont, who could not forbear ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at it. <hi>Signior Count,</hi> reply'd Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Boufflers, You are come to that age that you cannot but be ſenſible, that all you are able to do in ſuch a caſe as this, is only to aſſiſt me with your good Counſel. And if we may give credit to the common report, you could not at that time paſs the Ditch without a great deal of difficulty; Nay, I have heard it affirmed for truth, that you were not able to make your ſelf Maſter of the Counter ſcarp till ſix months after the Trenches were open'd. If this be true, I muſt confeſs it is one of the moſt famous Sieges that we have known of; and if you had not received Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors from the Relations of the Counteſs your Lady, it is a great queſtion to me, whether you would not have been oblig'd to raiſe the Siege.</hi> The Counteſs, who was preſent during the Conteſt, bluſht at this Diſcourſe, but this Colour (which is ſo natural to all civil Women) being a little gone, ſhe did like the reſt, who laugh'd all as heartily as they could.</p>
            <p>The Count then reſuming the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: <hi>To compleat your Diverſion, Ladies,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I will give you an exact Hiſtory of what paſt between my Spouſe and me the firſt night after our Wedding.</hi> The Marchioneſs <hi>de Choiſi</hi> a very grave Matron, told him, <hi>That the Ladies would not be againſt it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he would be cautious in offering any thing
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:109100:128"/>
that might be offenſive to the fair Sex. Ladies,</hi> ſaid the Count, <hi>In caſe I tell you nothing but what is true, and that I give you a faithful Relation of the whole Hiſtory, I don't queſtion but you will pardon the reſt. The Counteſs, my Spouſe, who is here preſent ſhall engage for me as to that particular; and I give her free leave to ſilence me, if I ſpeak one word of untruth. Well, well, let us have it then,</hi> unanimouſly cry'd the Ladies, except Mademoiſelle <hi>de Grammont,</hi> who being the only Maiden Gentlewoman in the Company, whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd her Lover the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> in the Ear, <hi>That ſhe was afraid that this ſtory would make her uneaſie; that ſhe foreſaw the Count was preparing to give a relation ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial as to thoſe matters, as would make her colour riſe in her Face, becauſe ſhe was upon the point of being marry'd her ſelf, and might perhaps be ſubject to the ſame frailties.</hi> But Monſieur <hi>de Boufflers</hi> bid her have a good Heart, telling her, <hi>My deareſt Child, you muſt be inur'd by degrees to the hardſhips and toils of War, your time draws near when you muſt begin to carry Arms, wherefore I would be glad to ſee you undertake the task with conſtancy and brave reſolution; that when you ſee the Enemy making an Aſſault, nothing may terrify you. Let us hear,</hi> continued he, <hi>what the Count will ſay: the good Counſels of a valiant Captain who has undergone the toils of</hi> Cupid,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:109100:129"/>
               <hi>Wars, often furniſh us with a piece of Morality, which may have more influence as to the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a fair Lady, than all the inſipid moral Doctrine of a Sermon preach'd by Father</hi> Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur</hi> de Boufflers <hi>is much in tke right on't,</hi> ſaid the Count, <hi>he has not beſtow d all his time in burning of Villages: he has learnt by experience, as well as my ſelf, how to give good doctrine to young people. I am of opinion,</hi> added he, ſpeaking to Mademoiſelle <hi>de Grammont, that when you have made one Campaign under him, you will be skilful enough not to ſtand in need of my Inſtructions:</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle <hi>de Grammont</hi> gave no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Count, but by a Smile, which appear'd more eloquent at that time than all the Sermons of Father <hi>Bourdalou.</hi> The Marſhal, her Lover, was ſo charm'd with her Modeſty, that he could not forbear to rob her of a Kiſs. <hi>Soft, ſoft,</hi> ſaid Madam <hi>de Tilladet, you will have playing time enough; a Fire that burns too fierce is not laſting; a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate paſſion is always the moſt conſtant and durable. By my faith, Madam,</hi> ſaid Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Bouffiers, we are only making Matches now, that when the day appointed for bombarding the Place comes, every thing may be in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs. Don't you know that I love Expedition; if I ſhould march into the Field, and ſhould find but one Nail wanting in my Train of Artillery, I
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:109100:129"/>
ſhould be ſtark mad:</hi> Then turning himſelf to Mademoiſelle <hi>de Grammont,</hi> his beloved Miſtreſs, whom he embrac'd; and ſaid he, <hi>I only deſire this one thing of you, that you be willing to receive the directions of your General. The firſt Attack is commonly fierce, but let not the ſight of a little blood diſmay you; every ſmall wound we receive in the Wars is not mortal. If Love does wound us ſometimes ſhe is as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in healing of us; and it was not without great reaſon, that</hi> Moliere <hi>nam'd one of his Plays,</hi> Love the Phyſician. The Ladies, who were diſpos'd to laughing, having ſilenc'd Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Boufflers,</hi> that they might be diverted with the Story the Count had promis'd to tell 'em: <hi>I am content, my Ladies,</hi> ſaid he; <hi>and as for Mademoiſelle</hi> de Grammont <hi>and I, we will endeavour to profit by it as much as poſſibly we can.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Counteſs, my Wife, was but twelve years of Age, ſaid the Count, when I marry'd her. She being ſo very young had not the opportunity to learn thoſe things which ſhe has been taught ſince, and which ſhe has now at her fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ends, tho ſhe be not now above eighteen. Our Nuptial Feaſt was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated at the Marchioneſs <hi>de Breſe</hi>'s, my Wife's Mother. About an hour before we were to go to Bed, I went up into the Chamber where we were to lie that
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:109100:130"/>
night, to inſpect the Nuptial Bed which was prepared for us, and after I had carefully examined every thing, with all the Circumſpection imaginable, I returned to my Spouſe, whom I had left in the Hall among our Gueſts. The hour being come, when we were to go to bed, Wax-tapers were lighted, and the Gentlemen and Ladies having taken their leave, went every one to their reſpective Lodgings. Some of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies at their departure, whiſper'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I know not what, in my Spouſes Ear, which I never have been able to learn ſince, neither from them, nor her own Mouth. I confeſs that this put me into ſome ſtudy for a few moments, conſidering with my ſelf what ſmall progreſs I had made over the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this young Beauty, which ſeem'd to be born with a general aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to all Men. Her early years never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs gave me ſome hopes to believe, that time, which ripens every thing, would overcome her ſtubborn Heart, and render it more flexible towards me, who omitted nothing to inſinuate my ſelf into her good Will, but all in vain. At laſt, my Spouſe being undreſt, and laid in Bed firſt, according to the uſual Cuſtom, and I having put on my
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:109100:130"/>
Night-cap and Wedding Shirt, I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my <hi>Valet du Chambre</hi> to withdraw, and to ſhut the door after him, which he did. When I came nearer to the Bed, I heard ſomething ſtir underneath it, which made me ſuſpect, that ſome body was not far off ready to play me a ſcurvy trick; my Wife being as much ſurprized at it, as my ſelf, I run all in a fury towards the Table where my Sword lay, which having drawn out of the Scabbard, I puſh d with it under the Bed, with a deſign to kill any one that ſhould have hid himſelf there. I was much ſtartled to ſee the Cavalier <hi>du Bleſe</hi> come out from under the Bed, begging my pardon a thouſand times for his unſeaſonable curioſity, and tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, <hi>That he would willingly have given</hi>
               </q> 100 <hi>Piſtoles, if he might have remain'd in the Poſt where he had plac d himſelf, if he could have done it without being diſcovered.</hi> 
               <q>I confeſs I ſtood quite amaz'd, yet it was impoſſible for me to forbear laughing heartily, when I ſaw the Cavalier creeping out from under the Bed, as black as a Devil, without a Perriwig, and cover'd all over with duſt.</q> 
               <hi>By my Faith, Sir,</hi> ſaid the Cavalier, <hi>you have a very good Noſe that you could ſo ſoon ſmell out a Rat. Indeed I ſhould have been mightily
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:109100:131"/>
pleas'd to have been a Spectator of the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a Witneſs of your Victory, if it had not been for this unlucky accident, which has ſpoil'd all.</hi> 
               <q>You muſt know, ſaid the Count, that the Chamber-pot which ſtood under the Bed being overturn'd, I was about to take it up, when I eſpy'd the Cavaliers Foot, whom I told, <hi>That I did not want either a Second or an Umpire in the Duel I was going to fight; and,</hi> ſaid I to him, <hi>the Devil take me, if I had not run you thro and thro, if you had ſtay'd one moment longer without diſcovering your ſelf:</hi> And ſo, continued the Count, I took my Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman by the Arm, and led him out of the Chamber Door.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This Adventure being over, which I then look'd upon no otherwiſe than fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to a Man in my circumſtances, who was amorous even to a degree of Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy; the only comfort I had left, was the hopes of having now ſurmounted all the obſtacles which could by any means obſtruct my Happineſs in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying that young Beauty, which I had hitherto eſteem'd as the moſt difficult Conqueſt in the world. Being boy'd up with this aſſurance, I put out the Candles, I pull'd off my Breeches, and ſo into Bed I went, like a triumphant <hi>Hercules,</hi> who had defeated all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:109100:131"/>
But no ſooner was I laid down, but I found my ſelf alone, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take my Spouſe in my Arms, I found nothing but the Sheets. I might call as long as I pleas'd, <hi>My Deareſt where art thou?</hi> No body would anſwer me ſo much as one word. Now you muſt know that my Spouſe had a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Chamber-maid, who was her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, unto whom ſhe had repreſented the averſion ſhe had to Men, adding withal, <hi>That if ſhe did not find out ſome way or another to prevent her being overcome by her Husband that night, ſhe would take a Reſolution againſt her own Life.</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>This Chambermaid was at laſt mov'd with Compaſſion by the Tears of her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, whom, like a young Chicken, ſhe ſaw in the Claws of a Bird of Prey, in danger of looſing her moſt precious Jewel, which was her Virginity: her Name was <hi>Paſquette,</hi> and being very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious at ſuch like Inventions, and willing to favour her Miſtreſſes frailties, or rather fantaſtick humour, becauſe ſhe lov'd her very tenderly even from her Cradle, at laſt diſcover'd a private door which ſhe found means to open at pleaſure, and thro which our new marry'd Lady, under favour of the darkneſs, was convey'd out of the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:109100:132"/>
Chamber, and hid her ſelf in a Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, with a reſolution, rather to dye than to ſuffer a Man to touch her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ladies, continued the Count, I leave it to your own conſideration, to judge in what a condition I found my ſelf at that time. No Enchantment that ever I heard of, ſeem'd to me ſo ſurpriſing as this, not knowing in the leaſt that there was a Sally-port behind my Bed, becauſe the Chamber was all hung with Tapeſtry, and having taken all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution imaginable to look before hand with a Candle in all the corners of the Room. I was ſtark raving mad, my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon having quite left me,</q> 
               <hi>It can never be ſo,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>except the Devil plays his Pranks here.</hi> 
               <q>I cry'd out, and made a hideous noiſe like one in <hi>Bedlam.</hi> I call'd her a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times by her Name, but I might call long enough there was no body that anſwer'd me. After I had made a ſufficient Outcry, I roſe at laſt out of my Bed, imagining that ſhe might perhaps have hid her ſelf underneath it, as the Cavalier had done before, whom I had hunted from thence. The Love and tender Affection which I had for her, were motives ſufficiently ſtrong to hinder me from taking up my Sword to fetch her out from thence,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:109100:132"/>
as I had done before to the Cavalier; beſides, I was ſenſible, that I ought to make uſe of more gentle Arms againſt a young Virgin. Wherefore, after a great many vain Reflections, which almoſt diſtracted my Brains, I got under the Bed my ſelf, where I crawl'd up and down for a conſiderable time, without being able to find any thing, ſo that now I began tobelieve in good earneſt, that there muſt needs be Witchcraft in the caſe.</q> No ſooner had the Count ſpoke theſe laſt words, but his Spouſe, and all the reſt of the Ladies laugh'd very heartily. The Count perceiving how overjoyed they were at the recital of this Adventure, which had coſt him ſo much vexation, and had almoſt put him quite beſides himſelf, if he had not had courage enough to bear up againſt that Daemon, the Enemy of his Repoſe, could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to give 'em this Leſſon: <hi>Ladies,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>you are thoſe familiar Spirits, which are ſent from the other world on purpoſe to damn and torment Mankind, and to make them dye a lingering Death.</hi> Whereupon the Ladies laugh'd as if they had been out of their Wits, and deſired him to proceed in his Story. Ladies, reply'd Monſieur <hi>de</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Surlaube,</hi> we are far yet from the end of our Adventures. My unhappy Deſtiny
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:109100:133"/>
which perſecuted me, or rather that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Daemon, that would make me dye the moſt cruel and violent Death that can be imagined, did not ſtop here. He had prepared for me theſe ſufferings, which were ſufficient to ſend the moſt conſtant and braveſt Lover that ever was heard of in any amorous Hiſtory, to his Grave. The Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>de Breſe,</hi> the Mother of my new married Spouſe, being at laſt awaken'd with the noiſe I made, came running all undreſt into my Chamber, asking me, <hi>Where her Daughter was?</hi>
               </q> I anſwer'd her, all overwhelm'd with Grief, <hi>That I did not know what was become of her; that ſhe had diſappear'd like a familiar Spirit, without knowing which way ſhe went, except ſhe were gone out thro the Chimney, becauſe the Windows were very cloſely ſhut up.</hi> 
               <q>This good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy having underſtood what I told her, was in an incredible Agony about her Daughter, verily believing, that the ſame Chavalier, who had hid himſelf under the Bed, had ſtolen her away: She was ſo much troubled at it, that ſhe would certainly have run diſtracted, if <hi>Paſquette,</hi> the Chamber-maid, had not whiſper'd her in the Ear, that ſhe knew where ſhe was. <hi>And where is ſhe then?</hi>
               </q> ſaid the Marchioneſs, taking the Candle
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:109100:133"/>
up her ſelf, <hi>Let us look in all corners.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quette</hi> having told her Mother, that ſhe believed ſhe had hid herſelf in the Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, we all went thither in Proceſſion, where we found her lying amidſt the Hay, without any Cloaths, but her Wedding Shift. I leave it to your ſelves, Ladies, ſaid the Count, to gueſs, how much ſurpriz'd I was to ſee her peepout of the Hay, like a Mouſe out of a Neſt of her own making, where ſhe intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have ſpent that whole night. The Marchioneſs her Mother taking her by the hand drew her away by force, ſhe being very unwilling to to ſtir from thence, and having firſt given her a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primand, ſhe re-conducted her into my Chamber.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Being once more gone to bed, I ſpent great part of the night in endeavouring to perſwade her out of this ſavage and barbarous Humour; but after I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd the utmoſt fatigues, I found my ſelf where I was before. Her Innocence and Youth, which were the cauſe of her crime, were all my Comfort, in hopes that time would work out that, which was impoſſible for my Love and Paſſion to effect. I might repreſent to her what I thought fit concerning the ſacred Tye of Matrimony, which had join'd us
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:109100:134"/>
together, and that, for the future, we were to be but one Fleſh, according to the true Principles of Chriſtianity: That this was the moſt ſacred and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Knot of matrimonial and civil Society, and the only one in which conſiſted all the Pleaſure and Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that we Mortals are capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying upon Earth. I did not forget to produce a thouſand Examples of young Virgins, who having been married at the ſame age, had before the years end brought forth the fruits of their tender Love, in having honour'd their Husbands with Children, which were look'd upon as the Pledges of Conjugal Love, and as certain Bleſſings from Heaven. All theſe Reflections were in vain, and made no more impreſſion upon her Mind, than if ſhe had heard a Fanatick, or Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank, making an Harangue.</q> 
               <hi>Come, come, Count,</hi> ſaid <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers, let us leave theſe moral Reflections to the Prieſts: Father</hi> Bourdalou <hi>takes care to furniſh the Ladies with 'em in his Sermons: Let us hear the end of your Story.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Whatever pains I took, continu'd the Count, to obtain from this inhumane Creature the laſt favour, it was all to no manner of purpoſe, ſo 15 days were ſpent in vain Attacks; and the more Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:109100:134"/>
and Eagerneſs I ſhew'd to aſſault the Place, the oftner was I repuls'd with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor; the Governeſs of the Fort taking as much Pride in defending it, as the <hi>Veſtal</hi> Virgins did heretofore in preſerving the ſacred Fire. But pray obſerve what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trick ſhe plaid me to free herſelf from my importunities. She having therefore again adviſed with <hi>Paſquette,</hi> her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bermaid, who is as unlucky as a Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and more ingenious at a contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance than <hi>Ariadne;</hi> this curſed <hi>Megaera</hi> made her a Puppet about the ſame big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as my Wife; and, becauſe I had been ſo cautious as to get the Key of that private door behind my Bed into my own Cuſtody, they had by ſomemeans or another procur'd a falſe one, by the help of which, they intended to deceive me, tho I were as watchful as <hi>Argus.</hi> One night, ſuppoſing that no body was with me in Bed, but this cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el fair One, and turning my ſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, I found in her place this Puppet, which they had taken care to dreſs up very neatly. Thus for ſeveral nights together, my Wife was accuſtom'd to undreſs her ſelf before me, ſo that when I thought my ſelf moſt ſure of her, I found in her place a piece of Wood as cold as Ice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:109100:135"/>
               <hi>O Sir, not to interrupt your Diſcourſe,</hi> ſaid <hi>Monſieur Boufflers, this was moſt convenient to quench your flame.</hi> 
               <q>'Tis true, Sir, reply d the Count, but a Block of Wood is a very inſipid thing for a paſſionate Lover. If you had been in my place, you would I believe, with all your Stratagems, Bombs, and Fire-works, have been put to a <hi>Non plus.</hi> You might have planted your Cannon, and fixt your Mortars, according to the moſt exact Rules of the beſt Ingineers of the Kindgom; you would have miſs d your aim for all this, and that too, ſome hundred paces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the mark; and if at laſt you had not turn'd Fool you muſt have had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good luck.</q> 
               <hi>Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Monſieur Boufflers, the Art of War is of little uſe in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions of this nature. The Subtilty of a Fox, and the Nimbleneſs of a Cock, are ſufficient qualifications for ſuch Exploits; theſe will make the Pullets dance after their Pipe; take this Doctrine from me, Sir, as old an Engineer as you are.</hi> 
               <q>Sir, reply'd the Count, you are juſt at the point of giving us ſome proofs of your Bravery: Time and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity will queſtionleſs inform us, with what skill you ſhall have brought your ſelf off theſe Quick-ſands, where the moſt able Seamen have often ſuffer'd Shipwrack.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:109100:135"/>
               <hi>But Sir,</hi> ſaid the Dutcheſs of <hi>Artagnan,</hi> whilſt all the reſt of the Ladies were laughing out, <hi>and what iſſue had this fatal Adventure?</hi> 
               <q>Madam, anſwer'd the Count, the end of the Story is, that it coſt me a vaſt ſeries of cruel ſufferings, which made me lead a languiſhing Life like a poor condemned Wretch, for the ſpace of ſix months; inſomuch that I was verily perſwaded, that this time of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ought infallibly to deliver me from the pains of Purgatory, if I ſhould be condemn'd to go thither after my death; for I give you my word for it, that all the torments of Hell cannot exceed thoſe pains which we endure by the cruelty of a charming Beauty ſo much belov'd and admir'd as this unlucky Creature was by me, pointing with his finger to the Counteſs his Spouſe, who laugh'd open-mouth'd, when ſhe ſaw her Husband relate this Story with ſo much concern.</q> 
               <hi>But you have forgot my dear Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>to tell us the circumſtances of our Reconciliation.</hi> 
               <q>You are in the right on't, my dear Child, ſaid the Count, but give me but leave to cough, and to cleanſe my Lungs a little, and then Mr. Preacher will begin where he left off before.</q>
               <q>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:109100:136"/>
Having thus ſuffered all this cruel u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage which I have juſt now related to you, and having taken no reſt day or night for a conſiderable time, I told my Mother-in-law frankly, and plainly,</q> 
               <hi>That I was reſolved to give her her Daughter again, as good as I had found her, if by her authority, ſhe could not prevail upon her to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate her ſentiments to the State of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi> 
               <q>The Marchioneſs, being moved by my complaints, at laſt reſolved to call an Aſſembly of Ladies of her next Relations, and having given an account to 'em of her Daughters averſion to the Conjugal Bed, and to all Men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhe order'd a moſt magnificent Collation, which was to be the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of one of the moſt famous General Councils that ever was held among Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. At laſt, after the Doors of the Appartment, where theſe Ladies were aſſembled were ſhut up cloſe, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant was call'd up to appear before her Judges, where ſhe was examin'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the preſent ſtate of her natural Parts, to ſee whether ſhe were an Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphrodite, or whether ſhe had ſome other impediment, which might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude her from the enjoyment of the Conjugal Union.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:109100:136"/>
               <q>All Parts thereabouts having been found in a very good condition, and conformable to the Rules of Anatomy, (according to the report made by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain expert Matron, who was ſent for on purpoſe to aſſiſt at this Inquiſition) and the Generation-box being found without blemiſh, they paſt on to Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories.</q> The Marchioneſs, my Wife's Mother, being there preſent in quality of my Lady Chief Juſtice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of her Daughter, <hi>What was the reaſon that ſhe refus'd to live as a marry'd Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ought to do, with a Man whom Heaven and ſhe had given her for her Husband; there being nothing wanting in her Perſon which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had beſtow'd on the reſt of her Sex for the bringing forth of Children; eſpecially ſince the Count her Husband was a Man of a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Eſtate and Quality, deſcended from one of the moſt ancient and noble Families in</hi> France. She added, <hi>That the hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting lawful Heirs, was the only motive that induc'd him to deſire her in Marriage; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe a conſiderable diſproportion in their Age; that he grounded his opinion upon her being ſo young, and deſcended from a fruitful Family; for which two reaſons, he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſure of Children that might inherit his Eſtate: And finally, that he was the laſt of his Family, which was the chief conſideration
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:109100:137"/>
that had made him reſolve to marry at that Age.</hi> 
               <q>The poor Child anſwer'd her <hi>Mamma,</hi> that the Count had ſo fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her, that ſhe would much rather go into a Nunnery, than to let that be ſacrific'd which was the moſt precious to her in the World, meaning her Maiden-head.</q> 
               <hi>How! Daughter, what do you mean by this?</hi> ſaid her Mother, full of indignation. <hi>Explain your ſelf, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have you for ſo doing? Mamma,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the young Counteſs, <hi>my Husband told me one day, I think it was juſt the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Wedding, that he believ'd he ſhould not live long. And why ſo,</hi> reply'd her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Becauſe that he had</hi>—anſwer d the young Lady: <hi>O Lord! Mamma, I dare not tell it. Speak out you Fool,</hi> cry'd the Marchioneſs, <hi>there is none but Women here. He told me,</hi> anſwer d the Counteſs, <hi>that he had a certain Gut that would come out in... If it be ſo, Mamma, I cannot poſſibly lie with him, becauſe I know not what it means.</hi> At theſe words, all the Ladies fell a laughing as loud as they could for a conſiderable time. <q>But to come to the end of my Story, added the Count, my Mother-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, and the reſt of the Ladies who were there preſent in Court as Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, did ſo tutor this ignorant Girl, and explained this Gut in Terms ſo live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:109100:137"/>
and natural to her, that the poor Child at laſt was over-perſwaded to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice her Maiden-Treaſure, which ſhe had hitherto ſo carefully preſerv'd; ſo that after ſix Months Marriage ſhe was made a Wife: the Prodigy of our Age, and perhaps the moſt extraordinary one that ever was heard of before.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Count having finiſht his Relation, Madam <hi>de Tilladet</hi> and the reſt of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, taking the Counteſs <hi>de Surlaube</hi> on one ſide, ask'd her, <hi>Whether her Husband had ſpoke nothing but the truth as to all the circumſtances of his Narrative. He has been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry punctual,</hi> reply'd the Counteſs, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as loud as ſhe could. <hi>My dear Child,</hi> ſaid <hi>Monſieur Boufflers,</hi> addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont; and how do you like this Story of the Gut? ſhall I be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate as the Count? I am deviliſh impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,</hi> continu d he; <hi>if any thing like this ſhould happen to me, my Wedding-day would be that of my Funeral. Sir,</hi> reply'd Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle pleaſantly, <hi>if I thought I ſhould act with as good ſucceſs as the Counteſs, I ſhould take it to be the greateſt pleaſure in the World to let you languiſh for ſome time.</hi> She accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd theſe words with ſo charming a ſmile, that the Marſhal was eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, that at her Age ſhe was not ſo ignorant as Madam <hi>de Surlaube</hi> had been,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:109100:138"/>
and that whenever that time ſhould come, ſhe would not ſtop her Ears to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>The Marſhal anſwer'd her by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand amourous looks, telling her, <q>That he was not ignorant, what delight young Ladies would often take to play a ſpiteful trick with their Gallants. I think, ſaid he, that 'tis much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, when it proceeds from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Modeſty and Innocency, which is natural to ſo tender an Age. In ſuch a caſe as this, I ſhould be ſo far from tormenting my ſelf about it, that on the contrary, I ſhould eſteem it as the moſt delicious and moſt ſavory Diſh Love can afford us: I ſhould then look upon my ſelf to be the Poſſeſſor of the whole ſtock of Charms and ſweet Fruits that Love is able to give to a Lover; and that I might flatter my ſelf, even to an aſſurance, that I was the firſt who put the Plow into that ground, which I think to be the greateſt, Charm peculiar to a Beauty that never ſaw day-light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. This is ſo great a rarity, continu'd the Marſhal, in the Age we now live in, that ſuch a Miſtreſs is to be accounted a Phoenix. Our modern Gallantry in uſe among Ladies, is like an Academy of young Beauties, where at the Age
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:109100:138"/>
of 14 they are ſo well inſtructed in theſe matters, that they will ſcarce refuſe a good thing when 'tis once offer'd em.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is paſt contradiction,</hi> ſaid the Count, <hi>de Surlaube.</hi> Monſieur de Boufflers <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals tho ſomewhat remiſs, come very near the truth, and probability pleads ſtrongly for what he has offered. Experience has ſufficiently taught us, that he talks of it like a Maſter, and that the Draught which he has given us of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues of the fair</hi> Sex <hi>is done to the Life. For my part,</hi> added he, <hi>I foreſee already that he will have no reaſon to complain of his Lady s cruelty, and that his Happineſs will be more compleat at the very beginning, than mine has ever been as yet; tho thanks to Heaven, I have no reaſon to complain now of her, who made me ſuffer ſo much before. You ought to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute your Felicity</hi> reply'd <hi>Monſieur Boufflers, to the explication of the</hi> Story of the Gut, <hi>for without that, I believe your Lady would have been a Maid to this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers</hi> had ſcarce ſpoke theſe laſt Words, when a Page of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle de Grammont s</hi> came to advertiſe him, and his Lady, that <hi>Madam de Maintenon</hi>'s Coach was at the door. This Lady had not ſeen our Lovers for ſome days laſt paſt; and as ſhe of all the reſt that were at Court, ſhew'd moſt concern for their Happineſs, and had her
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:109100:139"/>
ſelf been the firſt that ſpoke in <hi>Monſieur Bouffler</hi>'s Favour to <hi>Mademoiſelle de Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont;</hi> nothing was tranſacted in carrying on the Match without her approbation. The <hi>Marſhal</hi> and <hi>Madamoiſelle de Grammont,</hi> went immediately out of the Room to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her at the Stair-head, ſhe being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd by the Abbot <hi>de Tellier,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the late Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam de Maintenon</hi> at her coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chamber, being overjoy'd to meet with ſo much good Company, all the Gentlemen and Ladies, of whom we ſpoke before, entertain'd her with all the Courteſie imaginable. The <hi>Marſhal de Boufflers</hi> himſelf preſented a Chair to her, and the <hi>Marchioneſs de Maintenon</hi> having taken her Seat <hi>Nephew,</hi> ſaid he, (for ſo ſhe was won't to call him) <hi>I have ſome good News to impart to you. And what good News, pray Madam,</hi> ſaid the Marſhal. <hi>I juſt now came from Court,</hi> reply'd the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs, <hi>where the King told me, that his pleaſure was, that thoſe obſtacles, which have hitherto obſtructed your Match ſhould be removed, His Majeſty,</hi> added ſhe, is reſolv'd <hi>to beg in the Campaign very early and therfore will ſoon have occaſion for your Service in</hi> Falnders. <hi>It is for this reaſon that</hi> he will have the Marriage forthwith conſummated, <hi>and that all ſhall be over in fifteen days. I am
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:109100:139"/>
very glad to bring you theſe good tidings, that both you and</hi> Mademoiſelle de Grammont <hi>may take yorr meaſures accordingly. I don't queſtion but you are already ſo far advanced into your Miſtreſs's favour, that ſhe will not be diſſatisfied with this ſudden change. I know that young Ladies at her Age, are not ſo backward to taſte thoſe ſecret enjoyments which Love offers; the firſt night after Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, ſuppoſing this to be true, I believe you both have an equal ſhare in this ſatisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> anſwered the Marſhal, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I ſhou d differ from all the World, and that my Heart ſhou d be quite inſenſible; how cou'd I chooſe otherwiſe than to be charm'd with the engaging allurements of ſuch a Perſon as</hi> Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Grammont. <hi>I am already all over in a flame, according to my natural diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and this fire cannot but burn with great vehemency, when 'tis fed by an object more bright than the Stars. Give me leave,</hi> added he, looking upon <hi>Mademoiſelle de Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> with a very paſſionate Eye, <hi>give me leave, my moſt Adorable, to ſpeak what is due to your merits, and do you accompany my words with your charming ſmiles and your ſweet and amorous glances, which being the interpreters of your Heart, may aſſure me of what your Tongue is unwilling to expreſs.</hi> The Maſhral ſpoke theſe words with ſuch a grace and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of mind, with ſo frank and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:109100:140"/>
an Air, that he was applauded by the whole Aſſembly; and his Miſtreſs found her Heart aſſail'd by a thouſand amorous tranſports. The Eyes of this fair Lady, the faithful Interpreters of the tender paſſion and ſhamefac'dneſs of a young Beauty, who always receives the careſſes of her Lover with ſilence, becauſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty requires it; made their addreſſes to him, giving him to underſtand the moſt ſecret and ſincere motions of her Heart.</p>
            <p>A Lover who is belov'd is Maſter of the ſecret of unfolding theſe amorous Riddles, which are no ſmall addition to the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Love ſports; ſo that if a Miſtreſs will but favour that Perſon with a ſmile, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom ſhe has given her heart before, he needs not covet any thing more, to make him the happieſt Man in the world. This was the condition in which the Marſhal was at that time with <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Grammout.</hi> The Marchioneſs <hi>de Maintenon,</hi> who was very expert in this noble Art, might eaſily judge that her Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew had no reaſon to repent of the pains and trouble he had undergone for a Lady of that quality and merit as <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont</hi> was, whom ſhe had firſt brought into his acquaintance. And that which encreas'd her ſatisfaction, was, that ſhe could now applaud herſelf to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:109100:140"/>
have been ſucceſsful in the choice of one of the chiefeſt Ladies about Court for her Nephew, whom ſhe ever look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as her adopted Son, and in whom ſhe took a more than ordinary delight.</p>
            <p>All the actions of our Marſhal have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways met with the approbation of the Marchioneſs <hi>de Maintenon,</hi> who has ſhew'd all the kindneſs to him that could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected even from a Mother, from the beginning of his appearing at Court till this time; which has been the main cauſe of his Preferment. Whenever the King had a mind to talk of his great Officers, Madam <hi>de Maintenon</hi> wou'd ſeldom let ſlip the opportunity to enlarge upon the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, Vigilancy, Bravery, and undaunted Courage of her beloved Favourite: Theſe <hi>Encomiums</hi> coming from the Mouth of one who had ſuch a ſway at Court as Madam <hi>de Maintenon;</hi> who both at that time and at preſent, beſtows what favours ſhe thinks fit within the verge of it; having by the continual care ſhe has taken to pleaſe his Majeſty, got ſuch an Aſcendant over this Monarch, that ſhe is, as it were, his right hand, and he ſeldom does any thing of moment without her Advice: <hi>Monſieur Boufflers</hi> at laſt, by her frequent Interceſſion, was advanc d to the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a Marſhal of <hi>France.</hi> This was the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:109100:141"/>
higheſt Pinnacle of her, hopes to ſee her Favourite ſo dignify'd, not queſtioning, but if the difficulty were once ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe might find means to accompliſh this Match, which ſhe had projected long before; and which without that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ſcarce would have come to a happy concluſion: for, Madam <hi>de Grammont</hi> would hardly ever have been prevail'd upon, to give her Daughter in Marriage to <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers,</hi> who was then but a Soldier of Fortune; having, as ſhe was won't to ſay, taken a reſolution, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow her upon none leſs than a Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> who might be anſwerable to that high renown, which the <hi>Marſhal de Grammont</hi> had acquir'd by his Heroick Atchievements.</p>
            <p>But we will lay aſide for ſome time theſe Reflections which only appertain to to the Hero of our Hiſtory, and give you a particular account of ſome paſſages of that Auguſt Aſſembly, where were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent all the Noblemen and Ladies of the higheſt Quality at Court. They enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained one another with a thouſand plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Stories, and among the reſt with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of their own adventures of Love and Gallantry. For the greater ſatisfaction of the Reader, we will make choice of ſome few of the beſt, and ſuch as ſeem moſt
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:109100:141"/>
worthy to be taken notice of, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been unknown hitherto in publick; and in regard that I was preſent at this entertainment; ſo I will undertake to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them with all the faithfulneſs imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam de Maintenon</hi> having for ſome time hearken'd to the diſcourſe of ſome of the Ladies, concerning what News lately happen'd in <hi>Paris,</hi> began to ſpeak thus. Ladies, I am about to give you a relation of a moſt Tragical Story, which will appear to be the more <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in its kind, the more extraordinary and ſurprizing it is in it ſelf. I have it,</hi> added ſhe, <hi>from Father</hi> La Chaiſe'<hi>s own Mouth, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two days ago, when I was with him laſt, and it is ſo much the more certainly true in regard that it hapned to himſelf not above four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days before. When you have heard all the circumſtances of the whole matter you'll be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, that ſome things are tranſacted in</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, <hi>which are bury'd in eternal oblivion. And if it ſo fall out ſometimes that ſuch like things are diſcover'd, tis owing to Providence which brings them to light to convince us of the Vanity of this World, and to make us ſenſible of what abuſes are daily committed among Men. At the ſame time it muſt be acknowledg'd, that Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanary is the famous Theatre, where, theſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick Parts are diſplaid; this occaſions more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:109100:142"/>
crimes than any thing elſe that I know of, The following Hiſtory will furniſh us with a notable example to prove my Aſſertion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Father <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> told me, that on the 24th of <hi>April</hi> laſt paſt, about a quarter of an hour after twelve a clock at night, when the whole College of Jeſuits were in Bed, there came to the Door of the Monaſtery a Coach with ſix Horſes; and a Footman coming from behind the Coach, rung the Bell at the Gate. The Porter, being in his firſt Sleep, did not hear him immediately, which made the Footman ring again ſo loudly, that the Porter was awaken'd at the noiſe he made. The Porter having ask'd, <hi>Who is there?</hi> the Footman anſwer'd, <hi>That he deſir'd him to open the Gate.</hi>
               </q> Brother <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> (which is the name of the Porter) told him, <hi>That 'twas not in his power, becauſe the Rector of the College had forbid him to open the Gate ſo late to any one whatever.</hi> The Foot-man made anſwer, that <hi>they wanted a Father Confeſſor for a Perſon of great Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, who was juſt at the point of Death; and that it was a caſe of very urgent neceſſity.</hi> Brother <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> having underſtood theſe words, open'd the Gate, when the Foot-man told him, <hi>That he was come to fetch Father</hi> La Chaiſe; <hi>that the ſick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of whom he had ſpoke before, whoſe Name
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:109100:142"/>
he was not to tell, was deſirous to have Father</hi> La Chaiſe, <hi>and no body elſe, for ſome very weighty reaſons, which related to the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a wounded Conſcience,</hi> and the <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of an immortal Soul.</hi> Brother <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> told him, <hi>That he would go up to Father</hi> La Chaiſe'<hi>s Chamber, and let him know what he ſaid.</hi> 
               <q>The Foot-man pray'd him to make all poſſible haſte he could, by reaſon that no time was to be loſt. Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ambroſe</hi> having awaken'd Father <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> inform'd him of what he knew of the matter. Father. <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> having ask'd him the Name of the Lord or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that ſent for him.</q> Brother <hi>Ambroſe</hi> told him, <hi>That by the Train and Equipage it ſhould be a Perſon of the higheſt Quality.</hi> He alſo told him, that <hi>there was a mourning Coach at the Gate, drawn by ſix black Horſes: That the Coachman, Poſtilion, and four Foot-men, who attended it, were all cloathed in black; that they appear'd as black in their Faces as Negroes; and that they had no Flamboys a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them, neither could he deviſe what might be the meaning of it, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to tell the Name of him who had ſent them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Father <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> being by this time got out of Bed, went down to the Gate himſelf, where the ſame Foot-man, who had ſpoke before to the Porter,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:109100:143"/>
ſaid, <hi>Good Father I entreat you to get up into this Coach with ſix Horſes. Who is it that ſent you to fetch me?</hi> reply'd Father <hi>La Chaiſe, Good Father,</hi> ſaid the Foot-man, <hi>We came from a Perſon of the firſt rank in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who deſires to impart to you ſomething of great conſequence before he dies. He is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to have any other Confeſſor, but your ſelf, and we dare not tell his Name, becauſe we are forbid it.</hi> 
               <q>Father <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> who could not diſcover whoſe Equipage this was, the Foot-men being all diſguis'd by their black Faces, like your very Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, thought it moſt convenient to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe with the Rector, Praefect, and other Superiors of the Order, whether they would approve of his going along with thoſe unknown Perſons.</q> 
               <q>He began to make ſerious reflections upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; his Head being fill'd with jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, that perhaps ſome Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity diſgrac'd at Court, and excited by diſcontent, hatred, or revenge, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Perſon, might by this means endeavour to get him into ſome private place or another, there to ſerve him an <hi>Italian</hi> trick, without being any more to be heard of for ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>All the good Fathers being got out of their Beds, and having weigh'd the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with deliberation, it was reſolv'd,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:109100:143"/>
that Father <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> who was ſo dear to theirwhole Order, ought not to expoſe himſelf to this hazard. The Rector be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of opinion, that ſome body elſe ought to be ſent in his ſtead. Father <hi>Bourdalou</hi> generouſly offer'd himſelf.</q> But being come down, the Foot-man who had ſpoke to Father <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> before told him, <hi>That they had orders to bring along with 'em none elſe but Father</hi> La Chaiſe, <hi>and that he need not make any ſcruple to truſt himſelf with 'em, they being aſſur'd that he would be in no more danger, than if he ſtaid in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</hi> For the reſt, they deſir'd him to conſider, <hi>That the Welfare of a Soul lay at ſtake, and that it was one of the greatest Men at Court, whoſe Conſcience could not be ſatisfy'd till he had ſeen him; that there was not much more time to loſe; that if he tarry'd one quarter of an hour longer, it was to be fear'd it would be too late, becauſe the ſick Perſon was almoſt at the laſt gaſp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Father <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> who ſhews much zeal in matters relating to the Salvation of Souls, being mov'd at theſe words; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the reſt of the Fathers to let him perform his duty in a place whereto his Conſcience call'd him; and ſo, in ſpite of all the diſſwaſions of the Rector, Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and Father <hi>Bourdalou,</hi> who went down with him to the Gate, he reſolv'd
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:109100:144"/>
to go, whatever might come of it. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore croſs'd himſelf three times with the ſign of the Croſs, he went into the Coach. The Coach-man, laſhing the Horſes ſoundly with his Whip, drove away with a full Gallop. Father <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> tho it was very dark, did take as much notice as poſſibly he could of all the Streets and by-lanes thro which they paſt; and tho he knew exactly all the places throughout that vaſt City; yet he was never able afterwards to find out any of thoſe parts thro which he was convey'd; the Coach-man being order'd to drive round about ſome parts of the Town, paſſing and repaſſing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times the ſame Streets, the better to deceive the Father, and to prevent any diſcovery of thoſe places thro which they went.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In the mean while Father <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> lying along the bottom of the Coach, began to make a thouſand ominous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, accuſing himſelf of Imprudence to have ſo ſlightly expos'd himſelf to the utmoſt hazard of his Life. But as the caſe now ſtood, the beſt advice he could take was, to ſet his Conſcience at reſt, and to prepare himſelf for Death, in caſe he ſhould have occaſion to dye at that inſtant. Conformably to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:109100:144"/>
he made a full Confeſſion of his Sins to Almighty God, begging par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for thoſe that he had committed ſince his laſt Confeſſion, and for all ſuch as might not then occur to his Memory, adding, that if he had done ſome ill office to ſome great Man or another with the King, who ſtir'd up by his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt him, had reſolv'd to make uſe of this opportunity to draw him into a Snare, which ſhould coſt him his Life; he pray'd God to forgive him, becauſe the Station he was in, of being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor to the greateſt Monarch, made him againſt his Will, often liable to the Diſcontents of the Courtiers, who laid claim to ſome office or another, which were often beſtow'd upon others, by his ſollicitation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Having been thus perplex'd in his thoughts for a good half hour, he came to the place where he was to be ſet down. The Coach having ſtopt, he ſaw a Foot-man coming out of a great Gate, which was all hung with black Cloath, that hid the Coat of Arms belonging to the Family, to keep it from his ſight. The ſame Foot-man, having in one Hand a Flamboy made of black Wax, open'd the door of the Coach, and with his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hand helpt our Father out, who
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:109100:145"/>
was conducted into a great and and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine Palace, all hung with black; ſeveral Foot-men all with Flamboys made of black Wax in their Hands ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Stair-foot, from whence they led him up Stairs, two ſtories high back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into a very fine Appartment. All the Domeſtick Servants were cloathed in black, as were likewiſe their Faces, ſhining as if they had been true Black-moors. This was contriv'd on purpoſe to deceive Father <hi>la Chaiſe,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had ſeen them a thouſand times in his Life time, but was not able to give the leaſt gueſs at them under this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This Appartment was like all the reſt, hung all over with black, and as ſoon as Father <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> was entered, all the Candles were put out at once, ſo that all upon a ſudden he was left quite in the dark, and conducted up to the other end of the Room, where a Chair was ſet for him under a Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, upon a piece of Tapeſtry ſpread upon the floor. When he was ſet down, he could hear the voice of a Lady bewailing her ſelf, and imploring the mercy of a Perſon, who as he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, was about to put her to death for her unfaithfulneſs. <hi>Come, come, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
               </q>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:109100:145"/>
ſaid the Nobleman, <hi>your Father Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor is ready, you have but a few moments to live, which you may beſtow, in ſettling your Conſcience. The time draws near, for me to revenge my ſelf in puting an end to your Life: I pray God to forgive you your ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Immediately after, the Lady was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted out of an Appartment hard by under favour of the darkneſs, directly to the place where our Father expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her coming: Father <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> by her Confeſſion, was inform'd of the crime, which was the occaſion of her death, but ſhe did not ſay one word, either concerning her own Name, or his, who intended to put her to death, and whatever pains he took, he could not bring out one word from her as to that matter;</q> till at laſt, the Lady perceiving the curioſity of her Confeſſor, told him, that <hi>ſhe was afraid, leſt his Curioſity might prove fatal to him, and that therefore ſhe advis'd him not to dive any farther into the matter, or to oblige her to commit an indiſcreet Act, becauſe, if her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhould get the leaſt notice of it, he would certainly be the death of him, and would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps provide for him the ſame entertainment, which ſhe was about to receive,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>There needed nothing elſe to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence our Father; for in an inſtant
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:109100:146"/>
he loſt the uſe of his Tongue, not ſpeaking ſo much as one word more, but employ'd the reſt of his time in hearkening to this diſconſolate Lady, whilſt ſhe made a particular confeſſion of all her ſins, which, having ask'd pardon of Almighty God, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Abſolution from the Mouth of her Confeſſor. It is to be obſerved that during the whole time, as well as before, that the Lady was with him, they were without light; ſo that he had not the leaſt opportunity to know her. But, to come to an end of this Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hiſtory; no ſooner had the Father Confeſſor pronounc'd theſe words: <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvo te,</hi> or <hi>I abſolve you,</hi> but a certain Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman-Uſher came to re-conduct this unknown Lady into a Room next by, where a Bath was prepar'd for her. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had been undreſs'd by her wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gentlewomen, ſhe enter'd the Bath, and being ſet upon a Chair, the Veins in her Arms and Feet were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, till all-her Vital Spirits having left her with the Blood, ſhe dy'd in the ſame manner, as <hi>Seneca</hi> did heretofore, this being look'd upon as one of the moſt gentle kinds of death.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Father <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> was re-conducted to the ſame Coach, which had brought
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:109100:146"/>
him thither, attended by the ſame Coach-man and Foot-men, who carry'd him back to the Convent, but by a quite different way, than what they had paſs'd thro before, having made ſo many turnings and windings, that 'twas impoſſible for the good Father to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them, who, beſides this, was very glad to ſee himſelf return ſafe and ſound, and to have paid no dearer for his Journey. As ſoon as they were come again to the Gate of the Monaſtery, one of the Foot-men open'd the Coach-door, and rung the Bell to awaken the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Father <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> coming out of the Coach, had no ſooner ſet his Feet to the ground, but away drove the Coach-man, whip and ſlaſh immediately out of ſight, not ſtaying to ſee whether the Gate were open'd or not. As ſoon as the Porter had let Father <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> in, he went up directly to the Chamber of the Rector and the Praefect; <hi>O my good Fathers!</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I never heard of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Hell more terrible than what I have ſeen, ſince I left you. Every thing about me was black and frightful, the moſt diſmal Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral pomp that ever was beheld.</hi> Then Father <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> gave 'em an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all that had paſs'd, without being able to tell 'em one word, which
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:109100:147"/>
might contribute any thing towards the diſcovery of the Noble Man's Name, or of that of the Lady, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Abſolution from him. The good Fathers were extremely ſurpriz'd at the ſtrangeneſs of the Matter of Fact, which appear'd to 'em ſo terrible, and ſo Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical, that the like had not been known in <hi>Paris,</hi> in the Memory of Man: And what I have told you, added <hi>Madam de Maintenon,</hi> is true even beyond contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, Father <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> being the Man who was concern'd in that Affair, no longer than ſome few weeks ago; from whoſe own Mouth I have received it, with all theſe circumſtances, which I have related to you.</q>

               <hi>Madam,</hi> anſwered <hi>Monſieur de Surlaube, Love is a ſtrange capricious Paſſion, it is the cauſe of great Evils in this World, the feweſt of which come to our Knowledge, the reſt being bury'd in Eternal Oblivion. If Men are once poſſeſs'd with jealouſie, it makes 'em furious, and incapable of Compaſſion towards their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes; the leaſt ſlip they make, is ſufficient to raiſe in 'em a ſuſpicion of Unfaithfulneſs, which is enough for 'em to render their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes Criminal in their ſight. I cannot deny it,</hi> Sir, reply'd <hi>Madam de Maintenon, but Methinks this Crime ought not to be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as ſo enormous, as not to be expiated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:109100:147"/>
death. A Gentleman of Honour ought to take Compaſſion of the frailty of the Fair Sex. And if they will needs make it a rule to be inexorable upon that account towards their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, why ſhould not they with juſtice, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the ſame right, to inflict ſuch rigorous Puniſhments upon their Lovers when they prove treacherous. We are pretty well acquairted with the Qualities of your Sex,</hi> added the Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs, <hi>if Women are ſometimes unfaithful, you I am ſure a thouſand times more; the leaſt thing in the world makes you changeable. How many do you think there are of your Men of Fortune in the World whom</hi> Baron <hi>has ſo lively repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in his Comedys? I believe there are very few among you all, but what may find their true Character there; and turn it which ſide you will, you do us the greateſt Injuſtice in the World, thus to exerciſe your Tyranny, in exacting a blind Obedience from our Sex, and to deprive us of that ſmall ſhare of Liberty which is allowed us. If you Gentlemen were all to be put to death, as this poor Lady was, of whom you have heard this Tragical Relation, as often as you prove per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd and unfaithful to thoſe ſeveral Ladies unto whom you have ſworn one after another an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable Love, confirm'd by moſt ſacred Oaths, the common Language of Lovers; I believe verily there would ſcarce be any one living but that deſerv'd to undergo the like Capital puniſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:109100:148"/>
               <hi>Hold Madam,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Marſhal de Lorge, you have fairly ſhewn your skill in pleading the Cauſe of your Sex; but I hope you will give me leave to tell you, that their natural conſtitution ſeems to require from them more Reſervedneſs, Conſtancy and Fidelity, than from us Men. This is the only Heroick Vertue in your Sex, to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; this is the only Charm by which you capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate us, and which makes Men ſo paſſionate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, and which beſides this, diſtinguiſhes Vertuous Women from the crowd of wanton Jilts, and common Proſtitues; who ought to be eſteem'd as Monſters; and for whom a Man of Honour can never have thoſe ſentiments which are, as it were, Spice to make Love ſavoury to the taſte. Inſomuch that upon the whole, this fickle Humour in Menought to be conſider'd as a ſlight Treſpaſs, and not as a Capital Crime; as you would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly repreſent it. If a Man has more Miſtreſſes than one, he may be reſpected for all that, as a Gentleman of Honour and Probity; whereas a Woman that proſtitutes her ſelf to many, loſes inevitably all that modeſt and innocent behaviour, which are the inſeparable Companions of Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Women; and without which 'tis impoſſible for a Man to be charm'd, or to be made ſenſible of any real ſatisfaction from a Lady who does not poſſeſs theſe Endowments. The</hi> Marſhal de Lorge <hi>is in the right on't,</hi> ſaid the Count <hi>de Surlaube. Your too forward Women are juſt like your ſparkling Wines, no body cares to buy them.
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:109100:148"/>
That which renders Love delicious, and which makes Men amorous and paſſionate, is that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence which we admire in the Perſon belov'd. The moſt real and ſweeteſt pleaſure, a Man is capable of enjoying with his Miſtreſs, is, the delight he takes to inſtruct and breed up a young tender Heart, which may be compar'd to your pure Wines, which are ſtill upon the Lees; or to a Roſe gather'd early in the Spring, when it juſt begins to bud: And that is, what properly ought to be call'd a Maiden-head, without ſeeking any further for it, as moſt Men do, who ſeldom find it any where elſe, but in conceit, when their Brains are heated with amorous Fancies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> added the Count, addreſſing his Speech to <hi>Madam de Maintenon, We are here teaching a Doctrine, which may ſeem to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſomewhat of Libertiniſm, and which I don't know how it may reliſh with you: All I have to ſay is, that conſidering the circumſtances of the time, our Friend</hi> Boufflers <hi>being ſo near his Wedding-day, we could ſcarce pick out a more agreeable and diverting Subject. One may, without Flattery,</hi> continu'd the Count laughing, <hi>tell him, that he is the happieſt of all Men in the choice of a Miſtreſs, who will make him ſenſible of all thoſe Charms we have ſpoke of juſt now with ſo much Commendation.</hi> Mademoiſelle de Grammont <hi>is one of thoſe rare Beauties, which have not as yet been brought
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:109100:149"/>
to light, and whom the God of Love himſelf takes care to inſtruct in his Charms, and to make her ſenſible of all his myſteries. The Abby of</hi> St. Cyr, <hi>where ſhe has reſided of late, has not been a little inſtrumental in preſerving theſe charming Qualities, which few of your young Ladies in</hi> Paris <hi>can boaſt of, who perhaps have been more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in the Affairs of the World, and have had the opportunity of making more Conqueſts, but which, if truly conſidered, are nothing but Vanities. For example, why muſt we be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd with ſo many Abbey-Lubbers about the Town, who make it their chief buſineſs to viſit Ladies, and to talk to them of their Paſſion? How many beautiful Damſels are there in</hi> Paris, <hi>who are fond of the flattering Praiſes beſtow'd upon them by theſe inſinuating</hi> Tartuffs, <hi>who ought to ſay their Breviary, inſtead of playing the Gallants? I am not able to endure, Madam,</hi> continu'd the Count, <hi>all theſe Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, I cannot but pity on one ſide thoſe poor ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Creatures, who ſuffer themſelves thus to be cajoled by theſe Sparks with their little Bands; and on the other, I am at the ſame time ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at the Impudence of theſe Raſcals, who acting the</hi> Libertine, <hi>do not make any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſeducing abundance of young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women of very good Quality, who quite ſpoil their Fortune by theſe extravagant Courſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:109100:149"/>
               <q>I do declare to you, <hi>reply'd the Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs</hi> de Maintenon, that I am no great Friend of theſe Sparks of the Collar-band; and if his Majeſty wou'd follow my Advice in this particular. I wou'd have 'em meddle with nothing but their Breviary, without giving 'em the opportunity to ſcamper about to Debauch our young Women. If they have not the Gift of Continency, and the Frailty of their Fleſh will not admit of this Doctrin taught by the Holy Fathers; I wou'd have their black Coats pull'd over their Ears, to give 'em inſtead of it, a red Cloak and Sword, that they may have liberty to Marry.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>O Madam, <hi>anſwer'd the Count,</hi> 'tis under the Cover of their long Robes that they play the beſt of their Game; not to take notice here, of their Revenues and fat Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, which make 'em appear ſo freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd and of ſo ruddy a Complexion: It ſeems to me, as if theſe Sparks had alone the Touch-ſtone in Hand, to try the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all ſorts of Metals; there is not a ſavoury Bit in <hi>Paris,</hi> but they have it at their Devotion. The moſt part of young Women are led away by 'em, as it were by ſo many <hi>Sirens,</hi> which inchant 'em by their Allurements, and the ſweetneſs of their Voice; for moſt of theſe Gentlemen are well skill'd in Muſick, which is in great
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:109100:150"/>
eſteem among the Fair Sex, who love to have their Ears tickl'd with harmonious Strains, by which Bait they may eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant 'em ſo far, as to catch 'em in their Nets.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Let us not be any longer diſturb'd with theſe Abbots, <hi>ſaid Monſieur</hi> Boufflers, let us talk of us Men of the Blade, who are the truely generous Souls; being very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable both to the State, and to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of Beauty, whoſe Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives they always treat upon Honour. We are, <hi>added he,</hi> like Gold, the trueſt and beſt of all Metals, and if we were conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to our ſelves of having the leaſt wrong'd the Female Sex, we ſhou'd think our ſelves unworthy of wearing a Sword. Hold, Sir, <hi>reply'd the Count</hi> de Surlaube, you run too faſt; you do very well to Hector it in ſo good Company: For if we ſhou'd begin to rehearſe all your amour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Exploits, I queſtion whether you cou'd with Juſtice, make appear ſo much Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity on your ſide. But come, <hi>added he,</hi> we will not be too hard upon you at this time; Marriage is likely to cure you of this Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Humour, which was wont to carry you from one fair Lady to another; and you will be forc'd at laſt, in ſpite of your ſelf, to ſubmit to thoſe Chains and Fetter-Locks, which Love has prepar'd for you
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:109100:150"/>
by <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont.</hi> I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, you will look upon 'em as very glorious for you, becauſe you have all the reaſon in the World to flatter your ſelf, of having obtain'd the moſt precious Jewel in <hi>France,</hi> and having marry'd the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd Lady of the whole Court.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>du Maine,</hi> who had not as yet been to complement <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers</hi> and <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont</hi> upon their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Marriage, coming into the Room, did for ſome few moments interrupt their former Diſcourſe. And the Marchioneſs <hi>de Maintenon,</hi> having look'd upon her Watch, to ſee what a Clock it might be, roſe up from her Seat, and told the Company, <hi>That ſhe was, by Order from his Majeſty, to be at Court at a prefix'd time, about ſome Buſineſs of great Conſequence.</hi> As ſoon as ſhe was gone into her Coach, the Lords and Ladies began to ſit round again, every one in his own place, paſſing away the time, till the Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhou'd be ready, which was preparing for 'em. The Duke <hi>du Maine</hi> told 'em, <q>That he was juſt now come from the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot <hi>Tallement</hi>'s, where he had ſpent an Hour the moſt agreeably, that ever he did in his Life-time.</q> The Ladies ask'd him, <hi>With what?</hi> The Duke <hi>du Maine</hi> told 'em, <q>That he had ſeen there, ſome of the fineſt Pictures that cou'd be, and among the reſt,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:109100:151"/>
a moſt curious Piece, in which the Ladies have a more particular Concern. In this Picture, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> are contracted all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Fair Sex, to that degree, that there is not any one wanting, to make the Copy abſolutely like the Original. To be ſhort, it is an univerſal Piece, where all at once, are repreſented both their good and bad Qualities. And, what is the moſt ſurpriſing, all is done at one and the ſame time, without the leaſt altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Ladies being over-curious to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inform'd concerning all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this Picture, which ſeem'd to be a Riddle to 'em, and ſurpaſs'd all their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, begg'd heartily of the Duke, to give 'em a full Deſcription of it. <q>This I will do, <hi>reply'd the Prince, with a certain malicious Smile,</hi> but it is purely out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance and Obedience to your Commands. I am ſenſible, that Ladies love to hear a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation in their Praiſe, and that they wou'd willingly have their good Qualities made known to the World; and I know not any thing which will ſuit better with their Humour, or pleaſe 'em better, than this following Deſcription. I was juſt now, <hi>continu'd he,</hi> with the Abbot <hi>de Talle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> one perhaps of the moſt curious Men in <hi>Europe.</hi> After he had conducted me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:109100:151"/>
his Cloſet, he ſhew'd me a Piece, in which was repreſented a very ugly Head: It had 3 Mouths, 6 Eyes, and 3 Noſes, ſo that it appear'd to me like a Monſter. Beſides this, there was painted on one ſide a Magpye and a Peacock; and on the other, a ſmoaking Chimney.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Abbot ask'd me, Whether I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Riddle, and whether I was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the rarity of the Piece? <hi>I anſwer'd him,</hi> That I cou'd ſee nothing, but what appear'd to me very groſs and confus'd. And that beſides, I did not underſtand the meaning of this Hieroglyphick, deſiring him to explain it to me.</q> 
               <q>Sir, <hi>ſaid the Abbot,</hi> pray ſhut your left Eye, and with the other, look through this Hole.</q> 
               <q>I did as the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot had directed me, who having taken a Cylinder, made of a piece of poliſh'd Steel, he fix'd it oppoſite to the Hole through which I look'd. In an inſtant, this Monſter of a Head, the Magpye, the Peacock and the Chimney-piece, were, by a ſudden <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> chang'd into a Woman's Head, the fineſt and handſomeſt that ever I ſaw. The Abbot, having with one Hand, cover'd the Figure which repreſented the Magpye, the Mouths immediately diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd; ſo that nothing was ſeen in the Cylinder but a Woman's Head, without a Mouth: Afterwards, having laid his Hand
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:109100:152"/>
upon one of the Eyes, that were painted on the Piece, I cou'd not ſee any thing in the Cylinder, but one Eye. I never in all my Life time, <hi>added the Duke</hi> du Maine, have ſeen ſuch a curious Piece in the Opticks.</q> The Ladies, who began to be impatient to hear the Explication of it, cou'd not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear interrupting the Prince, deſiring him that he wou'd be pleas'd to explain to 'em the ſeveral Pieces, of which this Picture was compo'd. <q>Ladies, <hi>ſaid the Duke</hi> du Maine, the 6 Eyes denote, that the Women wou'd ſee all Things; the 3 Mouths, that they always begin to Talk firſt, and leave off laſt; the 3 Noſes give us to underſtand, that they have a very quick Scent, and won't be eaſily deceiv'd; the Peacock ſhews their Vanity; and the Magpye ſignifies, that they are always Chattering and Quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: Laſtly, the Chimney and Smoak are a Repreſentation of their Inconſtancy and fickle Humour; and all theſe Qualities are ſo eſſential to the Perfection of the Head, repreſented in the Cylinder; that if but any one of 'em be wanting, the whole is imperfect, as I have told you before.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We muſt confeſs, <hi>ſaid all the Ladies in general,</hi> this Picture has ſomewhat ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing in it.</q> 
               <q>You muſt look upon it, <hi>added the Marſhal,</hi> as a Panegyrick, in Short-hand-Writing, upon your Sex. It's
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:109100:152"/>
true, Sir, <hi>reply'd Madam</hi> de Tilladet, but this <hi>Encomium</hi> only expreſſes our bad Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. What, <hi>ſaid ſhe, addreſſing her ſelf to the Duke</hi> du Maine, Sir, won't you do us the favour as to give us an account of ſome of your Opticks, which may make amends for this, by repreſenting us on the beſt ſide, with all thoſe rare Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which captivate your Hearts, and make you our Slaves to wear our Chains, and to pay us Hommage. This is true, <hi>anſwer'd the Duke</hi> du Maine, but it is much againſt our Will. At the ſame time, Ladys, <hi>added he,</hi> I wou'd not have you think me ſo vain, as to pretend to ſet up for a Critick, or to draw upon my ſelf the ill Will, as poor <hi>Orpheus</hi> did heretofore, of ſo ſtrong a party, as the Women are. Whatever I have ſaid, was done meerly out of complaiſance, and to ſatisfy your Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Tilladet</hi> ſeeing how dextrous the Duke was at turning the matter from himſelf, and in making his Apology to the fair Sex, for whom he had always ſhewn a moſt particular eſteem, being one of the moſt Gallant Princes about the Court; told him, <q>That 'twas reſolv'd among 'em, that all the Ladys there preſent, ſhou'd go to Morrow, in a Body to the Abbot <hi>Tallement,</hi> on purpoſe to ask him, whether, what the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:109100:153"/>
Prince had related to 'em, were really ſo; and that if they cou'd get this Picture, ſo injurious to their Sex, into their Hands, they ſhou'd make a Bonfire of it, and burn it in ſome publick Place, as 'tis uſual to do with Books that treat of <hi>Magick.</hi> I muſt confeſs to you, Ladies, <hi>reply'd the Duke</hi> du Maine, that I took it no otherwiſe at firſt, till the Abbot <hi>Tallement</hi> diſcover'd to me the whole buſineſs, and convinc'd me, that every particular of it, was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence of the Rules of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, He ſhew'd me another Piece, no leſs ſurpriſing than the former, and which ſeems to contain ſomewhat ſupernatural in its kind: It is a Venice Looking-glaſs, which repreſents People that look into it, ſtark naked, If I were <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers,</hi> I wou'd go thither with <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont.</hi> This Looking-glaſs will give him a faithful repreſentation of thoſe Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which young Ladys take ſo much pains to hide from their Lovers: And at once looking only in the Glaſs with his Miſtreſs, he may learn more in one Moment, than two Months Courtſhip, and ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation are able to teach him. Away, away, with theſe Triffles, <hi>anſwer'd</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle de Grammont, with a charming and pleaſant Air, the Marſhal has no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either for a Confident or for a Looking-Glaſs
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:109100:153"/>
to diſcover my Defects. He is wiſe enough of himſelf, not to be ſurpris'd or to be impos'd upon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ladys, <hi>reply'd the Duke</hi> du Maine, ſince theſe pieces of Gallantry do put you out of Humour, come let us have a touch at Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The Abbot, ſaid he, ſhew'd me among the reſt, another Piece, which was no leſs ſurpriſing than the former, and as far as I remember, I never ſaw any thing finer, and more curious in my Life time. Well, let us hear what it is, ſaid <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers,</hi> but let me deſire you, Sir, not to offer any thing, to affront the fair Sex: I muſt needs tell you, that I am ſo very nice in that point, that I declare to you, I ſhall be ready to revenge their Quarrel, and even not to grudge, to employ my Sword in their juſt Defence, if there ſhou'd be occaſion for it. Wherefore Sir, <hi>added he ſmiling,</hi> and you had beſt have a care what you do. No, no, <hi>reply'd the Duke</hi> du Maine, this has no relation more to one Sex than the other; but all People are concern'd in it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Abbot <hi>Tallement</hi> ſhew'd me a large Painting, divided into three Columns: In the middle Column on the right hand, was repreſented, firſt of all, our Holy Father the Pope, as being the Chief of the Church, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him follow all the Cardinals; Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, Prelates, Abbots, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:109100:154"/>
and in general, all the reſt of the Members of the Clergy. In the Column on the right ſide, you might ſee a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Portraitures, repreſenting Temporal Princes, as Emperors, Monarchs, Kings and other Princes, follow'd by the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and a multitude of Courtiers. The Column, which was on the left ſide, was fill'd up, with the third Eſtate repreſenting the Courts of Juſtice; where you might ſee the Pictures of Lords Chief Juſtices and Judges, Maſters of the Rolls, Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, Attorneys, Sollicitors, Notaries, Tipſtaffs, Serjeants and ſuch like. So, that this whole Piece was fill'd up, with an infinite number of all ſorts of Perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the three Eſtates, every one in his Habit, according to the rank he bore in the Church, in the State or in the Courts of Judicature. The Abbot, after I had taken notice of the Medley, deſir'd me to put one Eye to a Hole at one end of the Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and from thence to look upon the Cylinder which he had plac'd oppoſite to it, at the other end of it: All theſe different Objects, having made a reflection upon the Cylinder of poliſh'd Steel, this Inſtrument did repreſent, no otherwiſe, than in a Looking-glaſs, a Death's Head, extremely well done; to put us in mind of the end of all Mortal Men, who in what ſtation ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:109100:154"/>
muſt all pay this laſt Tribute to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I aſſure you, <hi>ſaid Monſieur</hi> Boufflers, this ſeems to me, to be one of the moſt curious Pieces that ever was made in the World, and I will give you my Word, that <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Grammont</hi> and I, will to Morrow, do our ſelves the Honour to go and wait upon the Abbot, and take a view of all his Curioſities. But that which is moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in this Piece, is, <hi>added the Duke</hi> du Maine, that if you cover any part of theſe Pictures, contain'd in the three Columns, with your Hand; the Death's Head, which is reflected in the Cylinder, appears defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and there is ſome part or another of it wanting; to convince us, that none can be exempted from the unavoidable neceſſity of Dying. We entreat you, <hi>ſaid the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, directing their Diſcourſe to the Duke</hi> du Maine, let us not talk any more of this dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and frightful Subject, Death. Let us rather return to our Jollities, and divert our ſelves with ſome Pleaſant Story or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they are moſt ſeaſonable at this time, when we are met together, on purpoſe to be merry and pleaſant. <hi>Mademoiſelle de Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> is moſt concern'd in the matter, and it is chiefly upon her account, that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys deſire it. Becauſe you will have it ſo, <hi>ſaid the Duke</hi> du Maine, I will relate to you
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:109100:155"/>
another very extraordinary Story, which perhaps you will look upon, as one of the moſt refin'd pieces of Necromancy; the whole being altogether full of Gallantry.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Abbot, continu'd he, having given us a view of all the Rarities in his Cloſet, took me on one ſide, whiſpering me in the Ear.</q> 
               <hi>Pray my Lord, bring the Ladys who came along with you, into this Spacious Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I have a mind to ſhew you the Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of all my Rarities; but don't you ſpeak one word to 'em, you will divert your ſelf extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, provided you let 'em know nothing of the matter; becauſe they will perhaps be unwilling to ſee this Curioſity which indeed, will be very well worth your trrouble, and will undoubtedly give you more ſatisfaction, than any thing that you ſaw before.</hi> 
               <q>I went therefore, to fetch in the Ladys, and having taken the Dutcheſs <hi>de Chevreuſe</hi> by the Hand, to lead her into a very fair and ſpacious Room, which was juſt by; the reſt of the Ladys follow'd us thither. No ſooner were we all enter'd the Room, but the Abbor, having drawn a Curtain, and open'd certain Windows; we look'd into a great Plain, which extended it ſelf beyond our Sight, and which appear'd to us, to be one of the beſt and faireſt Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skips in the World.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Sir, <hi>ſaid the Abbot to me,</hi> do you ſee that Country-man and young Country-damſel
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:109100:155"/>
there in the Meadows, I will make 'em come hither in an inſtant, in the ſame moment that I give the Word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, they ſhall come and preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this Looking-glaſs.</q> This was an extraordinary fine <hi>Venice-</hi>glaſs, of about ſix Foot high, cover'd with a green Curtain; the Ladys, who ſuſpected ſome trick or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, began to laugh, but at the ſame time, gave the Abbot to underſtand, that they were very impatient to ſee the iſſue of it, becauſe the Peaſant and the Damſel were at above a Mile's diſtance from us: The Abbot, to ſatisfie the curioſity of the Ladys, who were very eager, took a Speaking Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet (the Invention of Sir <hi>Samuel Moreland,</hi> an Engliſh Knight) and pronounc'd theſe Words; <hi>You young Damſel, pull off your ſhoes, and come hither.</hi> The Damſel obey'd imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and at that very inſtant, appear'd in the Looking-glaſs. For the Abbot, having drawn away the Curtain, which cover'd the Glaſs, and told the Ladys, that they ſhou'd take notice of what they ſaw; they were very much ſurpris'd to ſee the ſame Damſel ſtark Naked in the Glaſs, which made 'em put their hands before their Eyes, tho' at the ſame time, they laugh'd as heartily as they cou'd. <q>Sir, <hi>ſaid they,</hi> we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of this, it being more than we are able to comprehend; and we know our
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:109100:156"/>
ſhapes well enough before hand, without your Inchanting Looking-glaſs. Lady's <hi>anſwer'd the Abbot,</hi> this is not all, I have another diverſion for you, before we part.</q> 
               <hi>You Damſel,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>put on your Cloaths, and go from whence you come.</hi> This being done, he again took his Speaking Trumpet, and having call'd the Peaſant, he immediately appear'd in the Looking-glaſs in the like manner, without any thing to cover his Nakedneſs; at this Spectacle, the Ladys with bluſhes in their Cheecks, run quite to the other end of the Room, tho' they cou'd not forbear laughing at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>
               <q>For my part, <hi>ſaid the Duke</hi> du Maine, I did all that lay in my Power, to make the Ladys return to the Looking-glaſs, but cou'd not prevail upon 'em. At laſt having diverted our ſelves with theſe ſeveral ſorts of moſt ſurpriſing Adventures; the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot commanded the Peaſant to take his Cloaths, and be gone immediately, which he did in an inſtant, and flew away from our Eyes like Lightning.</q> 
               <hi>Good faith! Sir,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>you are more skilful than all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians put together; I wiſh I cou'd learn your Art, the better to divert ſome Ladys at Court, who ſometimes give me the Honour of a Viſit.</hi> 
               <q>Thus Ladys, <hi>continu'd the Prince,</hi> I have given you a very diverting Story; which, methinks, ſhou'd pleaſe you all, and if you
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:109100:156"/>
will vouchſafe to take my advice, I wou'd have every one of you get you ſuch a Looking-glaſs in your Chamber, in which you may be able to take a full view of your Beauty, and of thoſe Charms that make Men to be ſuch Fools, as to run after you, and which you are always ſo careful to hide from our ſight.</q> 
               <hi>Sir,</hi> anſwer'd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Tilladet, if ſuch ſort of Pictures were expos'd to publick view, they wou'd appear fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to you; it is more ſafe to have 'em only in your imagination. Nothing is more in eſteem among us, than what is conceal'd from us, and it is perhaps that which makes Love reliſh ſo well, and draws that reſpect from you, which you pay to the fair Sex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Supper-time being come, the Company broke up, leaving the Marſhal <hi>de Bouffiers</hi> and <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont</hi> by themſelves, who ſpent the reſt of the time in Amourous, Careſſes; for <hi>Monſieur Boufflers</hi> did not part with his Miſtreſs till pretty late at Night, when he went home to Bed; but his Head being diſturb'd with Amorous Fancies, he was not able to reſt all the Night, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he flatter'd himſelf that in time, his Miſtreſſ's Heart wou'd be mollifi'd, who hitherto look'd but coldly upon him, yet ſo as to treat him Honourably and Civilly. <hi>I want ſomething elſe beſides Complements,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>this not being that which can make me happy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:109100:157"/>
Thus he tormented himſelf Day and Night, which made him appear in a very Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and Languiſhing condition, his Countenance being quite alter'd, ſo as to be ſcarce like himſelf; which at laſt turn'd to his Advantage; for <hi>Mademoiſelle de Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> having taken particular notice of it, begun to Commiſerate his Condition, and one time when he complain'd to her of his Sufferings; <hi>Truly Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I am mov'd with Compaſſion for you, and I begin to hear ſome ſhare in your Trouble.</hi> She ſpoke theſe words with ſo ſweet and ſo charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Air, that the Marſhal did now no longer queſtion, but that he was belov'd by her. <hi>Monſieur de Boufflers</hi> having receiv'd this aſſurance, manag'd his Affairs with ſo much dexterity, that he at laſt overcame the rigor of his fair Miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>The news being ſoon ſpread abroad, that he was upon the point of being Marry'd, every one came to Complement our two Lovers, and the King himſelf, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the News from Madam <hi>Maintenon</hi>'s own Mouth, ſpoke to our General, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Match, in very obliging Terms; which prov'd a means to engage his Miſtreſs more ſtrictly to him than before. They ſpent their whole time in nothing but Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, going abroad, Balls, Plays; and ſuch like diverſions, which made a great noiſe
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:109100:157"/>
about the Town, being all perform'd with a great deal of Magnificence; ſo that this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt coſt our General not only a great deal of Trouble, but alſo good ſtore of Mony. In the mean time, in regard that he was of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hot Conſtitution, and that his Miſtreſs was the niceſt Woman in the World, as to the point of granting him the leaſt Favour, beſides that he bore ſo extraordinary a Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to her, as ſcarce to dare to ſteal a Kiſs from her; he reſolv'd (in order to allay a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his natural Heat) to court a pretty young Damſel, whom he had ſeen at <hi>Boulogn,</hi> not far from <hi>Paris,</hi> imagining, that ſince his Match was ſo far advanc'd, ſuch a piece of Gallantry, if it ſhou'd happen to be diſcover'd, cou'd not prove any Obſtacle to it. Conform bly to this Reſolution, he often went to viſit this Damſel, diſguis'd in the Habit of a Country-man, for fear of being known by any one, to his Prejudice.</p>
            <p>One Day, <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to go to the ſame Village, with ſome of her Friends, to ſee a Nurſe who had had the Nurſing of her, when the Marſhal came juſt from viſiting his Country-Miſtreſs; and having been obſerv'd by the Nurſe, <hi>Pray,</hi> Mademoiſelle, ſaid ſhe, <hi>look upon that young Country-Fellow, what a genteel Spark he is; he comes very frequently of late to that Houſe, to ſee a certain young Damſel, the handſomeſt, I
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:109100:158"/>
believe in a hunder'd Miles round.</hi> The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal was ſo near 'em, that they might eaſily diſcern his Face, which made <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont</hi> ſay to one of the Ladies that was with with her; <hi>I vow my Deareſt he is as like the Marſhal</hi> de Boufflers, <hi>as one drop of Water to another.</hi> The Marſhal having heard his Name mention'd by his Miſtreſs, immediately ſcam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd out of the Village, to an adjacent Wood, where he chang'd his Country-Habit, for his own Cloaths, which he had left there before, with one of his Servants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont,</hi> being curious without any further deſign, having not the leaſt ſuſpicion that it was the General, whom ſhe had ſeen come out, wou'd needs go to ſee this fair Country-damſel; and was extremely taken with her charming Beauty. Her Nurſe told her, that ſhe was natural Daughter of the Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> by whom her Mother, who was as Beautiful as the Daughter, had had two or three Children; and as to the Country-man, who came to Viſit her, no body cou'd tell who he was, but that he was generally believ'd to be ſome Perſon of Quality under a diſguiſe. <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont,</hi> making no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reflections upon the matter, only told the Nurſe, <hi>That ſhe cou'd not imagine who he ſhou'd be, but that he reſembl'd as much as one Brother does another, the Perſon ſhe had ſpoke
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:109100:158"/>
of before. O!</hi> reply'd the good Woman, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing her, <hi>I have heard it talk'd of among us, that you are going to be Marry'd to that</hi> Monſieur Boufflers, <hi>who makes ſo much noiſe in the World. Indeed it is much diſcours'd of,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>my Friends are buſie in making up the Match: if it comes to a concluſion, you ſhall be at the Wedding. That is evident of it ſelf,</hi> anſwer'd ſhe, <hi>What? a Child, that I have ſo carefully Nurs'd, ſhou'd ſhe not let me have a ſhare in that merry day? Alas! if your dear Father, the late Marſhal</hi> de Grammont, <hi>God bleſs his Soul, had been alive, I ſhou'd have ſat at the upper end of the Table; Ay marry ſhou'd I, becauſe he had promis'd it me a great while ago. Don't trouble thy ſelf upon that account,</hi> Foncette, reply'd <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont,</hi> taking her by the hand, <hi>thou ſhalt certainly be there, tho' not juſt at the upper end of the Table, for thou know'ſt that that belongs to the Miſtreſs of the Feaſt; all my Kindred have a kindneſs for thee for my ſake.</hi> When ſhe had ſpoke theſe words, ſhe put a Piece of Gold in her Hand, and ſo went in her Coach with her Companions, and an Aunt of hers, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly taking their way to <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Marſhal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> who had watch'd their coming back upon the road, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſting 'em on foot with one Servant only, they deſir'd him to come into their Coach; <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont,</hi> having ask'd him, <hi>what cou'd induce him to take ſo long a walk? I
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:109100:159"/>
do not very well know,</hi> Mademoiſelle, ſaid he, rubbing his Forehead, and looking upon her with a paſſionate Eye, <hi>thoſe Commotions which Love has rais'd in my Heart, have ſuch ſtrange Influences over my Spirit, that I think the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Deſerts and frightful Foreſts, the most ſuitable to my Humour.</hi> The Ladies, who were preſent, did not in the leaſt queſtion but that this Complement was addreſs'd to <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont,</hi> who, at this time, had the leaſt ſhare in it; his Mind being at that inſtant, taken up with the Beauty of his Country-damſel, whom nevertheleſs, he was fain to abandon at leaſt for ſome time, for fear of ſpoiling the whole Buſineſs, if the Hony-Pot ſhou'd be diſcover'd: In the mean while finding, that by the overflowing Heat of his Love, he had ſpoil'd the Country-dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel's Shape, he thought it moſt convenient to provide her a Husband, before it was too late; and having found out a Water-man of his Acquaintance belonging to the River <hi>Seine,</hi> he gave him 20 or 30 Piſtoles, as a Portion with his Wife, to make him ſome amends for his Horn-work, which he afterwards took care to make a regular Fortification, by add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral new Baſtions and Half-moons in the Front of the Place.</p>
            <p>Some Weeks after, <hi>Mademoiſelle de Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> who had not yet forgot the beautiful Country-damſel ſhe had ſeen at <hi>Boulogn,</hi> talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:109100:159"/>
of the Gallantries of the Count <hi>de Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> whoſe Miſtreſs this young Woman's Mother had been, told the Marſhal, <hi>that ſhe had ſeen there, a certain Man as like him as cou'd be in all reſpects, except in his Cloaths, which were very ordinary.</hi> The Marſhal, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is not very ſhamefac'd, bluſh'd at theſe words; his Heart accuſing him of Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the common vice of Men, and our fair Lady having obſerv'd his Colour to go and come, <hi>Ha!</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>one while a Fluſh appears in your Face, and anon you grow pale again. Sir, ſurely you have had a finger in the Pye, as the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, and indeed your looks betray your Guilt. And what Guilt pray, Mademoiſelle,</hi> reply'd the Marſhal? <hi>No leſs than high Treaſon,</hi> ſaid ſhe with a ſmile; <hi>Poſſibly you have infring'd that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity which you have ſo often ſworn to me you wou'd keep inviolably. Certainly, my moſt char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Creature,</hi> anſwer'd the Marqueſs <hi>de Bouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flers, you are only in jeſt,</hi> and throwing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at her Feet, <hi>is it poſible,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for you to imagine, that any thing in the World, cou'd appear to me more worthy of all my care, and that does better deſerve the entire diſpoſal of my Heart, than you? O! do me more Juſtice, or elſe I ſhall not be able to live any longer. Then I wou'd have you live;</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>altho' poſſibly I might be miſtaken, yet I am willing to believe you the moſt innocent of all Men. Can any thing be parallel'd to my preſent happineſs,</hi> cry'd the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:109100:160"/>
tranſported with Joy; <hi>Since I have met with a Perſon endu'd with ſo much Good Nature and Generoſity, and capable of curing her ſelf ſo ſoon, of the Diſtemper of Miſtruſtfulneſs, which is certainly the greateſt Evil that can befal any one in this World. For either it is requiſite to relye upon a Confident or not, and if one cannot put truſt in a Friend, what ſatisfaction can there be in this Life? You ſay very well, Sir,</hi> reply'd the young Lady, <hi>but you'll allow, that if one loves a Friend, one is very unwilling to loſe him, and that is the true cauſe of Miſtruſtfulneſs. Then you own you love me a little,</hi> ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, looking upon her very tenderly. <hi>At this very Moment my adorable Deity it is, that I can properly call my ſelf happy. And do you queſtion it, Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Mademoiſelle de Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, is it poſſible to marry a Man, without lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him? Indeed that is a thing, I cou'd never do; I ſhou'd not be of the ſame mind, as ſome of our light Houſe-wives are, who Marry a Man meerly to ſerve 'em as a Cloak for their extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies. Your Gallants,</hi> continu'd ſhe, <hi>will find very ſlender entertainment with me. When I am Marry'd my Husband is to be my All in All, and I ſhou'd think my ſelf very happy, if I were ſole Miſtreſs of his Affections. And as I never can love any Man beſides him, whom my Deſtiny has provided for me; ſo he ought not to doubt, but that I ſhall always be entirely at his Devotion. And is it eaſie to be believ'd,</hi> Mademoiſelle,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:109100:160"/>
reply'd <hi>Boufflers, that a Perſon ſo adorable at your ſelf, whoſe ſingular Merits are ſo well known to all the World, and who has been always ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with ſo many Adorers; ſhou'd never as yet have had a kindneſs for any Gentleman before? Sure your Heart muſt needs be made of a very hard ſort of Metal, to have been Proof againſt ſo many Sighs and Tears, as have been ſo laviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſtow'd upon you. Certainly 'tis almoſt paſt belief, conſidering you are ſo Lovely, ſo Engaging and Tranſcendently Beautiful. Nothing is more true than what I have told you, Sir,</hi> reply'd the fair Lady, <hi>and I did not deliver my Mind with ſo much freedom, on purpoſe to be comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by you; but only to let you know, that I ſhall for ever place all my Joy and Felicity in preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Heart entire for him, who has ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now the time of Courtſhip being paſs'd, it was thought convenient to come to the Conſummation of a Match, in which the Court took ſo much concern; and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal was preparing to go to Church with <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont;</hi> which he did one Morning early at ſix a Clock, when they were Marry'd by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> in the Church of <hi>our Lady.</hi> The Ceremony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, and the Marſhal thinking himſelf now at the very point of caſting Anchor in the Port of Felicity, he cou'd not without a great deal of affliction underſtand from
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:109100:161"/>
               <hi>Mademoiſelle de Grammont,</hi> that ſhe was not at preſent in a condition to go to Bed with him, being diſturb'd at that time, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Infirmity incident to all young Women once a Month: The Marſhal wou'd have made a Jeſt of it, but his Lady being poſitive in her Reſolution, he was ſo Complaiſant, as to languiſh three Days longer. The next Day after the Wedding, a great number of Perſons of Quality, who were invited to a ſumptuous Feaſt and Ball, that was to be that Evening; came to Congratulate our Marſhal for the happy Minutes he had enjoy'd the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with his Spouſe; whom they look'd upon as a Perſon ſo full of Charms, as to be capable of giving all poſſible ſatisfaction, as to what Men can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine moſt delicious in Love; But he, who had not as yet taſted of the Sweat-meat, receiv'd their Complements with ſo much coldneſs and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, that the whole Company was much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd at it. The Count <hi>de Montal</hi> at laſt, unto whom the Marſhal, as to a moſt intimate Friend, had told the buſineſs, unfolded the Riddle to ſome, who made themſelves very merry with it in our General's preſence. The Marriage being at laſt conſummated with a great deal of ſatisfaction on both ſides, they receiv'd for 8 or 10 Weeks ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, the Viſits of moſt Perſons of Quality at Court; and the Marſhal after having reap'd the firſt Fruits of the Matrimonial State, was by vertue of his Majeſties ſpecial Command, oblig'd to go to <hi>Flanders,</hi> not without a moſt ſenſible regret of being forc'd ſo ſoon to quit his adorable Spouſe.</p>
