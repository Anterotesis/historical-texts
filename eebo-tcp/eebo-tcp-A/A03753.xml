            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

grasse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:18733:4"/>
In the handling of which words, wee shall
first passe through those considerations that are
most obuious, and neerest hand; as first, the
various acceptations of this word <hi>Caro, Flesh,</hi>
in Scripture, and which of them wee are to
pitch vpon here; then the extent, the latitude
of it in that acceptation, and that is carried
here as farre as any terme, any expression can
doe it, for it is <hi>Omnis Caro,</hi> All flesh; Lastly the
condition, the nature of flesh in this latitude,
in this vniuersalitie, and that is set downe by a
similitude, a comparison, and the thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it is likened, wherto it is compared is, <hi>Grasse,
Omnis Caro vt foenum,</hi> All flesh is as grasse.
And when these particulars haue passed our
discussion, wee will then fall vpon those resul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances,
those emergent and collaterall conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
wherein the text and the time shall best
agree.</p>
            <p>To begin then; This word <hi>Caro,</hi> flesh, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly
taken in Scripture. Amongst other
things which the Prophet Dauid <hi>ascribes</hi> vnto
God by way of praise, Psal. 136. One is that he
doth, <hi>Dare escam omni carni,</hi> hee giueth food
to all flesh; there, flesh is taken for euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that hath life. In the 29. of Gen. <hi>Laban</hi>
sayes to <hi>Iacob, Os meum es, &amp; caro mea,</hi> Surely
thou art my bone and my flesh; there flesh is
taken for consanguinitie and kindred. Among
other articles of the Creed, wee beleeue <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the resurrection of the flesh: there, flesh
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18733:5"/>
is taken for the body of man. In the 7. to the
<hi>Rom.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, <hi>I know that in me, that is,
in my flesh, that is, in my soule, as farre as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
vnto, and is guided by the flesh, I know
there dwels no good:</hi> there flesh is taken for the
soule of man. In the 6. of <hi>Gen.</hi> God saw that
<hi>Omnis caro,</hi> all flesh had corrupted their wayes;
there flesh is taken for those that had forsaken
God. In the 2. of <hi>Ioel,</hi> God sayes, I will powre
out my Spirit <hi>super omnem carnem,</hi> vpon all
flesh; there flesh is taken for those that should
be called to the knowledge of God. Many
other significations it hath; sometimes it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for the people of the Iewes; sometimes for
the ceremonies of the old law; sometimes for
the corruption of nature, sometimes for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
of nature; and many times in a larger
capacity it comprehends all men, and so it is
taken here, <hi>Omnis caro,</hi> All flesh, that is, all
men are as Grasse.</p>
            <p>Now if you aske me the reason why men in
Scripture are called by the name of flesh, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the reason of gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer, that the part is here
siguratiuely taken for the whole) <hi>St. Chrysostome</hi>
renders it thus:chrys. Because (saith he) they are so
wholy giuen ouer to the workes and lusts of
the flesh, <hi>ac si sola carne circundati, carerent
anima:</hi> As if they were nothing else but a
masse, a lumpe of flesh, that had no soule to
quicken it, no reason to guide it at all.</p>
            <p>But yet we must take heede that we stretch
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18733:5"/>
not this reason of <hi>St. Chrysostome</hi> too farre.
For though it be true in most men, yet it is not
true in all: God forbid that all men should be
so fleshly. Greg. And therefore <hi>St. Gregorie</hi> thought
fit to correct and to limit it by a distinction,
<hi>In sacro eloquio aliter dicitur caro iuxta naturam,
aliter iuxta culpam vel corruptionem,</hi> (saith he)
The sinne, the corruption of flesh, is one thing:
and the nature, the constitution of flesh, is
another thing: these are two different conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and the Scripture takes them so: And
therefore where it is taken in the first sense,
there <hi>St. Chrysostomes</hi> reason is good, but not
otherwise, for it holds not heere; since it is only
the nature, the constitution of flesh that is
aym'd at in this place, &amp; in that sense it growes
to an vniuersality, which is the second thing we
obserue, <hi>Omnis caro,</hi> All flesh is as grasse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All flesh:</hi> That flesh which is but coursely
fed, with any thing that comes next hand: and
that flesh which eates nothing but what is farre
fetcht and deerely bought. That flesh which is
clothed in ragges, or perchance not so well;
and that flesh which weares only what is rak't
out of the intrails of beasts, and out of the
bowels of the earth, and out of the bottome of
the Sea. That flesh which is so macerated with
fasting, that the skinne is ready to cleaue to the
bones, much like a walking Anatomy: and that
flesh which is so pampered and blowne vp by
riot and excesse, that the skinne can scarce
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18733:6"/>
hold it. That flesh wherein is lodged and cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered
vp as much learning, as much wisedome,
as makes a man a walking Library: and that
flesh which entertaines nothing but ignorance
and folly. That flesh which is painted and
trimmed vp as <hi>Iezabells</hi> was; and that flesh
which is <hi>squallida &amp; fletibus siccata,</hi> neglected,
and squallid, and dried vp with teares;<note place="margin">Hierom.</note> as St.
<hi>Hierome</hi> writes of that vertuous Lady <hi>Paula.</hi>
That flesh which is smoothly playsterd on; and
that flesh which is but rough-cast. The face
that is so amorous and so angelicall, that it
rauisheth a beholder; and the face that is so ill-fauoured,
so <hi>Ther sites</hi>-like, that it may well
serue for a skarre-crowe in a garden of Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
The body that is so eleganly contriu'd, so
methodically layd together, with such an eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxy
of proportion, such a concinnity, such a
harmony of limbes and members, as if nature
meant to make it her master-piece; and the
body that is so mishapen, so discomposed, as if
nature had shuffled it vp in hast, or made it in
the darke. The man that is so transported with
the conceit of his riches or his honour, that
he is ready vpon euery occasion to swagger in
St. <hi>Bernards</hi> termes, <hi>Quis ille, vel ille, aut quae
domus patris eorum?</hi> What is this fellow, or
that base fellow, and what is the house of their
father that they should affront me? And the
man that glories only in his infirmities, and
accounts all but drosse and dung in respect of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18733:6"/>
Christ crucified, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did: <hi>Omnis caro,</hi>
all faces, all bodyes, all men, all flesh is but as
grasse.</p>
            <p>Yea but <hi>Omnis caro non eadem caro.</hi> (sayth <hi>St.
Paul</hi>) all flesh is not the same flesh, there is one
manner of flesh of Men, and another of Beasts,
and another of Byrdes, and another of Fishes.
It is true: but yet marke the distinction that
<hi>Tertullian</hi> giues here:<note place="margin">Tertull.</note> All flesh is not the same
flesh, in equality of prerogatiue; but, all flesh is
the same flesh, in community of nature. It is
<hi>differentia honoris,</hi> not <hi>differentia generis,</hi> (as
he sayes there) a difference of honour, not of
kind that <hi>St. Paul</hi> puts betweene them. Now
then, make an Allegory of it; vnderstand by
men, those that are the best of men, those that
liue as men should doe, that is, religious and
exemplar Christians; Vnderstand by beastes,
men of a carnall and a bestiall conuersation;
by byrdes, contemplatiue men, that soare vp
aloft to hidden and heauenly things; by fishes,
men that are satisfied only with a baptismall
aspersion, non-proficients in Christianity, that
stand at the Font still, and are gone no further
then their God-fathers first brought them: and
then, though in regard of personall and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
qualities it may be true in this figuratiue,
this Allegoricall sense too, <hi>Omnis caro non
eadem,</hi> all flesh is not the same flesh; though
there be a great difference betweene the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
and affections and inclinations of men,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18733:7"/>
yet notwithstanding, whatsoeuer their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or their progresse be, they will meete still
in the Center of nature, they are all but flesh,
<hi>&amp; Omnis caro foenum,</hi> and all flesh is as grasse.</p>
            <p>It is obseruable, that the first thing which
euer sprong out of the earth, was grasse; and
the last creature that was made of the earth,
was man. And surely (besides that infinite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in nature) when God at first did put
such a difference betweene the manner of their
creation, <hi>Germinet terra,</hi> let the earth bring
forth grasse, but <hi>faciamus hominem,</hi> let vs make
man our selues, let that be our owne immediate
handy-worke; when he put such a distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the time of their making, (for grasse was
brought forth the third day, and man was
made the sixt day; and he was the last creature
that was made, as being Gods master-piece
here on earth, and the vp-shot and the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
and the complement of all;) when hee
did thus separate these two at the beginning, it
was not likely that there should be, neither did
he intend any such degeneration, any such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
in nature, that they should euer meete
togeither in termes of comparison. Yet, see the
confusion that sinne hath brought in: Man
that was so glorious a creature at the first, is
now falne so farre, and growne so meane, so
vile, that grasse and he are growne to a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance,
to an affinity, &amp; they are both weighed
heere, one against another in the ballance, this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18733:7"/>
text, <hi>Omnis caro vt foenum,</hi> All flesh is as
grasse.</p>
            <p>As grasse, in diuers respects: 1. grasse is light;
and so is man. Sometimes a winde of doctrine,
some new-fangled opinion, blowes him out of
the faith. Sometimes a winde of preferment,
an ambition of honour blowes him out of the
society of his friends. Sometimes a winde
of persecution blowes him out of the Church.
Euery little blast of distemper makes him
droope and hang towards the earth; but the
impetuous gust of a violent disease blowes him
quite out of the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, grasse is short; and so is the life of
man too. The Scripture, at longest, makes it
but a spanne; and yet this spanne is continually
cut off by inch-meales too. Sometimes it is
cut off an inch aboue, when a Father or a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dyes; and sometimes it is cut off an inch
belowe, when a Sonne or a Daughter is taken
away: and sometimes it is cut off quite in the
middle, when a wife is parted from her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baud,
or a husband from his wife; death is still
nibling at it, euery day, euery houre, till at
length it hath eaten it so low, so neere the
ground, that there is nothing left.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, grasse is brittle, apt to be bruised
with the least touch; so is man likewise: So
thinne, and so slight, and so weake of constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
such brittle ware, that it falles to peeces
many times, euen by the least mischance. The
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18733:8"/>
light of the knowledge of Gods glory in the
face of Christ Iesus, is the greatest, the richest
treasure that we can enioy heere; and yet when
we haue it, <hi>Habemus thesaurum hunc in vasis
fictilibus,</hi> saith <hi>St. Paul,</hi> we haue this treasure
but in earthen vessels, and such vessels, you
know, are quickly broken. A pinne, or a fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,
or a crumme, or a haire, these are but
poore and weake, and despicable things: and
yet historie tels vs that men haue lost their
liues, euen by these. It is strange, you will
thinke, they should doe so; and yet I shall tell
you that which is more strange then this too.
<hi>Chilon</hi> the Spartan, when his sonne returned
home a conquerour from the Olympian games,
dyed, <hi>prae gaudio,</hi> meerely for ioy. When <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi>
the Athenian had a crowne of gold set
vpon his head, he died <hi>prae gloria,</hi> only with
the conceite of that glory. <hi>Plato</hi> died in a
dreame; and <hi>Crassus</hi> died in a laughter; and
<hi>Tertullian</hi> reports all this too. So tender a piece
is the body of man, so fraile, and so feeble, and
so brittle is his constitution.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, grasse is subiect to beasts, they
may eat it vp and tread it downe: so are men
too, for whilst they are as tenacious of wrongs
as a Cammell, as lustfull as goates, as deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and craftie as Foxes, whilst they licke vp
the dust of the earth by couetousnesse, with
the Serpent, &amp; foame with anger like a Boare,
and are readie to deuour one another by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18733:8"/>
like Wolues; they make themselues a
prey to these beasts, that is, to these base and
beastiall affections, which trample vpon, and
tread down their soules to the nethermost hell.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, grasse is subiect to Mowers, they may
cut it downe when they please; so are men too,
if you consider them in respect of a ciuill and
temporall estate; so, the Potentates, the great
ones of this world they are mowers, inferiour
people are as grasse: if there bee any that stand
in their way, and ouershadow their steps ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so little, that thriue and grow vp faster then
they would haue them, they haue their sithes
readie, oppression and policie and supplantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to cut them downe. If otherwise you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
them in respect of a vitall subsistence, a
naturall being, which is the consideration that
wee are to stop vpon here; so there is one that
hath beene a mowing euer since the beginning
of the world to this present, that is, Death;
and yet there is a repullulation of grasse, a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of men euery day: and where he is the
mower, there great men, and meane men, and
all men, <hi>Omnis caro,</hi> All flesh is as grasse. Hee
that comes to mowe downe a field, doth not
spare and passe by the flowers that are in it, but
cuts downe all, perchance a Cowslip, or a
Primerose, or a hony-suckle, as soone as other
ordinarie grasse. Though we ascribe so much
to the nobles and great ones of this world, as
to account them the flowers of the field, the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18733:9"/>
glory of a people; yet when death comes with
his sithe, he doth not passe by them, and suffer
them to stand and to flourish still, whilst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are cut downe and fade away; but hee
takes all before him, flowers and grasse, Prince
and people, rich and poore, without any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
or distinction at all. A mower doth not
passe by an herbe, though happily it bee very
wholesome and medicinable, but cuts downe
that too, as well as the weed that is good for
nothing. Though men in the generall are said
to be as grasse, yet some men are as wholsome
and soueraigne, and medicinable herbes, there
is much vertue in them. There is vertue in a
good States-man to cure the maladies, and to
ease the grieuances of a Common-wealth.
There is vertue in an honest Lawyer, to support
and to strengthen a weake and a feeble, and a
crazie estate. There is vertue in a good physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
to recouer and restore to health an indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
and a languishing body. There is vertue
in a learned Diuine to binde vp a broken heart,
and to heale the woundes of a distressed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
these are wholsome herbes indeed;
happy is that land wherein they grow: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
Death will not spare these nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but cuts them downe too, as well as the
weedes, as well as debosh'd and idle and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
people, that are not only not vsefull, but
very hurtfull and combersome to a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:18733:9"/>
Thus haue you a Catalogue, and an Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of mans infirmities: so light is he, and so
vnsettled in his course; so short in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
so brittle of constitution; so subiect to
vile and bestiall affections, and so apt to bee
mowen downe by the hand of death, that
<hi>St. Peter</hi> did rightly cast it vp, when hee made
the summe of all to be but grasse, <hi>Omnis caro
vt foenum,</hi> All flesh is as grasse.</p>
            <p>Now, if the weaknesse, the frailtie of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature be such, that flesh is but as grasse;
if this weakenes, this frailtie be so vniuersall, so
vnlimitable, that there is no exemption, no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie
from it, <hi>quia omnis caro,</hi> for all flesh is
as grasse; Surely then <hi>amor corporis ebrietas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimae,</hi>
as <hi>St. Chrysostome</hi> calls it,<note place="margin">Chrys.</note> the loue of the
body is the drunkennesse of the soule; nay, <hi>St.
Bernard</hi> giues it a higher terme,<note place="margin">Bern.</note> and saies, that
it is <hi>Spiritualis phrenesis,</hi> A spirituall kinde of
Lunacie: they are drunke and madde indeed,
<hi>Qui sic intendunt tabernaculo suo ac si nunquam
esset casurum,</hi> (as he speakes) that are so curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
so busie about the tabernacle of the body
as if they thought it should neuer fall; so fond
and so tender, and so carefull ouer their flesh, as
if it should neuer see corruption. But it is a
lamentable complaint that <hi>St. Austin</hi> makes
here; <hi>Quid meruit anima?</hi> whilst the flesh is
thus magnified, and so much made of, that all
the store-houses of nature are ransackt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted
to serue those two vnthrifts, the backe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18733:10"/>
and the belly; <hi>quid meruit anima?</hi> What hath
the poore soule deseru'd all this while, that
men should be so carelesse of her, as that she is
all naked and readie to starue, whilst they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
not for her any one drop of the comfort
of the Spirit, any little ragge of righteousnesse
to hang vpon her? <hi>Quid meruit anima?</hi> How
hath the soule deseru'd so ill, that shee should
be thus neglected, for whom Christ died; and
<hi>quid meruit caro?</hi> How hath the flesh deseru'd
so well, that it should be thus cocker'd &amp; pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd
vp, since it is but grasse? <hi>Omnis Caro
vt foenum,</hi> All flesh is as grasse.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding, as in those particulars
which we specified before, flesh was compared
to grasse in respect of its weakenes and morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie;
so there is yet a further analogie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and a resemblance betweene these two,
that makes not a little for its grace and for its
glory. Though grasse be eaten vp or cut downe
neuer so lowe, yet there is a root still left in the
ground, and that root is capable of a repullula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
as soone as the warmth of the Sunne, and
the influence of heauen comes at it, it springs
vp againe, more greene and more liuely then it
was before. So likewise, though happely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
may bring a man to so lowe an ebbe
and declination of fortune, as to leuell him
with the ground; though death bring him yet
lower, and lay him in his graue; yea, though
his race, and his name, and his memory perish
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18733:10"/>
among the liuing, as if he had neuer beene; yet
there is a root still left in the earth, the body
that sleepes in the dust, and that body is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of a resurrection: as soone as the Spring of
Iudgement shall begin to aduance, and that
glorious Sunne of righteousnesse to appeare
and shine in his strength; <hi>Surget caro, &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem 
omnis, &amp; quidem ipsa, &amp; quidem integra,</hi>
(as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaketh) flesh shall rise,<note place="margin">Tert.</note> and all
flesh shall rise, and that flesh shall rise which
was buried before, and it shall rise with a full
proportion of feature and perfection of parts
without any diminution at all.</p>
            <p>Though you heape vpon it all the termes of
ignominy and infirmitie that may be deuis'd:
Say that it is <hi>Immunda à primordio,</hi> Vncleane
from the very beginning, as being made of the
slime of the earth; and vncleane in its propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
as being conceiued in sinne: say that it
is <hi>friuola, infirma, criminosa, onerosa, molesta,</hi>
a weake, and a friuolous, and a sinfull, and a
burdenous, and a troublesome thing. Say fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that it is <hi>Caduca in originem terram,</hi> that
it will dissolue againe into that dust of which it
was first made; that it will change the name of a
man into the name of a carcasse, and say that it
falls from that name too, <hi>In omnis iam vocabuli
mortem,</hi> (as <hi>Tertulltan</hi> doth elegantly deliuer
it:) say that it dies so farre to all expression, that
no terme, no name can be found for it; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all this waight of Rethoricke, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18733:11"/>
of infirmitie cannot keepe it downe, or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
one haire, one atome of it, but it will rise
againe, <hi>Quia in deposito est apud Deum;</hi> God
himselfe hath taken it into his tuition, his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodie,
<hi>Et quis eripiet?</hi> And who shall take it
out of his hands? And surely it is a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that <hi>Tertullian</hi> giues for it,<note place="margin">Tertull.</note> because (saith
he) it stands in better congruitie with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and maiestie of God, to restore to a being
that which he once reiected, then vtterly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
that which himselfe once made, and liked
well too. <hi>Et sic caro foenum,</hi> in this respect also
flesh is as grasse, it will spring and rise vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and this makes for its glory.</p>
            <p>Yet this is not all its glory neither. 'Tis true,
that in the 6. of Gen. God saies, My Spirit shall
not alwaies striue with man, <hi>quia Caro,</hi> because
he is but flesh; there indeed flesh is branded
with infirmitie. But in the 2. of <hi>Ioel,</hi> God sayes
that he would poure out his Spirit, <hi>Super om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
carnem,</hi> Vpon all flesh; there flesh is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanc'd
to a great deale of glory. <hi>St. Paul</hi> sayes,
that <hi>in carne,</hi> in his flesh there dwelt no good;
this was <hi>St. Pauls</hi> infirmitie: But <hi>Iob</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
that <hi>in carne,</hi> in his flesh he should see
God, and this was <hi>Iobs</hi> glory. <hi>St. Peter</hi> sayes
here, <hi>Caro foenum,</hi> flesh is as grasse; What
greater infirmitie? and yet <hi>St. Iohn</hi> saies, <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum
caro,</hi> the Word was made flesh; and what
greater glory?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>St. Austine</hi> Aug. hath a passage to this purpose
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18733:11"/>
too; Let no man thinke (saith he) that God
doth not regard the sinnes of the flesh: For,
know ye not (saith the Apostle) that ye are
the Temple of God? If therefore you sinne,
you defile Gods Temple. Yea but <hi>dicit aliquis,</hi>
haply some wicked man will say, it is my soule
that is Gods Temple, not my body; that's no
fit place for him to dwell in, <hi>&amp; adijcit testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi>
perchance hee brings this testimony to
confirme it, <hi>Omnis caro vt foenum,</hi> all flesh is
as grasse. <hi>Infelix interpretatio, punienda cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio,</hi>
(sayth the good Father:) this is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
exposition, a damnable imagination. For
flesh is therefore called grasse, <hi>quia moritur,</hi>
because it fades, it dyes; but <hi>Quod ad tempus
moritur, vide vt non resurgat cum crimine,</hi> take
heede, that that which dyes for a time, but for
a time, take heede that it rise not againe laden
with sinne: For the same Apostle sayes else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
that our bodyes also are the Temples of
God; and therefore <hi>vide quid agas de Templo
Dei,</hi> take heede how thou vsest thy body, thy
flesh, for it is Gods Temple. Now then, <hi>Caro
Dei Templum,</hi> that flesh should be so highly
aduanced as to be call'd Gods Temple; this is
mans excellency and this is his glory: but <hi>Caro
foenum,</hi> that flesh, notwithstanding all this,
should be as grasse, this is mans infirmity and
this is his frailty. And this infirmity, this
frailty Christ himselfe could not take from our
nature, though he tooke our nature vpon him.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18733:12"/>
               <hi>Verbum Caro,</hi> the Word was made flesh; &amp; yet
<hi>Caro foenum,</hi> that flesh also was as grasse, hee
dyed too.</p>
            <p>So that the summe, &amp; the resultance; and the
harmony of this text is briefely this; that as in
diuers other places of Scripture, so heere also,
grasse is set downe as an embleme and an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eroglyphique
of mans mortality, which is the
Center, wherein all those lines that wee drew
before, haue their concurrence and period.</p>
            <p>Now, though the very Heathen themselues
haue declaim'd so largely &amp; so elegantly vpon
this theame, that we may digge siluer enough
out of their Mines, learning enough out of
their bookes to make vs rich in this knowledge,
that we must die: yet notwithstanding if wee
desire to find out that fine Gold of sauing
knowledge, to make such vses of our mortality,
as may conduce to our saluation, wee must
seeke for that elsewhere, wee must digge for
that in another Mine, that is, the Scripture.
Euery Poet &amp; euery Philosopher can tel vs that
our life is a moment, but that it is <hi>momentum
tanti momenti vt ab eo pendeat aeternitas,</hi> a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of so great moment, as that therevpon
depends happines or misery, ioy or sorrow
that shalbe as endles as eternity it selfe, this is
more then they can tell vs; and this wee learne
out of the Scripture. When they had trauelled
ouer all that Microcosme, that little world,
Man, and curiously obserued all that was in it;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18733:12"/>
when they had made an exquisite suruay, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
description of euery Country, euery
climate; his generation and his natiuity,
and his infancy, and his child-hood, and
his adolescency, and his mans estate, and his
middle age, and his old age; when they had
passed ouer all these; yet when they came once
to that same <hi>Mare mortuum,</hi> that dead Sea,
the graue, there they sate them downe, and set
vp a pillar, as <hi>Hercules</hi> did, &amp; they wrote vpon
it <hi>Nil vltra:</hi> Further they could not goe, for
they thought there was no further being. But
Christianity hath taught vs that there is <hi>Plus
vltra;</hi> wee haue discouered another world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this, and a farre greater then this, whereof
this earth is but the Center. Wee know that
the graue is <hi>Diuersorium non domicilium,</hi> it is
but an Inne wherein the flesh must soiourne
for the while, not the house wherein it must
dwel for euer. The Scripture sayes that the dead
doe sleepe in the dust: If so, then the graue is
a bed: wee know that we shall lie in this bed
but one night, but a <hi>St. Lucies</hi> night; and when
that great and glorious day of Iudgement shall
once beginne to dawne, we know that then we
must lie there no longer.</p>
            <p>Now, in this abundance and plenty of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
what remaines but that we commit it to
the good <hi>Ioseph</hi> of the land, the memory; that
if haply there doe fall out a famine of grace in
the soule, she may find whereby to sustaine her
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18733:13"/>
selfe. <hi>Memorare nouissima,</hi> (sayth the Sonne
of <hi>Syrach</hi>) Remember thy end, and thou shalt
be sure not to doe amisse.</p>
            <p>Hee that will guide a Ship well, must put
himselfe into the hinmost part of it, the Sterne;
so likewise he that will shape the course of his
life aright according to the carde &amp; compasse
of Faith and Hope, that finally he may arriue
at the land of liuing, must conuey himselfe to
the hindmost part of his life, by a continuall
meditation of Death.</p>
            <p>That great tempest mentioned in the Gospel,
wherein the disciples were like to be cast away,
it rose (as the text sayes there) while Christ
was asleepe in <hi>Puppi,</hi> in the hinmost part of
the Sip: so likewise the tempests of Gods iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and the stormes of the Deuils temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
wherein many a soule doth suffer Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke,
they rise whilest we sleepe too in <hi>Puppi:</hi>
in the hinmost part of the Ship, the latter end
of our life; whilst we are secure and carelesse, &amp;
thinke not of Death. Tis true, there is no man
so brutish, as to thinke that hee shall neuer die;
but yet, alas! how many are there so Godlesse,
that they neuer thinke they shal die? So strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doth the Deuill blinde their eyes, that they
may not see that ditch, that deepe infernall
ditch, into the which he leades them.</p>
            <p>But as Christ in the Gospell restored that
blind man to sight by applying to his eyes a
playster of spittle clay, so must we doe in this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18733:13"/>
case too; we must take spittle, that is, the teares
of repentance, and clay, that is, the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our owne frailty, and temper these two
well together, and apply them to the eyes of
our Soule; and then we shall easily discouer any
danger that is before vs, and preuent it too.
<hi>Pliny</hi> writes of Bees, that when they swarme
and fly vp into the ayre, if you doe but cast a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
dust amongst them, they will quickly come
downe. When vaineglorious, and ambitious
and aspiring thoughts doe swarme in our
hearts, let vs learne to doe so too: That is, to
intermingle them with the meditation of that
dust into which we must one day be dissolued;
and then they will soone fall from that pitch to
humility and mortification. I haue heard, that
it is a present remedy to asswage a swelling in
the body, if you rubbe it with a dead mans
hand: when there riseth vp any tumor of pride
in thy heart, doe thou so too; rubbe and chase
it well with this consideration, that <hi>Caro foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
Flesh is but as grasse; that the body which
thou dost so much tender and value at so high
a rate, shall at length become a liuelesse, and a
stinking carkas; and surely thy proud heart
will quickly downe: So vsefull and so operatiue
and so soueraigne is the meditation of our
mortality, that as <hi>Dauid</hi> s<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yet notwithstanding how little doe the

you by a homely comparison, I confesse, and
yet sutable enough to the disposition of most
men. When a Hogge is kill'd; it is an vsuall
thing for the rest of the Hogges to runne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

againe. So likewise when a neighbour dyes, it
is a common custome for people to flocke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his Corse, &amp; to follow it to the Church,
and perchance some lamentation is made, some
good thoughts are entertain'd for the time;
but when the solemnity is once ouer, they all
part, and returne euery one to his owne home,
to his old sinne againe, as if there had bin no
such matter. But I hope better things of you,
who haue at this time, not only a text and a
precept to put you in minde of your mortality,
but an instance also and an example, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of a worthy Gentleman; vnto whose
memory we doe now offer vp this last act and
sacrifice of our loue: In which loue I hold
my selfe to be so farre interessed, that I cannot
but ascribe vnto him those termes and titles
of worth, which all you doe know better
then my selfe, to be but his due. As he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
of an ancient and worthy family, so
did he entertaine those dispositions and those
affections, whereunto men of such a race doe
commonly encline: so humble hee was and so
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18733:14"/>
affable, and so inoffensiue in his behauiour; so
vpright and so conscientious in his dealings;
so liberall and so bountifull in his hospitality;
so euen and so equall in his temper: but aboue
all, so well deuoted to religion (as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by some speciall euidences) that now
<hi>nomen eius quasi vnguentum effusum,</hi> his name
is like a sweete oyntment powred out, the box
is broken, and the fragrancy of it is dispersed
ouer the wholehouse. And those tokens, those
euidences of his piety were these. 1. He was
quite out of that common fashion which too
too many of his quality are in, that is, hee was
no swearer; he hated it in himselfe, and he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it in others too. 2. Hee was so tender
and so chary ouer the truth, that he could not
abide to heare it toss'd and tumbled vp and
downe in a controuersie, least peraduenture
heate and impatience might doe it wrong.
3. Hee was much and often grieued at the
irregularities and exorbitancies of those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
times; which I take to be, not a probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but a demonstration of an honest and a
Christian heart.</p>
            <p>Touching his sickenes, which is vsually the
abstract and Epitome of the whole volume of
a mans life, what I saw, I will relate.</p>
            <p>As God hath giuen to all things in the
world their seuerall instruments to laud and to
magnifie his name; the heauens haue their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
their light, their influence; the seasons their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18733:15"/>
succession, their vicissitude; the elements their
conducibility to the vse and seruice of man, and
all creatures their sustenance and being; so man
hath his instrument for this purpose too, that
is, his tongue: and this instrument did hee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and tune to the sweetest harmony that can
be vnder heauen, that is, hee prayed. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he made his chamber a Church, <hi>Ego &amp;
domus</hi> (as he spake) he and his family ioyned
together in prayers &amp; supplications vnto God.
Sometimes hee made himselfe a Church: for
wheresoeuer a man gathers together the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and faculties of his soule to pray, there is a
Church and there is a congregation, <hi>Ibi duo
vel tres,</hi> there are two or three, <hi>Et ibi Deiu,</hi>
and there is God in the midst of them. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he prayed in a continued forme, and
sometimes he prayed by Eiaculatious, as the
pauses and intermissions of his agony gaue him
leaue. When his tongue fayl'd him, then his
hands tooke their turne, and by a frequent ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
testified his zeale, and did (as it were)
say Amen to the prayers of those that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him. And when his hands lost their
strength, then his eyes were lifted vp; &amp; surely
<hi>vbi amor ibi oculus,</hi> his eyes were fixed where
his loue was fixed, that is, vpon the Kingdome
of heauen. And when all these failed him, I
doubt not, but the heart, as it is <hi>vltimum mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi>
the last thing that dyed in nature, so was it
in religion likewise; it liued longest, &amp; it prayed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18733:15"/>
longst too. Yet for all this, he was but a man;
his breath was in his nostrells, &amp; his foundation
in the dust. <hi>Et quid de mortali nisi mortale ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectandum,</hi>
What can be look't for at the hands
of a mortall man, but that he must dye?</p>
            <p>Now, though <hi>Dauid</hi> prayed earnestly vnto
God, that he would not take him away in the
midst of his age; yet let no man thinke this
good Gentleman the lesse happie, because hee
was taken away much about that time, for he
was but two yeeres ouer, 37. yeeres old when
he died: doe not thinke him the lesse happy in
this respect; for Christ himselfe died before he
came to the middle of mans age, when he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
two yeeres of it, when he was but 33. yeeres
old: <hi>Et quis Christo beatior?</hi> Who can be more
happy, who can be so happy as Christ is? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet let any say that they haue lost him,
though he be dead: as, I haue lost a louing hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
or I haue lost a louing brother, or I haue
lost a louing friend, or I haue lost a good Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,
or I haue lost a good Master: for though
he were all these, and though this be the vsuall
phrase of the world, yet it is a plaine solecisme
in the language of Christianitie. For why
should we thinke that lost, which God hath?
<hi>Non est amissus sed praemissus,</hi> He is not lost,
but only sent before vs into heauen. And now,
that which lies vpon vs to doe, is, that wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
and striue to follow him thither.</p>
            <p>Which that we may the better doe, first it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18733:16"/>
will easily be granted that we must follow, <hi>Quiae
omnis caro vt foenum,</hi> For all flesh is as grasse.</p>
            <p>Secondly, two places of Scripture there are,
wherewith I shall close vp this exercise, and
which will be, perchance, not vnworthy your
remembrance. The first is that of our Sauiour
in the Gospell, <hi>Facite vobis amicos,</hi> Make you
friends of vnrighteous Mammon, that when
ye die, they may receiue you into euerlasting
habitations: and vpon this text I shall descant
by way of historie. I remember I haue heard of
a certaine man, that had three friends; it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned,
that suite being commenc'd against this
man, he was summoned to appeare before the
Iudge. In which extremity, he did as all men
vse to doe in the like case; that is, hee went to
his friends, for aduice and assistance. When
hee came to the first, his answer was, that hee
would lend him a good cloake to goe before
the Iudge in a decent and a handsome fashion,
and that's all he would doe for him. When he
came to the second, his answer was, that hee
would goe along with him to the Court gate,
and there he would leaue him. But when hee
came to the third, his answer was, that he would
accompany him into the Court, and stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Iudge, and speake for him too. This
man that we speake of is a Christian, and hee
hath three friends too, his wealth, his kindred,
and his good workes. When death arrests
him by some mortall disease to appeare before
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18733:16"/>
the Tribunall seate of Almightie God, if hee
come to his riches, they will lend him a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-sheet,
and that's all they can doe for him.
If he come to his kindred, his acquaintance,
they will attend him to the doore, the graue;
that's all they can doe for him. But when hee
comes to his good workes, they answer, That
they will neuer leaue him, they will goe vp
with him into the Court of heauen, and
plead his cause before almightie God. Happy
is the man that hath store of such friends, for
they will receiue him into euerlasting habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>The second place of Scripture that I would
commend to your memory, is that of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
<hi>Vbicurque ceciderit arbor, ibi erit;</hi> and
vpon this text I shal descant by way of Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
Wheresoeuer the tree falles, there it lies; if
it falles towards the North, then it lies toward
the North; and if it fall towards the South,
then it lies towards the South: but which way
soeuer it falles, there it lies. Now, looke which
way we would haue a tree to fall, it is an vsuall
thing to loppe off the boughes on the contrary
side, that their waight may not carry it that
way; and then when it doth fall, it will fall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our desire. Beloued, euery man is a
tree, his inclinations and affections the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
though hee spread neuer so farre, and
growe vp neuer so high, yet the hand of Death
must one day cut him downe: and he hath but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18733:17"/>
two waies to fall; either toward the cold and
pinching North of damnation; or toward the
warme and comfortable South of saluation:
but wheresoeuer he falles there he lies. If thou
then wouldst faine haue thy tree fall the right
way, be sure that thou begin betimes to cut off
all the luxuriant boughes on the contrary side,
those carnall and rebellious desires, that grow
and weigh towards hell. Cut off that lower
branch of couetousnesse, that doth so houer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
earth; and cut off those middle branches
of lustfull and licentious affections; and cut off
that top branch of ambition and pride; cut off
all on that side: but cherrish those branches on
the other side, good affections, good desires;
and then when this time comes that thou must
fall, their weight will carry thee the right way
towards saluation, towards heauen. Which the
Lord of his infinite mercy grant vnto vs
all, for the all-sufficient Merits of his
only Sonne and our alone Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Christ Iesus: To
whom, &amp;c.</p>
