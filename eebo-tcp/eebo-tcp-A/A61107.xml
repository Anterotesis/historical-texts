            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>That admirable diversity of gifts and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of minde, vouchsated to men to serve the necessities of those times and places to which they are appointed that elegant vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Beings in the world, that gratefull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparity of occurences which the history of every age of the world entertains us with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> give assurance that there is a <hi>riches</hi> and pleonasm (as of Grace, so) of Wisdom in God: as which (like some full word that cannot be delivered of all that notion and sence with which it is pregnant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out variety of expressions) cannot be understood and made out without the large paraphrase of such a multitude of excellent instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and displays thereof.</p>
            <p>And the faithfulness of Nature to its Original laws of motion, the continuance <hi>of all things as they were from the beginning of the Creation,</hi> awaken a considerate minde into a quick and lively sense of the <hi>depth</hi> thereof. <hi>Nulla litura est in libro naturae.</hi> God never saw it necessary (as upon maturer thoughts) to correct and amend any thing in this great volume of the Creation, since the first edition thereof; which sufficiently resolves us, that all things were issued at first by a minde that doth not <hi>ad pauca respicere,</hi> but that did look the whole systeme of the Creation quite through, and comprehend at once the several mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and mutual aspects of secondary Agents, from the beginning of time to the end thereof.</p>
            <p>This general constancy and harmony of Nature in its operations, is not so much removed as commended by (those petty discords) prodigious occurrences, whose rarity sometimes commands our noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and regards. These are but the Anomalies of Nature some tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary exceptions from her more common rules of motion; she runs sometimes against her bias, when the rub of some unusual impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment disturbs her, but quickly recovers into her more easie and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive course. No kingdom is simply <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but that of heaven, and no law absolutely immutable but that of eternal righteousness. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is but <hi>Ars Dei,</hi> and so admits variety, but righteousness is <hi>Imago</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Dei,</hi> an emanation from, and transcript of the Nature of him <hi>with whom is no variableness, nor shadow of turning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now these <hi>Errata Naturae,</hi> Natures steppings out of its more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon road, have been received by the faith (phancy) of most times <hi>tanquam Dei Feciales,</hi> as Gods Heralds to proclaim his purposes of war and vengeance upon men; and as a kinde of reall prophesies of some impendent evils. It hath been concluded that as <hi>Natura libera,</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in its usual freedom, doth <hi>declare the glory and power of God,</hi> Psal. 19. 1. <hi>Natura superata,</hi> Nature quite conquer'd (as in a miracle) doth
<pb facs="tcp:41213:3"/>
report and confirm the truths and counsels of God; so <hi>Natura impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> Nature disturb'd and hinder'd (as in a Prodigy) doth proclaim his (approaching) judgements.</p>
            <p>The designe therefore of the present Discourse, is (with freedom and sobriety) to make enquiry how far any kinde of Prodigies (<hi>sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> or <hi>poenal</hi>) may be drawn into consequence to conclude the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of heaven from them; and whether that Faith and Religior with which the multitude receive them, be not (especially) owing to those two credulous and superstitious principles [Fear and Ignorance] which usually manage and deprave their affections and conclusions.</p>
            <p>I readily foresee, that as to some persons (more easily moved by the common ayr of popular prejudice) Religion and a great Truth will seem too much concerned in the argument, to be dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a question; so to others of more severe and examined prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, it will appear to hold too much of imagination or imposture, to receive the credit of a serious debate; and therefore had I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed no higher (in these papers) then barely to be publick, I should have made choice of some more obliging and inviting theme and with which my thoughts have been longer acquainted: But that which thus far reconciled me to the Argument, was a regard to the <hi>Profitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Pleasure, Seasonableness,</hi> of a Discourse thereupon.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>It will (in designe at least) be profitable to very great purpose,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>To secure the peace and tranquillity of common life.</hi> For if when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>skie is red and lowring</hi> (the face of heaven puts on a different colour and appearance from what it usually looks upon us with) we must conclude some approaching storm in the state, every man must needs hold the peace and serenity of his minde by a very crackt and litigious title.

               <pb facs="tcp:41213:3"/>And (indeed) I understand not how many men could reconcile their secure and quiet thoughts to their vain perswasions concerning Prodigies, but that I observe their usage is upon any such occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to charm down their fears with such like words, <hi>What these things signifie time to come will declare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>It will also serve the honour of Religion, which the common reverence of Prodigies doth greatly trespass upon;</hi> and that,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>As it detains men under a constant Paedagogy to many base and servile fears.</hi> Whence Religion is easily concluded a great Adversary to (what it mainly designes to bring on upon the world) a true gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousness, and universal freedom of spirit, and that its whole business is to subdue the spirits of men to some cold and little observances, pale and feminine fears. Hence men quickly grow weary of it, as of a yoke that continually galls them, and conclude themselves gainers if they may but purchase manhood with Atheism. This was that (especially) which gave <hi>Epicurus</hi> the confidence of thrusting God and Religion quite out of the world, and solving all the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> of Nature without calling in any assistance from the power and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of any Agent superiour to Naturall, even that bondage and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, which he observed mens ears bor'd unto by the Religion of his times, which was nothing but a timerous and base observance of the Signes of heaven, direfull Omens, prodigious occurrences, against whose evil abodements, men arm'd themselves with (paper against pod-guns) a few bodily and ineffective Rites and Ceremonies. <hi>Fear</hi> bindes in the powers of the soul, debars it the easie use and enjoyment of it self, and therefore the soul hates the womb that is conceived to bear it. Religion can never be amiable, till it appear designed not to increase the fears of men, but truly to cure and remove them.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The superstition of Prodigies commits no small waste upon Religion, in regard the fears it creates abuse the mindes of men,</hi> proving generally but <hi>è vitro fulgura,</hi> vain as the shadows of the night.

            <p>2. <hi>A very pernicious errour,</hi> as having a most malign influence upon the <hi>Minde and Understanding, upon Philosophy,</hi> and <hi>upon Divinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>Upon the mind and Understanding it self.</hi> No two things do so usurp and wast the faculty of Reason, as <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> and <hi>Superstition:</hi> the one binding a faith, the other a fear upon the Soul, to which they (vainly) intitle some divine discovery; both train a man up to beleeve beyond possibility of proof, to deliver over himself (in a kind of captivity of Understanding) to the confident dictates of the sons of imagination, to determine of things by measures phantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal (rules which cannot maintain themselves in credit by any sober and severe discourses) both inure the mind rather to divine then to judge, to dispute from Maximes rather vehement then folid, and place a man (if he chance to mistake) beyond possibility of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,<note place="margin">Pessimum est &amp; planè pestis &amp; tabes intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectus si vanis accedat vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio.</note> it being in vain to press an argument upon him that thinks he can confront a Revelation, a miracle, or some strange judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon his Adversary, against your conclusion; nor is there a greater evil then wickedness establisht by a law, and errour by reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and an ignorant devotion toward God.

            <p>2. <hi>Upon Philosophy.</hi> For when once Superstition hath advanced these Prodigies into the repute of divine messengers, it will easily be inferr'd a necessary respect towards them to keep some distance, and not to approach them too nearly by too busy and curious an enquiry into their natural and immediate causes. We find among the <hi>Grecians</hi> those which first made a tender of the natural causes of lightnings and tempests to the (as yet) ruder ears of men, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently blasted with the reproach of Atheists; as if to shew, how many wheels, in some great Engine, move in subordination to the production of some great work, were to obscure and ecclypse the art of the Artificer.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Upon Divinity also;</hi> Because the conceit conciliates reverence to a lie, and christens the vain and soft fears of ignorance by the name of prudent foresights and religious observances of God: whence the soul is brought (like some of the ancient Heathens) to give worship to its very passions and diseases. Stories of Prodigies may perhaps serve to deceive the <hi>taedium</hi> of a winter night, but when once they advance (<hi>à focis ad Aras</hi>) from the chimney corner to the Church, and are adopted the measures of a religious faith or fear, advanc'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (whether to serve the interest of Philosophy or Divinity, I shall not here concern my self to enquire) hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest her self (<hi>fas est &amp; ab hoste doceri</hi>) by her representatives a great

               </gap> more leaven'd (in mind) with that kind of superstition, then <hi>Herodotus</hi> or <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and others which stood in no better light then he did. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever much may be pardon'd to a great zeal to a good undertaking. The mind of man was made for Truth and Goodness, and therefore should nor in any matter (if the remedy fell within our compass) be put off with the bare form and idol of either; But where an errour hath once ceas'd it, which is (what some say of a comet) both <hi>malum &amp; causa mali,</hi> an evil and a pregnant cause of evils, no need then of the voice of thunder to awaken charity to endeavour (as it can) its remedy and removal.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>This Discourse may be profitable to serve the just interest of State,</hi> and that;</p>
            <p>1. <hi>As it tends to secure the honour of Acts of State and the results of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick counsel.</hi> How mean a value and regard shall the issues of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest debates, and the commands of Authority, find, if ever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>2. <hi>As it tends to make men more manageable to the commands of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> which easy men may quickly be frighted from by such images of straw, as the relations of monsters and strange sights are. Of what ill consequence the <hi>Romanes</hi> at last found the observation of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ignes and <hi>Omens</hi> to be (in war especially) appears from what <hi>Tully</hi> hath<note place="margin">De Divin. l. 2.</note> left recorded viz. that howsoever they were in his time <hi>ab U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now where weak men (like the horse of <hi>Alexander</hi>) are ready to start and fly off from their Rulers and Guides, because frighted with shadows, 'tis but a charity to them and the publick to turn them to the Sun, to lead them to the light by a faithfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of their judgements.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>As it ministers to the quiet and tranquillity of the State.</hi> That man that hath already incircled his own head with a <hi>Glory</hi> and is strongly perswaded that Gods honour and the Gospel stand or fall with his
<pb facs="tcp:41213:5"/>
private Opinion, will need no great Rhetorick to perswade him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a prodigy as a sign from heaven to encourage any endeavours to advance it. Prophesies concerning the deaths of great persons, or changes in the State, (a kind of weak ayr which carries about and commands but the more chaffie and lighter faiths) the wisdom<note place="margin">Stat. 3 Edw. 6. c. 15.</note> of the Nation hath judg'd of such evil consequence in a State, as by two several Acts of Parliament (under severe penalties) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict<note place="margin">Stat. 5 Eliz. c. 15.</note> the publication of them. Now Prodigies have ever been propos'd as a kind of types and real Prophesies of some black days, and some wonderfull alterations at hand; and therefore may easily be presum'd to have as malign an influence upon the people (apt to be mightily mov'd with what ever comes toward them with any shadow and promise of Divine and Sacred) as the former.</p>
            <p>Among the Ancient Romanes subtil Statesmen made use of that Superstitious observation of <hi>Omens</hi> and <hi>Prodigies,</hi> (to which they saw the people, in the ruder ages especially so invincibly addicted) to act and manage them to what perswasions might best serve the necessities of State; to which purpose they had their <hi>Collegia Vatum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Publick Diviners, who knew to bend these Osier accidents (as the <hi>Mufti</hi> can doe the <hi>Alcoran</hi>) to such a sence and signification as might make the easie multitude manageable to the purposes and designs of their Rulers. And 'twere to be wisht that some Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had not since transcrib'd the copy of this Ethnick example, and endeavour'd to serve some secular ends upon the credulity and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition of the multitude, by the tendring of any such Prodigies, or Prophecies to their hopes or fears. All that I shall add further in this place, is this. He that alledgeth barely the Spirit of God to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie an Opinion in Religion may thank himself, if he perish in the other World; and he that quotes onely a Prodigy in Nature to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage any sedition in State, may thank himself if he perish in this.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>This Discourse</hi> (without oweing much to the Author) <hi>will be pregnant with pleasure and delight.</hi> For things rare and unusual (the subject thereof) call forth the Soul to a very quick and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full attendance, whilst matters of greater worth and moment, of more familiar occurrence, (like things often handled and blown upon) loose their value and lustre in its eye. Now the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things new and strange, gives the Soul so high a pleasure;</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Because they prove the occasions of wonder and admiration,</hi> which the<note place="margin">

               </gap>, things pleasant and delightfull; because (saith He) admiration comes attended with a tacite desire of learning [more fully the nature and causes of its object] though I rather think, because admiration is (as the Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> well stiles it) <hi>abrupta quaedam scientia,</hi> an Essay to knowledge, besides we shall observe that the acts of the Soul which are intense, and call it much off from it self, [as profound contemplations, great joys, ectacies a great love, and so, high admirations] create it a most chast and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd pleasure.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Because Objects not as yet fully known</hi> (as objects rare and strange are) <hi>keep the Soul in a State of hope and expectation of some huge satisfaction</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:41213:6"/>
               <hi>in a greater intimacy and acquaintance with them.</hi> Now (as to this Worlds heaven) the <hi>Viatores</hi> (because improving their felicities by an active phancy) are usually more happy then the <hi>comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sores.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Because the Soul of Man affects a kinde of insinity in its objects.</hi> The affections are alway reaching after new pleasures, the desires are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried forth after new possessions, phancy is perpetually entertaining the minde with new <hi>Ideas,</hi> the Understanding is continually calling for a new Scene of contemplations. <hi>Scaliger</hi> alledgeth this reason<note place="margin">Mens nostra è fabulis &amp; monstrorum picturis, capit Voluptatem, propterea quod exupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant vulgares limites veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, &amp;c. aspernatur enim certo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum finium praescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem. <hi>Exerc. 307. §. 11.</hi>
               </note> of the delight men naturally take in fables, the pictures of Anticks, and Monsters, (things rare and extraordinary) even because they exceed the common limits of truth, and mend the prospect of the Soul; which by its unconfin'd desires and motions gives it self to understand, that it is of higher extraction then that of a beast, and cannot truly compose and enjoy it self but in Union with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the infinite Ocean of truth and Goodness.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That which further engag'd my thoughts upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, was a consideration of the <hi>Seasonableness thereof.</hi> We have been of late perswaded by three or four several impressions of Books (as there never wanted those which would farme the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and easiness of the multitude) that <hi>England</hi> is grown <hi>Africa,</hi> and presents us every year (since the Return of his Majesty)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a new Scene of Monstrous and strange sights, and that our lot is fallen into an Age of Wonders; and all held forth to the People (like black clouds before a storm) the harbingers of some strange and unusual plagues approaching in the State. A matter not much to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, when the Nation (like the Womb of <hi>Rebekah</hi>) carries such striving and contesting Parties.</p>
            <p>The Poets feign the Giants (the sons of <hi>Earth</hi>) to have bidden battel to the Gods, and to have perisht by a thunderbolt in the confidence of that attempt. And the <hi>Earth</hi> (their Mother) to avenge<note place="margin">De sapient. Vet. c. 9.</note> the death of her Sons, to have brought forth their last Sister, Fame. A fable expounded by the excellent <hi>Verulam,</hi> of unquiet and sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous persons (a kind of <hi>Filii Terrae,</hi> the creatures of the People, usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally envious against their Rulers, and soon weary of the present State of things) who when crusht and ruin'd in their attempts against the Gods on earth (their rightfull Governours) their f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To all that hath been hitherto discourst concerning the profit, pleasure, seasonableness of the Argument before us, I shall superadd this one consideration to excuse the trouble these papers give the Reader. A hasty, ignorant, rash rejection of things which obtain (though unworthily) the place and repute of religious and sacred, (as prodigies doe) gives no small advantage to Atheism. An over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hasty
<pb facs="tcp:41213:6"/>
pulling off (even) the wens and excrescencies from the body of Religion, may prove of as bad consequence, as a permitting them still to grow upon it. As our Saviour would not be call'd <hi>Good</hi> in an ignorant courtesie, so neither should these Prodigies, <hi>Vain,</hi> in an ignorant scorn: He that (without light and resolution) slights and neglects things, but presum'd sacred and religious, is but a more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Atheist, and more harmlesly profane. Look as (sometimes) Persons once Sacred, found guilty of capital crimes, are solemnly degraded, before they are executed; so things once reputed Sacred, should be first degraded (by a well inform'd judgment) from that Opinion and degree of respect they held in mens minds, before they be thrown off, and deliver'd to their neglect and disregard.</p>
            <p>And this is all that that I thought necessary to premise, to level the way to a fairer reception and interpretation of the ensuing Discourse.</p>

               <p>2 The <hi>Lusus Naturae,</hi> (as I may style them) the disports of Nature; such works wherein the hand of Nature breaks and divides (as it were) the plain ground of some common nature into an elegant va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Individuals, different in shape and temper; as is seen in dogs and roses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as also those works wherein (because delighted as much with consent as variety) <hi>se sequitur<expan>

               <p>3.

All these have imployed the hours of other men, and besides are more properly entred among the rarities then the Prodigies of Nature, and so fall not within the lines of our present Argument.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There are <hi>Wonders Extraordinary,</hi> such are they which happen but now and then, and are a kinde of short and transient dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, stepping in sometimes to recommend the general harmony and evenes in the motions of Nature, and the Government of the world, comprised under the general name of <hi>Prodigies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that division of these, which I shall premise to the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>suing discourse, shall be such as the necessity and designe thereof, rather then such as the laws of Logick, do prompt me to; which I conceive may be best serv'd, by dividing them into Prodigies (barely) <hi>Signal</hi> and <hi>Penal:</hi> For though I have no faith nor favour for the former, yet while I indite them at the bar of Reason, I am forc't to take notice of them under such names and titles, as common opinion hath affixt upon them.</p>
               <p>Those which are (barely) <hi>Signal</hi> (such, I mean, in vulgar account) are of three sorts.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Prodigies Natural,</hi> such I reckon all those of whose particular and immediate causes (though rarely occurring) we are sufficiently resolv'd: such as are (to speak with the people) <hi>falling-stars, Earthquakes, Extraordinary Eclipses, the appearance of two or three Suns at once, some kinde of monstrous births.</hi> With these I number all events (besides the common road of Nature) owing to some accidental (though to us unknown) assistance or interruption of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41213:8"/>
Agents purely natural, or some secret and reserved Law in Nature, as <hi>Comets, New-stars, some extraordinary alteration in the heavenly bodies,</hi> (as that in the Planet <hi>Venus,</hi> both as to colour and figure before the times of Christ, often mentioned by Astronomers from <hi>Varro</hi> and S. <hi>Austin</hi>) and the strange <hi>deliquium</hi> of light in the Sun about the<note place="margin">
                     <hi>S.</hi> Aug. de Civit. Dei. <hi>l. 21. c. 8.</hi>
                  </note> death of <hi>Caesar; Some unusual ebbings and flowings of the Sea.</hi> These, I reckon Prodigies Natural, all being but Natures acting of its part in a different habit, and giving us to know how it will exert it self, when such Agents, and such matter chance to meet.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Prodigies praeternatural,</hi> such I account all strange Events, which hold of no steady causes, but are (to us) solely casual and uncertain; as the <hi>firing of a house by lightning, the coming to shore of some strange kinde of fish, the breaking off or standing still of Rivers, messages delivered by spirits, apparitions in the ayr</hi> (which are effects above a natural, and beneath a bare supernatural Agent.)</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Supernatural,</hi> such as are Events of which Reason is sufficiently resolved, that they exceed the powers and sufficiencies of all Natural causes. For look as in Religion, there are <hi>quaedam juxta Rationem,</hi> some things according to the common reason of all men, [<hi>viz.</hi> the doctrines of temperance, righteousness, obedience to God;] some things <hi>praeter rationem,</hi> beside reason, [the discoveries of God, which reason now apprehends and seals unto, but could not <hi>Marte proprio,</hi> of it self reach unto;] some things <hi>supra rationem</hi> [the great Articles of Faith, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent to the capacity, as well as light of common reason, in the modes and circumstances of them:] So in the compass of Divine Providence, there are three sorts of works, <hi>quaedam juxta Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam,</hi> some according to the common Laws of Natures working; <hi>quaedam praeter Naturam,</hi> some beside common Nature, such are the Events we call Prodigies, which though according to Nature, as considered in such circumstances and co-incidence of causes, yet are beside it, considered in its more usual and familiar methods of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Quaedam supra Naturam,</hi> such are those alterations in Nature, which exceed the capacities of second causes. In a Prodigy (strictly taken) Nature suffers from it self, and is (in a sort) both victour and captive to it self; but in a Miracle, Nature is solely passive to that original Minde and Power which gave it its first Laws of motion.</p>
               <p>These supernatural Prodigies (though I know not to beleeve any such now happening) yet must finde a place in this discourse, not onely because some such have (as Embassadours extraordinary) been dispatcht heretofore upon some great errand (as the fearfull E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse at our Saviours death, the hailstones, mentioned <hi>Iosh.</hi> 10. 11. so hugely exceeding the common standard of Nature, and perhaps the fiery sword which hung over <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> so long before its final desolation) but because our Adversaries are so prone to over-value such occasions, and to intitle an immediate hand of heaven to all such objects of wonder.</p>
               <p>As for those stories (with which the Ethnick Legends abound) of the <hi>speaking of children out of their mothers wombs, the raining of stones, the speaking of oxen, their being found without hearts or livers when brought</hi>

                  </note> and impostures, with which the world hath ever been abused (<hi>Rome-Pagan</hi> was as good at inventing stories of Prodigies and Apparitions of the gods, as <hi>Rome-Christian</hi> of Miracles and Apparitions of Saints) And with a like faith (though better affection, because found in a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em) I receive many of those <hi>Portenta,</hi> which (as 'tis said) attended the fall of <hi>Cesar,</hi>

               <p>'Twas but proper for a <hi>Poet</hi> to hang the whole frame of Nature (as it were) with mourning and astonishment, upon the fall of so great a Person as <hi>Cesar</hi> was. Gods miracles carried majesty in those visible characters of Power, Greatness, Wisdom, stampt upon them: (they were never vain and ludicrous) and they came forth upon some er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand of importance: like a broad seal they carried Majesty in their aspect; and came to derive credit and authority upon some matter of great weight and moment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There are a sort of <hi>Prodigies Penal</hi> (for I take the word in the latitude of its sence) such as are judgements upon Persons or Nations of a dreadfull and unusual figure and condition: <hi>sudden ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests by death, strange diseases, death by lightning, or the fall of a towre, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual plagues, defeats of Armies at huge odds and disadvantages, mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>These distinctions premised, I shall offer the best service I can, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the deciphering of these dark characters of divine Providence; and make enquiry (in the order they now lie before us) into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and meaning of these new and unwonted occurrences.

But God (who useth to make the devils mines to fall in upon himself) made (no doubt) this happy use of these slavish fears in the minds of the Gentiles, even the ushering in of the Gospel Jubilee with the greater acceptance among them; as by the fears &amp; terrours of the Law, he also levelled the way to its more ready and cheerful reception among the Jews.

                  <p>Besides (secondly) they were <hi>Times of publick fears, troubles, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> (generally) <hi>when men were most impressive to a fear of these prodigious accidents.</hi> Thus <hi>Livy</hi> somewhere notes, <hi>turbido aliquo tempore, versis in Religionem animis, multa visa creditaque prodigia quae non erant;</hi> and elsewhere tells us, (<hi>Hist. l.</hi> 28. 11.) <hi>In civitate, tanto discrimine belli solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cita, quum Omnium secundorum adversorumque causas in Deos verterent, multa prodigia nunciabantur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men, when they think God displeased, (as they deal by a man they conceive their adversary) look upon all his actions through the black <hi>medium</hi> of suspicion and jealousie, and therefore they all seem to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry terrours and affrightments with them. All strange Accidents (like strange passengers) in times of discomposure are suspected and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, which freely pass without our notices when peace and love spread their gentle wings over a nation; when fear hath once tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured the eye of the minde with black (dreadfull) apprehensions, it easily sees every thing of its own colour: it either finds its object, or creates it in every occurrence; the sun shines not upon the water or a cloud, but (like the <hi>Moabites</hi>) men conclude signs of bloud from the redness of the colour, when fear hath once softned the spirits, and disabled the minde for a cool and sedate judgement and valuation of things. Besides, in such times, Religion knows not to keep its mean, but quickly runs over into superstition (a servile flattery of God, and an observance of him in little, weak, feminine instances of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.)</p>
                  <p>Now the Religion of Prodigies being conceived thus in the womb of gross ignorance, and nourisht by the soft and easie fears of men in affliction, when their fancy (like mettal in the fire) refuseth no fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, we cannot entertain any great Opinion of its strength and goodness without a forfeiture of our credit, with more considerate and serious persons. Can it be ever thought that God should advance an observation of these things into so necessary a part of our Religion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt it a great instance of our regards of his superintendence, and presidency over the affairs of the world, when (we see) the devil made choice of it to entertain the devouter fears of his Votaries with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all? Did God ever take sacrifice from the devils altars? The devil (indeed) hath alway been Gods ape, but God will alway be found the devils opposite, and to tread counter to him perpetually. Many of the critical rites and usages appointed the Jewish Nation, will be found to resolve into the divine purpose to cross and thwart (by his commands) the rites of the <hi>Zabii,</hi> the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41213:12"/>
Nations, which had the devil for the Great Master of their (religious) Ceremonies. When our Saviour came into the world, the Religion of the greatest part of it (through the agency of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil) ran out into a multitude of little rites, weak observances bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily postures; and he appoints a Religion (directly opposite) plain, simple, rational, life and spirit, whose main designe was to employ and perfect the minde and spirit of a man. And can it be thought that heaven and hell now touch each other so far, that we must borrow the measures of our biggest fears and hopes, and motives to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, from the Ethnick Divinity? (in which if there had been <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid sani,</hi> to be sure the devil would have hindred its gaining so great a regard as it did among his Votaries) must we now look for such a Jewel as the intimations of the counsels of infinite Wisdom are, in the dunghill of obscene and monstrous births, apparitions of lying spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, strange voices in the air, mighty winds, alterations in the face of heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from which the Gentiles in the <hi>times of their ignorance</hi> (to be-nighted men rotten wood shines) thought to receive the light of some heavenly counsel and direction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Prodigies Natural,</hi> are not to be regarded as Prognesticks<note place="margin">Arg. 3.

                  <p>Nay (upon a due judgement of things) there will perhaps appear more of <hi>Nature</hi> in a Prodigy, then in the more harmonious consort of Uniform Agents, to which common usage hath appropriated that name; That Nature in its production of the several kinds of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, should (as if they were all stampt with one common seal) give them forth in such equal and similar figures and proportions, is a more just object of wonder, then to see the natural <hi>Archeus</hi> sometimes to play the bungler, and to leave its work (in some parts thereof) rude and mishapen.

                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Comets</hi> commonly thought presages of evils, and why. A difference between comets and some luminous bodies in the Heavens <hi>like them,</hi> Prov'd not to be <hi>signa operantia</hi> of any evils in Earth. The difficulty of determining the specifick Nature of a <hi>Comet,</hi> prov'd no incenst exhalation by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations: further evinc't <hi>no effective cause</hi> of evil, from the dimension and the acknowledg'd altitude thereof. Three Arguments to prove them not to be <hi>Signa indicantia</hi> of any evils. The difficulty of reprehending any errour which bottomes in phancy and imagination. The Omission of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular discourse concerning some other Prodigies, excus'd.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THat which the law of our intended method lays next before us, is the proof of the <hi>Thesis</hi> propos'd by a particular Induction. I shall therefore direct my thoughts upon some, (twere to overvalue the Argument to speak to many) Prodigies, which have been thought the most plausible pretenders to the honour of being <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bola Prophetica:</hi> Amongst which Comets are of more especial regard, and have been receiv'd (by the faith or fears of most times) as a kind of Beacon fir'd from Heaven to alarm the World, and to give intimation of an approaching evil: The <hi>Cauda Cometae</hi> especially seems to the eye of ignorance the emblem of a Flaming sword, or fiery rod, and to carry the dreadfull images of some mighty scourge prepar'd to correct a froward world withall. With the Poet it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth as a rul'd case,</p>
                  <q>—<hi>Nunquam coelo spectatum impunè Cometam.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>A comet never shone from Heaven to give the world any pannick fears. The <hi>Astrologers</hi> (as confident of the final as the Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks of the formal cause, of any such unusual lights) take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon the appearance of them to be the <hi>Filii coenaculi</hi> which are to expound to the world these mystick characters of Heaven. Indeed any alteration and unwonted wrinckle in the face of heaven, is thought (like a frown) a presage of anger and some intended evil, partly because Heaven is conceiv'd the throne of justice whence 'tis most proper to expect the signs of Vengeance, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially because the general harmony of its motions and constancy of its parts (whereby it reproacheth the Lunacies and irregularities of this lower world) seem to assure that Anomalies at any time therein cannot issue <hi>ex natura subjecti, sed Consilio Dei,</hi> from the nature of the subject, but the wise purpose of God (by these) to warn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he strike, and (as by a <hi>flaming sword</hi>) to drive the world out of its fools paradise, (a flattering peace and security)</p>
                  <p>To encounter the vanity of so specious and obstinate an imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I shall endeavour to evince these strange Phaenomena in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

no Prognosticks of any ensuing evils, as being neither the <hi>signa operantia,</hi> nor yet the <hi>signa indicantia</hi> of them. Only I must (before I proceed) tell the Reader that by Comets, I mean Comets (truly so called) not those (<hi>Cometo</hi>-<gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The Reasons I shall tender to perswade the contrary shall not be many because I designe not a triumph but a victory, and would not that this part should swell beyond the just measures and proportions: I shall content my self with some few taken from this threefold To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick. The <hi>Nature,</hi> the <hi>Dimensions,</hi> the <hi>Altitude</hi> of a Comet.</p>
                  <p>1. I argue it to be no <hi>Operative signe of evil in this</hi> lower world, from the <hi>General Nature thereof.</hi> As for its more specifick and distinct Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is that which many Philosophers have shot their bolt at, but it is hard to say (at this distance) who hath hit the mark. Enquiries about heavenly bodies usually conclude in wonder and doubt: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly (in this argument) we shall finde all sorts of Philosophers (ancient and modern) profess themselves unresolv'd, and modest, but onely the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>avow'd Followers of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whose usage is (too often) in <hi>Divinity</hi> to make a great deal of nothing; and <hi>in Philosophy,</hi> nothing of a great deal. We fell from God by reaching after the knowledge of things too high for us, and 'tis a mercifull justice that we should be humbled into a sense of our sin and ignorance by our being pos'd in those things which we most converse with, or are most desirous to understand. However those notices we can arrive to of the <hi>General Nature</hi> of a Comet, will sufficienly serve the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of that vulgar conceit now before our consideration [that 'tis <hi>Mali Praeco</hi>] For it appears to us in an evidence as great as the matter will bear, 1. <hi>That a Comet is no exhalation set on fire;</hi> (the great hinge which the Opinion turns upon) 2 <hi>That it is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>First, <hi>It is no exhalation incenst.</hi> This may appear first from the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant equality and evenness of its light and figures,</hi> the main body of a Comet is observ'd to maintain an even and constant rotundity, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41213:14"/>
to send forth a direct and uniform ray of light in the tayl or train thereof: whereas if it were a fire, it would shift its figures accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the necessity of that <hi>Pabulum</hi> whereby it is maintain'd, did require; and would appear greater or less according as it had more or less subdu'd and prevail'd upon the matter which it spent its force upon. Besides Comets as they are (like the Planets) in their motion, a kind of <hi>stellae erraticae,</hi> so also like them in the Nature and quality of their light; they do not <hi>scintillare,</hi> and provoke the eye to more intense notices by any new and uneven vibrations of light, whereas fire sparkles, and is alway in (either direct or circular) motions.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>From the clear and constant visibility of them.</hi> Nothing checkes and intercepts our full and free view of an appearing Comet, but (what may also obscure the sun) the interpose of a cloud. Whereas were they incenst exhalations (of such vast dimensions) a Comet must necessarily carry its own Earth about with it to eclipse it sometimes from our sight, because it is suppos'd (like a torch) in the pursuit of its <hi>pabulum</hi> to burn downward, (though it be apparent that Comets extinguish and become invisible by moving higher into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens) because the more gross and uninflamed parts must sometimes needs intertupt our sight of that fire which hath ceas'd the parts which lye next the sun, or the (suppos'd) elementary fire, which the vulgar doctrine asserts the occasion of these prodigious fires in heaven.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>From the Uniformity and steadiness of their motions.</hi> Comets<note place="margin">Nullis igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ordinariis &amp; coelestibus iter flexum est, sideris proprium est ducere orbem. <hi>Sen.

                     </note> though not all subject to one and the same law of motion (because observ'd indifferent in their motions to any quarter of Heaven) yet are all noted to proceed with a very great constancy and uniformity, to describe exactly a segment of a great circle, and not to be acted to any such giddy and casual courses, as fire, which is (in the elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Region) determin'd by the air, or the circumstances of the matter which feeds, it which way it shall move and incline it self.</p>

                     </gap> the measures of Astronomy, they have been oft found to exceed the proportions of the Earth: Now it seems greatly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that so vast a body of vapours should be drawn together so long and so high, nay impossible; the whole earth (if but one vast exhalation) being insufficient for its make and supply. Its here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, that it were indeed impossible, if the body of a Comet were solely of a spherical figure; but a Comet (say our adversaries) may be expanded to a plain, like a cloud, and so maintain the opinion of its dimensions: To which we answer, that although in some po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, a plain figure may give the shew and appearance of a Comet, yet it cannot in every motion and site and every position of Behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, unless it be of a spherical figure.</p>

Comet, by proving it to be <hi>some heavenly body.</hi> What kinde <hi>of heavenly body it is,</hi> is as difficult as unnecessary in this place largely to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That such a one it is, was a truth credited by the joynt suffrages of the more Ancient Philosophers. <hi>Aristotle</hi> seems the first, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd against the sense of Antiquity to degrade Comets from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the degree and place of me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Largely to endeavour the proof of this truth, would be to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value the pains of more able Undertakers in this argument, and to<note place="margin">Cometas coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestes esse à Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, praesertim Tychone &amp; Keplero, nuper sic probatum ut pudeat non credere. <hi>Id. c. 1.

                     </note> over-doe the end to which this discourse is levell'd. In short, (to omit the consideration of its rise and setting) the <hi>Parallax,</hi> of a Comet is found much less then that of the moon; which gives the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted report of its exceeding it in <hi>Altitude.</hi> Besides if it were not much above our <hi>Atmospheare</hi> (which exceeds not the distance of fourscore miles) its <hi>arcus apparentiae</hi> would be so strait and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable that (as hath been prov'd) it would in two or three hours quite run out of the compass of our sensible Horizon, nor possibly continue so long together visible to us as Comets are generally known to doe.</p>
                  <p>Our second Argument to evince that no evil in this lower world, owes it self to the malign aspects of a Comet, is taken <hi>from the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions thereof.</hi> It seems (in the body of it) scarce equal to the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of a star of the first magnitude: the truth is, <hi>pars minima est ipse Cometa sui,</hi> the true and real Comet is the least part of its appearing self, in regard the tayle thereof is not <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, not any real and substantial part thereof (as commonly presum'd) flaming forth as the condition of the matter doth invite the fire to follow, but the shining of the solar beams through the more porous and spungy parts of the head thereof (some imitation whereof, we sometimes have in the beams of the setting sun darted through a dispos'd cloud, or through some small crevise in a wall, which (after the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a rod) first close and knit together, and then spread and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late themselves according as they advance further from the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustiae</hi> of the matter whereat they enter (for its observ'd that still as the Sun circles in its diurnal motion in the heavens, so doth a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets tayle veere, and respect an opposite poynt in the heavens) so that these mighty vibrations of light from its luminous body, put a great fallacy upon the eye, and report it much larger then in truth it is. Now then can it be presum'd by any man that will ow any account of his Opinions to Reason, that (in it self) <hi>so small a body, at so vast a distance, lasting so inconsiderable a time and moving so fast away,</hi> can be sufficient for any such notable effects as some easy men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title

it unto? What History (almost) is there of Comets but what arrives at us stain'd and defil'd by the superstition of the writers, able to support the confidence of this perswasion? How little able are we, after the observation of so many hundred years to assigne the effects of the most noted stars in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Besides how little able are those weaker impressions upon the ayr, to stand before those more sensible and vigorous alterations which the succeeding seasons of the year con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually make upon it? The Opinion which asserts Comets to be incens'd exhalations would carry (in my eye) more fair appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of truth, if owing them rather the presages of seasons health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and desireable, in regard it supposeth so many noxious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure exhalations consumed (at so vast a distance from Earth) by fire, the most potent corrective of an infectious ayr.</p>
                  <p>These Reasons seem sufficient to reach the proof of our first asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion [that Comets are not <hi>signa operativa malorum</hi>] I am next to prove them not to be <hi>signa indicantia of them</hi> which I shall endeavour <hi>From the indifferency and Universality of their aspects and motions.</hi> They often pass over the heads of many and different Countries, that in 1618. was successively vertical to <hi>Arabia, Persia, Turky, Barbary, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco, China, Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Poland, Muscovie, &amp;c.</hi> now which of these can it be presum'd to level its malign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>aspects at?

                     <hi>Tully</hi> hath noted, that no King nor People ever was there with whom some presumed divine predictions, were not in use and credit: to which I further add, that it is hard to mention that thing (necessary or contingent) upon which the Ethnick vanity had not affixt some signification and presage or other. Nay, and even in very good men (in sacred writ) we finde not this itch after the knowledge of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of future times, sufficiently kil'd.</p>
                  <p>This desire of knowing things future, is owing partly to that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thirst in the soul after knowledge in the latitude thereof; partly to a secret distrust of Providence, which we cannot endure to follow e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven blind-fold, like <hi>Abraham, not knowing whither we go;</hi> partly to our natural restlesness in uncertainties, and the souls not enduring a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41213:18"/>
crucifixion between hopes and fears; partly to that impressive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of spirit which times of action and change (for in such, prodigies and prophecies are most critically recorded) are generally attended with; as also to that <hi>nausea</hi> which the tedious repetition of things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and familiar, creates the soul of man. For these reasons, men are very ready to attend to a Prodigy as to a kinde of silent Oracle, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve them in their enquiries <hi>de futuro,</hi> which is indeed but profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to go to God, whose work it is, as they would to a common For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-teller.</p>
                  <p>To dismiss this particular, There are especially two sorts of things which command our minds to the most quick and serious attendences. 1. <hi>Things rare and extraordinary,</hi> Oracles, Mysteries, New notions, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Arts, Secrets, Stories of Apparitions. 2. <hi>Predictions and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations:</hi> for we shall observe the soul especially delighted in its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries into times far past, and long hence to come; whereby it grasps (in a kinde of petty infinity) both the ends of time at once. Now then, Prodigies may quickly call forth the serious notices and regards of the <hi>most,</hi> as being <hi>mira,</hi> matters (in themselves) rare and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and also (in common opinion) <hi>monstra,</hi> things which can shew them what is to come, and to lift the soul above the narrow <hi>Horizon</hi> of things present and sensible, which it hath so often surfetted and cloy'd it self withall.</p>

                     </hi>) ready to overspread Heaven, and to fall down upon men, may (without much forcing) perswade themselves that all these unusual occurrences are owing to their courteous Agency, designing by them to warn men by repentance to <hi>flie from the wrath</hi> approaching.</p>
                  <p>Others again seem to me to apprehend the World, as a kinde of of <hi>Great Animal,</hi> inform'd by a very subtile and apprehensive Spirit, which out of a hidden and inexplicable sense of an impendent evil, (as many creatures have of an approaching storm) starts (as it were) and shrinks in, and in its several parts, suffers mighty emotions and disturbances. But this notion, will (perhaps) look more temptingly, when presented to us as the Parents thereof are pleas'd to dress it forth. <hi>There is (saith a late writer) that sympathy and fellow-feeling which God hath put in his whole creation, whereby each part hath a care of the whole, and according to its measure, doth endeavour its preservation. As in the body natural of man, upon the next and immediate approach of death some parts are put into suddain tremblings, and convulsions, whereby they discover the nearness, and, as far as they can, labour to prevent the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of that Enemy: So God hath order'd it in the Great body of the World, that Earthquakes like convulsions, Eclipses (like fallings of the eyes) and such other unusual Prodigies, (which have an analogy and resemblance to the accidents of the body of man) should commonly precede that ruine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any one State or Nation is finally to be involv'd. As when our Saviour died, the sun was darkned,</hi> the rocks were rent, the Earth shook, <hi>by a kinde of natural sympathy and compassionate horrour, at so dreadfull and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing a spectacle: So when</hi> Hierusalem <hi>was to be destroyed, Our Saviour himself foretells</hi> that there should be Earth-quakes, and famines, and pestilences, and fearfull sights, and great signs, <hi>as the Van-carriers and Out-guard to that more terrible desolation, which was to follow them. What the Apostle therefore says elegantly concerning future Glory,</hi> that the whole creation <hi>which was made</hi> subject to vanity <hi>and misery for mans sin, doth</hi> groan <hi>and, (as it were</hi>) travail in pain <hi>untill it be deliver'd from</hi> the bondage of corruption, and <hi>manu-mitted or set free to</hi> pertake of the glorious liberty of the sons of God; <hi>so while it is in the state of vanity, God hath put into it such a quick sense, that not one part can grieve, but it will after a sort grieve together, and discover by its tremblings, shakings, eclipses, and extraordinary changes, that there is some great judgement a coming.</hi>

                  <p>The pretty allegories, and allusions of which Discourse (but the washing of weak and rotten stuff) might possibly shew not unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely in an oration, but are two aery and thin for a sermon, as the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41213:20"/>
hony under the law, might be of use at the <hi>table,</hi> but was too frothy and luscious for the <hi>Altar:</hi> As for that vanity now upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is solely passive therein, and subject to it; and as for that vizard upon the face of Nature, those direfull and amazing alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the frame of the world, which attended our Saviours death, and the fates of <hi>Hierusalam,</hi> they are instances (concluded) miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and extraordinary, (whose return may be expected with their occasions) and so are so far from coming up to, that they scarce look towards our present case, as shall appear more fully in due place:</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>It is the Nature of the Soul to be greatly impressive to a perswasion of parallels, equalities, similitudes, in the frame and Government of the World:</hi> and that (indeed) so far, as to make them (by the poesy of phancy) where it cannot really discover them; that so it may please and sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace it self in some supposed lines and figures of its own uniform and harmonious nature pourtray'd upon the world; and 'twere easy to shew how this temper hath betray'd it to a great many pretty dreams, both in science and common life.</p>
                  <p>This being the general temper of the Soul, it is easily inclin'd to believe great and mighty changes in states, usher'd with the solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of some mighty and analogous changes in Nature, and that all terrible evils are prefac't or attended with some prodigious and amazing alterations in the creation; that so the black and dreadfull dress of the stage, may be correspondent to the tragical part shortly to be acted thereupon. The minde readily apprehends it a great <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum,</hi> to imagine the children of the creation trembling, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gastly, and running out of their places when their Father is just a taking of the rod of vengeance into his hand. Hence perhaps it is, that we generally finde great troubles and judgements on Earth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd, especiall by persons ecstatical (Prophets and Poets) whose speeches usually rather follow <hi>Sensum animae quàm veritatem rei,</hi> by all the examples of horrour and confusion, in the frame of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>This disposition of Soul, doth never more strongly exert it self, then when the Prodigies (being no unfitting emblems of the judgement) doe impregnate imagination, and offer a mighty assistance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41213:20"/>
Thus, (as 'tis call'd) the raining of bloud (which is but water tinctur'd by the condition of the soyl whence it ariseth, or, rather, where it falls) shall strongly sollicite the fear of some great effusion of bloud in the state; the appearance of two Suns at once, (which is but the figure and glory of the Sun drawn by its own beams upon a disposed cloud) doth greatly encourage the phancy of two Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titours for Royalty in a Nation; some great Eclypse seems (to a soft imagination) to hang the world with black against the approaching funeralls of some Great Person; the Casual parting of the River <hi>Ouse</hi> in <hi>Bedfordshire,</hi> seem'd (after the event) a presage of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding division between the house of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster.</hi> These and many more, where they meet with an imagination strong enough to supply and relieve their weakness, shall prove an event beyond <hi>Geometry,</hi> and the Reasons and experience of all men and times.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Humane Nature is greatly propense to entertain things vehement and extraordinary with an Opinion of a more then ordinary sacredness in, and presence of God with them.</hi> In the Old Testament, things more vulgar and accommodate to a humane size and measure, had the name of Man call'd upon them; thus we read of the <hi>Rod of a Man.</hi> 2 Sam. 7. 14. <hi>the cords of a Man,</hi> Hos. 11. 4. <hi>the pen of a Man.</hi> Is. 8. 1. that is gentle, and usual: on the other side, things rare and which hardly admit their pattern, are attributed unto God, <hi>Horeb the Mount of God.</hi> Exod. 3. 1. <hi>the River of God.</hi> Ps. 65 9. <hi>the trees of God</hi> Ps. 104. 16. <hi>the fire of God</hi> Job. 1. 6. that is, great and extraordinary. Now the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hebrews (to whose law of speaking the Holy Ghost accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modates himself) in their customes and language, seem to make the truest report of the easy sentiments of simple Nature.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly, these strange and prodigious alterations in Nature, appear to men, (because not of familiar occurrences) stampt with some Characters and touches of Divinity; and so apt to raise a great<note place="margin">Pessimum omnium est augurium quod ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensu capitur, in rebus intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectualibus, &amp;c. nihil enim multis placet nisi imaginatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem feriat, aut intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum vulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num nodis astring at. <hi>Verul.

                     <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> tells us, viz. That there were more prodigies found out by the <hi>Egyptians</hi> (perhaps because of a traditional reverence of signs and wonders continu'd among them from the very times of <hi>Moses</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in so many happened) then by any other Nation whatsoever: and their usage was when any Prodigie hapned to write it down, and observe the event succeeding; and if ever any like Prodigie hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they easily concluded it would be issu'd in a similar event. The mind of man is apt to be greatly mov'd and affected with objects which strike upon it strongly and unawares, and lead it into won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ecstacy; and easily invited to believe (especially because Ioath to be dodg'd and abus'd with endless dissimilitudes and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities among things) that other things will fall like those few with which it is so strongly affected and prepossest.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Because any great evils (like some harsher passages in Musick) use to make strong impressions on our memories,</hi> and are generally made use of as a kind of little <hi>Epochas,</hi> whence we reckon our times. Whereas great blessings slide off from our minds, and are soon deliver'd to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and forgetfulness: or else such prodigious accidents would soon appear (if at all) to <hi>prophecy</hi> as oft <hi>smooth,</hi> as harsh and <hi>evil things</hi> concerning us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. (<hi>Nam pluribus exceptionibus uti, nemo prohibetur</hi>) this plea is (at best) but very fallacious and uncertain; and that upon many accounts,</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>As many and great evils have been consequent to Prodigies, so also are they to many and great evils;</hi> the World is acquainted with any thing better then consistence; its nature seems emblem'd in its figure, it is round, and accordingly in perpetual motion and turning from one side, (state and condition) to another. And therfore as the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples said to our Saviour (in that great croud, Luk. 8. 45.) when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding who toucht Him? <hi>Seest thou the multitude thronging thee, and sayst thou who toucheth me?</hi> so say I, when we see such a multitude of changes and evils in the world, thronging of Prodigies before and after, shal wee be so vain, as to ask what persons death, or what event is toucht upon and pointed unto in their meaning and signification?</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>This plea builds upon a most unfaithfull and sinking foundation,</hi> viz. the credit of all those prodigious narrations which books and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon discourse are stuft out withall: which will shrink to a mean account, if we consider how prone a faith men have for such kind of relations as these, arising either from a vain opinion of themselves, (as if worthy for whose sake God should be continually altering of nature, and making of signs) or too high a conceit of men and the concerns of this life, <note n="f" place="margin">Undenam constat Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas ad aliquid nobis signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candum usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pari? an ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unde quam ex vanitate qua miseri turgessimus, dum digni nobis ipsis vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demur, propter quos haec ostenia fiant? <hi>Gassend.

                  <p>3. <hi>God may possibly</hi> sometimes <hi>in judgement, bring an evil upon men,</hi> (but falsly conceiv'd) <hi>presaged by a prodigie.</hi> It is not unlikely that the evils thought portended by prodigies are often consequent to<note place="margin">Excessus fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae, res ut pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fana, ita sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per infelix <hi>Verul.

                  <p>That which may possibly pass with some for no rash example to abet this assertion is the instance of <hi>Vespasians</hi> death, of whom its recorded, that when notice was given him of a Comet, then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, as a presage of his death; He bad the Relaters to deliver this message to the King of <hi>Parthia, Ille comatus, ego autem calvus;</hi> meaning, that seeing that King wore long hair, it seem'd most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that this <hi>stella crinita</hi> (as the Romans call'd it) did portend his death rather then the Emperour <hi>Vespasians</hi> who was bald: But the Emperour dyed before the extinction of this Comet, and that King surviv'd both.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We are further told, that by removing of the received<note place="margin">Objection 2.</note> Opinion of Prodigies and signs, we remove a main pillar, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the faith of a Divine Providence [of a God, concern'd in all the affairs of the world] and that we hereby strengthen the hands of Atheism, and few pillours under the elbows of secure and sleepy wickedness.</p>
                  <p>I answer, <hi>Its rather the way to make men Atheists to tell them, these</hi>

                     <hi>are Gods signs of things which they see seldom or never come to pass.</hi> All arguments brought in defence of a truth men are willing to free their minds of, if they doe not fully prove, doe hugely weaken and disparage it; like weak Physick, which if it drive not forth the ill humour, doth by accident exasperate it, and make the patient, worse: and therefore it is no way safe to trust so great and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant an article of our faith, with so feeble and aery a proof as this is. If an Atheist can believe that the world came by chance into all this beauty and elegant order, and the severall sphears of beings to maintain so gratefull an harmony in their motions, without some great intelligence to give law and measure to them; He will more easily perswade himself, that things run by chance sometimes into discord, monstrousness, and deformity.</p>

                  <p>And therefore if we had a more faithfull <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Anomals in Nature,</hi> (the want whereof is owing not a little to the superstition of men, which stains all it toucheth) we might be soon able to see beyond the surface of those things, which as yet seem plac'd in the world, but to confound and pose us.

                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Such unwonted occurrences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> give us to understand that the most common rules of natural operation are not without exception, nor her most known laws simply immutable;</hi> God is able to overthrow Nature by it self, by appointing one Natural cause to disturb and countermand the weaker efforts of another.

                  <p>First, The great <hi>disparity of signs;</hi> the signs whereof the Text is understood, were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Signa moralia,</hi> signs of a moral Nature, such as were the gradual lessening of the lustre and glory of the Jewish Polity and pedagogy; by the ceasing of prophecy, the absence of the heavenly fire, the arke of the Covenant, the <hi>Shechinah,</hi> the Oracles by <hi>Urim and Thummim,</hi> from the second Temple; the lapsing of the government from Kings to Dukes, from Dukes to the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> from them to the Romanes; there having been no Kings types of Christ after <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> (except <hi>Hezekiah</hi> be admitted a candidate for that honour) This vanishing splendour of the face of Moses (that Oeconomy whereof he was the minister) was a sign that the <hi>Sun of Righteousness</hi> was now a rising, under whom a state of more spiritual and inward glory was shortly to obtain.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Signa praedicta, signs of times</hi> long before spoken of, and of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and scriptural institution; such as were, the <hi>departing</hi> (in a good degree at least) <hi>of the Sceptre from Iudah,</hi> the near expireing of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels weeks,</hi> the coming of <hi>Iohn the Baptist in the Spirit of Elias,</hi> the general expectation of the <hi>Messias</hi> about that time rais'd up in the minds of men.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Signa miraculosa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> the mighty signs and wonders (every way equal to those upon which the credit of the Mosaical dispensation was built) which attended the person and doctrine of our Saviour,<note place="margin">Jo. 10. 25. Mat. 11. 5.</note> and to which (as his visible witnesses) he sometimes made his appeal.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the <hi>signs of times,</hi> I contend against, are neither of any moral nature, (speaking not to the Reason, but the phancy of men) neither were they ever foretold, (God doth not now appear so far to value the world as to usher any change in the affairs thereof, by the promises of a Prodigie) nor are they miraculous, the power of Nature (in such a coincidence of causes) being able to reach the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of any of these prodigious signs.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>The disparity of things signified;</hi> All the forementioned signs were <hi>tokens for good,</hi> but as the blushings of the Evening before the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that happy day, wherein, a state big and good enough for the title of the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> was to take place. Besides, they were matters of no narrow and private reference (the fall of some Great Person, or the commencing of some petty war) but of a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick concern, such wherein the felicities of Jew and Gentile were bound up, (matters big enough for the solemnity of a sign to preface and bring on. The things signified were also matters of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41213:31"/>
huge importance [as, that <hi>Iesus</hi> was the promised Messiah, that all the shadows, and rites of the law, were to expire and conclude (like the <hi>Phaenix</hi> in a nest of spices) in the graces, truths and glories of the Gospel-state; that the <hi>wall of partition</hi> was now to be taken away, and all Nations to own themselves brethren under one common Father] These things, all men were concern'd to know and believe, and therefore God taught them by great signs, as well as excellent Preachers. Whereas Prodigies are suppos'd the signs of wrath and judgements, which yet often surprize men (not unfitly therefore<note place="margin">Ps. 144. 6.</note> stil'd <hi>Gods arrows,</hi> which give a fatal, but withall a suddain an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>3. The <hi>disparity of the times spoken of</hi> (in that Text) from our own: The times there intended, were times rather present then fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whereas all the changes which chequer and vary the times of the World now, are of no name and reckoning, if compar'd with this. The world is so acquainted with civil changes, that I should expect a Prodigie rather to give notice of some days of peace and settled tranquillity (to which the world is the greatest stranger)</p>
                  <p>4. The <hi>Disparity between the Persons to whom those words were spoken, and our selves;</hi> The Jews were a People so us'd to signs, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, 1 Cor. 1. 22. <hi>the Iews require a sign.</hi> And it was the vulgar opinion amongst them, that as all extraordinary Prophets were to seal their commission with a miracle, so all events extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary were to be foreshewn by a sign. Hence the Jews come to<note place="margin">Mar. 8. 11.</note> our Saviour with that bold demand, <hi>What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest all these things?</hi> Jo. 2. 18. and the Disciples (upon the credit of this common conceit) no sooner heir our Saviour fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell strange events in reference to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and the Temple, but<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 4.</note> they presently ask him [<hi>what shall be the sign, when all these things shall come to pass?</hi>] God perhaps gave them signs, to assure them that the evils which befell them arose not out of the dust, but came upon them from the fore-appointing counsels of heaven; and to awaken their dull and worldly minds into a lively sense of his justice and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. But now in the broad day light of the Gospel, 'tis expected that we should not need awakening by any such monitors into a sense and awe of the Divine Majesty. We must now believe without a

Ezek. 32. 7, 8. Joel. 2. 10. Isai. 13. 10. 34. 4. Ezek. 30. 18. Rev. 6. 12. 8. 12.

Particularly the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note n="*" place="margin">Locutiones istae decaligne solis &amp; lunae multis in locis reperiuntur, nusquam au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem sensu physico sed sensu figurato. <hi>In Mat. c. 24. com. 27.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Grotius</hi> is so secure of a figurative sense of such places, that he tells us, they are never to be expounded (in all scripture) to any other. And indeed should we expound them literally, we should soon honour the falls of great men, or destruction of cities, with greater (or as great) wonders, as attended the crucifixion of our blessed Saviour. Besides, what Histories ever mention any such asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing alterations in the frame of Nature, as the literal sense of these places would introduce a faith of?</p>
                  <p>Now the Prophets chose thus to deliver themselves, for some or all of these Reasons;</p>
                  <p>1. Because it was the custom of the Eastern Nations, to describe great and mighty storms and troubles in a state, in such phrases as these, <hi>the darkning of the heavens, falling of the stars, shaking of the earth, flying away of the Mountains, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Because these being the most remarkable and glorious bodies in the world, terrible alterations in them, seem the most proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives of mighty changes and alterations in kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>3. Because the terrible judgements of God upon the <hi>Babylonians, Egyptians, Iews and obstinate Gentiles</hi> (set forth in such expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions) were but <hi>supremi judicii specimina,</hi> little images and types of the last and dreadfull judgement; and therefore not unfitly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter'd by the terrours and horrours which shall usher that last and great Day.</p>
                  <p>4. Because these are expressions mighty and vehement, and so very expressive of, and sutable unto, that hot and vigorous impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion which the Spirit of Prophecy made upon the minds and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of those holy men which were acted by it.</p>
                  <p>5. Because that anxiety and perplexity of mind, which should attend the plagues coming on men, should be as great almost, as if they saw the eye of heaven (<hi>the sun</hi>) put out, and the earth to tremble under them, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now, (in this figurative sense) the words were accomplished in their first and original intention, when that great misery was brought<note place="margin">Is. 7. 20. Jer. 47. 5.</note> upon the earth by <hi>Nabuchodonosor;</hi> and they receiv'd a further degree of accomplishment (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> intimates, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 19.) under the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, when the land which was but <hi>shaven before by Gods hired Razor,</hi> had an utter <hi>baldness</hi> brought upon it (to use the expression of the Prophet.) and it shall have its fulfilling in the outmost latitude of its sense, at the day of judgment (of which some Interpreters solely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it) Propecies have their <hi>Gradus &amp; Scalus comple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>enti,</hi> (as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> speaks) the last day only is that true <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>fulness of time,</hi> wherein they shall be completely fulfilled. God often draws similar and parallel lines of confusion, over different times and places, whips many stubborn children with the same rod, and therefore prophesies of the same vengeance may have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated accomplishments.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Some learned men understand in these places a real and literal darkning of these great bodies of light, though arising not from any common and natural, but an extraordinary and supernatural cause. The reasons of which exposition, I shall remit to their proper place; which (if they appear satisfactory) nothing can be thence conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in favour of presages by these Prodigies, which are but some more unusual effects lying hid in the powers of natural Agents, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times exerting themselves.</p>
                  <p>There is one place of Scripture more which may seem to some to <hi>require</hi> (perhaps to refuse) an answer, <hi>viz.</hi> that Luke 21. 11. where our Blessed Saviour (foretelling that large line of confusion to be stretched out upon the Holy City, and whole nation of the Jews, as as a precedent signe thereof, tells his Disciples, <hi>Great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences,</hi> &amp;c. now <hi>earthquakes</hi> have been numbred with Prodigies natural.</p>
                  <p>I answer, First, <hi>When God hath once sealed them by his sanction and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, Prodigies natural may be regarded as the signs of events arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and supernatural.</hi> Gods bow (without a string) in the heavens, is to us a signe that the world need never fear perishing by any such fatal arrow as once was shot out of the clouds; [A universal deluge] although it be owing to a natural and necessary cause; as being [by Gods institution] advanc'd to the dignity of a signe of grace and favour. Thus when God had told the people that, as an expression of his great displeasure against them for asking of a king, He would send thunder and rain (things in themselves natural, except it be said that the peculiar condition of that season and climate, made them approach to a miracle) it was a religious fear with which<note place="margin">1 Sam. 12.</note> the people entertain'd their coming. God may appoint the crowing of a cock (at such an instant of time) to be one of his signs. So, when the Disciples had asked a signe of their Lord, when all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions<note place="margin">Luke 21. 7.</note> concerning the Temple and Nation, should come to pass, and he had mentioned (amongst others) <hi>Great earthquakes,</hi> they were then prefer'd a kinde of Sacraments and prophetick symbols of the terrible shaking of the Jewish worship and polity now approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And indeed when the great wickedness and security of that generation had merited, that that fatal time should fall as a <hi>snare upon all them that then dwelt on the earth:</hi> such signs as had a natural cause seemed the most proper indications thereof, as which (because hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening at that time) might sufficiently warn and alarm the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and lull faster asleep the more Atheistical and incredulous part of that age; appearing to them, but the more unusual works of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted nature. To conclude now, that because some earthquakes, of Gods appointing, were his signs, therefore all are, is as inconse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent an inference as this; the bread and wine are signs and seals in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41213:33"/>
the Sacrament, because stampt with a divine institution; therefore all bread and wine may challenge the same degree of reverence and regard from us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, These earthquakes had such characters upon them as might sufficiently inclose and distinguish them from the common is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues of disturbed nature; As,</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Their greatness,</hi> the Text styles them <hi>great earthquakes.</hi> It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Amos 1. 1. 1 King. 19. 11.</note> there appeared in them more then the bare force and impatience of some crude and imprisoned vapours. We read of an earthquake in the days of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> so great and terrible, that we finde it made an <hi>Epocha</hi> in the Jewish histories. <hi>Iosephus</hi> reports that some furlongs of the mountains about <hi>Ierusalem</hi> were rent asunder, and cities swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by it. If <hi>Aristotle</hi> styled the <hi>Celtae</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, mad men, because an earthquake would sooner make a mountain tremble then them: certainly the title is too little for those which are not impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive to some fear of God, when they see him thus let loose the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and forces of natural agents upon them.</p>
                  <p>2. Their <hi>multitude</hi> [there were <hi>earthquakes in divers places</hi>] Nature ran often against her bias in the same instances, that so the effect might not be intituled to the rub of some casual impediment, but to the hand of heaven over-ruling and directing it. And should I here grant (which I see no reason to do) that many and great earthquakes in a continent especially, are a signe of some approaching evil, our adversaries could advance little upon the concession, both because the example will I believe be found a heteroclite, and to stand alone in the History of Nature, as also because I conceive they would not adventure to compare a monster or fiery meteor with the terrours of so many earthquakes (generally singled out in Scripture, as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitours of the Divine power and majesty)</p>
                  <p>3. Their <hi>dismal attendants.</hi> The creatures would not nourish such rebels against heaven as were then upon earth. [there were <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nines</hi>] the air refused to cherish and refresh them. [there were <hi>pestilences</hi>] the eyes of heaven shrunk away from such hated objects [<hi>the lights of heaven were darkned</hi>] the earth groaned and staggered in a sort, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her vile burden [there were <hi>earthquakes in divers places</hi>] so that these signs might, as letters do, speak that to a pious fear, in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which they could not have done in separation.</p>
                  <p>4. Their <hi>Divine prediction.</hi> [There <hi>shall be</hi> earthquakes] and each earthquake was a signe, not as <hi>Eventus mirabilis,</hi> but as <hi>Eventus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 10. 3. 7.</note> Saul his meeting of <hi>three men, carrying three kids, and three loaves, and a bottle of wine,</hi> when he parted from <hi>Samuel,</hi> might have been received with the slight and passing notices of a casual and common accident, had it not been foretold by the Prophet, as a signe of Gods presence with him. And thus any of these earthquakes might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have been received but with the common wonder which any rare and prodigious occurrence calls forth; but because foretold, it was a signe when it came to pass, that that eye of prescience which could foresee an event which held of no certain cause, did with as much truth and certainty foresee that fearfull desolation approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41213:33"/>
whereof it was appointed a signe and symbol. So that this place of Scripture appears to lend as little strength and support to that weak and falling cause, which seeks for confidence and assistance from it, as the foregoing.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Concerning Prodigies Preternatural.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Prodigies Preternatural, what. The observation of them, proved a hurtfull vanity: The profane opinion the Heathen had of God, upon the presence of any of them, noted from their writings. The evil influence they have upon the minds of men now: A double account given of the prevalence of this perswasion. The conceit of Gods giving forth some shadows and pictures of his great works before he set about them, toucht upon. The Authours judgement of Apparitions delivered in five Conclusions. An enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the truth of the Prodigies mentioned in <hi>Josephus.</hi> The wonderfull Prodigies mentioned in <hi>Ovid</hi> and the <hi>Sibylline</hi> Oracles, whence taken.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALl the Extraordinaries in the world which fall out by no steady and certain rules and causes (Such as are the approach of a <hi>strange and unknown kinde of fish to the shore, the firing of houses by light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, disorderly ebbs and flows of the sea, some spots as it were of bloud appearing in stones or statues,</hi> and a hundred such like) to serve as I can the distinctness of the Discourse I style <hi>Prodigies Preternatural.</hi> All which as soon as fastning upon my hand, I shall shake off (as the <hi>Apostle</hi> did the venemous beast) and deliver the observation of them to that smoke and darkness, whence it did at first proceed, that my Reader nor my self derive no infection from so hurtfull and headless a vanity.</p>
               <p>1. I style the observation of such things a <hi>very hurtfull vanity.</hi> The regarding of these and the like occurrences as presages of evil, served heretofore, but to cherish in men, this deformed thought of God, that (all things being subject to the law of an insuperable Faté and a blinde necessity) all he could do, was onely to foresee an evil, and so, to piece out his power with his courtesie, by these and the like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, to awaken men to shift for themselves, and as they could, to get out of the way, or to strengthen themselves by resolution when
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41213:34"/>
any blinde and fatal causes were ready to rush furiously upon them. A matter which may appear from the words of <hi>Ovid,</hi> where (speaking of <hi>Venus</hi>) he thus delivers himself,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Verba jacit, Superósque movet, qui rumpere quanquam<note place="margin">Ovid. Metam. l. 15.</note>

                  </l>

               </lg>
               <p>Now Poets, (though in a matter of History they usually follow <hi>ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um proprium,</hi> and stretch out by the force of imagination a matter which shrinks of it self to a short and simple narration, yet) in a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter of opinion commonly follow <hi>ingenium temporum,</hi> and take liberty to express freely the common thoughts of the times wherein they live. That this was one of those gross phantasms which abused the minds of men, in the darkness of Gentilism, may appear more fully from the words of a more severe and serious Writer, <hi>Valerius Maximus,</hi> who having told us of the several strange Prodigies, as the finger of God held up to warn <hi>Pompey</hi> (before his encounter with <hi>Cesar</hi>) or to<note place="margin">Invictae leges necessitatis, pectus alioqui ab amentia remotum, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digia ista ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stâ aestimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one perpendere passae non sunt.</note> declare his fall; He infers from them, that the Deity evidenced [<hi>Se Pompeii errorem inhibere voluisse,</hi>] a great willingness to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the errour and rashness of <hi>Pompey,</hi> but onely the insuperable laws of Fate would not permit him (though otherwise a person so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and advised enough) to weigh all those forewarnings in the balances of counsel and consideration.</p>
               <p>And if the Opinion concerning presages by such or the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, do not now comfort and a bet any such base perswasions concerning God, in some minds, it is well: sure I am, if they do not give men to think that God is under the power of Fate, yet they little less then assure that Events are: For either the intimations by such kinde of signs are (as the shadows of the mountains) ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, moveable, and vain; and then, why do men at all regard. them? or they are certain and undoubted; and if so, they place the Event beyond the redress of counsel and endeavour, and they call upon men onely <hi>fortiter ferre,</hi> to ride out the tempest approaching with as much courage and resolution as they can. (the evils, both to the state and religion, in the womb of which opinion, swell so visibly out, that it is needless, by any further argument, to rip it up and lay them forth to common view and notice.)</p>
               <p>Besides, the Opinion greatly tends to lessen and degrade the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of Heaven in our thoughts, while it prefers any such weak and pitifull occasions to the repute of Gods trumpets to give notice that he is now going forth to some great act of justice upon the world: it aims also directly to a lessening of our faith of the Divine Goodness and Kindness, while it teacheth us to imagine we discover a <hi>Fury</hi> in every strange issue of Providence: and to conclude it is mercy ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is Gods strange work (the black ensigns of wrath and vengeance being continually hung out in one unusual accident or
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41213:34"/>
other) It tends also to leaven the minds of men with sowre thoughts of Providence, as if designed to bereave men, not onely of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness but the hopes and shadows thereof, and (as <hi>Benjamin</hi> did his mother) first to pain and torture them by mighty fears, and then to kill them by some great evil;</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>—Sic coeca futuri</l>
                  <l>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ns hominum fati, liceat sperare timenti.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Finally, the Opinion doth make even good men too much to concern themselves in the affairs, and issues of things in this worthless and giddy world; to stretch themselves into Gods line, by inquiries after things wrapt up in futurity; and fills them too full of vain hopes or fears, to take up with composed and thankfull minds in that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent portion which the hand of Providence deals out to them</p>
               <p>2. The observation of any such objects of common wonder, as presages, is also a <hi>groundless, headless vanity.</hi> The person that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his thoughts and studies much with them, gives (like those in that famine. 2 Kings 6.) a great price for an <hi>asses head.</hi> The Opinion (like the image of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>) while it pretends to a <hi>head of gold,</hi> to promise Oracles and the knowledge of futurities, it stands for ought I can discover; but upon these two weak feet of clay,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Narrow and scanty observation;</hi> Men (it may be) have here tofore observed some few evils to tread close upon the heels of these or the like Prodigies, and therefore are easily perswaded that they were ushered by them; and they can never after shew themselves, but it is presumed they come forth to deliver some sad and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full message. It is this also hath given credit to the observation of some, as <hi>auspicious,</hi> others as <hi>inauspicious</hi> days in the life of some great Persons, especially, viz. the observation of some happy or unhappy Events which the womb of such a morning hath perhaps twice or<note place="margin">Psal. 110. 3.</note> thrice brought forth unto men. As there are <hi>lusus Naturae,</hi> of which before; so (be it spoken with reverence) there are <hi>lusus Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae:</hi> God is pleased to display his multifarious Wisdom in the many pretty varieties in Nature; and seems delighted with some pleasant constancies and uniformities in the works of Providence; whereof the sending of many great blessings or afflictions upon a person, just on such a day of the week, or returning year, is an especial instance; and this perhaps to try whether we be such <hi>men in understanding</hi> as not to suffer any distrust of his providence to break in upon us upon such a day, or after such accidents, because of some little disasters formerly befalling us then, more then at another time.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Weak and childish dislike of things;</hi> Objects and Persons we conceive a kinde and courteous Opinion of, we can easily perswade ourselves come forth with good tidings; we can readily look for<note place="margin">a Sam. 18. 27.</note> an emblem of peace from the lovely dove. But where matters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull fall before us, we usually serve our little hatreds, by deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon them the Opinion of being ill abodements, and we quickly conceit, that they come about us (like the hated birds of night) against a time of mourning. For we may observe that the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41213:35"/>
occurrences to which imagination hath affixed the Opinion of their being ill <hi>Omens,</hi> are generally such as we shrink from, and follow with dislike, <hi>as the firing of houses by lightning, monstrous and desormed births, dreadfull eclipses, apparitions in the air, strange voices heard in the night, earthquakes, bloudy waters,</hi> &amp;c. We hate these things and therefore avenge ourselves of them, as we can, by a vain conceit, that they <hi>prophesie onely evil things concerning us.</hi> This Opinion then having no better support to trust unto, it were to over-value it, to put forth any great strength of reason, to throw it down.</p>
               <p>Onely perhaps some contemplative Persons may perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that the foundation of this Opinion is not laid so much upon the surface, as I would make my Reader to believe; for as there was a pretty conceit among some of the Ancient and more my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical sort of Philosophers, that all things in the upper and <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible world,</hi> were limned forth in some parallel instances and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar figures here below, and that <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but the true fillings up of things sensible, which carry but some general and rude lines and images of them; thus some persons seem strongly perswaded, that all the greater works of God are pourtrayed, and shadowed out first in some little pictures and images of them, and that therefore many strange acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and to be received as a kinde of <hi>sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of things to come,</hi> &amp; as a sort of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> exemplars and types of some great and unusual work to follow after. Thus the sinking of the <hi>Lambeth Ferry-boat</hi> with the <hi>Arch-Bishops</hi> coach-horses, and coach-men, to the bottom of the <hi>Thames, Sept.</hi> 19. 1633. the very<note place="margin">Authour of the Breviat of the life of <hi>Arch-Bish. Laud. p. 35.</hi>
                  </note> first day he removed from <hi>Fulham</hi> to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> was (saith one) <hi>no doubt a presage of his own and the Arch-Bishopricks sinking through his pride and violence:</hi> (with as good reason may I add, that their swimming again at last, was a signe that the function should at last appear above wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.) But I believe it will appear to the most altogether unnecessary to bestow much breath to break this pretty bubble, which hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but wind therein, and will break and refute it self, by its own aiery, unstable and transparent principles: though perhaps with some (that know not to distinguish between an argument and a similitude) the conceit may appear of more value and moment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apparitions</hi> whether (in the air) of Armies of cities, or by any particular application of Angels good or bad in a way of counsel and conference (reckoned among <hi>Prodigies Preternatural,</hi> no power transcendent to created being exerted in them) may perhaps appear in this place, argument big enough to deserve a more serious and particular examination. In which undertaking, I may hope for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, if (standing in no better light) I hit the butt though not the white, and deliver what may seem most consistent with so briety and approach nearest to the truth.</p>
               <p>All that I think fit to offer in this Argument, shall be disposed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these five <hi>Propositions;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>There have been some such apparitions as these mentioned.</hi> I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily<note place="margin">Propos. 1.</note> grant that this Argument (like an enchanted house) is full
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41213:35"/>
of Phantasms, and delusive images; and that many stories of this Nature there are which like Spectres are filled out in shew with body and substance, which when we come to handle and examine by making search into their grounds and evidence, we shall find them vanishing into the ayr of common report, or the single testimony of some superstitious or melancholy imaginant. And therefore (I know) many men are not at all impressive to any such relations, but look upon them all but as (apparitions indeed) things which never advanc'd nearer to realities, then the images of a dream.</p>
               <p>Look as in Religion, some men (to present God but with a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering faith) take great pleasure to invent new mysteries there in, to fancy a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, some what inexplicable in every article thereof, till they have made it a contradiction to the most natural maximes and easy sense of our minds, and a scandal to men that can discourse; so others are very busy in filling up every depth, and removing every real mystery therein, till they have left no image or footstep of its unsearchable Authour, thereupon thus it comes to pass in the matters of providence, some men are hugely taken with mysteries therein, delighted to hear and relate <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> somewhat new and strange, their <hi>pia Mater</hi> is alway big with some religious <hi>Legend,</hi> or <hi>prophecy,</hi> to obtrude upon the easy world as a divine discovery. Others again would remove all prodigies, apparitions, and what ever goes off from the figures and measures of common and ordinary, and know not to admit a perswasion of any thing, of whose causes, ends or examples, they are not aware.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucian</hi> commends this temper in <hi>Epicurus, Democritus, Metrodorus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Alexand.</note> that if any thing rare and wonderfull, fell before their considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they had put on <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a resolution as inflexible as adamant to endeavour a solution thereof, and its reduction to the proper ends and causes: which if they were able to doe, well and good; but if not, to arrest all further search and wonder with this sentence, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it is a lie, and impossible to be at all. (An easy art to maintain the repute of understanding men!) And we shall not seldom find men (especially such as are arrived at no great experience of themselves or things) advancing the length of their own understanding and experience (like as our Einglish King did his arme) the common standard and measure of the truth or falshood of things; an instance of which temper appears in their slow and heavy motion to a faith of such things (appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among the rest) whose natures, causes, ends or patterns fall not within their compass. But certainly as to be of a waxen faith, impressive to any narrations of this nature, is an instance of softness and superstition, so an obstinate and pertinacious incredulity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a little to Atheism, because removing one of the greatest and most pregnant arguments of a Deity, and gives cause of suspicion that the Person hath <hi>ingenium difficulter sanabile</hi> in Religion, which (as we may observe) is so managed, as to suppose men candid and ingenuous, such as will sit down with high probabilities, where the condition of the things to be believed, admits not evidence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41213:36"/>
The stories of all times are full of relations of such<note place="margin">Cardan. De Rer. Variet. <hi>l. 14. c. 69. &amp; l. 15. c. 78.</hi> Gros. Magic. de spectris. <hi>Propos. 2.</hi> Ioseph. de Bel. Iud. <hi>l. 7. c. 12.</hi>
                  </note> things as these, and therefore unbelief in this particular, is guilty of the rudeness of giving the lie to the world. They which have <hi>itching ears</hi> for such stories may have them sufficiently scratcht by <hi>Cardanus, Grosius,</hi> and other writers in this curious argument.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It seems probable that some Apparitions in the ayr have been intended the Monitors of some judgement approaching.</hi> I shall instance but in two examples; One mentioned by <hi>Iosephus,</hi> who tells us that a little before the destruction of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> by the Romane army [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] there appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other prodigies chariots and armed companies of horsmen issuing out of the clouds, and intercepting the heavens with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of their troops, which was received by him and others (not so drunk with pride and opinion as the rest) a representation <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) of the marching forth of the great <hi>Lord of hosts</hi> with all warlike appoyntments to take vengeance of that rebellious city and nation.</p>
               <p>Our other example shall be taken from an Authour credited by Apostolical citation, the writer of the <hi>book of Maccabees,</hi> who speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Hebr. 11. 35, 36.</note> of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> thus delivers himself,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It happened that through all the city, for the space of almost</hi> 40. <hi>days there were seen horsmen running in the ayr, in cloth of gold, and armed with</hi>

                  <hi>And troops of horsmen in array, encountring one against another, with shakeing of shields, and multitude of pikes and drawing of swords, and cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of darts, and glittering of golden ornaments, and harness of all sorts.</hi> After the mention of which apparition, we may read there what a scene of woes and tragedies the City was made by the Armies of <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I think we may discover some probable and darker cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of divine signs upon these examples, but especially the first; And that,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Because our Saviour prophesied that the desolation of that people, should</hi>

               <p>These considerations incline me to receive this narration and the significancy thereof (especially because not knowing where to fix the accomplishment of our Saviours prediction, Luk. 21. 11. but

in this and some other prodigies related by <hi>Iosephus</hi>) with the favour of a great probability, but not as an undoubted truth.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Because the single credit of Iosephus (Eusebius</hi> but relating the same things in his words) <hi>seems scarce sufficient to venture the faith of such a story upon,</hi> both because having much converst among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, he seems to smell a little of the Gentile superstition, when he adds, immediately after this relation, <hi>It would seem a matter scarce credible, but that there follow'd evils great enough for the solemnity of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages;</hi> as also because it will appear upon a compare of the same. Stories related in Scripture and <hi>Iosephus,</hi> that he usually tunes his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to the common humour both of Greek and Latine Historians, making them to sound as much as much as might be to the glory and honour of his own Nation.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Because he hath put in one fly</hi> (the story of a Heifer, which come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">

Can any man think God would ever work so ludicrous, so cheap, so insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant a miracle?</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Because, whereas he there also relates the story of the Priests their going into the Temple about Pentecost to attend the Sacra Vespertina,</hi> and hearing that voyce therein <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>let us goe hence,</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with the rushing as of persons going out, the whole matter seems but a fable originally invented by some superstitious heathen (and a little disguis'd) whose usual doctrine was that the <hi>Gods</hi> when their Temples and Altars were defil'd, or taken, us'd to take pett, and (<hi>adytis arisque relictis</hi>) to betake themselves to some more hallow'd<note place="margin">Expansae su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitò sores delubri, &amp; audita major humana vox, excedere Deos, simul ingens motus excedentium. <hi>Hist.

                  </note> and magnificent shrines. Sure I am, <hi>Tacitus</hi> appears to understand this relation to some such sense as this. But I think I need not much concern my self to throw out a relation, which hath had peaceable possession of the common faith for so many ages; for (to say no more) 'tis in many regards, an example extraordinary, and 'tis a good maxime, <hi>examples extraordinary neither break a rule, nor make one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon which account alone, I have no great fear that the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance wil much prejudice our cause though I allow both a truth and a significancy to that apparition: though perhaps I should not have judg'd so much in favour thereof had I not been brib'd by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which the suffrages of so many wise men, and the antiquity of the Authour seem to drive upon that <hi>Apocryphal</hi> writing wherein it is found.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>There appears not now any ground at all to receive any such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Propos. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>in the ayr as the certain signs and monitours of any calamities to ensue upon a Nation,</hi> and that,</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Because we have no warrant from the Book of God, so to regard them, having no precept at all to oblige us, nor yet any example therein to encourage us.</hi> The signs of future events which we sometimes find God making use of, were such as (out of their institution) were no way apt to foreshew any any such event; they were most commonly <hi>signa</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:41213:37"/>
                  <hi>ad placitum,</hi> such as carried no similitudes of the things whereof they were signs (as the apparitions of armies in the air seem to do of some succeeding battel) that so none might be encouraged afterward to regard them as <hi>Omens,</hi> when again occurring; and fancy that they ministred at all to the vanity of any such observations. Now a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative argument from Scripture, seems conclusive enough, in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherein the faith of a Divine prescience and providence, and mans dutifull observance of God in the way of his judgements, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear so much concerned and assisted, as we are told they are in the religious observation of such things as these.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Such kinde of signs would lay men naked and exposed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual delusions and impostures:</hi> for how often do the antick shapes of the clouds, serve the imaginations of dragons, and armies in the air? That word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Zech. 10. 1. which we render clouds, the LXX (by a verbal mistake of the radix) translate <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritiones:</hi> and a melancholy fancy is as subject (to this real mistake) the translating of clouds into apparitions of Churches or castles, or armies. Can any serious Person then believe that God would have us apply our selves to such a <hi>Proteus</hi> as a cloud is, for a solution of any doubt <hi>de futuro,</hi> which can shift into any shapes and forms of things? Hath he not all along appear'd to value our understandings at a higher rate, then to require them to a regard of things so expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to suspicion and the conceit of some imposture?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Such kinde of apparitions in the air, have been known not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by any black and tragical Event.</hi> The truth is, Wisdom (which useth to draw her lines by the steady and even rule of some well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed principles) hath not appear'd so critical an observer of such accidents and their Events, as folly hath been; and therefore we are not so well provided of examples to reprehend this vanity, as<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sandys</hi> his Transl. <hi>Ovid.</hi> Met. p. 291.</note> otherwise we might be. I must therefore satisfie my self with a single instance which occurrs in a learned and sober Writer, who delivers it as a matter reported to him by Persons of good credit, how that in the year before he recorded that relation, there were<note place="margin">Anno 1629.</note> 
                  <hi>seen two opposite Battalions in the air, lancing out their spears, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging (as it were) their muskets, victory now reeling, and in the end one side giving chase to the other.</hi> Whereas all these things proved but <hi>è vitro fulgura,</hi> being followed onely with jubilees and the <hi>voice of joy and peace</hi> in our dwellings for many years. Nor can they be (with any colour of reason) presumed to foreshew our succeeding civil wars, being removed by the distance of so many years. Now, one negative instance in such cases, is of more force to unfix and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit a pretending rule, then two affirmatives to establish it; because the latter (the world being so full of evils) may fall out by a kinde of chance, or the agency of seducing Spirits, whereas the former seem to proclaim some necessity of the Event in nature, and the no purpose at all of God to give notice of any of his counsels by any such emergencies as these.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>I doubt not but many of these aery apparitions might be solved by a natural cause.</hi> To let pass the conceit of real armies somewhere
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41213:38"/>
fighting on earth, reflected in the clouds as in a glass, (as at best, but an ingenuous vanity) the supposed firing of Ordinance and muskets, is I believe generally nothing but the coruscation of some incensed exhalations breaking forth by pauses and intervals from the clouds, and (as thunder doth) with the noises and terrours of those military engines: The running to and fro of hors-men and companies may be represented to an active fancy, by the clouds car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the unconstant force of the winds to very giddy and unequal figures and motions. The stands of pikes and spears may be but the ragged and deformed protuberances of the disturbed clouds. Onely I am apt to believe that Nature draws the images of these things in such rude and imperfect figures, that men are forced much to assist and quicken the dulness and defectiveness of the type by the ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of imagination.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Some of these aery apparitions and noises are managed with that method and artifice, come forth in such chosen seasons</hi> (if we credit relations) <hi>that I doubt not to intitle them to the power and operation of the Aery Principality.</hi> Impure Spirits (like juglers) may oft do strange tricks, to call upon themselves the regards of the world, and when they see causes big with their effects, may by such signs foreshew them, to derive upon themselves, either the Opinion of presci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or of some great affection to men, whom they awaken, though indeed it be, but as <hi>Delilah</hi> did <hi>Samson,</hi> when (the Philistines) some great evils are just upon them; or else (as S. <hi>Austin</hi> speaks) <hi>noxiae curiositatis retibus implicare,</hi> to fly-blow the minds of men with curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and impertinent enquiries into times to come.</p>
               <p>Sure I am, we finde the Appearances of armies and the noise of arms and trumpets in the air, found among such bad company (so many hatefull <hi>Omens</hi> and Prodigies observed by the Heathen) as is sufficient to blemish them, and to give suspicion that the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and production of both, was owing to the same Father of lies. <hi>Ovid</hi> having mentioned the noise of armies and trumpets heard in<note place="margin">Ubi supr.</note> the clouds, relates (as presages of equal place and repute) the weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Statues, the wandring of Ghosts, the odd figures and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Sacrifice, and the like doth <hi>Virgil</hi> in that place so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten cited.</p>
               <p>The Devil well knew that without the maintaining of some O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of his foresight in the minds of men, the fires on his altars would quickly go out, and therefore he appointed all the changes in the <hi>Exta,</hi> in the face of heaven, in the births of creatures, in the flying of birds, &amp;c. as a kinde of signs from the Gods of some great and strange effects; which when he saw their causes to swell out withall, and just ready to be delivered of them, he could easily bring about, (all these little changes, falling within the compass of his power) that on which side soever the die of affairs fell, were the success of an undertaking on this side or that, he might still secure the repute of his prescience, by holding his easie Votaries in hand, that the preceding Prodigies were a warning of the things which fell out: and therefore he served the ends of imposture much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41213:38"/>
upon these dumb and doubtfull, then his speaking Oracles; wherein he hazarded his credit greatly by returning doubtfull or false solutions to the questions proposed to him <hi>de futuro:</hi> well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may the Devil be presumed (upon an easie foresight of some great disaster) to cause the entrails of the Sacrifice to put on a sad and unusual face: (and therefore the Poet upon such an accident, spake more truth then he was aware,
<q>—caesique in viscera Tauri Inferni venêre Dei.—</q>)
So also upon his sight of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching battel, he may easily give forth a prophetick emblem thereof, in some such martial images and impressions upon the aery Region, his proper province.</p>
               <p>If all this satisfie not, I shall readily deliver the Reader to the freedom of his own judgement in reference to such things. For my self, when I finde in the Book of God, that holy and heavenly <hi>Host,</hi> not called forth but to wait upon some great and important Services (the protection of a Patriarch, or a great Prophet, the declaration of the Birth of the Son of God, or perhaps to attend Gods great act of justice upon <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) I know not to entertain any such cheap and little thoughts of them as once to imagine that the Angels are ever sent forth to run a tilt in the air to finde the vain world talk, and to tell it news, or that God would ever confer the honour of so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and great a presage upon a paultrey battel at sea or land, which is generally intended but to serve the lusts and passions of men which have broken all those cords of love, precepts of charity, whereby they were bound one unto another.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Apparitions of evil Angels, in what places, forms, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Propos. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>and their premonitions by what voices, and signs soever, ought not to be attended unto as the prognosticks of any Events whatsoever.</hi> Many relations there are current in writers and common converse of such apparitions in very terrible forms, and that before some great plagues<note place="margin">V. D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> Serm. Luk. 13. 5. pag 18. D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>H. More</hi> Myst. Godl. li. 2. c. 2.</note> and wars: and I shall not once attempt to build my cause upon the ruines of the credit of them all. (we finde in Scripture, the fall of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan</hi> foretold by the apparition of an evil Angel) Such apparitions have happened (though generally in times and places of greatest ignorance and superstition) and that perhaps (as was said) that these lying Spirits may maintain an Opinion of their foresight of things (though the matters signified by them be such as may easily be discovered in their natural or moral causes) or to derive a suspicion upon the stories of Angelical apparitions in sacred Writ, or to get such a stock of credit, whereby they may set up cheaters with the less suspicion for the future: or perhaps in a kinde of petty triumph over those men whose sins together with their temptations, have betrayed them to such fearfull judgements; or perhaps (evil Angels being often the Executioners of his judgements) God will have these <hi>Apollyons</hi> seen (as it were) upon the stage before execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Psal. 78. 44.</note> that men may know and consider into whose hands, in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, their iniquities have betrayed them.</p>
               <p>But admit the depths of God or the Devil in such apparitions past
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41213:39"/>
our fathoming; sure I am we have no warrant at all to give any evil Spirit the honour of the least trust and regard, by an observance of any word, action or signe of his. God would disown one of his Royal titles, when once black'd and profaned by the Devils usurpation, Hos. 2. 16, 17. our Saviour refused a just and true testimony to his Divinity, when given in by the Father of lies, Mark 1. 24. Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants refuse his good creatures when once set upon the Devils table, 1 Cor. 10. 21. We are allowed no <hi>fellowship with devils,</hi> by whom truth is never told but to serve some delusion and imposture. And therefore though we read, Psal. 78. 49. that God sometimes made use of evil Angels as the <hi>Executioners</hi> of his judgements, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that he commissionated any of them to be the <hi>Denouncers</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>To receive therefore the apparitions, voices, drummings, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick noises of Spirits in any place whatsoever, as presages of some approaching evils (as if like some strange creatures in the sea, they used to shew themselves, and play in sight against a storm) is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult shame to our selves and our Religion; <hi>To our selves</hi>] because rendring our selves thereby to the suspicion of having a great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity and curiosity, (pregnant arguments of a soft, vain, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnished minde) <hi>To our Religion</hi>] deriving upon it an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of falshood in those many assurances it offers us of the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and impostures of those forsaken Spirits. Such apparitions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port nothing to us with truth and faithfulness, but (what they tempt men least to believe) the Being of a God; and so (as the Vipers flesh cures its own biting) enable us to quote the Devil against Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and to cast him out by himself. It is therefore our wisdom not to invite the Devil so far to be our Oracle as to vouchsafe the least credit or regard to any of his prophetick speeches, postures, actions; but to resolve to take the goodness and providence of God as secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity sufficient for the peace and composure of our minds, and not to put our selves out of his keeping (and so make way for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of any of them) by any distrustfull fears, arising from any signs whatsoever given forth by so sworn an enemy to God, truth, and the peace of man.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>The appearances of good Angels are now rarely given, hardly</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Propos. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>discovered, never to be expected;</hi> I say, <hi>Rarely given</hi>] I do not say, <hi>never,</hi> lest I speak without book. To omit some very probable rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this nature, that Apparition is usually thought a Herauld from heaven which advised <hi>Iames</hi> the fourth of <hi>Scotland</hi> (in whose counsels at that time the concerns of a Nation were wrapt up) to<note place="margin">See the story more fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Jackson, ubi suprà,</hi> from the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian.</note> forbear some vicious practices, but especially the fighting of his intended battel with the English; in those words, <hi>Rex, Ego ad te missus sum, ut te admoneam, ne quò instituisti progrediaris; quam admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitionem si neglexeris, non erit è re tua, nec eorum qui te comitabuntur.</hi> Which counsel he neglecting, himself, most of his Nobles, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my fell in that fatal battel. <hi>Hardly discovered</hi>] For how easily may the Devil impose upon our simplicity in the livery of an Angel of light? Though I think this negative signe of such an apparition,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41213:39"/>
faithfull enough, viz. That these Sons of God never debase them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to such antick shapes, Iudicrous postures and actions, monstrous forms, weak rites which evil spirits (designing to get to themselves the homage of a great fear from some men; or to abuse their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, or to dishonour the image and figure of man (whom they so much hate) or to appear rather ridiculous then abominable) usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally doe. <hi>Never to be expected</hi>] because never promised: besides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with Angels is a blessing which our state of infirmity could not bear, and our follies cannot well admit.</p>
               <p>And this I suppose may suffice to tender concerning these second kind of <hi>Prodigies signal;</hi> Stil'd so (<hi>ex communi fide</hi>) because vulgar faith hath prefer'd them to the repute of divine signs and intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; which I thought fit again to intimate, to excuse the <hi>indecorum</hi> of my applying of the term without the reason thereof, so frequently unto them.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THere are some events (which the history of times presents us with) of so peculiar and strange a make and character, that they stand alone in Nature, and their causes stand so much in the dark, that they seem to enter a very fair and plausible plea for the repute of a miracle. Such as are the turning of Ponds and lakes (in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance) into bloud: swords as of fire seen to hang over cities for several days together; the removal of mountains, or other parts of the Earth, for several furlongs, from their natural places, some strange alterations observed in the motions and tempers of the birds and beasts, or figures and colours of any of the heavenly bodies. With these I reckon some suddain intercsions of the light of the sun, occasioned, not by the veil of an eclipse cast before it, but some unaccountable passion of the luminous body it self. Such a <hi>deliquium</hi> we read of immediately subsequent to the death of <hi>Caesar,</hi> concluded by the Ethnick Poet, a kinde of prodigious shrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the eye of heaven from the view of so black a wickedness as the assassination of so excellent a person, who upon occasion thereof, thus expresseth himself,</p>

               <p>An example parallel whereunto, is related by <hi>Lavater,</hi> who reports<note place="margin">Not. in Job. c. 9. v. 7.</note> that in the year 1585. <hi>Mar.</hi> 12. such a darkness suddainly cover'd the earth, that the birds went to roost at noon, and the guilty fears of men antedated the day of judgment. A like instance whereunto (in another kinde) is the suddain <hi>torpor</hi> and standing still of great cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and the parting of their waters in so wonderfull a manner, that they seem to carry some figures and imitations of those miraculous divisions of waters recorded in sacred Writ.</p>
               <p>Such was that (mention'd in our Chronicles) which hapned Anno. 1399 when the river of <hi>Ouse</hi> in <hi>Bedfordshire,</hi> parted asunder near <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold</hi> in that County, the waters from the fountain standing stil, and those towards the Sea giving way, so that it was passable over on foot for 3 miles together. To which I add that unparllel eruption of fire from the mountain <hi>Vesuvius,</hi> first hapning in the second year of <hi>Titus;</hi> of which it may be truly said, that if all the characters of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, enumerated by Historians, were duly weighed, it would be hard to finde its pattern but in Scripture, where we <hi>read of a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which quaked greatly, and that burnt with fire to the midst of heaven,</hi>

               <p>Now, though I am far from giving to all these effects the repute of a miracle (as may appear by my marshalling of some of them under other heads) much less of a signe; yet because Nature seems not in these as in other Prodigies, to err by any known law, and some of them at least, are so wonderfull, that (to speak truth) they stand in <hi>confinio miraculi,</hi> I thought good to discourse them apart, and as inclos'd under another name and notion. And the rather, because if our Adversaries should chance to call a knub a horn, to stile these, (or some other of the foremention'd prodigies) supernatural and miraculous, they might seem (like <hi>Proteus</hi>) to avoyd all the knots they cannot unloose, (reasons they cannot answer) by shifting forms, and that event which they cannot advance a signe of the time <hi>sub nomine prodigii,</hi> they may possibly assay to doe, <hi>sub specie miraculi.</hi>

               <p>All therefore that I shall offer concerning Prodigies Supernatural (whether in truth or pretence, I shall not much enquire) shall be coucht in these few ensuing propositions;</p>

As for the miracles wrought by our Saviour, least any shadow of natural power might seem to assist and so to disparage them, he usually exerted his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in <hi>raysing of the dead, restoring of a man born blinde to sight, in curing the woman whom Art had given for desperate,</hi> Luk. 8. 43. <hi>in commanding the wave and storms into rest and silence with a word;</hi> and such like works which evidently appear'd to lie <hi>extra vias naturae,</hi> such whereof no magician ever attempted the counterfeit: otherwise his miracles had left open a wide door for infidelity to break out at.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>We understand not fully how far the power and dominion of the Prince of the powers of the Ayr extends, and how far he is able to ape a Miracle, by those wonderfull impressions, he can make upon natural bodies.</hi> We read of his doing great wonders, causing <hi>fire to come down from heaven,</hi> Rev. 13. 13.

               <p>3. <hi>We finde all along that God reserv'd his miracles onely to attend some great and excellent ends and occasions:</hi> so great that the person and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> seem'd not great enough to receive the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Miracle.

               <p>4. <hi>God's miracles came forth heretofore attended</hi> generally <hi>with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;</hi> being wrought by those <hi>men of God,</hi> who were able to point to their intended ends, and declare the meaning of God in them. Miracles are Gods seal, and therefore some writing and evidence they must be affixt unto, for as the writing without the seal wants authority, so the seal without the writing, certainty and significancy. Gods miraculous works have been generally level'd to some humane benefit (either the confirmation of men in some important truth, or the curing of some desperate disease, or the supplying of them in some urgent strait, or the affrighting of them from some destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive practise) never solely to the advancement of his own power and greatness (sufficiently reported, as the Apostle tells us, by the <hi>things which are made</hi>) and therefore tis but necessary that we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what errand this or that supposed miracle comes forth upon, and upon what account we are concern'd therein. Where men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 9.</note> not the meaning of Gods voice, <hi>he speaks but into the ayr.</hi> Now what prophet have we able to lead us to the true meaning of any such great wonder? if it be Gods Embassadour, where is the <hi>Interpreter</hi> that can expound its language?</p>
               <p>Upon a consideration of the premises, I understand not how any hasty conclusions now, concerning the miraculousness of any strange event, can reconcile themselves to counsel and sobriety.</p>

               <p>The sitting of the comment of these Historians so closely and handsomly about the Text, offers an easy Apology, for our embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing this literal sense thereof, at least, till another shall be tendered with fairer probabilities. Especially considering the season to which our B.

                  <hi>Ecclesiae Iudaicae,</hi> so this dreadfull occurrent (<hi>Miraculum,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> calls it) seems given as a signe that was to forerun <hi>fata Imperii Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani</hi> (the other deadly enemy of Christianity) which from that time began to sink under its own weight, and to labour under great and grievous evils; and not to be accounted among the signs of the miseries approaching upon the Jewish State, (as some learned expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitours contend) our Saviour having brought his discourse concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to an issue just before. And indeed, no signe seemed more proper then a burning mountain to give the Gentile world to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that God would shew himself as severe a Judge upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spisers of his Gospel, as he had before upon the despisers of his law, against whom at the promulgation thereof he proclaimed the <hi>terrours of the Lord in blackness and darkness, and that mountain which</hi>

               <p>Notwithstanding what hath been said, I shall not receive this signe, and sense of these Texts, with more then the favour of a probability, both because I finde Expositours hovering but in the loose air of some general expressions upon them, and fearfull to settle down upon an assignation of the particular time and manner of their accomplishment; (amongst whom, commendable especially the modesty of <hi>Calvin,</hi> who upon that Text in S. <hi>Luke,</hi> thus delivers his sense, <hi>Quomodo Sol obscurandus est, hodie conjicere non possumis, sed</hi>

               <p>But lest I be thought to make too curious and unnecessary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to this mount of terrour, I shall set bounds to any further discourse about it, when I have added; that if upon the Readers further thoughts concerning it, it shall appear <hi>more then probably</hi> a signe of the time, it will also appear so appointed by God in those Scriptures forementioned; <hi>if less,</hi> nothing is lost but the courtesie conferred upon the conjecture; and so the credit of our present cause appears not at all prejudiced, which way soever the beam of his understanding (upon a due weighing of particulars) shall incline.</p>
               <p>A second instance (in this order of Prodigies) which seems to enter a very probable plea for its reception, as an intended signe of an ensuing vengeance, is that <hi>flaming sword</hi> (as it seem'd) hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

no where required us to a faith which cannot satisfie the reason of a man which searcheth into the grounds and evidence thereof; He hath commanded us to <hi>prove,</hi> before we <hi>hold fast,</hi> to chew before we swallow, to sound as well as sail. And therefore till we see some better reason offered to acquit our owning of them as the signs of Gods counsels, besides the imaginations and dictats of dogmatical men (which will venture to break open Gods Cabinet, while they want any sure key to unlock it) it is but a just respect to our selves, to maintain our freedom of dissent, and to believe such strange works levelled to some other white, then what they imagine.</p>
               <p>As for the seeming Reasons which this Opinion leans unto, they will appear (like the <hi>staff of Egypt</hi>) either to break under, or by an easy retortion, to pierce and wound it. For whereas it is urged that except we admit this end of these semi-miracles, the most quick-sented will be at a fault, wholly at a loss what end of them to assigne and pitch upon. I answer, Is it so great an inconvenience to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of some passages in the book of the creature, of which we are not scholars good enough to make a right and proper construction? Are there not some works of Providence which God hath made deep and mystical, on set purpose, that man might be humbled by them into a sense of his own ignorance and shortness? see Isai. 48. 7. Eccles 7.<note place="margin">Eccles 8. 17.</note> 14. and is it a strange thing to hear of some works in the compass of Nature, out of our reach, such as we must behold (as children do the Moon) onely with an ignorant wonderment? <hi>Yea, but the world will be alway surprised by judgements, if we admit not such Prodigies the signs of them.</hi> And hath not God told, even those whose profession it is to look after and expound the pretended signs of times [<hi>the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The study of natural philosophy.</hi> The nature of knowledge (in general) to fortifie against the fears of evil, the particular usefulness of natural Philosophy hereunto. <hi>4. A great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency of minde as to the issues of things in this world.</hi> Persons most in love with the world most sollicitous to know its fortune; evidenc'd in the Iews and Gentiles. <hi>5. The discarding of that vulgar princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, That God gives us [now] signs of times.</hi> That question [whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any or no] answered in three conclusions. The vanity of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to vulgar prophecies reprehended. An answer to <hi>Luke 21. 11.</hi> brought for proof of them. Why some signs of destruction given to the Iewish nation. Great changes in the world not easily foreseen, and why.

Besides, no man (that believes himself) shall ever be able to possess himself in peace while his inward house is haunted by such spirits of fear as a superstitious perswasion of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies will be alway raising up within him.</p>
               <p>I shall therefore, in order to a more perfect cure of so common and dangerous a distemper of minde, advise these ensuing remedies.</p>

                  <note place="margin">In his disc. <hi>de Regno.</hi>

especially taken up with the contrivances of new plagues and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for the hated world (then which did never a more pestilential air breath from the bottomless pit, ceazeing the very vitals of religion, and corrupting the first and earliest notions rising up in the Soul when conceiving of a God) Hence grows this easy conclusion, that all Prodigies are a kinde of <hi>Van-guard</hi> to give notice of the many troops of furies and miseries marching after; so that hated man may not have so much as the aery hopes of good times to refresh his weary spirts with, nor be able to deceive his present pains so much as with a dream. Sure I am that the observation and expiation of all manner of O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ens and prodigies among the Heathens, was a sowre fruit growing from this evil root especially, perpetual fears, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy jealousies of God.</p>
               <p>Whereas, if men did not measure the Nature of God by that froward and envious spirit which commands themselves they might easily understand all the evils sometimes sent down upon the world, to be (in the language of the Moralist) onely <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, a divine testimony given in against sin; and intended but to discipline the mad world into some sober and wise thoughts: and they would believe the fairer reports which scripture makes of God, which tells us, <hi>He doth not willingly grieve the children of men, that fury dwells not with him, that judgement is his strange work, &amp;c.</hi> And then would be easily perswaded that prodigies come forth upon some other errand, then to let them understand they must look to be spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily miserable. Did they once believe the Patience and long-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, they could not think he lets his creatures (as <hi>Moses</hi> did the tables) fall out of his hand, and break into disorder, as a disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his frequent anger and displeasure.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The avoiding of any great fears or hopes in reference to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>things future. Lucian</hi> well notes that to a man big with any huge fears or hopes, a foreknowledge of events appears greatly necessary and desireable, (because this brings his distracted thoughts to a point) and therefore he is easily perswaded to attend to any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy or prodigie that offers him a promise of satisfaction and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. Besides where the soul is under the power of some great affection (as it alway is when sollicitous about the issue of things) any odd accident is apt to make a great impression upon it. Fear (like a crackt gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Before they have ram'd this ground, they hastily advance this conclusion, that Prodigies are a very great and proper <hi>signe of the times,</hi> because every eye may easily foresee an evil in such <hi>signs,</hi> though the sons of wisdom alone are able to foresee it in the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>causes</hi> thereof. But, that this is a very sinking and deceitfull ground to stand upon will appear upon a brief resolution of this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, [<hi>Whether or no, now, under the times of the Gospel, God vouchsafe particular Kingdoms any such extraordinary signs of the times as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for?] Particular Kingdoms,</hi> I say; for, as for those signs some speak so much of, of the <hi>fall of Anti-christ, of the last times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the binding and loosing of Satan, of the lost-judgement,</hi> &amp;c. they are all, of a very catholick concern, and are so loose and general, that (like the heavenly bodies) it is hard to determine their aspects to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular time and place, and if any such signs do hereafter appear, they will serve rather as Arguments of Gods providence and presci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then as monitours of that just distance of time they have left those Events behinde them, of which they are (at large) the forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: and so are wholly forein to our present enquiry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:41213:46"/>In order to a more distinct answer to the Question proposed, I must necessarily premise this distinction of the supposed <hi>signs of times.</hi> There are 1. <hi>Signa indicantia tantùm,</hi> such signs as have no real and effective influence at all upon the Event succeeding, but serve as a kinde of <hi>Bath Col,</hi> onely as some softer voice from heaven to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it to persons of more purged and attentive ears. <hi>Such as are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies of all sorts, the aspects of heaven, some old prophesies, plausible paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels, (in many instances) between the occurrences of former times and our own, some stated periods of time beyond which bodies politick have not been observed to continue without some gray hairs upon them,</hi> (as the Prophet.<note place="margin">Hos. 7. 9.</note> speaks) <hi>some great decays, changes and alterations: some mystical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies or general promises in Scripture, forced by a strong and active fancy to the narrow sense and interest of some private times and occasions.</hi> Many such kinde of signs there are, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> (because I intend not to feed curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity, but to starve it) I purposely omit. 2. There are other signs spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of (of better name and credit) which we may style <hi>signa operan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> such signs as seem to carry their effects in the womb of their own powers and sufficiencies; having an influence upon them either in a <hi>moral way</hi> [as the <hi>fulness of the iniquity of a Land,</hi> upon the punishment thereof.] or an <hi>active</hi> and <hi>physical,</hi> as the general bias and inclination of a people, the precipitate counsels of men in trust, and many such like which politick discourses, and the history of times may best lead us to the knowledge of.</p>
               <p>This premised, I shall return an answer to the question proposed in these three Conclusions;</p>
               <p>First, <hi>There are no such signa indicantia tantùm of any changes in States and times, as mention hath been made of.</hi> None I say, that God ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, or man may safely trust to. A truth which I shall presume evinc'd, if I can degrade <hi>Prodigies, Prophecies, Heavenly aspect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> from the honour of being Gods signs. Of all which I doubt not to say, that men may call upon their own fancies to divine unto them, and please themselves in the visions of their own heads; but neither Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture nor solid reason warrant us now to receive any of the instances mentioned, as <hi>Gods tokens</hi> of some great plague, or mighty changes in a State, suddenly to ensue.</p>
               <p>First therefore, I assert <hi>Prodigies</hi> to be none of Gods designed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens. The credit of this assertion I shall trust solely with the evidence of the precedent discourse: adding here onely, (because they are pretended the warnings of heaven) that it is not at all likely, that those men which will not be warned by those great examples of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Justice extant in Sacred Writ, (in which they may see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves executed <hi>in effigie</hi>) would ever learn wisdom from <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>digies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 6.</note> and those attested generally, but upon the faith of two or three igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant spectatours: nor can it reasonably be presumed that those <hi>strong holds</hi> in the hearts of men, usually impregnable to all the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of sermons and afflictions, should ever yeeld upon the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of any such supposed warning pieces (whose bullets fly so much over them) whose threatned evils stay in loose generals, and point not to any particular <hi>persons,</hi> or <hi>time,</hi> or <hi>nature and condition</hi> of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41213:46"/>
judgement. So that as good men need no such warnings, so bad ones do not deserve them, so little use would they in all probability make of them, if they were afforded. More sober therefore, and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Doctrine couch'd in those Ethnick fables, in which the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets feign <hi>Nemesis</hi> (Divine Vengeance) the Daughter of <hi>Ocean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> and <hi>Nox,</hi> the strange vicissitude and revolution of affairs in this work, and the dark and inscrutable counsels of heaven; and the <hi>Parcae</hi> to have had their habitation in a deep cave, whence they oft issued forth suddenly upon the secure and unwary world.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Vulgar Prophecies</hi> are not to be received as any <hi>signs of future times.</hi> It was the Opinion of some of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and most of the <hi>Gentile Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers</hi> of old, that the soul came down into the body, pregnant with a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a prophetick and prognostick<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Plut.</hi> de defect. Orac.</note> power, which it could here not exert and feel, being now <hi>blinde and unable to see afar off,</hi> because of a veil of flesh and a thick mist of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasms cast before its eye in this embodied state. A Doctrine, which the carriage and demeanour of the soul, while a prisoner to its own house, seems a little to encourage; for as the bush in the fable, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sustained a great loss of cloth, stands ever since by the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and catcheth hold of every mans clothes, in hopes to repair its own losses; so the souls of men seem to express a tacit sense of a great loss in regard of the knowledge of things future, in that they stand (as were) <hi>in triviis,</hi> and hastily catch at any pretending Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy and shadow of Divination: and indeed I have <hi>nothing</hi> (in this matter) more <hi>to accuse my own Nation</hi> then others <hi>of,</hi> it being an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the blindness of most ages and Nations, that they readily swallow down such flies as these, when tendred to them.</p>
               <p>This branch of superstition not dropping much upon our grounds, it may suffice to strike at it but with this one consideration: <hi>Such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies evidently appear no signe of the times, because not coming forth from God who alone is able to declare the end from the beginning:</hi> * For they are often found (like lines drawn by no rule) to cross and thwart one another; * they are generally observed to abuse mens minds with vain hopes and pannick fears; * the style they are generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in wears the Devils livery, being full of darkness and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity. * They engage the minde to attend to hurtfull curiosities, and difficult impertinencies; they are not all levelled (what was noted of old of all the Devils predictions) <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The Devil then must be acknowledged the Authour of most of these vulgar Prophecies; and will any man that owns Christ for his Prophet, receive the Devil for his Oracle? or when he is sick of the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41213:47"/>
present times, go to the <hi>God of Ekron</hi> (by attending to any such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies) for quiet and resolution? Shall we value our faith at so cheap a rate, as to trust it with the Oracles of the Father of lies? Can the Devil be presumed <hi>able</hi> to give us true resolutions to any questions <hi>de Futuro?</hi> (did God ever make him of his counsel, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver times and seasons into his power?) or <hi>willing</hi> (if able) to do it with any fair and single purposes and intentions? Have the beams of the <hi>Sun of Righteousness</hi> put out all the fires on his Altars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the glory and power of the Divine Oracles and miracles, spoiled his great trade of <hi>Oracles and lying wonders,</hi> and shall our easiness and vanity encourage him to drive this more secret and little trade of Prodigies and Prophecies?</p>
               <p>3. We are next in the third place, to evince the <hi>various aspects of heaven,</hi> no intended <hi>signs of times;</hi> but because the contrary events of things, do so often <hi>make,</hi> or prove <hi>the Diviners by</hi> them, <hi>mad;</hi> and because the greatest and most wonderfull change in State, that ever happened (by the restauration of His Majesty in peace and honour) was not so much as dreamed of by all the Privy-Counsellers to the<note place="margin">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>H.

               <p>As for the Arguments drawn from those <hi>fearfull sights and great signs from heaven,</hi> mentioned Luke 21. 11. precedent to the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the Jewish polity; to encourage the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any such <hi>signs of times</hi> now, or the advancement of Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies into the repute of any divine Monitors, they will appear to be greatly inconsequent, if we consider,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>All those accidents were foretold and particularly appointed by God as signs.</hi> Particularly, the opening of the gates of the temple (some time before its desolation) of their own accord, though of such massy brass, that they could not be shut or opened (if we credit <hi>Iosephus</hi>) without the twisted strength of twenty men, and though secured with great bars of iron, is thought by some learned Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish and Christian Expositours, the accomplishment of the prophecy<note place="margin">

               <p>2. <hi>The miseries foretold by those signs, were great without example. Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi> calls them evils <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, worthy of some signs. They came not forth as the Heraulds of some petty war, or to precede
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41213:47"/>

               </lg>
               <p>3. <hi>The destruction of Ierusalem was a type and picture of the final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the world.</hi> And therefore fit it was that the terrours of the latter, should be a little pattern'd and shadowed out in the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sights and Prodigies attending the former; besides, the conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of soul, and failings of heart which these foregoing signs wrought in some men, before the <hi>decree brake forth,</hi> made the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (in all the circumstances thereof) the more lively type not onely of the terrours of the last judgement, but of those horrours and sinkings of spirit in bad men which shall go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Our Blessed Saviours extraordinary prediction of those Prodigies as his signs to that generation, seems rather to assure them not intended the common fore-runners of any great plagues and wars,</hi> and that no good <hi>crisis</hi> can be ordinarily made of the future condition of a state by a regard to any such in themselves doubtfull and unfaithfull indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. For what need of predictions, if these signs were to fall out by a kind of common rule and law of providence? and how unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary had it been to appoint such accidents for signs of evil, which draw after them a <hi>series</hi> of evils with so great a constancy, that they seem (without a Prophet) to appoint themselves the signs of the times?</p>
               <p>5. <hi>The condition of those times seem'd especially to require some such signs.</hi> For, 1. They serv'd then as mercifull warnings to Christs followers,<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 16.</note> to hasten their escape from that house (that City) which was ready to fall upon them and involve them in its ruins. 2. The Jews requir'd signs from heaven, and God would not be wanting to any probable means and motives of their repentance. 3. The Jewish oeconomy commenc'd in fearfull sights at mount <hi>Sinai, and great signs</hi> from heaven; and fit it was its conclusion should somewhat resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the solemnity of its beginning. 4. The many signs given by our Saviour serv'd gradually to wean the hearts of his followers from <hi>Hierusalem</hi> (once the <hi>light of their eyes</hi>) of whose determin'd desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, these gave them such full and repeated assurances.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>We cannot receive any Signa Operantia, as the faithfull and</hi>

               <p>3. <hi>God sometimes makes use of means great and pompous to some ends weak and little in the eye of sense.</hi> To what great actions all on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dein, did he strengthen the hands of the <hi>King of Sweden?</hi> his victories drew the eyes of the world upon him, and 'twas concluded by some, that Providence design'd him the <hi>Apocalyptick Angel</hi> which should pour out one of the <hi>Vials</hi> upon the Beast, when behold, unexpectedly the current of his successes runs under ground, and men engag'd to conclude God had ends more secret and spiritual to accomplish by him, then they imagin'd.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>God usually advanceth his great works and ends, by pauses and periods.</hi> Providence (in the advancement of the church) hath usually its <hi>fines abruptos.</hi> God in the works of Nature doth <hi>compendium facere,</hi>

               <p>5. <hi>God hath an unknown variety of means and methods to accomplish his purposes by.</hi> He works by any means, by weak, by contrary, by none.

               <p>But we shall finde God in Scripture so far securing the honour of true Divination, as to confer the gift thereof (generally) upon men, and those of a pious and learned education, and all the shadows there of which may be yet found in the world <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us dwell in a wise and understanding Soul [Prov. 22. 3. <hi>A prudent man fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeth the evil, and hideth himself;</hi> and that not by consulting of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies, but observing the seeds and causes in which it lies hid.] As all other gifts and abilities, once miraculous and extra ordinary, <hi>those of healing, of speaking with tongues, of interpreting the Scriptures, of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of Spirits,</hi> so this also of <hi>foreseeing events future</hi> (so far as they remain yet in the world) are reserv'd solely as the reward and honour of the diligent, observant, and understanding person.</p>
               <p>To dismiss this particular: <hi>Times and Seasons</hi> are especially <hi>reserv'd in Gods power,</hi> and 'tis our wisdom to study rather how we may <hi>redeem the</hi> present <hi>time,</hi> then understand the future. As for that threed-bare Argument therefore (<hi>Signs of future times</hi>) I could wish it might be worn no longer in writings and discourses, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause things shew of colour, but according to the light men stand in, but because the men whom they are designed to deterr from any course of sin, start at them possibly at first, (as birds doe at the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of a man in the fields) but afterward sit down upon them and neglect them, perceiving (in the issue of things) that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd of [life and motion] truth and certainty: and so these false fears in religion may chance to discredit the true, as the adventitious heat in bodies oft-times supplants and betrays the natural: besides, all such signs of times doe but tender the short and narrow thoughts of man, as the standard of Gods: and tend to detain people always in a gazing and expecting posture, so that they compose not to the work and duty of the day. And to encourage rash and unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble purposes, and therefore perhaps the wisdom of the State may in time see reason to interdict the publication of prodigies and Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical predictions, under as severe a penalty as it hath old prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; all being but the <hi>ignes fatui</hi> leading to the boggs of sedition, by amuzing men with a false light, (the pretended knowledge of the <hi>signs and state of future times.</hi>)</p>

                  <p>First, <hi>Not of the extraordinary sinfulness of Persons.</hi> Men are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally prone to finde their own vertues in <hi>Fortunae blanditiis</hi> (to weigh their own merits at the false beam of outward blessings and succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) and their brothers faults <hi>in Parcarum tabulis,</hi> the sad destinies and evils which lie upon his lot. <hi>Iobs</hi> friends judged the dimensions of his iniquity by the shadow of the sufferings which were laid upon him, and concluded the former great because the latter were so.<note place="margin">Job 2. 13.</note>

                  <p>Now such hasty conceits as these, rise up in our minds, partly from a peasantly notion of good and evil in us, we are apt to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our bodies and estates, and then to estimate the favour of God by the references and aspects his Providences bear towards them. Besides we conclude (the great rule of justice being this, that all punishments be adjusted to the merits of the person) that all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments extra ordinary, are the most proper indications of a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent guilt.</p>
                  <p>Whereas Gods distributions of rewards and punishments in this life, are not directed by any of our short and scanty maxims and notions.

God (perhaps intending this cryptick management of affairs, as a kinde of Divine tentation, to prove whether we be such men in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing as to stand by the doctrine of a Providence, while the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, power, and wisdom thereof are rendred so much to dispute by the great appearances of Nature and Fortune, and whether we be quick-sighted enough to discover that the <hi>living creatures</hi> have the <hi>hands of a man,</hi> though half <hi>hidden under</hi> the covert of <hi>their wings,</hi>

Our histories make mention of a very hot contest about the marriage of Priests, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were more acceptable with God, they which vowed single<note place="margin">The Late Church Hist. <hi>l. 2. p. 133.</hi>
                     </note> life, or they which were married. At last the Contenders agreed to remit the controversy to the debate of a Synod, where they which asserted the marriage of Priests, placed themselves on one side of the room, and they which appear'd against it, on the other: and so it happened that the side of the house, whereon the defendants of the marriage of Clergy-men sat, fell down, and many of them were hurt, and many lost their lives. Which accident was construed Gods determination in the dispute, and received as a signe that he was better pleased with those which vowed single life; and the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their adversaries were hereby, long after knock'd at head, as well as themselves. <hi>Baronius</hi> (to inferr the piety of that paiment)<note place="margin">In Annal. circa An. 740.</note> takes notice that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was even overspread with schisms and heresies, <hi>simul ac denarium Petri solvere desierunt,</hi> as soon as ever the people left off to pay Peter pence.

                  <p>Against all such unclean proofs, which (like the Crab) go backward, from events to rules, I offer these considerations,</p>
                  <p>1. As God <hi>in his word,</hi> hath recorded some actions of very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent persons [as the equivocating of <hi>Abraham</hi> with <hi>Abimelech, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> her defeating of <hi>Laban</hi> with a falshood, some actions of <hi>Samson,</hi> &amp;c.] not noted (like the Jewish Sepulchres) with any visible signe of reproof and dislike, that so men might not unwittingly defile themselves by copying out the example (in which he doth but prove our constancy to his even and undoubted precepts, and try whether we have understanding to put a difference between the bright and darker side of that <hi>cloud of witnesses</hi> we are to eye in our way to heaven) so also <hi>in his providence</hi> there are <hi>tentationes divinae;</hi> God often blasts the cause of truth and goodness by adverse provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences; the cloud often rests upon the <hi>tabernacles of the Righreous,</hi> the fire of heaven sometimes strikes a religious house, the chief wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of truth shall be forc'd to know themselves by the title of <hi>Victus Dei populus.</hi> God hereby makes trial whether we will believe the <hi>Spirit of the living creature</hi> to move <hi>in the wheels,</hi> whilst they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe such involv'd and perplex'd circles and motions; whether we love truth and vertue, or rather their fortunes and felicities. Besides, the divine relation, and light of righteousness and truth, never make such clear reports of themselves, as when they break out and shine forth at last, through all the clouds of persecution and heresies, God often permits them for a time to be obscured withall.</p>
                  <p>2. Prodigious evils upon its Adversaries, is a plea which almost any cause is able to enter for it self at one time or other.

We have the Oracles of God, the counsels of wise and good men, the common principles which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the discourses of the world, the laws of a state, and our own exercised reason, which is (in the language of <hi>Plutarch</hi>) <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the great Oracle of truth to resolve us in the emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent doubts of life. And it is especially because men are under a quick sense, how exact an eye is requisite to discern how nearly any of these rules touch the building (any cause or doctrine) of whose evenness there may be a doubt; and that this method of knowledge engageth them to <hi>dig for understanding,</hi> and requires them to an industrious use of themselves, in the acquist of true resolutions in a case, and perhaps may detain them some time but in the place of candidates and Probationers for truth, that they are so easily inclin'd to attend to the (supposed) intimations of a <hi>Revelation,</hi> some <hi>strange prodigy,</hi> or <hi>prophecy, a mighty impulse,</hi> which give them the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without tasking them to a tedious consideration of the value of the premises, and lift them up into the <hi>Tree of knowledge,</hi> without any industrious climbing of their own. But certainly God who bade us <hi>buy the truth,</hi> never intended it should be got upon such cheap and easy terms; men may suspect their wares to be nought, if they cost no more then an idle attendance to such fantastical measures as these generally are.</p>
                  <p>4. Gods particular judgements, as to the special ends and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of them, are generally inscrutable. We commonly set so high a price upon our causes, parties, and opinions, that we easily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, the biggest end, Gods judgements can be directed to, is the bearing witness to the truth and righteousness of them. By which fancy, we become a kinde of spiritual <hi>Anthropomorphits,</hi> shaping out a God like our selves, and laying out the counsels of heaven by the poor, short, (and often peevish) thoughts and models of a man. If we consult Scripture we shall seldom or never finde a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son onely of a corrupt judgement in reference to some Doctrine of religion (if otherwise of a blameless life) smitten with any great plague from heaven, but often, persons of corrupt and depraved manners: because all the laws of righteousness carry <gap reason="foreign">

Whereas matters of faith and doctrine appear not before the minde in so great an evidence. Men indeed are apt to follow a little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Opinion from themselves (in religion especially) with thick <hi>Anathemas,</hi> and quickly to blow it out into a schism or heresy (because such differences seem to dispute the strength of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments)

God never menac'd any such reproachfull judgement against any such errours as these, in Scripture; and if he had, if found in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with great crimes, it may be more reasonably presum'd, that it was directed rather against the wickedness of the heart then the weakness of the head.</p>
                  <p>If I would advise with my eyes in the choice of my party or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I should rather observe (as I could) what parties of men are most delivered to the judgement of a cruel and unquiet spirit, to a giddy motion from one fond notion to another, who they are which seem most forsaken of vertue and true goodness. For these are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual judgements, and so, more suitable to the condition of that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Oeconomy; the appearance of our Saviour hath now put us under.

Which he doth either when the sword of justice is permitted to rust in its scabbard, and the Magistrate neglects to put open wickedness to shame, or when perhaps he is unable, through a want of knowledge or power to reach the criminal; or in his to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal absence, thus in the primitive times, when the Magistrate (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heathen) thought not any sin against the Gospel, to be <hi>fori sui,</hi>

                  <p>Now these judgements extraordinary, are Vocal and Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and call for our more serious notices in three cases especially;</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>When the judgement bears upon it the, evident pour traitures and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of the sin.</hi> The cross men bear (like that of our Saviour) of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten carries the inscription of the crime in such plain and legible characters, that he that runs may read it. There are some herbs which bear upon them <hi>Naturae signaturas,</hi> certain signatures and marks stamp'd upon them by the hand of Nature, serving (as a kinde of native labels) to tell us what vertues they contain, and whereby it may be known (even upon sight) to what diseases or parts of the body ill affected, they are proper and usefull (because bearing some figures or colours analogous to them) thus punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment sometimes carries <hi>signaturas peccati,</hi> and proclaims by its very make and fashion, what sin it is intended to discover and cure in us: And this it doth either when there is a <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, a suffering in the very same instances and ways wherein men sinn'd, and the cross is (as it were) shap'd out of the forbidden tree whereby they offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thus <hi>Davids</hi> adultery was punish'd in <hi>Absaloms</hi> incest; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> who would have all the males drown'd, was himself drown'd; and the wickedness of <hi>Abimelech</hi> in slaying his 70 brethren was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned<note place="margin">Judg. 9. 56.</note> upon his own head in that strange and violent death where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he perish'd.

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the judgement seems the symbol of the sin, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice pays men in value though not in kinde. Thus God threatned the<note place="margin">Jer. 5. 19. V.

When we see the scandalous sinner corrected thus by his own wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness, and made even to drink the dust of his own Idol, we should make a pious meditation on the occasion.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>When the judgement surpriseth the sinner in the very acting of his wickedness,</hi> and sin the off-spring destroys its parent (as it is said of the viper) in the very production.

                  <p>3. <hi>When the judgement is such as the general experience of times proves the usual consequent of such a crime.</hi> As a sudden and untimely death of sedition, the ruine of estates of Sacriledge, an antedated and diseased old age of riot and drunkenness, an almost general impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency of uncleanness, a naked and expos'd posterity of oppression and unrighteous gain, strange discoveries and an infamous death of bloud shed, neglect and scorn of men of a great ambition, the blasting of designs which proceed upon the violation of the religion of national compacts, an untimely and strange death of cruel and bloudy persecutions. Gods <hi>judgements</hi> are generally a <hi>great deep</hi> (the reasons of them past our sounding) but <hi>his righteousness is sometimes as the great mountains,</hi> visible to the dullest eye, in the judgements wherewith he corrects, those sins especially which fall most directly cross to his government of the world.</p>

Gods judgements often come forth upon errands which they to whom they are sent, may better understand then persons unconcern'd. We are not to conclude the punishment from the sin, (<hi>saying, Thus and thus hath such a man done and it will come home by him</hi>) this is to prescribe time and measure to the justice of God; neither may we infer the sin from the punishment (intituling some such great evil of sin to such an evil of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) for God may give a good man his <hi>evil,</hi> as to a bad man his <hi>good things,</hi> in this world. But where we are as sure from Scripture (not fancy, apt to abuse us where our selves are concern'd) that the sin is extraordinary, as we are from sense that the judgement is such, we may then cry out with the followers of the Lamb, Rev. 15. 4. <hi>All nations shall worship before thee, O Lord, for thy Iudgements are made manifest.</hi>

Now their becoming thus (like <hi>Cain</hi>) vaga bonds and fugitives upon earth, (which no Nation besides is) speaks them like him gone out of Gods presence, and guilty of some horrible murder, even no less then that of the <hi>Lord of life,</hi> which the scripture charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon them.</p>
                  <p>2. There is a singularity in the judgement upon them, in regard of the <hi>Season</hi> thereof. For before they had stain'd their hands in the bloud of the Lord of the Temple, their Temple (though sometimes defac'd) was never made vile and contemptible by any abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heathen, set up in the most Holy. <hi>No war, no sedition, no captivity, no vastation, nor any other sad occasion whatsoever, made so great a wast upon the religion and reverence of that place, that an idol or image</hi> (against the essential sanctity thereof) <hi>should be tendered to worship therein</hi> (as <hi>Agrippa</hi> in his Embassy to <hi>Caius</hi> the Emperour largely tells him) for that the very heathens had been tutor'd into a reverence thereof, by those fearful judgements, which (as he there tells him) they had observed the King of heaven alway avenging any lesser in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities offer'd to that his chamber of special presence; But no sooner had they committed <hi>that wonderfull and horrible thing,</hi> but God delivers the place of his ancient habitation, the desire of their eyes, to the defilements and dishonour of an image that the Emperour, erected in the Holy of Holies, as a sign that <hi>place</hi> should no longer <hi>be his rest because it was polluted,</hi> and that he had forsaken both it and them. Moreover, most constant were the judgements which <hi>at last</hi> befel the enemies of the Jewish Nation, before their great sin of rejecting the son of God. <hi>Israel was</hi> then <hi>holiness to the Lord, and the first fruits of his increase, all that devour'd him did offend, evil came upon them from the Lord.</hi> Whereas afterward so constant their successes, when attempting upon them, as if to fight against that nation, were the only way of obliging victory, and the assistances of God. Which singularity in the divine judgements, was a sign that God had now put a period to the Jewish worship, and that their putting of Christ to death, lookt of a blacker colour in the eyes of Justice, as procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more dreadfull evils upon then all their other sins could ever doe.</p>
                  <p>I easily foresee how ready some persons may be to build <hi>hay and stubble upon</hi> this <hi>foundation,</hi> and to conclude such a cause or party branded from heaven, if any judgement (like an executioner in a vizard) <hi>frightfull</hi> as well as <hi>fatall,</hi> befall the persons appearing in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thereof. And therefore I must here minde them how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent any such reasonings can be, not only because I more then
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41213:55"/>
doubt whether any of the judgements they can instance in touch in any points and angles of similitude those already mention'd, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they came not forth to decide causes collaterally, but diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppos'd (not differences between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Cephas, but God and B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lial</hi>) but because Judaism and Gentilism were causes evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently devoted in sacred scripture, and the judgements following them were but the accomplishments of its predictions, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions of a scripture sentence upon them. But we have now no better warrant to infer the goodness or badness of some lesser causes and opinions men espouse, from the judgements which may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times overtake the assertors of them, then to make judgement of the loyalty of a wife, by a <hi>water of jealousie.</hi> For as sometimes the <hi>Person</hi> may fall in the cause (because that is displeasing to God) thus <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi> fell in the expedition against the King of Egypt; so sometimes the <hi>cause</hi> may fall in the person (because he is displeasing to God) as the Israelites in the controversy with the men of <hi>Benjamin.</hi> Besides, we are to presume that God speaks to us more plainly by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, then by his word, wherein he hath permitted some lesser matters to stand in a very doubtfull light, to engage us to an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of our <hi>understandings</hi> to find the truth, and of our <hi>charities</hi> to those who (having not such strong and excercised senses as our selves) chance to mistake it.</p>
                  <p>It were therefore heartily to be wisht, that men had that <hi>largeness of heart,</hi> as not to think heaven and earth concern'd in the standing or falling of their little interests and perswasions; that they would leave off (that worst kind of enclosure) the entailing salvation solely upon their own party; and not goe about to hedge in the Holy Dove, by appropriating the graces and influences thereof to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.

               <p>IT might possibly be expected that this discourse should have touch'd more closely upon the occasion, and have come to a more distinct view, and particular examination of (at least) some of those strange relations which of late, have been prest upon the faith of the Nation, with so great a confidence, and so troublesom an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. An undertaking which I purposely declined, looking at it as <hi>Needless, Difficult,</hi> and <hi>Unprofitable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>As</hi> in it self, <hi>Needless:</hi> For, (besides that I think it hard to finde a faith that can swallow any such Camel-stories, as many of them in all the circumstances with which they are swell'd out, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be) there are no relations in the world, which we may with greater reason, arrest upon suspicion of imposture, then such as these are. And that</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Because of the ignorance of the greater part of their Attestours, in natural Philosophy.</hi> Now where men look upon an object (strange and prodigious) through so gross and thick a <hi>medium,</hi> it is no trespass against charity to believe they sometimes report them beyond their proper and just figures and dimensions. It is the nature of ignorance <hi>fingere simul &amp; credere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Religion seems much concerned in such relations.</hi> Now men (like <hi>Iacob</hi>) will be ready to venture upon a lie for a great blessing [the advancement of Religion] Besides, as Atheism gives all events to the second, so Superstition (Religion scar'd out of its wits) gives all solely to the first cause, and is therefore quickly perswaded to fill out its relations with all the examples of wonderfull and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, that effects may appear the more worthy of the immediate power of God. Moreover, blinde and ignorant fears of God, make the minde impressive to any kinde of religious Legends. Never was the world more truly <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>apparitions, miracles, voices from the clouds,</hi> and the like: and therefore the Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> advising a just <hi>history of Prodiges,</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect<note place="margin">Nov.

               <p>3. <hi>The strength of these Relations</hi> (like that of <hi>Nisus</hi> in the Poet) <hi>lies</hi> generally <hi>in the weak hair of some single or double testimony.</hi> Now as there is little reason to conceive a whole Nation concern'd in the visions of one or two private persons, if they were true (Gods signs and wonders which were intended as lessons to a Nation, or poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, being generally attested by numbers;) so as little reason to hang the weight of so serious a faith and great affections in Religion upon so slender a wire, as the testimony of one, perhaps two, or three men (in such matters) is. The <hi>Romanes</hi> of old, though as apt to swallow such prodigious stories as any, yet used to chew them fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And we shall finde (<hi>in Livy</hi>) prodigious accidents sometimes past by without any religious regards, <hi>viz.</hi> where the testimony appear'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent; and this, lest what was intended a devotion to their Deities, might chance to prove a mockery.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Some men seem even naturally,</hi> fabularum proci, <hi>the very courters of fables and Legends.</hi> Either <hi>out of a native vanity and emptiness of minde,</hi> whereby (like the <hi>Cameleon</hi>) they are better pleased with<note place="margin">Quidam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credibilium relatu, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendationem parant, &amp; Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorem aliud acturum, si per quotidiana duceretur, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculo exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.

Hence the men can scarce relate any matter (especially, if going a little off from common and quotidian) but it must look big, and borrow somewhat of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
               <p>Very observable therefore, the manner of the relation of any great wonders, in Sacred Writ; wherein we shall finde the most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious displays of the Divine power, delivered in that simplicity and coolness of style, in that lax and general way, with as little of ecsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and emotion of minde appearing in the Relatour, as if some vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and quotidian occurrence had fallen before him: that so there might not appear any symptoms of that common itch in men to tell strange stories, or any affectation of strangeness and the common wonder, or a great solicitousness to raise the esteem of that cause or party, to which they were an honourable testimony from heaven, in the minds of men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Such an undertaking would prove exceeding difficult.</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much more easy to beleeve many a strange story, then to attempt its refute; especially where the Scene thereof is laid at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance off.
