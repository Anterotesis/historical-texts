            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PROLOGUE.</head>
            <l>OF all men those have reason least to care</l>
            <l>For being laugh'd at, who can laugh their share:</l>
            <l>And that's a thing our Author's Apt to use</l>
            <l>Upon occasion, when no man can chuse.</l>
            <l>Suppose now at this instant one of you</l>
            <l>Were tickled by a Fool, what would you do?</l>
            <l>'Tis ten to one you'd laugh, here's just the case,</l>
            <l>For there are Fools that tickle with their Face.</l>
            <l>Your gay Fool tickles with his Dress, and Motions,</l>
            <l>But your grave Fool of Fools, with silly Notions.</l>
            <l>Is it not then unjust that Fops should still</l>
            <l>Force one to laugh, and then take laughing ill?</l>
            <l>Yet since perhaps to some it gives offence,</l>
            <l>That men are tickled at the want of Sence;</l>
            <l>Our Author thinks he takes the readiest way</l>
            <l>To shew all he has laugh'd at here fair play.</l>
            <l>For if ill writing be a folly thought,</l>
            <l>Correcting ill is sure a greater fault.</l>
            <l>Then Gallants laugh, but chuse the right place first,</l>
            <l>For judging ill is of all faults the worst.</l>

                     <p>All's well, and better than thou could'st expect, for this Wench here is certainly no Maid; and I have hopes she is the same that our two curious Coxcombs have been so long a hunting after.</p>

                     <p>Why? because first she is no Maid, and next because she's hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some; there are two Reasons for you: now do you find out a third, a better if you can: For take this <hi>Frederick,</hi> for a certain Rule, since she loves the sport, she'll never give it over.

                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
                     <p>I'm right then. And pray who were you talking of?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mot.</speaker>
                     <p>Why Sir, of an inconsiderate inconsiderable Person, that has at once both forfeited the honor of my concern, and the concern of her own honor.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
                     <p>Very fine indeed. And is all this intended for the beautiful <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia</hi>?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mot.</speaker>
                     <p>O fie upon her Sir, an odious Creature as I'm a Christian, no Beauty at all.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:61727:31"/>
                     <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, does not your Ladiship think her handsome?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mot.</speaker>
                     <p>Seriously, Sir, I don't think she's ugly, but as I'm a Christian, my Position is; That no true Beauty can be lodg'd in that Creature, who is not in some measure buoy'd up with a just sence of what is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent to the devoir of a Person of Quality.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
                     <p>That Position, Madam, is a little severe, but however she has been incumbent formerly, as your Ladyship is pleas'd to say; now that she's marry'd, and her Husband owns the Child, she is sufficiently ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifi'd for all she has done.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mot.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, I must blushingly beg leave to say you are there in an error. I know there has been passages of love between 'em, but with a tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so innocent, and so refin'd, as it did impose a negative upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry possibility of her being with Child.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
                     <p>Sure she is not well acquainted with her. Pray Madam, how long have you known <hi>Constantia</hi>?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mot.</speaker>
                     <p>Long enough I think Sir; for I had the good fortune, or rather the ill one, to help her first to the light of the World.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
                     <p>Now cannot I discover by the fineness of this Dialect, whether she be the Mother or the Midwife: I had best ask t'other Woman.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mot.</speaker>
                     <p>No Sir, I assure you, my Daughter <hi>Constantia</hi> has never had a Child: a Child! ha, ha, ha; O goodness save us, a Child!</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
                     <p>O then she is the Mother, and it seems is not inform'd of the matter. Well Madam, I shall not dispute this with you any further; but give me leave to wait upon you to your Daughter; for her Friend I assure ye is in great impatience to see her.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mot.</speaker>
                     <p>Friend Sir? I know none she has; I'm sure she loaths the very sight of him.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fred.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Mot.</speaker>
                     <p>Then as I'm a Christian, I suspect we have both been equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in the misfortune of a mistake. Sir I am in the derniere confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to avow that though my Daughter <hi>Constantia</hi> has been lyable to several addresses, yet she never has had the honour to be produc'd to his Grace.</p>

                     <p>No, Brother, the fault was mine, in mistaking you so much, as not to impart the whole truth to you at first; but having begun my love without your consent, I never durst acquaint you with the progress of it.</p>

            <l>PErhaps you Gentlemen, expect to day</l>
            <l>The Author of this fag end of a Play</l>
            <l>According to the Modern way of Wit</l>
            <l>Shou'd strive to be before-hand with the Pit,</l>
            <l>Begin to rail at you, and subtly to</l>
            <l>Prevent th' affront by giving the first blow.</l>
            <l>He wants not Presidents, which often sway</l>
            <l>In matters far more weighty than a Play:</l>
            <l>But he no grave admirer of a Rule,</l>
            <l>Won't by Example learn to play the fool.</l>
            <l>The end of Plays should be to entertain,</l>
            <l>And not to keep the Auditors in pain.</l>
            <l>Giving our price, and for what trash we please,</l>
            <l>He thinks the Play being done, you should have ease.</l>
            <l>No Wit, no Sence, no Freedom, and a Box,</l>
            <l>Is much like paying money for the Stocks.</l>
            <l>Besides the Author dreads the strut and meen</l>
            <l>Of new prais'd Poets, having often seen</l>
            <l>Some of his Fellows, who have writ before,</l>
            <l>When <hi>Nel</hi> has danc'd her Iig, steal to the Door,</l>
            <l>Hear the Pit clap, and with conceit of that</l>
            <l>Swell, and believe themselves the Lord knows what.</l>
            <l>Most Writers now ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ys are grown so vain,</l>
            <l>That once approv'd, they write, and write again,</l>
            <l>Till they have writ away the Fame they got;</l>
            <l>Our Friend this way of writing fancies not,</l>
            <l>And hopes you will not tempt him with your Praise,</l>
            <l>To rank himself with some that write new Plays:</l>
            <l>For he knows ways enough to be undone</l>
            <l>Without tbe help of Poetry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
