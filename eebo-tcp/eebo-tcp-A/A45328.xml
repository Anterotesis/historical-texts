         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is not long since, that a faithfull <hi>Minister</hi> of
Christ, my very loving <hi>Friend,</hi> presented the
World with a <hi>Latine Treatise,</hi> vindicating and
asserting the Necessity, dignity and duty of a <hi>Gosp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l-Ministry;</hi>
which when I had perused, and discovered
(not onely by the testimony of the <hi>Epistles</hi> Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
but by my own Iudgment) in it a great Acuteness
of Wit, a sweet Savour of a pious Disposition, pertinent
and cogent Arguments, full and satisfacto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y Answers
to all Objections militating against the Truth; hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Discourse with him concerning it, I was bold to
intimate to him, how convenien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly and usefully it
might have been offered in a Tongue more known
amongst us, for the Conviction and satisfaction of
<hi>English</hi> Cavillers; Adding, That I thought, they,
who had so much knowledge as to understand <hi>Latin,</hi>
had also more Iudgment than to need to be satisfied
in that thing: Whereupon, the Reverend <hi>Authour</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:44913:7"/>
concurring with my Iudgment (but giving me a
good Account of his Style) was pleased, at first, to
desire, and upon reluctancy to press me to do that,
which I onely wish'd had been done: withall, trusting
me with the liberty of Paraphrasing and Enlarging,
by his <hi>Letters,</hi> of June 11. and June 25. 1658. Which
Task I have accordingly undertaken, being Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced (I hope) by a desire to glorifie God, and
have performed, being assisted by the strength of
that God, whom I desire to glorifie. Besides what
I have already express'd and intimated, I need give
no further Account of my Enterprize, but the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
which I then had. I see dayly more and
more justified of the proneness of our Apostatizing
times to grow Antiministeriall. Pardon me, I pray
thee, if, through my weakness, any of the Author's
Ingenuity, elegancy or strength be lost, or the Truth
suffer through my Inability to vindicate it. And I
humbly beseech Almighty God, that these poor En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors
may contribute some little towards thy satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
or Confirmation; towards the Edification and
Provocation unto Duty, the maintaining the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and Honor, the encouraging the Faintings and
Fears of the Faithfull Ministers of Iesus Christ.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Let us a little search the context, that we may find the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the text. When our Saviour had in the very threshold
of his Sermon, discoursed of the blessed ones of the world,
in this second step that he makes, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tly subjoyneth a discourse
concerning the Ministers of the Gospell, whose qualifications
he teacheth by three metaphoricall resemblances of <hi>salt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ght,</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eming to make this the one summary of
his similitudes, that the Ministers of the Gospell must not only
be Sayers but Doers, Preachers but Practicers, Talkers but
Walkers, and must have not only the <hi>salt</hi> of doctrine, but the
light of conversation also. But more particularly, by this simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
of <hi>salt,</hi> he s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs out in lively colours, the necessity and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of the Gospell-Ministry. Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> as men season sle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, so must the soules of men be seasoned by the Ministry of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44913:8"/>
the word, that neither the one, nor the other may be corrupted.</p>
            <p>The text is a Categoricall proposition, consisting of a <hi>subject
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> predicate,</hi> and a <hi>Copulative.</hi> The <hi>subject</hi> is ye (<hi>i. e.</hi>) ye my
disciples and all the preachers of the Gospell that shall succeed
you. The <hi>Copulative</hi> is are, not shall be for the time to come,
but at present ye are chosen and called so to be. The <hi>predicate</hi>
is, <hi>the salt of the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (i. e.)</hi> It is your office to season men,
who are altogether unsavoury untill they be seasoned with the
salt of heavenly doctrines. As salt is the seasoner of mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, so the
Ministers of the Gospell are called salt from their office, by
way of resemblance, because they should by their edi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ying
language and exemplary life season men, that they may be
kept from the corruption of vices, and have the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rellish of graces. And they are not onely Metaphorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called <hi>salt,</hi> or the most excellent <hi>salt,</hi> because they
season as salt doth, but emphatically called the <hi>salt,</hi> or
the most excellent <hi>salt,</hi> because they season so as no other
salt can doe. Nay they are not only <hi>salt,</hi> and <hi>the salt,</hi> but
<hi>the salt of the earth,</hi> not the salt of one Town, or City, or
Island only, but the <hi>salt of the earth,</hi> that is of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the earth, <hi>ye are the salt of the earth.</hi> And yet they are
not properly salt neither, they are but the salters, or seasoners.
But our Saviour doth here ascribe that which is proper to the
doctrine of the Gospell to them that preach it. Observe by the
way, that our Saviour in calling them <hi>the salt of the earth,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely
prefers them before the prophets, who were only the
salt of <hi>Iudea:</hi> But the Apostles and their successors are the <hi>salt of
the earth, of the whole earth.</hi> Mat. 28. 19. Observe also that in
calling them salt, he doth as it were make a secret promise of the
power and efficacy of the Gospell-Ministry to season the
world, and to keep men from putrifying in sinne. The sence of
the whole is plainly this, ye my Apostles and all the Ministers of
my ordinances, and pastors of my Church, in respect of the
doctrine of the law and the Gospell which you shall preach,
shall deliver men from the corruption, and filthinesse of sin,
and shall render them acceptable and savory to God, whom by
nature they cannot please. Loe here the usefullnesse and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of a Gospell-Ministry? When our Saviour compares;
it to sait, he commends it almost as highly, as if he had said
it were incomparable; For their is nothing (according to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44913:9"/>
proverbe) more usefull and needfull, than the sun, and salt.</p>
            <p>Take this doctrinall conclusion for a foundation of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
discourse, that</p>
            <p>The Ministers of the Gospell are the salt of the world.<note place="margin">Doctr.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This may easily be proved, F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>st from the nature, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes,
and manifold vertues of salt. Secondly from the titles
that the spirit of God gives them in Scripture. Thirdly by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>1. The First property of <hi>salt</hi> is to season tastlesse and unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury
things. It is a soveraigne condiment and singularly
usefull and necessary. And it may be called the condiment of
condiments, not only because it excells them, but also because it
helpes them, and contributes to their goodnesse. And it hath
that to commend it which few of our spices have, even it's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.
Spices are the superfluous ornament of meats, but salt
their necessary condiment. It is so necessarily subservient to the
seasoning of meats, and rendring them savoury, and gratefull to
the palate, that it hath deserved and found the name of Natures
balsome, and the Soul of bodyes; wherefore nature hath wisely
mixt salt with all well compounded bodyes, to season, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them from corruption; as may be exemplifyed in the salt
urine of beasts, and the saltnesse of roots: and is so commonly
received, that every Smatterer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in Chymistry will tell you that
Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury are ingredients in all mixt bodyes.</p>
            <p>Thus the Ministry of the Gospell is the salt of the world,
without which our condition is desperate and deplorable. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could I tell what answer to make, if one should aske me.
How it comes to pass that men abound with errors in their
heads, wickedness in their lives, and corruptions in their hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s,
but this, They are not seasoned with this salt. Our whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
without this is unsavoury, nauseous and indeed
odious to God, as the Psalmist describes a pure (that is, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure)
nature, <hi>Ps.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3. without this salt, what is the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the wold but a world of folly; what are morall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
but corrall vices, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ub the gums indeed, to make
men appear well as to the teeth outward, but not changing or
cleansing the inward heart and mind? Nay how can any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
indeed please God That wants salt, <hi>Lev.</hi> 2. 13. Or any
thing please a judicious palate that is unseasoned? Can that
which is unsavoury be eaten without salt. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eb.</hi> 6. 6. As if he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44913:9"/>
had said, can any one be delighted with meat that has not been
seasoned with salt? So, take away the Ministry of the word,
and all wordly things are presently unsavoury, gladness is
converted into sadnesse, or the best joyes are but toye sat best,
the purest gold is but dross, and they deserve no better Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
than <hi>Iob's</hi> friends, <hi>Physitians of no value,</hi> Iob. 13. 4. <hi>Misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and troublesome comfort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s.</hi> Iob. 16. 2. It is necessary therefore
that men be seasoned with this heavenly salt, that they be not
corrupted. For there is nothing better to preserve our hearts
from corruption than the savory Ministry of the Gospell.</p>
            <p>2. Another property of <hi>salt</hi> is Acrimony. Salt by it's acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
bites, eats, pierceth, pricketh. Flatnesse, faintnesse and
want of sharpnesse is a defect in salt.</p>
            <p>Thus the preaching of the law pierceth and pricketh the
consciences of sinners, that they seek of the Gospell for a salve,
<hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39. This makes men sound in the faith, therefore <hi>Paul</hi>
commands <hi>Titus</hi> to corn the <hi>Cretians</hi> with this <hi>salt.</hi> Tit. 1. 13.
<hi>Rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith.</hi> As <hi>Elisha</hi> by
casting salt into the spring of the naughty waters, healed them,
so our naughty and ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>en hearts being leasoned with the salt of
Gods word and spirit, becomes pleasing and acceptable to God.
Moreover as salt by its sharp heat, penetrates, attenuates, and
worketh the whole lump, so there is nothing more piercing
than the word of God, hewing like an axe, and slaying like a
sword. <hi>Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> 5. 6. He that would understand this property of
Gods word, let him consult and examine the Apostles six Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. It is quick, powerfull, sharpe, pie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it can divide, where the subtile wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

consolidates the substantiall parts by uniting the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44913:10"/>
native vertue, shutting up the pores and passages, and
shutting out the injurious assaults of the extraneous ayre.</p>
            <p>Thus the Ministers of Christ do the worke of salt by plucking
up sin by the roots, which is that corrupt and noxious humor,
which hath diffused its self through the whole soule. This the
salt of the Word expells by reproving Errors, by wasting the
sinfull desires of the old man, and by hardning the new
man against all injuryes, and by fortifying it against all
assaults.</p>
            <p>This salt of the Word therefore with a constant, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
hand is to be sprinkled, by declaring the nature and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of sin, to prick the heart, not to tickle the eares, and
which may be enterteined with the beating of the breasts, not
the clapping of the hands. For I had rather that men
gnasht their teeth, and beat their heads, than nod with their
heads under our Ministry. The teares of the congregation
ought to be most in our eye. And their inarticulate groans do
least speak forth our commendations. Hence the Holy Ghost
every where in Scripture puts such a price upon salt because it
signifyes that mortification, which so restraines the soft effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacyes
and delicacyes of the flesh, and all sweet carnall delights
and tickling pleasures, and hinders the inordinate affections of
the flesh from shewing themselves in the flesh. This grace doth
that to the spirit which salt doth to flesh, which will not suffer
it to putrifye, and dissolve into corruption and filthinesse, as it
would doe, were it not consolidated and hardned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
            <p>4. Salt begets an appetite to meat or drink, and is so usefull
in meats that we scarce know how to live without it. Bread
requires a mixture of this to season it, and it also begets an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
to drink.</p>
            <p>Thus the preaching of Gods word doth beget an exceeding
thirst after heavenly things It may most truly be sayed of these
waters of the Sanctuary. <hi>Quo plus sunt potae, plus sitiuntur,</hi> The
more a man drinks of them, the more he shall thirst after them.</p>
            <p>It cannot be sayd of this water, as our Saviour sayes of the
grace of God. Ioh. 4. 14. <hi>He that drinketh of it shall never thirst
more,</hi> but rather, he shall thirst the more: when <hi>Peters</hi> hearers
had tasted some of this salt, see how they thirst after the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44913:10"/>
water of life, after salvation. Act. 2. 39. For so says the test,
<hi>when they heard this, they sayd, Men and Brethen, what shall we
doe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>Salt</hi> is the Symbol or Hieroglyphick of wisdome.<note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note> Hence
wise men, and fools have names given them in Latine from salt:
as also all kind of jests, and wittinesses in speech, and festivity do
derive their name from hence. In so much as to reach a man
salt is interpreted by some people as an indignity, as much in
effect as to call him a foole.</p>
            <p>Thus the Ministers of the Gospell do correct the foolish
manners of the world, and render them savory. Take away
this condiment, and you take away all reall and true wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

bodies from corruption and putrifaction, and suffers
them not to perish, but playing the soule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it were, resisteth
death. Hence Antiquity above all things required salt at the
table, because it signifyed the perfection and perseverance of
friendship. And therefore many of the Heathens (and even
some of us who inherit their superstition) counted it ominous
and unlucky, if at any time it happened that the salt were spilt
upon the table, as though by <hi>this</hi> some breach of friendship
were portended.</p>
            <p>Thus the Ministry of the Gospell, although by chance and
indirectly it occasion divisions and warres (as our Saviour
brought not peace but a sword) yet directly, intentionally and
of it self, it both creates and conserveth the amity, peace, and
union of the faithfull, both with their God and amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
The Gospell is properly and deservedly styled, <hi>the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. <hi>Salt</hi> is medicinall to the body. It is a medicament as well
as a condiment. Therefore Physitians say that new-born in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
should be sprinkled with salt or salted water, not only to
scoure off all uncleannesse, but also to consolidate the members
of the body, and to bind up and heal the wound of the navell.
To which God himself alludes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 4. For salt doth
certainly conferre a solidity and fatnesse to naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes.</p>

upon the tables of the rich, but even with the poorest, where
there is scarce a table to be found. Thus ought the Ministers of
the Gospell to be so easy and common, that he that seeks them
may easily find them, and so facile and amiable in their carriage,
that no one may fly their presence, that desires to learn of them.

thing being in it self good and profitable, proves good to some
and hurtfull to others, and upon many has an operation besides
its nature. The Sun it self by its beams helps some to see, and
blinds the sight of others. And as salt, so the word of God,
according to the diversity of the subject, becomes either usefull
or hurtfull.</p>
            <p>16. <hi>Salt</hi> is a Symbol of discretion and prudence. If it be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44913:13"/>
moderately mixed with meats, it presents the palate with
a pleasant rellish, but to much of it renders it unsavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>Thus let the Ministers of the Gospell do all things with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scretion
and judgment lest by too much and indiscreet affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of bitter and harsh expressions and applications, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
the graces like furyes, they disaffect the auditors against
the truth of the doctrine, and render it nauseous, and odious to
them. Let them use such a moderate and convenient mixture of
Law and Gospel, whereby the sharpnesse of the one may be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed,
and the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the other may be sharpned, and both
together may be edifying, and usefull; that the Gospel may
not let men altogether sit still, nor the Law make them run out
of their vits. For it is our design to season men, not to destroy
them to salt them not to subvert them. The proverb is well
known, <hi>we must buy salt and oyle.</hi> Oyle signi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Therefore the sons of the Physitians mix oyle with salt,
that it may not be too corrosive.</p>
            <p>It may well become the Sons of the prophets to imitate these
men, and to poure the oyle of gladnesse into the wounds which
smart with the salt terrors of the Law. Let them so divide the
word of truth, that weak consciences be not swallowed up of
sadnesse by the immoderate austerity of the law, nor licentious
hearts encouraged by the over-wide and unlimited charter of
the Gospell.</p>
            <p>Thus we have seen the propertyes of salt, and a proofe of the doctrine by
those propertyes. Let us now look into the titles which the sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

            <p>THe Holy Ghost hath set upon the heads of the Ministers of
Christ many glorious inscriptions, and given them the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
of many worthy names, and hath thought good to call
them, <hi>The salt of the earth, the sun and light of the world, Men of God,

            <p>1. They are called <hi>the salt of the earth;</hi> which expression we
have already insisted upon.</p>
            <p>2. They are called <hi>the light of the world, Mat.</hi> 5. 14. Now
what is either more profitable or more pleasant than <hi>light?</hi>
Without it we cannot discern between things that dif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

world would be wholy over-spread with the grossnesse of
darknesse, the darknesse of sin, and sinfull errors. Hence it is
that God himself opposes darknesse to divination. <hi>Mic.</hi> 3. 6.
It's true, Christ Iesus the light of the world, and the sun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,

They are the lights enlightned, and enlightning the world with

Although indeed all Christians are also lights in their measure,
and ought to shine as lights in the world, as Children of the light,
<hi>Phil,</hi> 2. 15. Yet this title is by way of Eminence due to the
Ministers of Christ, because they ought in an especiall manner

            <p>4. They are called <hi>Prophets of God.</hi> which title is not only

of the Gospell. For these discharge that sacred employment,
which the prophets under the old Testament discharged, and do

Gospell are priests, in that by the preaching of the word they
subject men to God. <hi>Paul</hi> was such a priest offering up the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 16. and such are all other preachers of the
Gospell, in praying for the people, and consecrating themselves
to God in a more peculiar manner.</p>
            <p>6. They are called <hi>bearers of the vessels of the Lord, Is.</hi> 52. 11.
in whose presence they stand <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 8. and whose substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
they are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being appointed to preach, administer Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and to other sacred employments. Let these <hi>bearers of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44913:14"/>
uessels of the Lord,</hi> have their own vessels holy to the Lord, and
handle holy things in a holy manner. For if the Ministers of
the tabernacle must be clean in heart and hands, how much
more cleannesse is required at our hands both towards God
and men, who carry not the vessels, but the word of the
Lord.</p>
            <p>7. They are called <hi>Stewards,</hi> or <hi>Dispensers of the Mysteries of God.
1. Cor. 4. 1. 2. Tit.</hi> 1. 7. that is, of Grace, Iustification, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
and Salvation. Neither are they the stewards of
Emperors, or Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of the heavenly householder. Now
the great commendation of a steward is his faithfullnesse. <hi>Luk.
12.</hi> 42. And the best expression of faithfullnesse is to design his
Masters profit and credit, and not his own; and also to serve his
Masters will, and not his own, in administring the affayres of
the family. He accomodates his distributions to the capacity of
the subject; gives milke to the babes, and strong meat to strong
men; and also purgeth the family of all corrupt members.
Hence it is that they have received the Keys from God, with
which they open the gates of heaven to believers, and lock them
against the unbelievers. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 19. Now the Lord who hath
in effect call'd us stewards, effectually call us to be faithfull.</p>
            <p>8. They are called <hi>VVorkmen,</hi> or <hi>Reapers in the Lords harvest,</hi>
and <hi>Vine dressers, whom he sends into his vineyard Mat, 9. 37. 20. 1.
1. Thes. 3. 2. 2. Tim.</hi> 2. 15. This phrase denotes not only
the necessity of a Gospell-Ministry, but the diligent laborious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Ministers. Those that assert the easinesse of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
employment, will not (I believe) speak so much in favor
of a Reapers work, and yet their employments run parallell in
the Scripture dialect. Ministers are called Reapers; Now Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
you know, are exposed to the heat of the Sunne, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of winds, showrs and storms, which hardships do require
a strong and hardy nature, not a man accustomed to idlenesse and
pleasure. Ministers break themselves with labours, wear and
wast themselves with watchings, and are therefore called labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
1. Tim. 5. 17. such labourers as husbandmen, reapers,
Souldyers, who weary themselves with working. For
such is the force of the Greek phrase.</p>
            <p>The employment of the Ministers of Christ is so laborious,
that it attenuates and consumes the body, impaires the strength,
hastens old hairs to young heads to the grave. Our Saviour

Christ at three and thirty years of age by his great paines in

nay divine dignity, in which we may find a consolation
almost as great as the dignity, inferring, that if we miscarry
not in our duty, God will be also our fellow-labourer, and help
us by his labour. For what man will forsake, the plowmen,
the Shepheards, the Stewards, which himself sets a work?
And what good commander is thers, but will encourage, vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate,

darily the Ministers of the Gospell upon this account are so
too.</p>
            <p>10. They are called <hi>Gods. Moses</hi> that faithfull servant of God,
and steward of his house, is called a <hi>God,</hi> even by God himself,
Exod. 4. 16. <hi>Thou shalt be to</hi> Aaron <hi>instead of God,</hi> and again,

he is expos'd to, <hi>as Iacob</hi> complains of himself. Gen. 31. 38, 39,

of Christ, with the food of heavenly doctrine, keep them from
the poysonous and rotting pastures of hereticks, and the wolves
from them, and do also govern the sheep committed to them
with the rod of discipline.</p>
            <p>13. They are called <hi>builders</hi> of the Church. Eph. 4. 11,
12, 1. Cor. 3. 10. For by their doctrine the people of God
are built up and do grow in faith and mutuall charity. The
Church of God is a building, the Master builder or Architect is
God, the inferiour workmen are his Ministers, whereof some

as a temple fit for God to dwell in. The prophets of old
were Gods masons, Hos. 6. 5. <hi>I have hewed them by the prophets.</hi>
For as the Mason cutts, hews, and squares the stones, so by the
means of the law do the Ministers of Christ, hew us, square, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
us, that we may be fit materialls for the building up of a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall

prepare every particular house committed to their charge
to be some part in this building, wherein let them use discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>14. They are called <hi>Christs witnesses.</hi> Ioh. 15. 27. Act. 1.
8. Rev. 2. 13. 11. 3. 22. 16. Now they witnesse to Christ,
both by their preaching, as by a verball, and their conversations,
as by a practicall and reall testimony. For it every ordinary
judge will look for faithfullnesse and veracity, exact and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall
knowledg of the thing, and honesty and integrity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
in every one of his currant witnesses, much more doth
Christ require at the hands of his Ministers those extraordinary
witnesses, that by life as well as language they do truly, freely,
explicitely, ingenuously and constantly, own and witnesse to
him and his truth; And that those qualifications of every su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

            <p>15. They are called <hi>Servants of Iesus Christ,</hi> Rom. 1. 1.
Phil. 1. 1. sam. 1. 1. Not servants of men, of pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that God, who is above all men, of that Monarch, who is the
King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. Neither are they of Gods
ordinary sort of servants, as all creatures are his servants by the
right of creation. <hi>Ps.</hi> 119. 91. Or as all the Elect are his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
by the right of redemption, but his servants by vertue of
their mission, commission and ambassage, after a more peculiar
manner. They are the servants of Christ by way of Eminence,
in that they doe him more Eminent service then others, and in
so serving him doe govern his, which title yet doth enforce
pains, as well as conferr honour, for a servant is all his Masters.
For him he works, for him he wins, to him he lives and dyes:
He doth all things for his Masters profit, and according to his
Masters pleasure. So they owe to Christ what ever they have,
or are, and therefore ought to lay out and expend whatever
they have, or are, life, liberty, wit, wealth for this honour and
glory, and esteem themselves great gainers, in being profitable

            <p>18. They are called <hi>Christs Souldyers. 2, Tim,</hi> 2, 3. 4. Now
a souldier has much to doe, and more to suffer; their action is
fighting, 1. <hi>Tim,</hi> 1. 18. Their suffering is, not only the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of their adversaries, which they must sustain, but they are
exposed to hunger, and thirst, the heat of the day and the cold
of the night, and many wearisome watchings. Hence the
Apostle calls his fellow-Ministers, <hi>fellow-Souldiers. Phil 2. 25.

that they are called to a warfare, that there is a combat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for them, and that therefore they must either fight
for Gods cause, or dye for the cause of not fighting.</p>
            <p>19. They are called <hi>Guides</hi> of the Church. <hi>Act. 8. 31. Rom.
2. 19. Heb.</hi> 13. 7, 17, 24. because they lead others in the
ways of Salvation. They are the examples of believers,
whom all behold for imitation, and do conform themselves to,

            <p>It is with an Emphasis, that the Apostle calls them so oft <hi>the
guides or the leaders,</hi> in that 13. Chap. to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> Because
they either lead or ought to lead the people of God in the ways
of God. For although it be proper to God onely to lead men,
yet because he leads them by his word, he is pleased to
communicate this honourable title to the preachers of this word.</p>

these shall be turned into darknesse, the sun shall be totally ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipsed,

For 1. like Angells they are messengers sent by God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
his will to men. 2. They ought to imitate an Angelicall,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44913:18"/>
purity, chastity, zeal and celerity, that they may be as Angells
amongst men, Masters amongst boyes, and shepheards amongst
sheep. So that this name also brings duty with it, as well as
dignity. Many would be content to be Angells to dwell in
heaven, but loath to be Angells to doe Gods errands upon
earth; but he that would enjoy the honour, must first be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the office, and execute that office too with carefull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
cherefullnesse and speedinesse, as the Angells doe. Now if
<hi>Timothy</hi> as being a man of God, must flee covetousnesse; how
much rather ought he to doe it as being an Angell of God. And
if the Angels of God by pride fell from the presence and glory
of God, it concerns these Angels that yet they be humble as
men. What matters now though the world call us blind guides;
God counts us starrs, and will set us in heaven, when the starrs
themselves shall be misplaced. What though they call us devills;
it is honour enough that God counts us Angels. Let us doe
the work of Angels, and God will not stick to own us and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
us as such, before all men and Angels.</p>
            <p>28. They are called <hi>Presbiters</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> a name implying, not
their age, but office and dignity, common to all the Ministers of

So Christ Iesus makes use of the paines of his Ministers, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade

the King.</p>
            <p>30. They are called <hi>Legates, messengers, ambassadors</hi> for Christ,
<hi>Hag. 1. 13. 2. Cor. 5. 20. Eph.</hi> 6. 20. to be Ambassador
from any prince is an honour, from a renowned Monarch is
more, but to be employed an Ambassador for Christ Iesus is of
all other honours most honourable. And such ambassadors are
Christs Ministers. And therefore <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>1. as an Ambassador keeps
himself within the limits of his commission, and observes how
he is bounded by his Princes commands, so let the Ministers of
Christ deliver their Masters mind freely, and yet truly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
detracting from, or adding any thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the same. 2. As
no Ambassadour assumes that province to himself, nor puts
himself into commission. So let them expect their Masters missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
before they fall a running: and 3. As Ambassadors are safe
from any violence; so let these promise themselves the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of their Master, and well they may, for they serve the
best Master in the world, who not only sends them of his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage,
but goes along with them also. And let <hi>England</hi> take
heed of doing violence or offering abuse to these Ambassadors,
for if <hi>David</hi> did revenge upon <hi>Hanun</hi> the base usage of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and the Romans sackt Carthage, for offering violence to
their Ambassadors, surely Christ, that interprets despites done to
his Ministers, to be done to himself, will sharply and surely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the quarrell of his Ambassadors, and the dishonour done
unto them.</p>
            <p>31. They are called <hi>fishers of men.</hi> Mat. 4. 19. Mar. 1. 17.
Luk. 5. 10. Because they do, as it were by the preaching of the
word catch men, that wander up and down the wide world, as
it were in a deep and vast Ocean. And under this Metaphor, a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44913:19"/>
diligent and unwearyed care and endeavour to gain many
souls is enjoyned to them. For fishers many times catch at
what they catch not, it may be, toyle all the night and catch
nothing, therefore they had need of patience and constancy:
they are exposed to tempests &amp; ill weather, nay, have their lives
allwayes in jeopardy by reason of the raging waves and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull
deeps, therefore had need of a great share of courage
&amp; hardinesse, to adventure upon the one, and endure the other.
Oh that we had <hi>Peter</hi>'s successe to catch many fishes, or at least <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
indefatigablenesse, patiently to endure toyling all the night.</p>
            <p>32. They are called <hi>Husbandmen.</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 9. &amp; therefore are
called <hi>planters</hi> and <hi>waterers of God vineyard.</hi> 1. Cor. 3. 6. The prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and chief Husbandman is God, Ioh. 15. 1. The secunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or subordinate Husbandman is the Minister of God. God

               </gap>rdly by his spirit, the Minister outwardly by his word
&amp; doctrine. And as the field is plowed and sowed to bring
forth fruit to its owner, so is the Church plowed and sowed to bring
forth fruit to God, whose it is, and whose they are that till it.
See here the necessity of a Ministry, without bread no life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
corn no bread, without Husbandry no corn, without
Husbandmen no Husbandry, why so without faith no
Salvation, without hearing no faith, without preaching no
hearing, and how can there be preaching without preachers?</p>
            <p>33. They are compar'd to <hi>Oxen, 1, Cor. 9. 9. 1. Tim.</hi> 5.
18. under the name of an <hi>Oxe,</hi> the indefatigable labour of a
Minister is typically and allegorically set forth. For the Oxe
is a very laborious Creature, and very profitable by its labour,
(Prov. 14. 4. <hi>Much encrease is by the strength of the Oxe</hi>) and
that not to it self but to its Master. So let the Ministers of
Christ be laborious and industrious, and that for Christ, not
for themselves. The <hi>Oxe</hi> is slow in work but sure: If a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
be cast upon hard ground, amongst a dull and slow people
of understanding, it matters not for much hast or acutenesse,
Let him accommodate himself to their capacityes, rather study
to doe his work firmly then finely; Let him not think much
to explain, presse and inculcate the same things again and again.
And as the <hi>Oxe</hi> content with grasse, hay or straw is an Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick of frugality, So let a Minister of Christ be sober and
frugall, minding more his work then his meat. As an <hi>Oxe</hi> is a
harmlesse and innocuous creature, by the verdict of the poet,

to the greatest diligence, when there is the worst weather
in the Church. As the <hi>Oxe</hi> is profitable both in his life and
death, so let every faithfull and able Minister of Christ, be
serviceable to the Church of Christ, not only by his preachings
but also writings. Again as the ground which the <hi>Oxe</hi> plows
not, brings forth briers and thorns, but that which is by him
broken up and prepared, presents the Husbandman with a
wellcome harvest: So the souls to whom the sound of the
Gospell preached doth not come, that have no teaching priest,
no ministeriall Oxe to break up the fallow ground, are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
with the weeds and rubbish of vices, but those over
whose souls the plow of Gods word, held by the Ministers of
Christ, doth passe, are fruitfull in graces and vertues. And
lastly, as it is sit that the <hi>Oxe</hi> should feed of the harvest which
he gets in, and eat of the corn which he treads forth; So is it fit
that he that serveth at the Altar should live of the Altar, that he
that preaches spirituall things should receive of their temporalls
to whom he preaches; which piece of equity the Apostle proves
by many arguments. 1. Cor. 9.</p>
            <p>34. They are called God's <hi>Trumpetters. Hos. 5. 8 and</hi> 8. 1.
Because they must cry with a loud, shrill, and trumpet-like

we through ignorance or idleness suffer not those souls to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
whose Salvation God hath as it were entrusted into our
hands. Neither is that cavill worth any thing, that it is God
alone that converts and regenerates: For we do not deny it.
God saves, and so do we. He saves absolutely and principally,
we only subserviently and instrumentally, we endeavour the
salvation of souls, Gods gives efficacy and successe to our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.

That which God could do without us, he is yet plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed

that work which the hand does that acts us: we save men;

which Argument might be of sufficient strength to establish

To what purpose are all these Names, and honourable Titles,
if there be no such Order, as Ministers, in the Church?
Which Order is not of a moneths, a years, or an Ages stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but must be contemporary with the world, even in its

long as there shall be a world for it to be in; which we shall
prove by Arguments; 1. Confirming the truth. 2. Infirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and confuting the Cavills of the Anabaptists.</p>
            <p>1. It is plain, by those Evangelicall Prophesies and Promises,
by which God hath made himself a debtor to his Church. He
standeth engaged to his people, in all ages, as well as to those
of the Primitive times, to give them Pastors according to his
own heart, who shall feed them with knowledg and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<hi>Isa. 30. 20. Ierem.</hi> 3. 15. and 23. 4. <hi>Ezech.</hi>
44. 23.</p>
            <p>2. It is plain by the Promise of Christs presence, and help
with the Ministry of his Word, to the end of the world; the
enrollment of which Promise we may see <hi>Matth. 28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20. Loe,</hi> I
<hi>am with you</hi> (not a day, nor a year, but) <hi>alway, even unto the
end of the world.</hi> Although it may be shaken sore in this
world, yet it shall not be pluckt up by the roots; although
many may, and do gnash their teeth against it, yet shall
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44913:24"/>
they not be able to devour it; for Christ will build his
Church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it,
or its Ministry. Neither did our Saviour make this Promise
only (though chiefly) to his Apostles, but to all his Ministers
also in generall, that either in times past have been, to us who
now are, and to them that shall be after us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even to the end
of the world.</p>
            <p>3. The Offices of Ministers, and the works of the Ministry,
shall be perpetuall, Therefore shall the Ministry it self last also.
The Preaching of the Word, and the Administration of the
Sacraments are Offices of Ministers, and works of the Ministry;

of the representation of Christ in Sacraments, they have the

is sure then a fancy onely beseeming the heady brains, or rather
brainless heads of Anabaptists. It is the proper Priviledg of

Temple or Ordinances; Amongst them it is, that <hi>Prophes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>7. It appeares by the care of the Apostles for the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Successors, and the perpetuation of a Ministry
in the Church. <hi>Paul</hi> commands <hi>Titus</hi> to ordain Elders and
Bishops in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> city, describes the persons to be ordained, and

               </gap>, and cautions <hi>Timothy</hi> also about the same thing;
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ds him keep the commands relating to this Ministry till
the appearing of the Lord Iesus Christ; which Injunction is
not onely laid upon <hi>Timothy</hi> in his own person, but upon all
the Ministers of Christ that shall be in succession to the end
of the world.</p>
            <p>8. It appeares by that honor, reverence, and submission,
which, by vertue of the command, is due to the Successours
of the Apostles, 1 <hi>Thes. 5. 12, 13. Phil. 2. 29. Heb.</hi> 13. 17. Which
things, so long as they are due, must needs have, and prove
Ministers of the Gospel to whom they shall be given. And
if you take a way <hi>them that are over you in the Lord, your Messengers,
them that have the rule over you,</hi> and that <hi>watch for your soules,</hi> I
pray you tell me, where will you bestow the <hi>high estimation</hi>

and <hi>love,</hi> the <hi>reputation, obedience,</hi> and <hi>submission</hi> which the
great Apostle commands to be given, in the fore-quoted
Texts.</p>
            <p>9. It appears by that constant provision that God has made
for his Ministers, ordering them honourable stipends for their
work, <hi>Gal. 6. 6. 1 Cor. 9. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14. 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 17, 18. which provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is laid up in the store-house of the Gospell, not onely
for the Apostles sake, but all theirs that are Ministers of
Christ in succession. Now to what purpose should these
commands of God remain in the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble, if there should not be
a remainder of Ministers still in the Church. God needed
not to have provided meat for his Ministers, if he had been
minded that men should have sewed up their m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Words are not properly Scripture,, but the sense;
neither does the Scripture properly consist in the leaves of
words, but in the root of reason; the Word of God is not
to be taken <hi>formally,</hi> as it is described by words and syllables,
but <hi>materially,</hi> as it declares to us the minde and counsell of
God; we must not stick in the bark, for that hath involved
the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>
               </hi> and <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in many Errours.</p>
            <p>2. If we must needs have so much regard to the letter
of the Text, it rather takes away Private Instruction, then
Publick Preaching; for God does not say, there shall be no
publick Preachers, but <hi>They shall no more t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ach every man his
neighbour, and every man his brother.</hi> But neither can we dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ard
private Instructions under the Gospell, if S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Paul</hi> be a
Gospell-man, who presseth this duty, <hi>Coloss. 3. 16. 1 Thes.</hi>
5. 11.</p>
            <p>3. The Text is a Promise: Now Promises must not
shoulder out, nor overthrow Precepts; neither must the means
be taken away, because the primary cause is laid down and
asserted. God feeds all, it does not follow, therefore that
tillag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is unnecessary, or bread needless, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or by these means
God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eeds us. No more does it follow, that because God
teacheth, therefore the ministry of his word is unnecessary,
for God teacheth by the ministry of his Word.</p>
            <p>4. The genuine scope of the Text is to shew us, that
God teacheth his Elect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not onely <hi>externally</hi> by the ministry
of his Word, but <hi>internally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> by the ministry of his Holy
Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it. Neither does the Prophet speak absolutely, simply<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:44913:26"/>
and inclusively; but comparatively, as the Holy Ghost
frequently speaks. Things spoken negatively in Scripture, are
oft times to be understood comparatively, and are not to be
expounded so much by (not) as by (not so much,) which is
plain in <hi>Hos. 6. 6. Psal. 50. 8. Psal. 51. 16. Iohn 6. 38. Iohn</hi> 7. 16.
and many other places: So that the sum of the Prophets words
will easi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uller and clearer knowledg of
God in the times of the New Testament, then there was in
the times of the Old. 1. Because under the Old Testame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t
Christ was obscurely shadowed out in Types; but under the
New he is plainly preach'd, and shewn openly; insomuch, that
a very boy, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>echised and instructed doth understand
the Gospell concerning Christ, beter then many of the Priests
of the Law did; which is the accomplishment of that Promise.
<hi>Isa. 11. 9. The earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord.</hi>
2. Because there are farre more that are blessed with the saving
knowledg of God in the times of the New Testament, than
were in the times of the Old, the Preaching of the Word not
being restrained to one Nation now, as it was then, but
common to all. 3. By reason of the more plentifull Effusions
of the grace of God, there shall not need so much pains and
trouble to instruct the Elect now, as formerly there needed.
This is plain from <hi>vers.</hi> 33. where it is said, <hi>I will write my Law
in their hearts,</hi> not in their lips, not in tables of stones, not on
the fringes of their garments (as it was sometimes among the
<hi>Iews</hi>) but in their hearts, by giving them pious affections, and
inclinations for the Law of God. That of <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the
place gives the substance of the Interpretation; <hi>God, who had
more darkly represented himself under the Law, promiseth a more
glorious discovery under the Gospell; in so much, that the knowledg of
God shall be then, as it were, familiar, and common: But it is by an</hi>
Hyperbole <hi>that he commendeth this grace, when he saies, that no one
shall need any Master or Teacher, but every one shall be sufficiently
instructed: Neither yet does he say exactly, that they shall not teach
every one his neighbour, but they shall not teach every one his neighbour,
saying, Know the Lord;</hi> i. e. <hi>there shall be such a measure of
knowledg, that men shall be no longer Abecedarians: For this phrase</hi> (know the Lord) <hi>seems to point at the first beginning, and rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Religion.</hi> The minde of the Prephet in this place
(which we willingly yield) can be nothing but this, that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44913:26"/>
God will send out a greater light, and greater measures of
knowledg in the times of the Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pell, and will deale more
freely and familiarly with his people then, than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>5. If having given the naturall sense, &amp; genuine scope of the
text, we may use an answer <hi>ad hominem,</hi> I would fain know
why the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and Quakers, that stand up for this litterall
meaning, and apply the promise to our days, can make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
these new lights, and the heirs of this promise, and yet
goe about saying <hi>know the Lord.</hi> Certainly if this be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the promise, these be the times of the accomplishment of
it, and they the persons to whom it belongs, they contradict
their interpretation, and even break the neck of the promise, in
going from town to town, from street to street, from house to
house, teaching men to repent, to turn to the Lord, to know the
Lord, and a great deal more of this, and so take Gods work out
of his hands, for they should be all taught of the Lord. And if
they say, true men shall be taught of the Lord, but it
shall be by the means of men, then why are not we as
fit to teach as they? This now brings to my mind
their</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Obj.</hi> Which they build upon, <hi>Is.</hi> 54. 13. where God
promiseth that <hi>all the faithfull shall be taught of the Lord.</hi> Therefore
the Ministry of the word is needlesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This rather raiseth up then razeth out the Ministry of
the word, of which there shall be need in the New-Testament,
no lesse then in the old. All know that Scripture is the best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
of Scripture. Now Christ reacheth us what it is to be
taught of God. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 45. God teacheth us two ways, by the
outward preaching of his word and by the inward revelations
of his spirits. God here promiseth that his elect shall be taught,
not only by the teachers of the Church from without, but by
the Holy Spirit from within. Christians in this text of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
seem to be put in opposition to the lews, whose teachings
under the old Testament were more externall then internall.
And it is here promised that the spirit of God shall be mightily
efficacious by the Ministery of the word, and that it shall be
more free and liberall in distributing its gifts and graces under
the New Testament. So that these two kinds of teachings are
rather united in this text than divided. To be taught of God is

not to be taught of him immediately, but mediately by the
preaching of the word, as appears from <hi>Luk 10. 16. Act</hi> 10. 33.
But further if this text of the prophet be interpreted for the
overthrow of the Ministry of the word, how will it agree with
<hi>Ier. 3. 15. Mat. 28. 20. Rom.</hi> 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the Church. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be owned for the Children of the Church, that reject her
education. And it is in vain to boast the revelations of the spirit;
for the spirit teaches none, save those who submit themselves
to the ministry of the Word. Account we them therefore the
brats of the Devill, not the genuine begotten of God, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
this holy ordinance of his own institution. For we see
these two, (the Children of the Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch) and (the taught of

God, who will not be taught in the Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>2. If we may make an answer <hi>ad hominem,</hi> It little becomes
the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> to decrye a Ministry, and forbid prophesying
who otherwise bid all to do it, plead the cause of the gifted
brethren so stiffly, and give them a licence for prophesying
at their pleasure. No wonder if they would set Scripture to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by the ears, and make contradictions in them, who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
do contradict themselves, and whose latter opinions do
fall out and quarrell with their former.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Obj.</hi> Is grounded upon 1. Ioh. 2. 20, 27. <hi>Ye have an
unction from the holy one, and ye know all things; And ye need not that
any man teach you.</hi> The Objection fram'd for the purpose of our
Libertines and New lights, will be of this form, who ever hath
the spirit of God, understandeth the Scriptures without a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
But we have this spirit of God. Therefore we understand
them without any teacher.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Major proposition is false. For whom the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God teacheth, it teacheth by teachers, Eph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. 11. and
not immediately, as was made to appear before. This anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
teacheth you all things, that is, The spirit of God is effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and powerfull by the preaching of the word, to enlighten
the minds of the faithfull in all things necessary to Salvation.
These elect persons knew all things, and so St. <hi>Paul</hi> could do
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44913:28"/>
all things he sayes, and yet I dare say there were many things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that they did not know, nor he could not doe: what shall we
say then? Why not that these elect persons were so many Gods,
which they must be, if they know all things. Ioh. 21. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Not that Paul was Omnipotent, not that these were Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
But Paul's Omnipotence, and their Omniscience must be
limited. The one could do all things belonging to his calling,
the other knew all things necessary to Salvation, at least in some
good measure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they knew all things which might serve for the
discovering of Anti-Christ, and the avoyding of his snares,
which is there the subject of the Apostles discourse. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
these things, or concerning the fundamentalls of religion,
<hi>ye need not that any man teach you;</hi> which words else are spoken
comparatively not absolutely, and come to this meaning. The
spirit of God teacheth you so plainly and powerfully, that no
one needs to bestow much pains to perswade you concerning
heavenly truths. The <hi>Major proposition</hi> being pull'd down, the
<hi>Minor,</hi> staggars, and the conclusion appears to be a mere
delusion.</p>
            <p>2. If they that have the spirit of God and the Holy anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<hi>know all things,</hi> and <hi>need not that any one teach them</hi> any
thing, in the sense which our Enthusiasts would interprete it,
I wonder that the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> could so farr forget himself, as
to write an Epistle for the instruction, &amp; edification of such Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscient
persons as these were. This sense of the text, which our
libertines will stitch to it, will not only render the Apostle
contradictory to Christ Iesus his Master, Mat. 9. 38. to the
Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> 1. Tim. 3. 1. and Eph. 4. 11, 12, 13. but to
himself also. As though a man should goe and teach another,

without an Arke, but he would not. He could have instructed
the Iews without Levites, have propagated the Gospell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Apostles, but he would not. He could save us indeed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44913:29"/>
without means, but it has pleased him to make use of means for
the regenerating of us, and to prescribe those means to us.

in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledg of the Son of God,
unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Christ. Not only till we be united to Christ by faith, but

               </gap>ill all the elect come to a perfect knowledg in the beatificall
vision, and to the full statute of Christ. These remain many
scales yet to be strucken off from the most enlightned eyes in the
world, and some cubits which may still be added to the highest
stature in this world by the word of God. The word of God
is not only the seed, of which the Christian babe is born<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
the food also, by which the Christian man is sed, 1. Pet. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Act. 20. 32. 1. Tim. 3. 16, 17. Therefore the
Apostle would not have believers to <hi>forsake the assembling of
themselves together,</hi> by way of Christian congregations to handle,
and hear Gods word. Heb. 10. 25. The word of God
preacht, that principle of regeneration, is also the principle of
nutrition. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was regenerate, yet he eate the word
of the Lord, and it was to <hi>him the joy and rejoycing of his heart.</hi>
Ier. 15. 16. <hi>David</hi> was regenerate, yet the word of God, was

<hi>Iob</hi> was regenerate, yet he hid, or rather hoarded up the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements

God for this Seasoner, and that he hath caused us to be

hath out of his mere goodness ordained a Ministry for us,
that he would preserve it amongst us; as he hath set, it up,
so that he would keep it standing, whilest the world it self

Iesus came and spake unto them saying, All power is given to
me in heaven and in earth; Go ye therefore, and teach all
Nations, baptizing them.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> magnifies his Ministry
by this authority, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 1. 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 1. and <hi>Gal 1. 1. Paul an
Apostle, not of men, nor by man, but by Iesus Christ, and
God the father,</hi> It is not mans appointment, but an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God; not a humane fiction, but a Divine
Institution.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Antiquity</hi> of it, which also commends the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a good thing. The Ministry of the Church is no new
Invention, but an ancient Ordination: for it had been
even from the beginning, which the Churches of God have
not wanted in any age, neither before, nor under, nor
since the Law; Before the Law were the Patriarchs, who
instructed their Families in the Worship of God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
Religion to their Posterity: Under the Law God
had his Priests, and Levites, and Prophets, who had their
unctions, missions, and Commissions from him: And since
the Law <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Christ hath given Apostles, Pastors,
Evangelists, Teachers.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Ministers of it:</hi> the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> the <hi>Prophets, Christ</hi>
himself, and his <hi>Apostles. Isaiah</hi> was of the blood: oyal, and
yet a Minister of this ministry: King <hi>Solomon</hi> commends
himself to the Church of God under the name of <hi>Koheleth:</hi>
and amongst other his Titles, seems to glory first, and most
in that of <hi>The Preacher, Eccles. 1. 1 The words of the Preacher,</hi>
and then it follows, <hi>the son of David, King in Ierusal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m. Noah</hi>
the Monarch of the whole world was a <hi>Preacher of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
2 Pet.</hi> 2. 5. Nay, <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> himself, God blessed for
evermore, <hi>came to minister, Mark.</hi> 10. 45. and to be the Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preacher
of the Gospel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. The Apostles and Teachers
that have succeeded him, being set up by him (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28.)
are also honourable: For what greater honour can there
be in Court, then to succeed in that place and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44913:32"/>
in which the King's son himself deigned sometime to be.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Object</hi> about which it is conversant: not the body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but the soul; not humane Laws, secular concernments, but
spirituall things relating to the worship, service, and glory
of God, and the salvation of soules. Physicians binde up
bruised bodies, Lawyers patch up broken Estates, whilest
Christ Ministers bind up broken hearts, and salve wounded
consciences. If therefore the body he unworthier then the
soul, the earth be content to be below the heavens, externalls
give place to eternalls; parity of reason will prefer this sacred
function before, and set it above all others.</p>
            <p>5. The <hi>Supernaturall Effects</hi> thereof, such as the Conversion,
Sanctification, and Salvation of man; In all which the
dignity of the sacred Ministry does admirably appear, and in
the dignity of the ministry doth also appear the dignity of the
Ministers. Neither let any one say, they are servants, they
are but Ministers, and therefore not to be honoured; for
that derogates not awhit from their honour: If they be
servants, they are the servants of the Church of God; If
they be Ministers, they are <hi>Ministers of Christ,</hi> the Lord of
heaven, earth, and hell, They are not the servants of Kings,
but of the King of Kings, to whom the glorious Angells
do gladly Minister; neither are they of the meanest of Christ's
servants, put in some low place of service, but they serve
him in the distribution of the most precious treasure, even
Gospell-grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. now to be the Treasurer of the
Lord, is a greater honour then to be Lord-Treasurer. And
if there be honour in the meanest Office performed for God,
as he wing wood, and drawing water for the Sanctuary, and
keeping the door of the house of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84. 10. surely the
highest Offices cannot be dishonourable. All the things that
render any service honourable, do concurre to make this
great employment truly honourable. 1. <hi>VVe serve an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Master,</hi> the Lord <hi>Iehorah,</hi> the Monarch of heaven and
earth. 2. <hi>Our service is in it self</hi> excellent and honourable.
3. <hi>Our wages and reward is the highest of all others, viz.</hi> a Crown
of glory; God does not onely honour his faithfull ministers
that honour him, in this life; but he has reserved a more
exceeding weight of glory for them against the time to come.
Oh what admirable honour will be given of God at the last
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44913:33"/>
day to his faithfull Ministers! Then shall stand forth before
God, and his Angels, and all men, <hi>Andrew</hi> bringing with
him his <hi>Achaians,</hi> whom by his ministry he gained to Christ;
<hi>Iohn</hi> with his <hi>Asians. Thomas</hi> with his <hi>Indians; Peter</hi> with his
<hi>Iews; Paul</hi> with his Gentiles; and all the pious and painfull
Ministers of Christ, with the children that God hath given
them in their respective Ages and Generations, and these
shall be their crown of glorying, in the presence of Iesus
Christ at his coming, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
            <p>What remains therefore, but that we give such honour to
our Teachers, as is due to the Ambassadours and Ministers of
the most high God, For although they be servants, yet are
they his servants, whom to serve is to raign; Look not
upon them as slaves, but as such servants, to whom honour,
reverence, and obedience is due, even by the command of God
1 <hi>Tim. 5. 57. Tit. 2. 15. Heb. 13. 17. 1 Cor.</hi> 16. 15, 16. The Apostle
<hi>Paul</hi> desires the <hi>Thessalonians, 1 Thes.</hi> 5. 12, 13. not onely to know,
but to acknowledg their Teachers, nay, to love them with a
high strain of affection, even to an Hyperbole, <hi>to esteem
them highly in love,</hi> which Translation yet comes short of the
expression, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Let us imitate the
<hi>Galatians,</hi> whose very eyes were not so dear in their heads, as
the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was in their eyes, <hi>Gal</hi> 4. 15.</p>
            <p>But here a double <hi>Caution</hi> is needfull. 1. Let us take
heed lest these Encomiums and commendations of the Ministry
lay in us the grounds of pride, lest we be puffed up with the
dignity of our Office. And to this purpose 'twill not be
amiss to consider, that the operation and efficacy of our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
is not from our selves, but from God, <hi>Act. 3. 12, 13.
3 Cor.</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7. We are onely Ministers, not Lords of mens
faith, but <hi>Ministers by whom they believe;</hi> Our planting and
watering avail nothing unless God give<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> encrease. The
Preacher beats the ears, but God alone breaks the heart; The
Preacher teacheth, but God gives knowledg; the Preacher
perswades, but God inclines; <hi>Iohn</hi> baptiseth with water, but
Christ onely <hi>with the Holy Ghost, and with fire,</hi> Matth. 3. 11. 2.
Let us take need of dishonouring this honourable calling by
unsuiteable lives, lives led in drunkenness, idleness, ignorance,
profaneness, heresie, pride, covetousness, uncleanness, sports
and pastimes; let us take need of being unsavory salt, of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44913:33"/>
speaking silken words, and things to please mens fancies;
and so proving rather honey then salt to the sinners, as
they were <hi>Ezech.</hi> 13. 10, 11. They that are such, teach
others the things which themselves contemn; They
that reprove others, had themselves need to be irrepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable;
For,
<q>
                  <l>VVho can abide the traitrous <hi>Gracchi,</hi> when</l>
                  <l>They make complaints against seditious men?</l>
                  <l>Shall <hi>Clodius</hi> condemn Adulterie;</l>
                  <l>Or <hi>Catiline Cethegus,</hi> worse then hee?</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly he must needs strike faintly upon the Consciences
of sinners, who has his own Conscience polluted with gross
sinnes; and how shall he inveigh against the vices of others,
who fears shame for his own? <hi>How shall be teach well that lives
ill;</hi> or season others, who is himself altogether unsavoury?
How can the covetous Minister press his people to heavenly
mindedness; or, with what face can the drunken Doctor
commend to another a sober course of life? Or, if he do, 'tis
seldome with good success; A wicked man may indeed preach
against wickedness, but will hardly preach it down, except
he preach <hi>in deed;</hi> He that attempts to take a mote out of
his brothers eyes, must either cast the beam out of his own
first, or else he will certainly be entertained with the Proverb,
<hi>Physician heal thy self.</hi> He is a Pharisaicall Teacher that saies,
and does nothing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 3. such take away all authority from
their Preachings, plucking down with their life what they
build with their language; For, who will obey, when the
Preachers teach disobedience? Of all creatures upon earth
degenerate men are the worst; of all men, wicked Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
and of all Christians, wicked Ministers; They are the
shame of the Clergy, the worst of Varlets, <hi>not Pastors but
impostors, not Doctors but Seducers, not Dispensers but Dispersers,</hi>
the increment and Instruments of Sathan, and the very
picture of that wicked one; they are like the Statue of <hi>Mercury,</hi>
that shew others the way, which themselves walk not; like
<hi>bells</hi> that call men to hear the word and will of God, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
want ears; like <hi>spunges,</hi> that cleanse other things, but
remain unclean themselves; like a musicall Instrument, that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44913:34"/>
creates delight to others, but it self is sensless of any; or like
the Shipwrights that made an Ark to save <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family
in, but themselves were drowned. <hi>No wonder</hi> (saies a learned
Authour) <hi>if that polity be made a prey, and brought to naught,
whose VVatchmen are blinde,</hi>

of the Church, the corruption of manners, a sink of sinne,

of Faith, the debasement of Religion, the poyson
of pestilent Schisms, the contempt of the Ministry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all
Ecclesiasticall Orders, and Ordinances. Hence it is that the
people are so wicked, for how should there choose but be
whoredome in <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and defilement in <hi>Israel,</hi> when
the Priests commit lewdness, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 9, 10. The actions of
publick persons are influentiall; and this gave occasion to
that witty conjecture of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, who guest at the
state of a City, or Commonwealth, by three things, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
their <hi>Pastor,</hi> their <hi>Pedagogue,</hi> their <hi>Pretor:</hi> The Church
depends upon the Pastor, the School upon the Master, the
Court upon the Pretor, who are the salt of their respective
places; Such therefore as is the Preacher, is the Church; as is
the Pedagogue, so are the children; as is the Pretor, so are the
citizens. Good reason therefore why God requires ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
in those especially, that come thus nigh unto him,
<hi>Lev.</hi> 10. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Neither does it mitigate to say, that these Ministers are
learned, but rather aggravate. Learning dwells ill in an evill
man: it is like wine in a poysoned cup, or a sword in a mad
mans hand. Dexterity of wit, the liberall Arts, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Tongues, and humane Learning are indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
gifts from God; but they are all miserably prophaned
in such a man. A Religious dunce is better then he: And
it comes to pass by the just Iudgment of God, that the devill
works more powerfully in none, then in wicked and Apostate
Ministers; insomuch that they are called Devills, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 70,
71. the worst name in the world: Such do not onely invite,
but even compell, by their example: The examples of Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
are cogent, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 14. Christ therefore threatens these
unsavoury <hi>salts</hi> with sad Iudgment, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 34. 35. which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44913:34"/>
judgment that we may the better understand, let us consider it
in these following particulars.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Vnsavoury salt</hi> hath this inconvenience, that <hi>its lost nature
cannot be repayred.</hi> There is no further salt wherewith this unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury
salt can be seasoned. The unhappinesse of it is therefore
very unhappy. The best things in their corruption become the
worst. The best nourishment becomes the worst excrement,
the best wine is corrupted into the sharpest vinegar. Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Ministers are hardly cured; for what remains with
which they may be restored and seasoned? If the people be
unsavory, God hath given Ministers to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eason them. But
if themselves be corrupt and unsavory, what cure shall
we find for them. These vines if they be fruitfull, are
the best trees in Gods garden, and the worst, if barren.
<hi>Ezech.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Unsavoury salt is unprofitable.</hi> It is not fit for the earth, for
it will not suffer it to be fruitfull, not for the dunghill, for it will
not suffer it to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ructify. So unprofitable are unsavoury Ministers,
who are therefore deposed from their Ministry, and discarded
by the Churches censure: other things in their corrupt state are
good for something, as degenerate wine generates vinegar, and
the excrement of nourishment, nourishes land. But infatuated
salt is so unprofitable, as that it is also hurtfull; so hurtfull as
that it makes the very dunghills themselves unprofitable. Such
vile, unprofitable hurtfull creatures are Apostate Ministers and
corrupt; to whom God therefore threatneth, <hi>rejection, deposition,
and contempt. Hos. 4. 6. Mall 2. 8, 9 Ezr.</hi> 2. 62.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Vnsavoury salt is troden under foot of men,</hi> which is the height
of ignominy and shame. So <hi>Ecebolius</hi> the apostate cryed out,
<hi>tread upon me unsavory salt.</hi> The just judgment of God causes
their Ministry to be contemned, whose lives are contaminated.

that which indeed they are ignorant of, nay, are ignorant of
their ignorance. In all other arts and sciences, men use first to
learn and after to teach. But in divinity we have many that
teach what they never learn'd, and become the Masters of
fools, before they have been the Schollars of wise men. And
hence it is that this waxen divinity of theirs receives any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,

and are heard without profit. They dream dreams, and then

            <p>This brood of vipers have come forth in a numerous multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
in this decrepit old age of the world, doting upon opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and under the pretext of piety, going about to overthrow,
Scriptures, Sacraments, universityes, all order and ordinances,
to confound heaven and hell, with more than a Gigantick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
and whorish impudence. Let the heavens tremble,
and the earth be amazed, and both be ashamed, that this our
Brittain should bring forth, and bring up such monsters. Are
these the returns of so many incomes from above? Are these the
fruits of so much patience and love? Do we thus require the
Lord, a people foolish and unwise? There hath been a famous
Church, and a renowned Ministry in these parts of the world.
Nay, and there is still a Church and a Ministry, although it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be clouded, or rather can not appear, because it is
clouded. But let us lift up our hearts, and eyes to Christ Iesus,
whose Ministry it is, for although it be clouded, yet he will

the purpose. They that are sensible of the weightinesse of the

they will abide thrusting, <hi>Mat. 9. 37. Moses</hi> undertook the

it be evident that many doe preach that are not sent, yet
by what right, by what authority, with what good conscience
can they preach, except they be sent? No one can undertake
and exercise the publick employment of the Ministry, except

New Testament times, who diligently expected and observed
a mission or call to this sacred employment. No man of them

If God need thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he will call thee; if he call thee not, thy knowledge will

whom he never called to labour; For although they may preach things in
themselves wholsome; yet they do not heal, things in themselves profitable,
yet they do not profit the people. But on the contrary, great hath been the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of those that have gone at God's sending, and preacht at Gods bidding.</hi>

            <p>Away with the unfixed <hi>Anabaptists then,</hi> who determine any
self-ordeiner of what condition and calling soever, to the pulpit
promiscuously without any proofe of a lawfull call; and by this
means have brought in a kind of barbarous disorder, and baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish
confusion into the Church of Christ: which confusion God
abhorrs, as appears by his reiterated complaints. <hi>Ier.</hi> 14. 14.
and 23. 21, 32. and 27. 15. Christ reproves the Angell of

            <p>4. Inference follows. <hi>If there be a Ministry, then there must be
Schools of learning, and Universityes.</hi> If the end be allowed, the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44913:36"/>
means conducing to that end must not be denied. It is now
necessary, that they, that are intended for the sacred Ministry,
be instructed and principled in the Schools, those Nurseries for
the Church: As an Orchard, though it be excellently prun'd,
manur'd, and managed, and set with the choicest and fruitfullest
trees in the world, wil decay, and at length come to nothing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
there be a Nursery of young plants, which may be placed
and succeed, in the roome of the barren and dead trees: So the
sacred Ministry cannot long endure sale and firme, except there
be some formed, educated, instructed in the Schools; and
fitted to succeed in the employment; For Ministeriall gifts are
not now adayes inspired into men immediately and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously,
but mediately gotten by reading, meditation, study,
and diligent pains, as appeares 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 13, 15. Hence it hath
been the care of pious Princes, to found, endow, and maintain
Schools and Universities, in which young Students might be
seasoned with, and educated in piety and good Learning,
who might afterwards be Champions to defend the truth, and
put to flight Errours and Heresies. And therefore let it be the
care of all who have power in their hands, strongly to defend,
and diligently to preserve the Revenues, and Priviledges of
Schools and Universities, that the glory of our Church may
not fade, but be still more and more glorious,: unless you
will be worse than the uncircumcised <hi>Philistines,</hi> who
are observed to have spared the Colledge of the Prophets,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 10. 5.</p>
            <p>Away then with <hi>Familists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Anabaptists, VVeigelians,</hi> &amp;c. who
rail against Learning, and Learned men at this rate. <hi>They are
unsit for the Ministry who are trained in Schools, and taught of men;
There is no knowledge of Christ in Universities, They are the Nurseries
of wickedness, the Plagues of the Common-wealth.</hi> Oh the
<hi>Aegyptian</hi> darkness that hath overspread the mindes of men! Oh
Impudence, like that of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the second! who condemned
them all for Hereticks, not onely that were Students, but
(whose hatred of Learning was so deadly) tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>he pronounced
all them Hereticks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that either in earnest or in jest should name an
University;</hi> who therefore commanded the <hi>Romans</hi> not to
suffer their children to converse in Books, or to study for
Learning, saying, it were enough, if they could write and
read. These men are not more like this <hi>Paul</hi> the Pope, than
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44913:37"/>
he was unlike to <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle, who himself was brought
up at the feet of learned <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and commends Reading,
Study, and Meditation to his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> as you saw
before.</p>
            <p>But if there be found the seeds of sinne in these Seminaries,
let them be purged, and not spoyled; refined, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed;
made better, and not unmade. Let corruption be
drained; abuses be taken away, and the use of them
remain.</p>
            <p>5. It appears hence, that that is a sound and savoury Ministry
which bites and pie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ceth the consciences of the hearers. The

               </gap>ing
and sharp nature. Nothing torments a sinner like the free and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>incere Preaching of the Word, Hence it comes to pass, that the
sincere and savoury Preachers do purchase to themselves all
contempt, reproach and hatred; which gave occasion to <hi>Luther</hi>
(who knew well enough what salt preaching was) to define
preaching thus, <hi>It is a deriving of the hatred of the whole world
upon ones self.</hi> Hence it was, that the world hated and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
Christ and his Disciples, because they testified of it, that
the works, thereof were evill, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 7. and 15. 19. The
Gospell, because of its sharpness, has alwayes been the scorn
and derision of the stinking world, requiring the Mortification
of the flesh, self-deniall, and other things unpleasant to corrupt
nature. And although these sharp Corrosives, these bitter
Pills do heal and purge, yet such is the tenderness and softness
of the most, that they had rather rot in their sinnes, than to be
sharply reproved, although that be for salvation. But this is
an infallible Argument of a wicked man, and a heart full of
putrifying fores, not to be able to abide the salt of sound Reproof,
witness <hi>Ahab, 1 Kings 18. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Acts</hi> 24. 25. No wonder then if they have filthy hearts, and
stinking lives, who studiously put away from them this salt,
withdraw themselves from this Ministry.</p>
            <p>As for us, Brethren in the ministry, let us not faint, but go
on with chear and courage, thanking God that we are worthy
to be hated of the world, for it is a good proof of our sincerity
to be so entreated. And if this be to be vile, to season the
corrupt world with the savoury Word of God, Oh that we
might be yet more vile! let us love study, preach sound doctrin,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44913:37"/>
which although it be sharp, yet its savoury, although it wound
the conscience, yet it will heal, although it be bitter in the mouth
yet in the Conclusion will prove sweeter than the honey and
the honey-comb. Although the Ploughshare of the Gospell
touch upon our very soules, yet let it be welcome, if by this
means our spirituall weeds and thistles may be rooted out.

            <p>A fourth corollary may be this. Let us then study to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
mutuall <hi>peace and concord amongst our selves.</hi> God hath
joyned <hi>salt</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> together, <hi>Mark 9. 50. Have salt in your

               </gap> asunder. Because salt by its acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
biteth, therefore our Saviour presently advises so wisely
to temper it, that peace may be preserved inviolable. The love
of our brother must correct the salt of correction, and the salt of
justice must season the love of our brother. And so shall we be
insuperable, by being inseparable, and shall gain many to Christ:
As lighted torches, if they be separated cause a smoake, but if
they be united do encrease the flame. All wisdome is folly and
madnesse except it be seasoned with peace and charity. As
sacrifices must be without honey, so neither doth any service
or sacrifice please God that issues from an heart stuffed with
anger, envy, animosity, and bitternesse. Let us not forget that
there are many <hi>Canaanites</hi> and <hi>Perizzites</hi> in the land that are
offended at our differences, and from them seek occasion to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
and devoure us. Let us by mutuall and universall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
therefore grow into one body, into one soule, thinking
with our selves what an incongruous thing it is, that the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of peace should fall into mutuall jarrs; and how unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
it is at this time, when (the adversary is laying snares for
us) our strength had more need be united by peace, than broken
and enfeebled by divisions. There is a fitter object of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

too much, who promises himself a standing, in the downfall

he, Let me below even in the dust, rather than exalted in a tryumphant
Chariot by a Cadmean conquest. Let others affect the great title of</hi> Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomaeus.
<hi>I am more pleased with the pleasant name of</hi> Irenaeus. This
peaceable frame concerns all, but more especially the Ministers
of Christ, who are sent to preach to, and to pray, for, not to prey
upon others, to build up the Church of Christ, not to demolish
it, to worke and not to wrangle. The harmony and joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the builders promotes the building, <hi>Neh. 4. 76. Solomons,</hi>
temple was built without noyse, 1 <hi>King,</hi> 6, 7. which by a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
type doth shadow out the peaceableness of the builders and
quietness of Christ's Church, in which the noyse of contentions
&amp; schismes ought not to be heard. The builders of the Church of
Christ should not be divided as <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s servants were, halfe
to the worke and halfe to the warre, neither must these spirituall
builders have swords girded upon their sides when they build
as his builders had, <hi>Neh.</hi> 4. 18. If we will revenge our selves
upon the bitternesse and malice of base spirits, the best way of
revenging is by forgetting, and the onely way to vex them is to
be more zealous and servent in the study, practise and pursuit
of opposed Godlinesse: If we will contend with their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings
and malice, let it be by faith and patience and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of spirit, as knowing it better to neglect them than to stand
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44913:40"/>
to confute them, to pass them by in silence than to take notice of
them.</p>

What an ingratitude, what a sacriledge is it, that the true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters

               </gap>ion. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> that
Father of the Priests, did not only give a good part of his own
substance to them, but commanded the people to maintain the
Priests and <hi>Levites;</hi> that being freed from secular cares, they
might wholly give themselves to the Law of the Lord, and
lay out themselves in their sacred function, in the service of the
Temple, 2 <hi>Chron 31, 4, 12. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was not the least (was it not the greatest) of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s
Commendations, that he loved and honoured Learning and
larned men; which made his times be so fruitfull of great wits,
and witty Inventions. He so well know how to esteem Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and to treat the learned, that it afterwards, became a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
<hi>If thou hadst lived in</hi> Alexander's <hi>times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would have given
thee a Cyprus or a Phoenice for every Verse.</hi> For as a good refined
disposition of the ayr begets plenty of fruits, so the benign and
ingenious disposition and constitution of Kings and Powers
produces a great encrease of Arts and Ingenuities. But on the
contrary, the envy, ignorance and baseness of Princes blasts the
fruit, and makes the birth of the brain abortive. Therefore, we
have <hi>Nehemiah</hi> contending even with the Rulers, because they

            <p>1. Then let all Christian Magistrates take care that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Church (who are ignorant of manual employments)
be not driven to wrestle with want and hunger, and by this
meanes be turned aside from the diligent execution of their

Art, whereby to provide sufficient supplies or maintenance for
themselves and theirs, who must either therefore live upon
their people, or dye amongst them for want of a livelyhood.</p>
            <p>2. Let them take heed they do not diminish, or suffer to be
diminisht, or withheld the gifts given to God by pious Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.
For God is the revenger of all such, who will send up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the unthankfull world a famine of his Word, for the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of his Messengers, but rather let them imitate <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
the <hi>Great,</hi> who took care that the Clergy should receive
liberall and honourable stipends, and confirm'd it by a Law,
<hi>Euseb, de vita Constant, lib. 2. cap. 21. 36, 39. Sozomen, Hist, Eccl.
l. 2. cap. 8. l. 2. cap.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>3. Let them take heed lest the <hi>Levellers</hi> do also levell the
<hi>weal publike,</hi> and convert it into <hi>private-wealth;</hi> for after the
contempt of <hi>Moses,</hi> follows the insurrection of the people,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 26. Nay for this, amongst other causes, do these men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry
Ministers, because they are the pillars of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy.</p>
            <p>But that I may handle these things the more exactly, I will
discuss this position.</p>
            <p>There are certain and fixed stipends due to the Ministers of Gods
VVord, by a divine right, from their people, that they may be freed from
the secular cares and wordly incumbrances, and give up their whole
selves to the work of the Ministry.</p>
            <p>All the Churches of God are Patrons of this Truth, the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents
and Adversaries are the <hi>Anabaptistical party,</hi> and other
sectaries.</p>
            <p>But that the thing may be the rather clear and evident, I
will 1. Confirm the position by the Testimony of the sacred
Scripture. 2. I vince the same by Arguments. 3. Briefly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the wranglings, and break the Forces of the Truths Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries.</p>
            <p>1. The Truth is confirmed by the mouth of Truth it self, even
Christ Iesus, whose words are express for it, <hi>Mat. 10. 10 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

10. 11. The Labourer</hi> (speaking unto them that were to <hi>labour in
the word) is worthy of his hire.</hi> Christs Ministers shall not want
maintenance, for the promise leans upon the justice of God,
which will not deceive them. A true paraphrase of the word is
this, that the people ought by right to maintain those that
preach the Gospel to them. They ought by right to do it,

which springs from poverty as its object, without obliging
the person upon whom it is bestowed to any work or duty:
(save onely that by the law of nature, the Alms-receiver is
bound to be thankfull to, and pray for the Alms-giver.) But
what is given to the Ministers of Christ, is not properly given
upon the account of their poverty, or is there be some respect
had to their poverty, yet not purely and onely upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
but for their works-sake; No one will say that he has
received an Alms, when he has received it with an obligation
to a piece of service, especially to a service that deserves much
more, to which <hi>Austin</hi> gives his suffrage: saying, It is
his <hi>Power,</hi> not his <hi>poverty,</hi> when a Minister of the Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
from his people: for, if we judge watchmen that watch
by night for us and our estates worthy of wages; what do the
watchmen of our souls then deserve? from what has been said,
I thus argue;</p>
            <p>Whatsoever things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

ought to be honestly payed, But maintenance and wages are
due to the Ministers of the Gospel. Therefore they are lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
demanded by the Ministers, and ought by right to be paid
by the people.</p>
            <p>2. That which is due to labourers by the Law of nature, is
to be payed. But a ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>idently
averre, that the labour of the mind far exceeds the
work of the hands. For, although the Ministers of the word
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44913:42"/>
do not work with their hand; yet if they diligently and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
discharge their office, give diligence in reading, watching
over, praying for, preaching to, admonishing, reproving and
comforting of their people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it will be but an idle and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
part to accuse any of them of idleness, Either let
their adversaries confess them to be Labourers, or at once, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
all Souldiers, Shepherds, Husbandmen of idleness; for
such are they, as was before made to appear.</p>
            <p>2. A second proof is easily fetch from <hi>Gal. 6. 6. Let him that
is taught in the word communicate unto him that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

in all good things.</hi> That is, (1.) freely and liberally, not cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tously
and repiningly. (2.) Not in some onely, but in all
temporall good things. For as the Teachers communicates to
the Learners their spirituall good things, the knowledge of
Christ, and all heavenly Treasure; so it is fit that the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
communicate unto their Teachers temporall good
things, all things ordained for the relief of the necessities of
an animall life, which things carry no proportion in them to
spirituall good things, although the blind world put a great
price upon them, and stick not to preferre them before spirituall
things. It is a sad complaint that <hi>Musculus</hi> takes up. <hi>Now that
there are no Tithes, no Revenues, no stipends constituted by our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
the people contribute to their Teachers so freely, that, whilst
themselves either by covetousnesse contract all things unto, or by luxury
consume all things upon themselves, the Minister of Christ has source
dry bread, with which to satisfie the hunger of himself or his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here men begin to flinch. one pretends that he has a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
to maintain, another that he has nothing to spare: Others
declaim against the Ministers: They are cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ous, greedy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable
men; if they were right Gospel-Ministers, they
should have nothing of their own, but should nakedly follow
a naked Christ.</p>
            <p>To all which the Apostle given a sharp answer, <hi>Gal. 6. 7. Be
not deceived, God is not m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this you have to deal with God) who cannot be, will not be,

who rule well, especially they who labour in the Word and

give unto them double honour, that is, honour them fully
and freely? maintain them cheerfully, pay them stipends readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

Hence it appears that the maintenance of Ministers ought to be
sufficient, honourable, certain.</p>

with irrefragable invincible Arguments; For the Apostle

to throw away whole Kingdomes, and Provinces upon the Ministers of

roundly.</p>
            <p>The Apostle proves, that he had right, and power to receive
maint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nance of the Church; to lead about a wife, who should
also be maintained at a publick Charge, that posterity might
know this to be lawfull, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6. and, to shew what a clear
right of his own he denied for the <hi>Corinthians</hi> sake, that by this
means he might win them to Christ, and promote their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
He confirms this,</p>
            <p>1. By an Argument drawn from three <hi>Similitudes,</hi> to wit,
From the right of Souldiers, of Husbandmen, and of
Shepherds. <hi>VVho goeth a warfare at his own charges?</hi> &amp;c, that is,
as it is right and fit that Souldiers should live upon their pay,
the Planter of a vineyard feed upon the fruit of his vines, and a
Shepherd upon the milk of his flock; so is it fit, that the
Ministers of the Gospel should live of the Gospell, of their own
vine, that is, the Church; of the milk of their own flock, that
is, of the goods of their own people. Let those Souldiers
that decry Tythes, and the settled stipends of Ministers, consider
their own case, and answer the great Apostles Argument, if
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44913:45"/>
they can, <hi>VVho will go to war at his own charges?</hi> The Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation
is a vehement Negation, No one will souldier it upon
such terms. For indeed, it is an unjust, and unreasonable thing,
that a Souldier should stand in jeopardy daily, fight for the
common safety against the common enemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and offer his very
life as a sacrifice for the lives of the commonalty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not be
maintained at a common charge. He receiveth therefore wages
from his General by a natural and civil right. And is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
or just, that the Ministers of Gods word should undergo
the care of the Churches, the great burden of the Ministry,
and yet live of their own? For their pains, and labours, and
sufferings, and dangers exceed those of the Souldiery. These
fight against flesh and blood, but they against the world, the
flesh, and the devil, 2 <hi>Cor. 10. 4. 1 Tim. 1. 18. 2 Tim.</hi> 2, 3. This
then is the Apostles Argument, Souldiers do not war at their
own charges, The Ministers of the Gospel are Souldiers,
Therefore ought not they to war at their own charges.</p>
            <p>2. The Apostle having put to flight the souldiers that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame
and rayle against the setled and honourable maintenance
of the Ministers of the Gospel, he comes to stop the murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
mouths of <hi>Husbandmen,</hi> sowers, plowers, threshers, shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
and men of that mold. Against these he argues thus:
They that plant and dress a Vine, it is fit that they should tast of
the grapes thereof, (as it is said) that <hi>Noah planted a Vineyard and
drank of the wine of it;</hi> and <hi>Prov. 27. 18. VVhose keepeth the fig tree
shall eat of the fruit thereof.</hi>) But the Ministers of Christ plant,
and dress Christs Vineyard, therefore it is fit that they should
live of the fruit thereof. So also it may be argued from <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards,</hi> feeding upon the milk of their flocks. As much as if the
Apostle had said, look but unto humane equity and common
customs of men, in things of farre lesser and lighter moment,
and conclude how just it is that the Ministers of the Gospel
should live of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>3. The Apostle sets upon these sacrilegious persons with
stronger Arguments, Arguments fetch'd from Divine Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
For, although the cause which he pleads be a most just cause,
yet he knew how subtil and crafty worldly wit is to reply,
especially in a money-matter; therefore, by a <hi>Prolepsis,</hi> he meets
an Objection, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. where he proves, that he doth not onely
confirm his Position by humane Arguments and Examples,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44913:45"/>
but by the Law of God also; <hi>Say I these as a man?</hi> Do
I fortifie my cause with humane reason and examples
onely? <hi>Or, saith not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aw the same also?</hi> Yes; Deut.
25. 4. <hi>Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox, when he treadeth
out the corne.</hi> He uses an Argument from the less to the greater.
If it were not lawfull to deny maintenance to an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
creature, much less to a man; if not to an Oxe treading,
then not to a Minister <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oyling. For Gods chief care in this Law
was not for oxen; he look'd at a further end, even at us, who
are typical oxen, toyling in the Lords field, treading in his
barnes: Therefore convenient maintenance must not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
us, lest we faint in the work.</p>
            <p>4. He argues from the less to the greater again; From the
example of <hi>Plowmen,</hi> and <hi>Threshers, ver.</hi> 10. If the Plower
ploweth, and the Thresher thresheth in hope, to wit, of his
wages, and that he shall partake of his crop, and of his
threshing, then a Minister of the Gospell may exspect a Salary,
fruit of his labours, of which he and his may live comfortably.
But the Antecedent is true (saies the Apostle) therefore the
Consequent is true also.</p>
            <p>5. The Apostle argues <hi>vers.</hi> 11. from natural right, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutative
Justice, which commands to give like for like, much
more then, small things for great. Now, who doubts, but that
spiritual things do much excell carnall, heavenly things excell
earthly. eternal things excell fading, flitting, perishing, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory
vani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies? For, by how much the soul excells the body,
by so much does the Word, the food of this soul, outgoe corporal
maintenance, Oh ingratefull wret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to administer to him carnal things, who preaches unto him the
eternal Gospel, and is an instrument to convey unto him the
fruits of the same Gospel preacht, to wit, Faith, Regeneration.
and Life Eternal! Now these things (saith the Apostle)
we have sowed, therefore it is meet we should reap,
For,</p>
            <p>Whosoever do sow unto us spiritual good things, to them
we ought chearfully to administer of our temporalls, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15 27.</p>
            <p>But the Ministers of the Gospell sow spiritual things;</p>
            <p>Therefore ought we cheerfully to administer unto them of
our temporalls.</p>
            <p>6. The Apostle argues from Example, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. If the true
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44913:46"/>
Apostles receive maintenance of you, why should not I and
<hi>Barnabas,</hi> who have preached the Gospell to you as well as
they. 2. If the false Apostles and Seducers, who devour you,
receive things necessary, then, why may not we who propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the Gospel of Christ? If stipends be given to the bad,
why not much rather to the good?</p>
            <p>7. He argues <hi>verse.</hi> 13. from the Testimony of the Law, from
the Example of the <hi>Levites</hi> under the Old Testament; and from

God commanded that they should not forsake a <hi>Levite</hi> all his

to maintenance, protection, or encouragement; because they

            <p>The <hi>Consequent</hi> appears by the Apostles own words. <hi>Even

be taken away by Christ, yet a way of maintaining
the Worship of God in generall is not taken away; the way of
maintaining it being one and the same <hi>generically,</hi> though not
<hi>specifically,</hi> and both in quantity, proportion, sufficiency, and
certainty: Otherwise the Apostles Argument could not hold
water, who saies with an <hi>Emphasis <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, even so,</hi> since the
Ministers, of the Gospell do succeed the <hi>Levtical</hi> Priests and
Ministers, let them be maintained by some such like way;
let them that preach the Gospell, live of the Gospell, <hi>even so,</hi>
that is, <hi>so</hi> liberally, <hi>so</hi> plentifully, <hi>so</hi> certainly as the Leviticall
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44913:47"/>
Clergy lived under the Law. For so hath God, not man, nay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
God-man ordained, <hi>Even so hath the Lord ordained.</hi> The due
maintenance then of the Ministry is not man's device, but
Gods Decree; not a h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mane order, but a Divine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
which whosoever denies, resisteth the Ordinance
of God, and procureth condemnation to himself.</p>
            <p>2. Those Lawes concerning First-fruits, Tithes and Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
may be considered, either as to their <hi>substance,</hi> or as to
their <hi>circumstances;</hi> as to their Substance, they belong also
unto us; for the end of those Lawes was, that the people by
those Offerings should testifie their thankfulness to God, to the
advantage of the Church, the Ministry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the poor; to which
things even the Law of nature doth bind. And if our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
shall at this day enact Lawes for the maintenance of
Ministers, we ought to obey them carefully and cheerfully,
especially in those things which neither contradict the Moral
Law, nor the Law of Nature. It followes therefore that
as the Israelites were to communicate of their goods to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,
as unto them that administred their holy things, so ought
Christians at this day freely to communicate of their substance
to their Ministers: And the rather, because the Ministry of
the Gospell is more glorious, laborious, costly, than the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of the Law was. <hi>To say nothing (saies Bellarmine) of
the dignity of the Gospell-Ministry, which is farre greater than that
of</hi> Aaron'<hi>s Ministry, the Christian Clergie is exposed to greater pains
and cost than the Tribe of</hi> Levi <hi>was. It concerns now that Ministers
be learned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and consequently, that they spend much of their estates
upon their studies; who therefore ought, according to their condition,
to be maintained honestly and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his Ministers, and you shall finde God more liberall to

liberality.</p>
            <p>Again, That which takes away many occasions of sin is
very profitable and necessary; But a convenient, settled, and
and ratified Salary, cuts off many occasions of sin; Therefore
a certain and settled Salary is necessary. The <hi>Major</hi> is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
truth; The <hi>Minor</hi> may be proved in many particulars.
1. A certain and set<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>led Salary takes away temptations to
flattery; were a stated maintenance taken away from Ministers,
a sad temptation to make marchandize of souls would follow
upon it. Men will be inclinable to comply with those that
they hope to get any thing by. The Itinerary <hi>Levite,</hi> in <hi>Iudg.</hi>
17. who was fain to accept of what <hi>Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ah</hi> would give him
(which was but 25 s. a year) complyed with him in his Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as you may read, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. And so consequently the
Gospell would be preached with more boldness and freedom of
speech. For, who almost would be so bold, as to tax the vices, or
reprove the corrupt manners of those, from whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
dayly gratuities? But where there is a settled and
stated maintenance, there all sorts of men are freely and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
dealt withall. 2. By this means Ministers shall
not need to be condemned for taking or having more than they
will confess: which although no good men will deserve to be
condemned of, yet malignant and corrupt men are apt to
load them with such slanders. 3. Otherwise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
might ministers exspect from the wicked world, who
being reproved, would rather suffer them to sterve with
hunger, then relieve them. They would be bad at works of
arbitrary charity, who are so base at works of necessary
justice; and they who will not suffer Ministers to enjoy
their own maintenance quietly, will not easily give of their
own to maintain them. 4. By this means pride and arrogancy
is prevented, a sin very familiar to free Contributions; pride,
not conscience, would soon principle men to Liberality.
5. By this means Ministers shall be freed from secular cares,
and wordly encumbrances, and shall not be put to study for
meat and drink, when they should be studying the Law of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:44913:48"/>
6. We argue <hi>a damno,</hi> from the losse and danger which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
upon the contrary. That which is cursed by God, is to
be avoided; But the defrauding of his Ministers is accursed
of God, Therefore it is to be avoided. The <hi>major</hi> needs not
to be proved, the <hi>minor</hi> is proved sufficiently by the Testimony
of the Spirit of God, <hi>Mal. 3. 8, 9. VVill a man rob God? But ye
have robbed me in tithes and offerings. Therefore ye are cursed with a
curse.</hi> A man robs God, when he withholds from Gods
Ministers Tithes, and other things necessary for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
whereby it comes to pass, that they studying to avoid
poverty, are forced to desert Gods service in publick Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations.
<hi>Therefore ye are cursed with a curse;</hi> that is, with
Famine, poverty, and barrenness of the earth; For, <hi>It is a
snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy,</hi> Prov. 20. 25.
that is, it is a dangerous thing; for, a snare catcheth soon,
holdeth sure, and destroyeth suddenly. <hi>Austine, Serm. 219
de decimis</hi> speaks sharpely, <hi>Thou hast lost nine parts, because thou
wouldst not give the tenth; For this is the just proceeding of God that
thou, who wouldst not give a tenth part, shouldst thy self be reduced to
a tenth part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Crying sinnes are to be avoided; But the Scripture
reckons the defrauding of God's Ministers amongst crying
sinnes, <hi>Deut. 24. 14, 15. Ierem. 22. 13. Iames</hi> 5. 4. This cry is the
foulness and grievousness of the sinne, which can neither
be concealed nor excused, but beats Gods ears continually,
and provokes him to vengeance. School-men observe four
Crying sinnes in Scripture, which they comprehend in a
<hi>Distich,</hi> thus,
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>The voyee of</hi> Blood-shed, <hi>and of</hi> Sodomy,</l>
                  <l>Oppression, <hi>and</hi> Fraud, <hi>aloud do cry.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now if the defrauding the Reaper that reaps down our corn,
be so abominable a sinne to God; how much more abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
is the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rauding of his Ministers, who reap a crop
of soules for God himself?</p>
            <p>8. If we ought to maintain the Fathers of our flesh, from
whom (organically) we have our naturall being, and that
both by the Law of God, and of Nature; then much rather
our Spirituall Fathers, from whom (instrumentally) we have
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44913:48"/>
our well-being. 1. Maintenance is due to the Fathers of our
flesh from us, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 9, 10, 11. 2. Love, and that not onely
whilest they live, but to be exprest to them even when they
are dead, <hi>Gen. 25. 9. Gen.</hi> 50. 2. 3. Reverence, exprest by
mouth, heart, and hand, <hi>Exod. 20. 12. 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 4. 4. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,

1 <hi>Cor. 4. 15. Gal. 4. 19. Philem. ver. 19. 1 Thes.</hi> 5. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>9. They that give diligence to Reading, Exhortation, and
Doctrine, that minde these things, and give up themselves
wholly to them, and ought not to engage their heads or
hands in the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es of this world, must necessarily receive a
stated Maintenance of the Church; but such is the duty of
Gospell-ministers, <hi>Act. 6. 4. 1 Tim. 4. 13, 15, 16. 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 4.
Therefore had their types the Levites no part in the division of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> that they should not be engaged in Secul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r affairs,
and worldly business, but might be wholly for the Lord, and
for the Temple; but the Lord was their inheritance, that is, the
Tithes and offerings due to God, of which the Levites did live,
and were not sollicitous concerning any other way of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
which otherwise they would necessarily have been.</p>
            <p>10 If Idolaters &amp; Heathens have been even prodigal toward
<hi>Baals</hi> Priests and seducers, then it doth not become Christians to
be illiberal and covetous to the faithful Ministers of Christ. But
so prodigal have they been, witness <hi>Iezabel,</hi> who maintaind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
800. Priests of <hi>Baal</hi> at her owne costs and charges,
1. Kings 18. 19. whilest an hundred of the Lords Prophets were

prodigal were the Idolaters in the Prophet <hi>Isaiahs</hi> time, who <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished
silver out of the bags</hi> for their Idols, Isaiah 46. 6. It grieved
not <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to maintaine all the Egyptian Priests with his owne
bread. In a generall famine he was so farre from making mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of the Priests lands in the first place, that he continued to
them their inheritances, and gave them their diet severall
years besides. The Heathens thought not much to offer the
tenth of their spoyls to their Gods. And if the Papists with a
prodigal liberality be willng to spend allmost all upon their sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Priestlings, and greedy Iesuites, notorious deceivers; sure
then the faithfull Ministers of Christ may justly expect an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
maintenance from their people. <hi>Ahab</hi> the King of <hi>Iudah,</hi>
who sought to reduce the Priests of the Lord unto want, is

2 Those Tythes which were commanded under the old
Testament, are continued still under the new, as to their
spirituall and moral use; and that upon a threefold account.
1. Vpon the the account of piety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because they are given to
God and his Service. 2. Vpon the account of thankfullness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For Tythes are a Sacrifice of praise to God for his mercies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, and for the good things which he bestows on us,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 22. 3. Vpon the account of commutative <hi>justice,</hi>
for if we have sowed unto them our spirituall things, it is
no great matter if we reap their carnal things. Now then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
Tithes be not expresly and explicitly enjoyned in the
new Testament, yet we are as expresly engaged to piety,
thankfullnesse, and <hi>justice</hi> now as ever.</p>
            <p>3. Neither doth Christ in the new Testament expresly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish
the payment of Tythes, when the Pha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>isees boasted
of their care in paying even their smallest Tythes, he is so
farre from reproving them for it, that he commends and doth
countenance it, <hi>Luk. 11. 42. Mat. 23. 25. These ought ye
to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</hi> He gives no
commission to neglect the payment of Tythes. <hi>Ye ought not
to leave that undone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tythes therefore or fixed stipends are due to the Ministers
of the Gospel by a trebble right. First by a divine morall
right, not ceremoniall or judicial: For it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it and just that
a Minister, who feeds the peoples souls, should be fed by
the people, that he that preaches the Gospel, should live of
the Gospell. <hi>The old Law concerning the Sabboth and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tythes, at least shews thus much (saith</hi> Grotius de jure bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li
lib. 1. cap. 1.) <hi>that Christians are bound to set apart no less
than the seventh part of time, and to give no less than the tenth part
of their encrease to Gods Ministers.</hi> It shews at least thus much,
that however they be maintained, whether out of Lands,
Houses, Moneys, Tythes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet that they ought to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
honestly and liberally, not sordidly and sparingly.
<hi>Estius</hi> speaks clearly and learnedly. <hi>That which the Law of God
and Nature command in the generall, that doth the ecclesiasticall
Law determine specifically, whilst it app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inteth some certain stipend
to be given by the people to their Ministers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Tythes or the like.</hi>
Tythes therefore are not precisely commanded in or abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary under the new Testament, neither are they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44913:50"/>
unjust, where they are established by the Magistracy, whose duty
it is to take the most convenient way for maintaining the
Ministry, as may best consist with the edification of the
Church, and dignity of the sacred function. Secondly, They
are due by a naturall right. Even the very Heathens gave the
tenth part to their Gods, as the <hi>Grecians,</hi> the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
the <hi>Romans,</hi> &amp;c. who gave the Tythe of the spoyl to
<hi>Iupiter.</hi> And if the Tythe of such things, how much rather
the Tythes of more certain revenues. Thirdly, By the Law of
nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by the positive Law of our nation, Tythes were
given by <hi>Off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> the Saxon king in the year 793. afterwards
encreased and confirmed by <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> in the year 855. who
gave the tenth part of his owne revenues and of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to God: binding them with this prayer, <hi>VVhoever shall
adde to this our gift, let allmighty God adde to his life many pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
days, and if any one shall presume to change or diminish them,
let him know that he must give an account before the tribunal of
Christ.</hi> After him King <hi>Athelstone</hi> confirmed them in the year
930. In a word they have been confirmed, together with
<hi>magna charta,</hi> thirty times by Parliament.</p>
            <p>By all which it is plain, that the Preachers of the Gospel
have a better title to their tythes than any Nobleman, Knight,
or Gentleman to their proper Inheritances. For. 1. They
were given by our Ancestors to God and his service, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot be taken away without sacriledge; but the Estates
of Noblemen may be taken from them without sacriledge.
2. God hath commanded that a sufficient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> honourable, and
fixed maintenance be given to his Ministers, as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
proved. But such a special command hath he not given
concerning any other men. Therefore tythes and things which
are so God's, are twice God's. 1. By a divine right primarily.
2. By a humane right secundarily, as being dedicated to him
and his worship.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. But the people cry out and rayl, saying, Tythe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
are burdensome, they are <hi>Antichristian, Iewish &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. So do the people cry out of taxes, excize, customs
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they are burdens: therefore shall we say, Away with
taxes, customs, excise. All things are common amongst friends?</p>
            <p>2. It little matters what the many headed multitude say,
<hi>Seneca</hi> could say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44913:51"/>
people were the worst argument in the world: Neither
matters it how many they are, but how rational, how good.
<hi>The multitude of sinners doth not patronize a sinne</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. This is not the cry of the wisest, soundest and best of
the people, they do not declame against Tythes.</p>
            <p>4. Neither are Tythes Jewish: For first, before the Law
given by <hi>Moses,</hi> Abraham <hi>gave Tythes to</hi> Melchisedech <hi>of all
that he had,</hi> Gen. 14. 20. Heb. 7. 2. Iacob <hi>also vowed to
God the Tythe of all that he had,</hi> Gen, 28. 22. And secondly,
they are not payed to the Ministers of Christ by a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
right, but a moral right, and by a positive Law of the
Nation, as was proved before. See <hi>Repper. de. lege</hi> Mosis l.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>c.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>5. Neither are they Antichristian as many vain men object,
who whilst they are hearers, decry Tythes to save their money,
but turning preachers take Tythes, dispute for them and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for additions to be made to them. Tythes are not Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian,
that are by the Law of nature, by the moral Law,
by the positive Law of the nation, and not by any canonical
or pontifical Law. How can they be popish, which were
paid thousands of years before any such beast as a Pope did
spring up?</p>
            <p>6. If Tythes be unjust, burdensome, wicked things, then is
God the authour of injustice, oppression, wickedness (which
were blasphemy to conceive) for he gave the Tythes to his
Levites under the Law by a special command for their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence.
Neither doth the Gospel, as I said before, abrogate
or abolish Tythes in general, but rather establish and confirm
them specifically, as may appear, <hi>Mat. 23. 23. Luk 11. 42.
Gal. 6. 6. 1 Cor. 9. 13, 14. Heb.</hi> 7. 1. 5, 6, 8. And if the wise
God thought this way the best to maintain his Ministers,
who shall reprove him?</p>
            <p>7. They are not burthensome impositions, because they
were freely given to the Church by pious and well affected
Princes, They are not the peoples burden, for they are none of
theirs; Neither they nor their pro parents ever purchased
them, and why should they repine to part with that which
is none of theirs.</p>
            <p>8. Let there be found out a more sufficient and certain and
honourable maintenance, and who will contend for Tythes?

               <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. They argue from Mic 3. 11. <hi>the Priests teach for hire,

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans</hi> It is one thing to receive hire, and another to be an
hireling; one thing to be hired to teach, another to teach
for hire. The true Prophets received a reward of their pains,
and that by Christs allowance, Mat. 10. 10. but the false
Prophets whom God here reproves, prophesied false things,
and that for hire onely, and preached pleasing things onely,
that they might have a more liberall reward. The Ministers
of the Gospel do receive Salaries, not as a reward of their
Ministry, but that they may provide the necessaries of life,
and may persist in their sacred function.</p>

               <hi>Ans.</hi> The Anabaptists are deceived in this late figment of
theirs. For Christ himself unties the knot, <hi>v. 10. The work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is worthy of his meat,</hi> and appr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>2. Christ here speaketh concerning working of miracles,
as appears <hi>v.</hi> 8. and he forbids his Apostles to sel their miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
cures for mony, because that gift was freely given them by
God, &amp; they ought therefore to use it freely. As <hi>Elisha</hi> refused the
reward offered him by <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrians 2 <hi>King</hi> 5. 15. 16.
These words (<hi>ye have freely received</hi>) doth not so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the work of preaching, as the working of miracles,
which is not so laborious as the other.</p>
            <p>3. This command of Christ to his Apostles was onely temp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,
a precept for the present time, not a moral commandment;
neither can it or ought to be made a perpetual Law. It one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
related to that first Embassy of theirs to the Iews, which,
was to be dispatched with all speed, and they were to avoid
whatever would retard them in their journey. This is plain
from our Saviours owne words, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 35. where speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this first mission of theirs, and the charge he gave them
then: He says; <hi>Before I sent you without purse,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but now he
that hath a purse, let him take it</hi> &amp;c. As much as to say, the
former precept that <hi>I</hi> gave you is valid, Now I give you a
new charge.</p>
            <p>4. It is plain that the Apostles afterwards lived of the Gospel
<hi>Acts 4. 5. chapt.</hi> The primitive Believers offered them all
their goods, they sold lands and goods for the Apostels use,
<q>Heu quantum distamus ab illis,</q>
but now we had rather take the Apostles lands and goods
for our owne use, or at least are so farre from selling all for
them, that we grudge miserably to give unto them a tenth
part.</p>
            <p>5. This precept, as to the substance of it doth still bind.
It engageth us to have hearts free from covetousness, to be
a pattern of holinesse, of the contempt of riches, and of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and heavenly minds.</p>

               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:44913:52"/>
Now our Saviour foreseeing that men would be ready to
give any thing for Health, forbids them to make a private gain
of the gift of healing, as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> thought to have made of
the Gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>

go about to take away from Christs Ministers that which
elsewhere he doth allow them. Now he allowes them a right to
be maintained of the Publick, in many places, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 14. Gal.

            <p>2. Suppose the Case be now as it was then, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> and
we will also allow the Apostle <hi>Pauls</hi> example to be binding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
1. If the Preacher be furnish'd with Extraordinary Gifts, that

               </gap>ion; so
could the Apostle. 2. If Ministers can live otherwise, and it be
necessary by reason of the Churches poverty; in such a cafe of
necessity the Minister ought to deny his right, that he prejudice
not the Gospel, and be a burden to the Church, 1 <hi>Thes</hi> 2. 9.

2. The Church enjoys, through the bounty of pious Princes,

Church in the Apostles time: and here we must decline our
own right. Moreover, the Apostles preach'd to Heathens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who
knew not the worth of the Gospell, nor the necessity of a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44913:53"/>
Ministry. 2. There is a Church constituted, adorned with
Magistrates, and Lawes, and endued with certain Revenues and
Immunities appointed by those Magistrates for the Ministers:
these Revenues are by Divine Right due to these Ministers:
therefore <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledged, that he did receive things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
of some Church, as form the Church at <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Phil. 4.

<hi>Corinth,</hi> nor <hi>Thessalonica.</hi> In a word, Stipends are different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to time and place; doubtless the richer Congregations
both may and ought to maintain their Pastors more liberally
than the poorer; neither is it equall, that the Stipends of all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
should be equal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because of their different Gifts, different
Labors, different Families, and different quality of their people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 6. Many Ministers are rich, and are single men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ought to preach freely, and live of their own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. That does not follow; For our Saviours Proposition
is universal, <hi>Luke 10. 14. The Labourer is worthy of his hire,</hi> that is,
Every Labourer, be he rich or poor, single or double, or what
else. <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> was a rich king<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet <hi>Abraham</hi> payes him
tythes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 20. Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the oxe
that treadeth out the corne, be he fat, or be he lean. Moreover, if
a rich Minister receive nothing of his people, he will expose his
poorer brethren to the envy and malice of their people: and
not onely so, but be a means to starve his Successour; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let him receive his due Stipend, and let him give to the
poor, and convert much to publick uses. Our Saviour Christ
could easily have maintained himself, and the family of his
Apostles, after a miraculous way; his Godhead could easily have
provided for his manhood, yet he received of those things
which were brought him, <hi>Luk</hi> 8. 3. to instruct us by his example.
The Lord hath not ordained, that they that preach the Gospel
should live of their own private Estates, that I know of; but he
has ordained, that they should live of the Gospel, 1 Cor 9 14.</p>
            <p>2. Would this be a good Argument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Many Souldiers are
rich, therefore let them fight freely, spend and be spent,
without expectation or acceptation of pay, and live of thier
own: The richer men grow, the less commonly they care for
fighting, (lest they should loss their rich lives) much less
would they fight for nothing; For <hi>VVho goeth,</hi> saith the Apostle,
<hi>to war, at his own charges.</hi>

The tongue indeed teacheth, but the life commendeth; for the
voice of the hand is more powerfull then that of the tongue,
and gives efficacy to it; whilest we speak Oracles, let us live

self first to be moved. He that is first himself perswaded, shall

lips, but let grace also give strength to Eloquence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us therefore imitate our Master, who was <hi>mighty in deed
and word, Luke</hi> 24. 19. who began first <hi>to do,</hi> and then <hi>to teach,
Act.</hi> 1. 1. Himself was first meek, and pure, and peaceable, and
then he began to teach, <hi>Blessed are the poor in heart, the pure in
heart, the peaceable, Matth. 5. As Iohn the Baptist</hi> was all voice, so
the all of a Minister ought to preach; his eating, drinking, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing,
entertaining, clothing, life and language should all
breathe out holiness; whatever he does or saies should instruct
his flock. <hi>Ezra</hi> the servant of the Lord was indeed <hi>a Scribe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
unto the kingdome of heaven,</hi> for he first <hi>prepared his heart
to seek the Law of the Lord, and to do it, and</hi> then <hi>to teach in Israel
statutes and judgements,</hi> Ezra 7. 10. Lo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the right way to attain
to an excellent faculty of teaching. 1. Prepare not the head
onely, but the heart also. 2. Seek with all care and diligence,
<hi>viz.</hi> by hearing, reading, learning, meditating, praying.
3. What must be sought; not Civil Lawes, not humane Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
not scholastical niceties, but s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

converse in this, meditate of it, peruse it day and night. He
that will be a good Preacher must labour to be a good Textuist;
for Scripture is the best Interpreter of Scripture. 4. For what
end? first, that we may do it, then that we may teach it. Let
us labour to be as Glasses, in which the representations of all
verture and grace may appear; yea, <hi>if</hi> we <hi>do and teach,</hi> we <hi>shall

5. 19. Such an one was holy <hi>Basil,</hi> whose words were thunder,

               </gap>, <hi>walk uprightly according to the truth

spiritual beauty, in whom, from the crown of the head to the

had any blemish upon them were forbidden the Priests Office,
under the Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 21. 17. &amp;c. how shall they, whose mouthes,
hearts, hands, are full of sin and filthiness, be admitted, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
under the Gospel? Wherefore let every Preacher teach
by words, and works, by life and Language. It is an easie
thing to speak, but a hard to performe; easie to teach in words,
but preaching with the life, is the life of Preaching; for, words
make not such an impression upon the soul, as works do; A
fighting Captain encourages his souldiers more then a prating
coward. The Apostle therefore will that Bishops be blameless,

truly be said to be unblameable, not who is never blamed, but
who is not blameworthy. Neither does the Apostle call for

            <p>2. Let a Pastor feed his people <hi>ministerialy,</hi> by voice and sound
Doctrine. The bare Reading of the Scriptures seldom conduces
much to Conversion, the word preached by an Applicatory

which aptitude denotes both a proneness and a fitness: he should

A sadder complaint could not be made, than what a pious and
learned man of this Nation makes, That this Church has lain

From us, my Brethren, from us, does our mother the Church

means, by secret perswasions, or hostile invasions. they may
