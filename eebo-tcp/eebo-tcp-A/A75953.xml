         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of humane things; but amongſt
thoſe, whoſe Notions have com to the
light of Poſteritie, few or none have
<hi>Aeſop</hi> parallel'd; who, as by divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
atteining the perfection of moral Knowledg,
may juſtly bee ſaid, therein, to have born awaie the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
from them All: who neither by intricate definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

ſo won the affections of the Hearers, that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to them a ſhame, that they indued with reaſon,
ſhould not wiſely act, and foreſee thoſe things that might
bee for their advantage or prejudice, as did the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and
<hi>Fowl</hi> hee figured. In which image of his Philoſophical
Common-wealth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeming rather to Philoſophize in
works, then in words. Hee was a Native of <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>

ſlave; but the ſubjection of his Bodie could not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
nor yet inthral his Minde. As little gratious in
his form had Nature likewiſe been to him, beeing of all
<pb facs="tcp:112365:5"/>
men of that Age the moſt deform'd: Sharp-headed,
flat-nos'd, pouch-mouth'd, ſhort-neck't, crook-back't,
tun-bellied, Baker-kneed, bow-leg'd, inverſt-footed,
all which were varniſh't with a hideous black, which
gave him the diſtinction of his name, <hi>Aeſop</hi> implying
<hi>Aethiop.</hi> To theſe a voice obſcure and inarticulate; ſo
that in him all Pieces did agree, as hee were predeſign'd
to ignomie. But though in Bodie thus irregular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his wit
was ſudden, and invention ſharp, yet becauſ not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable,
his Maſter him (as fit for no domeſtick uſe)
imploied onely to dig up the ſoil: to which with much
alacritie hee ſtill appli'd himſelf. The Steward to this
Lord (to ſhew himſelf carefull to his Maſter's truſt, and
the Soil gratefull to his Maſter's coſt) preſented unto
him the choiſeſt Figs the Seaſon had afforded, which to
the truſt of a domeſtick given, till hee diſpoſed were
thereof to eat: the Truſtee with his Fellows privately
contriv'd to eat the Fruit, and to charge <hi>Aeſop</hi> with the
theft thereof: who by theſe Mates accus'd, was judged
guiltie, and to Supplice brought: But <hi>Aeſop</hi> proſtrate at
his Maſter's feet, obteining a Repriev, a flaggon of
warm water brought before them all, wherof part drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
he to his Fellows the remainder gave, the warmnes

provoking them to vomit: from <hi>Aeſop</hi> onely the

ſtraight diſclos'd their guilt; who juſtly ſuffer'd what
they had prepared for the Innocent: while <hi>Aeſop</hi> with
Applauſ diſmiſt, returned to his work. On which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
two of <hi>Diana's</hi> Prieſts, by chance, had loſt their
waie, to him repaired for direction, to which (after
ſom ſmall refection given them) <hi>Aeſop</hi> became their
Guide: for whoſe benevolence, the gratefull Prieſts
addreſt their zealous Preirs to Heav'n, like Grace from
<pb facs="tcp:112365:5"/>
thence might bee enlarg'd to him. <hi>Aeſop</hi> return'd tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
had ſoon o'recom his ſenſ with ſleep, in which hee
dream't Fortune appear'd to him, looſing his fetter'd
tongue, and him inſpiring with this moral facultie;
from which hee waking, found the ſucceſs of what was
figured; thankfull to Heav'n, <hi>Aeſop,</hi> o'recom with joie,
himſelf addreſſing to his task again, eſpied the Steward
<hi>Zenas</hi> (for ſom ſlight fault) ſharply correcting one of
his Mates with blows: <hi>Aeſop</hi> reproaching him his daily
crueltie, threatned to make complaint unto his Lord.
The Steward much amaz'd to hear him ſpeak, and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
now hee might provoke his Maſter to diſpleaſure
againſt him: to fruſtrate which, hee againſt <hi>Aeſop</hi>
(with falſ ſuggeſtions) prepoſſeſt his Lord, which
credit winning, wrought ſo much diſlike, that <hi>Aeſop</hi>
was ſurrendred ſolie to his hands, him to diſpoſe of, as
beſt liked him: whereon a paſſing Merchant requiring
of him what hee had to ſell; <hi>Zenas</hi> preſented <hi>Aeſop;</hi> the
Merchant much incenſt, as hee had mocked him, in
contemt of the proffer turn'd ſuddenly awaie: accoſting
whom, <hi>Aeſop</hi> deſir'd him to accept the ſale, hee might
bee uſefull to him; in that, perhaps hee might at home
have ſom unhappie Boies, o're whom if hee might but
preſide to keep them in aw, hee ſhould to them as an
Hobgoblin bee. The Merchant pleas'd with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
tender'd his Price, and mongſt his new Mates,
bid him chooſ his Pack: <hi>Aeſop</hi> heeron took a great
Basket, which was fil'd with bread for their Proviſion,
whereat his Fellows much derided him, in that hee had
the greateſt, might have took the leaſt: but ere they
travel'd far, few meals had <hi>Aeſop's</hi> carriage made ſo
light, they envied him his burden. The Merchant
with his Troop to <hi>Sames</hi> com, expoſed <hi>Aeſop</hi> and his
Mates to ſale: whom <hi>Xanthus</hi> a Philoſopher abourding
<pb facs="tcp:112365:6"/>
(neglecting <hi>Aeſop)</hi> ſtrictly examin'd of their Faculties,
they made replie, That they could all things do; at
which <hi>Aeſop</hi> laughed ſcornfully: which <hi>Xanthus</hi> ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
obſerving, they deſir'd him, hee would <hi>Aeſop</hi> prove;
to whom addreſt <hi>Xanthus</hi> ask't, What hee was? <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop</hi>
ſaid, Black: <hi>Xanthus</hi> ſaid, hee miſtook, hee ask't,
Whence hee was born? <hi>Aeſop</hi> replied, from his mothers
womb. <hi>Xanthus</hi> ſaid hee yet not apprehended him, hee
asked him. In what Place hee was born? <hi>Aeſop</hi> repli'd,
His Mother ne're told him, whither it were above ſtairs
or below. <hi>Xanthus</hi> ask't, What hee could do? <hi>Aeſop</hi>
ſaid, Nothing; his fellows All but lately had ingroſt,
and nothing left to him. <hi>Xanthus</hi> ask't him if hee bought
him, if hee'd not run awaie? <hi>Aeſop</hi> repli'd, if ſuch his
purpoſe were, hee'd of his Counſel not his Maſter make.
<hi>Xanthus</hi> objected, that he was deform'd; <hi>Aeſop</hi> replied A
Philoſopher ought to make the Minde &amp; not the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
the Object of his choice. The Scholars much deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with his wit, tender'd his Price; &amp; gave him to their
Maſter for their uſe. The ſtanders by o'rehearing of the
Price, much wondering at the meanneſs of the ſame,
ask't, who it was that bought him; who him ſold. But
(aſham'd of his value) neither would declare themſelvs:
Whereon <hi>Aeſop</hi> ſaid, Hee was the Partie ſold; <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>
the Chapman; The Merchant made the ſale; if
neither this avouch't, then hee was free; <hi>Aeſop</hi> brought
home, no pleaſing object was to <hi>Xanthus</hi> wife: But
<hi>Aeſop</hi> ſhewing her the prejudice a handſom ſlave might
bee unto her Fame, reſtrain'd the violence of her Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
which better yet to pacifie, <hi>Xanthus</hi> to a Publike
Garden went, to buie for her a Preſent of the choiſeſt
Fruits, with him <hi>Aeſop</hi> taking to conveie them home.
Arrived there, the fruit beeing gather'd and delivered;

prai'd him to accept of them, hee onely did deſire of him
ſolution to one doubt, which was, Why thoſe Herbs
planted by his hand, though water'd and manured dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
yet ſlowly took increaſ: but what ſprung from
the Earth of their accord, although neglected, ſooner
germinate? <hi>Xanthus</hi> (not knowing what elſ well to ſaie)
replied, this, as other things was in the Government of
Divine Providence: at which <hi>Aeſop</hi> laughing; <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>
incenſt, ask't, if in it, hee had derided him? <hi>Aeſop</hi>
replied; not him, but who him taught: For what
was by Divine Providence don, by wiſe men onely
ſhould bee ſcrutable: deſiring that the reſolution might
bee left to him; which granted, <hi>Aeſop</hi> thus anſwered
it; A Woman having children by the firſt, became the
Wife unto a ſecond Husband, who children alſo by a
former had: unto the children ſhee brought forth, the
Wife a moſt indulgent Mother was; but unto thoſe of
which ſhee found her Husband prepoſſeſt, a churliſh
ſtepdame, whoſe rights ſhee often them abridg'd, to
cheriſh more her own: So the Earth, to thoſe that were
her proper Iſſue, as Legitimate, plentifully adminiſtred:
But unto thoſe that planted were by Art, as Baſtards,
ſcarce afforded Nouriſhment. The Gardner with the
Anſwer ſatisfied; bad <hi>Aeſop</hi> fetch fruit <hi>gratis</hi> when hee
would. When home return'd: <hi>Xanthus</hi> bad <hi>Aeſop</hi>
(among other things) prepare a pair of Hog's feet for
his Supper, which on the fire ſet; <hi>Xanthus,</hi> occaſion
ſeeking to correct his Slave, as hee was buſied on ſom
other thing, took privately out of the Pot a foot; which
<hi>Aeſop</hi> not long after miſſing (foreſaw ſom ſnare was
laid to intrap him) ran forthwith to a Stall at hand,
and from a Hog, lately ſhut up to fat, chopt off a foot,
dreſt it, and caſt it to the reſt i'th Pot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Xanthus</hi> (in
the Interim) doubting, when <hi>Aeſop</hi> ſhould miſs the

foot hee took for fear of Puniſhment would run away,
went ſecretly, and caſt it in again: when they were
boil'd, as <hi>Aeſop</hi> pour'd them forth. <hi>Xanthus</hi> diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
five feet in the diſh, ask't, How that came to paſs?
<hi>Aeſop</hi> abaſh't, required, How manie feet two Hogs
ſhould have? <hi>Xanthus</hi> ſaid, eight; <hi>Aeſop</hi> replied, the
number then was right; five in the diſh, and the other
three the fat Hog had, was inclos'd in the Stall. <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>
incenſed; <hi>Aeſop</hi> deſir'd his Patience, ſaying, Hee
well knew, that from addition and reduction in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
could happen no error in the whole ſum. Next
daie a ſolemn feaſt was held by <hi>Xanthus</hi> Scholars,
where hee collecting of the choiſeſt meats, to <hi>Aeſop</hi>
them delivered, with a charge, hee ſhould to them
preſent it, lov'd him beſt: hee on his Miſtreſs thinking
to bee reveng'd: came home, and in her hearing, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
his late charge, <hi>Licaena</hi> cal'd, a little Cur his
Maſter of en plaid with in his lap, and gave to him the
meat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Miſtreſs heeron high in rage and grief, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
unto her Chamber, there with manie tears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing
this affront, as ſuppos'd from her Husband.
<hi>Aeſop</hi> return'd; a great diſpute aroſe amongſt the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophes,
<hi>When the greateſt diſturbance ſhould befall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</hi>
The Queſtion not at Table ſatisfied, <hi>Aeſop</hi> had
leav to ſpeak, who ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This happen would in the laſt
Reſurrection of the dead, when each one ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
what once they had poſſeſt. <hi>Aeſop's</hi> facetious
wit heeron all much approved, and by them ſtrait ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was propounded: <hi>Why Sheep led to the ſlaughter,
as Swine no clamours vent:</hi> The Queſtion at a ſtand;
<hi>Aeſop</hi> repli'd; Sheep uſually were handled to bee milkt,
and of the burden of their Fleece to bee deveſted; in
which took from their feet, no ill ſuſpected from the
ſight of iron: but Swine that neither milked were nor
<pb facs="tcp:112365:7"/>
ſhorn, well knew for theſe reſpects not to bee drawn,
but for their fleſh, which onely was of uſe; therefore
juſt reaſon for their out-crie had. <hi>Aeſop's</hi> conceit
much laughter moved till the Feaſt broke up. <hi>Xanthus</hi>
returned Home, his Wife reproach't him her indignitie,
as judging it from him; who much amaz'd, cal'd <hi>Aeſop</hi>
to enlighten the diſorder; <hi>Aeſop</hi> ſaid, hee perform'd
but his commands in giving this his Preſent to the Dog;
as to them lov'd him beſt: for though his Miſtreſs
ſeem'd benevolent, yet when reprov'd, ſhee would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
again, the Dog though threat and beat, return'd
with new endearments to his Maſter's Lap. But all
this in his wives opinion could not <hi>Xanthus</hi> clear, who
to her Parents ſtrait in this diſtaſte repair'd; to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
of her anxious Husband; whom <hi>Aeſop</hi> fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
much perplext, to pacifie this trouble, by his act
procur'd; practis'd this ſlight, to fetch her home again.
With a great Basket hee to Market went, which hee
well ſtored with the choiſeſt Fowl, then near the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
where his Miſtreſs was, enquired for ſuch rarities,
might grace a Nuptial Feaſt. Which beeing by one of
the Domeſticks over-heard, hee buſily curious, unto
<hi>Aeſop</hi> came, to know for whom this Preparation was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Aeſop</hi> (faining him not to know) repli'd; for <hi>Xanthus</hi>
the Philoſopher, who on the morrow ſhould a fair Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
wed. The Servant home returning with this haſtie
news, fil'd <hi>Xanthus</hi> wife with rage and jealouſie, who
ſtrait flew home to fruſtrate this deſign, where joifully
received, with the Proviſion, feaſting, ſhee was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd.
And to congratulate this new Union, <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>
next daie his Scholars made his Gueſts; comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Aeſop</hi> for the entertainment buie the beſt of things.
<hi>Aeſop</hi> (whoſe aim ſtill was to mock his Maſter's learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
thought, hee would puniſh him for this his unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
<pb facs="tcp:112365:8"/>
Commiſſion to Market went, where buying
nought but tongues, home hee return'd and dreſt them
ſundrie waies. The Gueſt arriv'd; firſt boil'd tongues
hee ſent in, whereat they all commended <hi>Aeſop's</hi> inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitie
that to Philoſophers for the firſt Meſs thus had
ſerved Tongues, the Miniſters of knowledg. For the
next ſervice, roſted Tongues was ſet, for the next bak't;
So that in Sum they nothing had but Tongues; at which
the Gueſts were much abaſh't, and <hi>Xanthus</hi> much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſt;
who <hi>Aeſop</hi> calling rebuked with much furie:
<hi>Aeſop</hi> returned thanks to him; in that hee favour'd him
with that advantage in this his reproof, to cal him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for this his default, in the preſence of Philoſophers,
who had capacitie to judg the Nature of his Crime, if
ſuch there anie were, then turning to his Maſter, ſaid,
He bad him buie of all things the moſt excellent; Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
then to the Aſſemblie, ask't, <hi>What there could bee
more excellent then Tongues;</hi> by them all knowledg was
communicated. Cities erected, Laws eſtabliſht, Nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
celebrated, Men protected, Friendſhip confirm'd; in
brief the Commerce of man's whole life conſiſted onely
in the uſe thereof: At which all ſmiling approv'd what
<hi>Aeſop</hi> ſaid; <hi>Xanthus</hi> himſelf (on <hi>Aeſop's</hi> fault) excuſing
to his Gueſts; ſaid, they ſhould ſup with him; and
to the end they ſhould no farther bee abuſed in their
Entertainment, they ſhould bee witneſs to the
charge hee gave; then calling <hi>Aeſop,</hi> with purpoſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap
him, bad him for their Supper buie the worſt of
things: Which <hi>Aeſop</hi> did; and for their Supper nothing
ſerv'd but Tongues again. Summon'd heeron to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
his Delinquencie: <hi>Aeſop</hi> for his Defence inſiſted
o'th particulars of his Charge, that nothing ever worſ
could bee then Tongues: By theſe, quarrels were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,
Men ſlain, Lies forged, Execrations diſpenſed,
<pb facs="tcp:112365:8"/>
Perjurie vented, Kingdoms overthrown; and in brief
thereby the whole life entangled in error; whereat the
Gueſts not ſo well pleas'd, one of them ſaid, If <hi>Xanthus</hi>
were not arm'd with Patience beyond the ſuffrance of a
Man, <hi>Aeſop</hi> would make him mad: whom <hi>Aeſop</hi> ſtrait
reproving, ſaid, Hee was a buſie curious fellow to incenſ
the Maſter ſo againſt his Servant. <hi>Xanthus</hi> occaſion ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to beat <hi>Aeſop,</hi> in that hee blam'd his Friend as curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
impos'd a Charge on him to bring him One, that
was not ſo. Which to effect, <hi>Aeſop</hi> went forth into the
ſtreet, where looking earneſtly about him; hee deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a man a long time in a corner had ſit ſtill immov'd:
<hi>Aeſop</hi> (him judging ſom ſimple idle drone) invited him
to Dinner from his Maſter; the Clown not asking who
his Maſter was or where, went home with him. <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>
admiring much this his new gueſt, askt <hi>Aeſop,</hi> who
hee was: <hi>Aeſop</hi> repli'd a man not curious, ſuch as hee
had commanded him to bring. <hi>Xanthus</hi> his wife ſtrait
whiſpering in the ear; deſir'd her to fulfill what ere hee
bad her do, hee might advantage win to puniſh <hi>Aeſop's</hi>
Inſolence: forthwith his voice exalting, bad her bring
ſom water to waſh the feet of this his welcom Gueſt:
Prefiguring to himſelf, his Gueſt would in civilitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
ſo mean a Miniſtrie from ſo fair a hand; and in ſo
doing <hi>Aeſop</hi> might bee convicted; of which his wife de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
appli'd her ſelf thereto with diligence. The Clown
eſteeming this as a peculiar grace to honor him, his feet
extended without Cerimonie; which waſht, as rudely
hee ſat down. <hi>Xanthus</hi> purſuing ſtill his Purpoſe; bad
fill his Gueſt ſom Wine imagining his Gueſt would in
good manners move the Cup might firſt have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to him; the Clown eſteeming this as right to his
reſpect, accepted it, and cleared with the Cup the doubt;
then eagerly fell on the Meſs that nigheſt was to hand;
<pb facs="tcp:112365:9"/>
which, <hi>Xanthus</hi> following his deſign, condemned much
in that it not well ordered was; and calling for the
Cook, reviled him with ſharp rebukes, which were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd
with blows; the Clown without intermiſſion fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
ſaid, The Meat was verie good, <hi>Xanthus</hi> might
ſaie, and do his Pleaſure, it not concerned him. <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>
much vext hee could not trap his Gueſt; at laſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
a <hi>Marchpane,</hi> ſeem'd much to miſlike, and calling
for the Paſtrie-Cook, reproacht him manie defects i'th
compoſure; who made replie, Had it not been well
bak't, hee might have born the blame; but the fault
beeing in the making, his Miſtreſs therein was to bee
condemn'd, who onely had a hand in it: <hi>Xanthus</hi> a
private ſignal giving to his wife, ſtept in a furie to her,
ſaying, ſince 'twas her fault, ſhee onely for it ſhould bee
burnt alive, then to the fire bearing her in his Arms,
pauſed a while, exſpecting when his Gueſt would run
to reſcue her. But hee faſt tied by the teeth, praid <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi>
if hee pleas'd to hold his hand awhile, hee would
fetch his Wife too, they both might burn together. <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>
admiring the immotion of the Clown, yielded the
Victorie unto <hi>Aeſop's</hi> choice: and forthwith ſent him to
the common Bath, to bee inform'd what companie there
was, if few or none, his reſolution beeing then to bathe
himſelf. <hi>Aeſop</hi> on his errand haſting, encountred the
chief Magiſtrate; who knowing hee belong'd to <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi>
askt him, Where hee went? <hi>Aeſop</hi> in haſte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd.
Hee did not know; the Magiſtrate believing this
ſlight anſwer made in ſcorn of him, committed him to
Priſon: Paſſing to which, <hi>Aeſop</hi> ſaid to the Magiſtrate,
hee now might ſee how pertinently hee had anſwer'd
him, hee did not know that hee ſhould go to Priſon:
The Magiſtrate much pleaſed with his readie wit, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
enlarged him: Who coming to the Bath, obſerved
<pb facs="tcp:112365:9"/>
manie there, who at the entrie ſtumbling at a ſtone, paſt
to and fro not much regarding it: Onely One came, and
ere like chance befel him, it remov'd. <hi>Aeſop</hi> return'd,
inform'd his Maſter there was but one man onely in the
Bath. But <hi>Xanthus</hi> thither com, finding a multitude,
reproved <hi>Aeſop</hi> for abuſing him: <hi>Aeſop</hi> repli'd; all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to and fro, had ſtumbled at a ſtone juſt in the entrie
laie, One onely had remov'd it ere hee paſt, to whom
the reſt compar'd hee could not judg them men, giving
ſuch ſlight evidence of that facultie, which ſhould for
ſuch diſtinguiſh them: heeron <hi>Xanthus</hi> not judging it a
fit time to bathe, withdrew from thence unto a private
Feaſt of his Societie, to which ſom time before hee was
invited; where on diſcourſ of luſtie Bibbers, hee high
in wine and fancie boaſted, hee onely would exhauſt the
Sea, by drinking it, which proffering by wager to make
good, found an Accepter there, who from their hands
depoſited their rings, to confirm the Contract, which
was the loſers dwelling houſ conſigned was thereby un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the winner. <hi>Xanthus,</hi> his wits recovering with his
ſleep miſſed his ring next morning, as hee waſht; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Aeſop</hi> hee examining, found to his grief the Error hee
had don, and to his ſuccor, with large proffers, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd
<hi>Aeſop's</hi> wit; <hi>Aeſop</hi> repli'd, to win there was no
poſſibilitie, but his Engagement to withdraw, that hee
aſſur'd him of. Which as <hi>Aeſop</hi> advis'd, was thus pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd:
Th'Aſſemblie met the wager to determine; <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>
immov'd no part of it deni'd, himſelf preparing to
the enterprize; of the ſea water taking a full Bowl; firſt
loudly publiſht the Particulars, which were, hee ſhould
the Sea drink drie, his adverſarie therewith ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as his part to ſtop all rivers fell into the deep, it bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sea hee onely was to drink, not the freſh waters
thither iſſuing, which demand held but juſt, and either
<pb facs="tcp:112365:10"/>
Part impoſſible; the wager was withdrawn. <hi>Xanthus</hi>
ſecuring both his Fame and Goods by <hi>Aeſop's</hi> ſubtiltie.
When home return'd; <hi>Aeſop</hi> requir'd his freedom for
his recompenſ, to which unwilling, <hi>Xanthus</hi> bad him
firſt to go forth, and if two Crows hee did diſcover,
to bring him word thereof, it would bee to him a good
<hi>Omen;</hi> if but one, it did protend ill hap. <hi>Aeſop</hi> went
forth, and ſpying two, return'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> informing thereof, <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi>
who, haſting forth to ſee them, found but one; the
other in the interim beeing flown awaie: whereon <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>
believing <hi>Aeſop</hi> had derided him, fell on his skirts
with blows: during which fraie a Meſſenger came in
to invite <hi>Xanthus</hi> to a Publick Feaſt. Which hearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Aeſop</hi> reproacht his Maſter this his Augurie: ſaying <hi>Hee
that had two Crows ſeen was heaten, his Maſter that but
One, was feaſted: Xanthus</hi> to gratulate this Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
another made ſoon after: at which <hi>Aeſop</hi> had
charge to let in none but ſuch were letter'd men. <hi>Aeſop</hi>
(as hee was wont) his Maſter's learning to deride, kept
the Door ſhut, and as the Gueſts knockt, askt, what the
Dog mov'd? At which without replie, diſtaſted All
return'd; but one, who when <hi>Aeſop</hi> askt, What the Dog
mov'd, repli'd, his Ears and Tale, to whom free entrie
<hi>Aeſop</hi> onely gave. <hi>Xanthus</hi> perplext to ſee his Gueſts,

in defenſ, his charge was onely the literate to admit; for
Proof whereof, hee onely askt, What the Dog mov'd?
But they not able to reſolv, hee could not judg them of
thoſe Gueſts, his Maſter purpos'd to receiv. <hi>Xanthus</hi>
(for ſhame, concealing his diſpleaſure, till time produc'd
a juſter cauſ of Puniſhment) went forth with <hi>Aeſop</hi> to

heeron four Paces meaſuring from the Tomb, dig'd up
the Earth, and found a Pot of Gold; which to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
bringing, hee his Promiſs clame'd. <hi>Xanthus</hi> ſaid,
firſt hee ſhould expound to him the Senſ of the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,
which hee more prized then the Gold, was by

<hi>Xanthus</hi> demanded, Whence hee had learnt that. <hi>Aeſop</hi>
repli'd, the ſame letters did infer the ſame, <gap reason="foreign">

in fear that <hi>Aeſop</hi> ſhould divulge his new adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
caſt him in Priſon. Where <hi>Aeſop</hi> ſhamefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
him the breach of his Promiſs, was at length
<pb facs="tcp:112365:11"/>
ſet free: but not reſtored to his libertie: which <hi>Aeſop</hi>
him aſſur'd hee ſhould ere long attein againſt his
will; about which time hapned this accident in the
<hi>Samian</hi> State. As they were in the Cerimonie of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Feaſt, an Eagle had truſt up their Publick Seal, and
dropt it in the boſom of a Slave. Amaz'd at this new
Prodegie, the Magiſtrates repair'd to <hi>Xanthus</hi> as the
chief Philoſopher, t'expound the Myſterie: but hee as
full of doubt as they, ſom time required thereon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate.
In which <hi>Aeſop</hi> perceiving <hi>Xanthus</hi> full of
trouble, knowing well the cauſ, deſir'd him to caſt the
burden of his doubts on him, and the next daie to let
the <hi>Samians</hi> know it was no part of his Profeſſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
Auguries, but that hee had a Boie, who skilfull
was therein, and what they ſought was able to reſolv;
and if hee did enlighten the Preſage, it would an honor
to his Maſter be, who had in his Poſſeſſion ſuch a ſlave,
but if hee fail'd therein, the hazzard of the Error would
ſolie fall on him; to which perſuaded, <hi>Xanthus</hi> next daie
what <hi>Aeſop</hi> had adviz'd, communicated to the <hi>Samians,</hi>
whereon <hi>Aeſop</hi> ſummon'd, Publickly ſtood forth and
ſaid, <hi>That Fortune (ſtill the Miniſter of ſtrife) had caſt the
prize of Glorie betwixt the Maſter and his ſlave, which if
the ſervant from the Maſter bore, in envie hee ſhould no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
gain but blows: and if hee failed in the Enterprize,
like ſtripes would puniſh his Preſumtion, which diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to avoid,</hi> Hee firſt deſir'd the People to procure
his libertie; the People heeron all with one aſſent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<hi>Xanthus</hi> to enlarge his ſlave, as a peculiar Grace
unto the Citie. <hi>Xanthus</hi> not verie forward to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was checked by the Preſident, aſſuring him, if hee
did not aſſent thereto, to make it their own Act. <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>
perceiving no evaſion, yielded his right, which by

on this Preſage fil'd with grief, diſſolv'd: Soon
after Letters had from <hi>Craeſus</hi> King of <hi>Lydia,</hi> by which

accepted, to prepare for War. The <hi>Samians</hi> doubtful what
heerin to do, ere farther they proceeded, would conſult
with <hi>Aeſop,</hi> who them aſſur'd; there was, as then, no Place
for Councel left; ſince the more pow'rfull ſtill muſt bee
obeied; to which at preſent hee advized them, ſaying,
<hi>That Fortune had in each man's life laid forth two ſeverall
waies: The one of Libertie, the Entrie whereof was diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
and rough, but the end ſmooth and pleaſant. The other
was of ſervitude, whoſe entrie plain and eaſie was of acceſs;
but th'Iſſue thereof penable and rude.</hi> But his advice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by the <hi>Samians, Craeſus</hi> thereof had ſoon intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
who ſtraight reſolved to decree a war againſt the

moved to the <hi>Samians</hi> by a ſecond Embaſſie with releaſ
of their purpos'd tribute, was accepted of, reſolving to

hee to the People publickly declar'd his liking to their

quickly underſtood, who thereon would retract
their firſt intention. But <hi>Aeſop</hi> not aſſenting thereto,
with Promiſs to bee helpfull to them, was diſiniſt with
the Ambaſſadors, who to <hi>Craeſus</hi> brought, the Spectacle
at firſt incenſed him with ſcorn, ſo vile a thing ſhould
bee an obſtacle to his Enterprize. <hi>Aeſop</hi> ſaid to the King
(with great Humilitie) hee nor by force, nor by neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
was compel'd to his Preſence, but of his own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord;
therefore deſir'd his Pardon and Libertie to ſpeak:
which granted; <hi>Aeſop</hi> ſaid; <hi>A certain man, who Locust
ſought to ſlaie, by chance had took a Graſhopper, whom hee
about to kil; the Graſhopper deſired him, not to deſtroie him
without anie Cauſ: ſhee did the Ear no hurt, nor yet in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Action injure him; the motion of her little tongue did
but delight the Paſſenger.</hi> Th'Alluſion heerof making
to himſelf, ſurpriz'd the King with wonder and delight;
who promis'd <hi>Aeſop,</hi> hee would his Life not onely, but
his Fate enlarge, commanding him to ask what hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd,
it ſhould forthwith confirmed bee to him. <hi>Aeſop</hi>
requeſted onely hee to the <hi>Samians</hi> would bee reconcil'd;
of which the King aſſuring him, <hi>Aeſop</hi> tendred him
thanks, and thereon writ theſe Fables, which to the
King preſented by him eſteemed highly were, and from
that time preſerv'd to future Ages. Soon after <hi>Aeſop</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
letters to the Samians from the King, conteining
that hee was in favor unto <hi>Aeſop</hi> reconcil'd to them, with
rich Gifts laden, to <hi>Samos</hi> ſail'd again. The <hi>Samians</hi> at
his return, receiving him in triumph, brought ſeverall
Crowns to him as their deliverer: whereon the Kings
Conceſſions to them publiſhed, <hi>Aeſop</hi> for this Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
was highly by the State rewarded. From whence
departing. <hi>Aeſop</hi> began his travels, diſputing where hee
came with the Philoſophers. Coming to <hi>Babylon</hi> the
reputation of his wiſdom, brought him in great favor
<pb facs="tcp:112365:12"/>
with <hi>Licerus</hi> King thereof. In which times it was a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
'mongſt thoſe Princes were at Peace together to
ſend <hi>Aenigma</hi>'s or dark Sentences one unto the other, and
who reſolved them, contracted tribute from the tender
gain'd, or failing forfeited to him; In which, by <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s
help <hi>Lycerus</hi> both enlarg'd his Fame and Treaſurie, <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop</hi>
beeing childeleſs, adopted for his ſon, one <hi>Ennus</hi> a
young man of noble Familie, who falling into league
with <hi>Aeſop's</hi> Concubine, ſoon after was by him expelled
from his houſ. <hi>Ennus</hi> heeron incenſt, a letter forg'd with
<hi>Aeſop's</hi> hand and ſeal, wherein expreſſed was <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s
contriving with <hi>Licerus</hi> adverſares to his Prejudice, in
the Solution of their Problems, which by him to <hi>Licerus</hi>
ſhewn, hee facile of belief, yielded no truce to ire; but
forthwith ſtrict command gave to <hi>Hermippo,</hi> hee ſhould
kill <hi>Aeſop</hi> without more delaie. <hi>Hermippo</hi> beeing <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s
friend belied not the Character, concealing <hi>Aeſop</hi> in a
ſecret vault, whither ſtill privately hee convei'd him
food, while <hi>Ennus</hi> by <hi>Licerus</hi> order ſeis'd on his Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
Soon after this, <hi>Nectenabo</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt</hi> hearing
<hi>Aeſop</hi> was ſlain, took that advantage, to ſend unto <hi>Lice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
Problematical Letters; requiring him to ſend him
ſuch Architects, could build a Tow'r might touch, nor
Heaven, nor Earth and there with a man, that ſhould
reſolv, what ever hee ſhould ask, which if hee did, hee
tribute ſhould receive if not paie to him. <hi>Licerus</hi> on
receit heerof, reflecting on the prejudice hee had (in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop's</hi>
loſs) procured to his proper Intereſts, perplexed
was in minde; which <hi>Hermippo</hi> diſtinguiſhing, laid hold
on this occaſion as auſpitious, to let <hi>Licerus</hi> know, <hi>Aeſop</hi>
was by him yet preſerv'd alive, leaſt that the execution
of his ſudden wrath, might after by him bee repented
of. At which <hi>Licerus</hi> overcom with joie for <hi>Aeſop</hi> ſent,
with floods of tears reſtoring him to favor. <hi>Aeſop</hi> his
<pb facs="tcp:112365:13"/>
accuſation knowing, and licenſt now to ſpeak, ſoon
clear'd himſelf in the diſcoverie of his Dilator's treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erie,
for which <hi>Ennus</hi> by the King condemn'd to die, the
ſentence was repeal'd by <hi>Aeſop's</hi> ſute. who him receiv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to his Adoption: with gratious Councel him admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing,
which gentle uſage pierced ſo much his woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Conſcience with the horror of his former guilt,
that in the inward conflict thereof hee ſoon after died.
<hi>Lycerus</hi> communicating to <hi>Aeſop</hi> the Contents of <hi>Necie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabo's</hi>
letter. <hi>Aeſop</hi> the reat ſmiling, adviz'd him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
for Anſwer, <hi>That in the inſuing Spring, hee ſhould
receiv from him what hee requir'd:</hi> With which the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
diſmiſt. <hi>Aeſop</hi> in the Interim four choiſ Eag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
dreſſed ſo to hand, that each could bear into the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Region of the Aër a Childe ſuſpended in a Basket,
and therewith make deſcent at his diſcretion. With this
ſtrange <hi>Aequipage,</hi> the Winter paſt, <hi>Aeſop</hi> to <hi>Egypt</hi> came,
where in the Preſence of th'<hi>Egyptian</hi> King, hee let his
Eaglets with their carriages in a ſquare figure flie; who
in the Aër exalted the Boies cal'd out to them that were
below to bring up the materials for the Structure. The
King abaſht, ſaid, <hi>Hee no flying men had for the carriages;</hi>
and in this part of his demand confeſt himſelf convinc't.
Next follow'd the <hi>Aenigma's,</hi> the firſt propounded by the
King, was, <hi>That hee had in his Poſſeſsion certain Mares,
who hearing the Horſ neigh in Babylon, forthwith conceiv'd.
Aeſop</hi> deſiring reſpite till th'inſuing daie, for the Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
commanded his Attendants to take a Cat, which
tied in a line, to draw her through the Streets, purſuing
her with blows; This put in execution, The <hi>Egyptians,</hi>
who worſhipped this Animal, ſeeing her thus miſerably
treated, ran forthwith to her ſuccour, and from her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors
reſcuing her, complaint made of the outrage to
the King; who <hi>Aeſop</hi> ſummoning requir'd the reaſon,
<pb facs="tcp:112365:13"/>
why what they held in Reverence, hee us'd with ſuch
conteme. <hi>Aeſop</hi> replied, <hi>That Cat had but laſt Night
don to Licerus a ſignal diſpleaſure, devouring a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
fighting Cock, hee had in great esteem.</hi> The King
repli'd; That was impoſſible, the Cat could in one night
ſo long a voiage make: at which <hi>Aeſop</hi> ſmiling, ſaid;
<hi>So it likewiſe was, that Mares ſhould at that distance bee
conceiv'd with Fole.</hi> The King well pacified heerin, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<hi>Aeſop's</hi> ingenuitie. And for farther trial, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the chief Sophiſters of his Realm, inviting them
with <hi>Aeſop</hi> to a Feaſt; at which one of them addreſsing
himſelf to <hi>Aeſop,</hi> ſaid, Hee by his God was ſent to ask
a Queſtion of him. <hi>Aeſop</hi> replied, Hee both his God
abuſed and himſelf; God had no need of man's intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;
whereat hee ſilene't; Another thus accoſted
him; <hi>There was a mightie temple in which a Column
stood twelv Cities had each one by thirtie beams ſupported,
round which ſtill ran two women. Aeſop</hi> repli'd, <hi>With
them, even children could expound ſuch riddles. The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was the world; the Column was the year, the twelv Cities
thereon, were the twelv months thereof; the thirtie Columns
ſupported each were daies; the women that ſurrounded it
continually were might and daie, which alternately ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
each other.</hi> The King heerat perplext hee could not
<hi>Aeſop</hi> foil, aſſembled all his Peers; to conſult with them
how hee might avoid the paiment of his tribute, made
forfeit to <hi>Licerus</hi> by <hi>Aeſop's</hi> ſubtiltie. One of them ſaid,
They <hi>Aeſop</hi> ſhould enjoin to propound a Queſtion to
them, that they neither knew, nor ever heard. Th'ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
receiv'd, and of <hi>Aeſop</hi> requir'd; who having reſpite
till the following daie, framed a Contract, in which
<hi>Necienabo</hi> confeſt himſelf a thouſand talents indebted to
<hi>Licerus,</hi> which at th'appointed time cloſe ſeal'd deliver'd
to the King in preſence of his Nobles (ere the inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:112365:14"/>
was unfolded, to o'rethrow <hi>Aeſop's</hi> purpoſe) they ſaid,
they all had that oft heard and knew it to bee true. <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop</hi>
repli'd, in reſpect of the paiment, hee was engaged to
them for their teſtimonie. The King the writing open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and puruſing, ſaid, Hee nothing was indebted to <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerus,</hi>
all they were preſent could it teſtifie; which, all
confirming, ſaid; They never knew nor heard of ſuch
a Matter. <hi>Aeſop</hi> replied, If that were ſo, they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
what they ſought of him. <hi>Nectenabo</hi> heeron ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding
<hi>Aeſop's</hi> readie wit; tendered to him the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
tribute, and from his Court diſmiſſed with much
honor. <hi>Aeſop</hi> return'd to <hi>Babylon,</hi> recited to <hi>Licerus</hi>
what had paſt, preſenting him his tribute hee had won.
<hi>Licerus</hi> heeron to perpetrate to after ages <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Fame
and Memorie, in honor of him cauſſed his Statue to bee
erected in Gold. Soon after <hi>Aeſop</hi> obteining licence of
the King to travel, on promiſs to return and end his
daies with him; paſſed thorough Greece with great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſ,
and unto <hi>Delphos</hi> came: The Delphians curious
to hear, but careleſs of what heard: made ſmall Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of him: In reproof whereof, <hi>Aeſop</hi> compared
them to a Log at Sea. which floting on the inſtable Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
ſeemed to them that were remote from it ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of ualue; but when viewed neer at hand was
found contemtible. The Delphians hearing this, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd
the Alluſion thereof to themſelvs; which ſeiſed
them with jealouſie, that <hi>Aeſop</hi> might this Judgment of
them publiſh through the world, which if hee did the
high eſteem all held of him would much eclypſ their
Glorie: this to prevent, they privately took from <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo's</hi>
ſhrine a Cup of Gold and ſecretly conveied it among
<hi>Aeſop's</hi> Goods; who on his departure thence was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
and accus'd of Sacrilege: which <hi>Aeſop</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they unbound his carriages, diſcovering to the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
<pb facs="tcp:112365:14"/>
they had rais'd the Cup; whereon <hi>Aeſop</hi> into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
caſt, his Judges his Accuſers beeing, was ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed,
and to ſupplice led; where calling to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
hee ſaid; <hi>When Beaſts could ſpeak; the Mouſ
made friends unto the Frog, invited him to Dinner; to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
which the Frog the enſuing daie would have the Mouſ
his Gueſt, and to avoid the danger of the Paſſage to his Cell,
which was a Pool, the Mouſ unskil'd in ſwimming, the Frog
his foot unto his Gueſts had faſtened by a line, therewith to
train him over; but having won the deepest of the flood, the
Frog plung'd over head and ears the Mouſ: who drowning
ſaid; Hee treacherouſly was ſlain; but a more powerfull
would avenge his death. When dead, the Mouſ laie floting
on the stream was by an Eagle truſſed for her Preie, and
with him the ſuspending Frog, who likewiſe with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
was devour'd.</hi> The Application heerto <hi>Aeſop</hi> made
was that <hi>Licerus</hi> and all Greece, would for his death like
vengeance take of them. But this reſtreining not the Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phians
from their purpos'd Act: <hi>Aeſop</hi> fled from them
to <hi>Apollo's</hi> Temple for his Sanctuarie: But from thence
alſo forced to the Precipice again. <hi>Aeſop</hi> attemting far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to diſſuade them; ſaid; <hi>An Eagle had purſu'd a
Hare into a Beetle's Den, the distrest Beast requiring ſbel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
the Beetle praid the Eagle not to despiſe her impotence;
but ſpare the refug'd Hare. The Eagle yet inſulting more,
ſtruck down the Beetle with her wings, and made the Hare
her unreſiſted Preie: The Beetle to revenge this outrage
ſought out the Eagle's Nest, and from thence cast her eggs
unto the Earth; the Eagle to avoid this injurie ſhifted her
Neſt much higher then it was, yet not there alſo from her
Foe ſecur'd: The Eagle beeing of Jove belov'd, took re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
in his boſom, the Beetle this perceiving, dirt gathered
from the Earth, and in Joves boſom caſh it amongſt the egs:
Jove of the eggs unmindfull, ſhaking off the dirt, cast both
<pb facs="tcp:112365:15"/>
unto the Earth together, who reproving the Beetle for this
revenge, as an indignitie to him. The Eagle arriv'd, and
heard, by Jove was not excus'd; yet beeing unwilling that
the Eagle's kinde ſhould ceaſ, adviz'd them to bee recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu'd,
but that accord ſoon broken; Jove transfer'd the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Eagle's breeding to another time, in which the
Beetle not able is to appear.</hi> The ſenſ thereof <hi>Aeſop</hi> to
them, infer'd was, that they ſhould not ſlight that God
to whom hee fled, though but an image they had figured
him, yet could not the impious ſcape his puniſhment:
But this not availing alſo; <hi>Aeſop</hi> thus concluded, <hi>A
Huſbandman, who in the Countrie had grown old, yet never
ſaw the Citie, commanded his Domesticks to prepare for this
his purpos'd Journie: who from their work not beeing to bee
ſpared, in stead of Horſes, as the more eaſie Beast, join'd
Aſſes in a Car, and left them onely to the old Man's Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
as on his waie a hideous ſtorm aroſe, whoſe obſcure
ſhrouds advanc't the distant Night: wherein the Aſſes er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
from off a ſteep rock overwhelm'd their Guide; who
as hee fell, ſaid, Jove, what had hee don, to merit ſuch a
ſhamefull end, not procur'd by the conduct of the generous
Horſ, or ſtrenuous Mule, but of all Beast the most deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Aſs:</hi> Like Fate, ſaid <hi>Aeſop,</hi> did enlarge his Grief.
Whereon yet more incenſt, they turn'd him off the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice;
whoſe death beeing followed by an inceſſant
Plague, the Delphians to their Oracle appealed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs:
from whence was anſwer made, they firſt ſhould
expiate the Crime of <hi>Aeſop's</hi> death; of which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious,
erected to his Memorie a Monument. But the
neighbouring Princes not ſatisfied heerwith, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
what had paſt, to <hi>Delphos</hi> came; where making
ſtrict enquirie into <hi>Aeſop's</hi> Death, became ſevere aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
