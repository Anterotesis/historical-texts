            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE Two following <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
which I have here
preſented to the Reader,
being lately come to my hands, and
containing a ſhort but moſt exact
and authentick Account of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Condition of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi>
Empire, I thought I could ſcarce
do more acceptable piece of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to the Publick at this Juncture,
than to communicate them to the
Curious. The firſt Letter was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by a Gentleman, who being at
<hi>Amſteldam</hi> at the time of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<hi>Muſcovite</hi> Embaſſy; and
whilſt the <hi>Czar</hi> was there preſent,
had the Honour to be intimately
<pb facs="tcp:57677:3"/>
acquainted with ſome of the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
of the firſt Rank there, which
gave him the opportunity to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
concerning theſe Matters,
which hitherto either are
not at all, or at leaſt, but very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly
come to our Knowledge.
Thoſe who will ſeriouſly reflect
upon what this Gentleman has been
pleaſed to tell us concerning the
two. Sieges of <hi>Aſoph,</hi> its true Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
Advantage and Strength;
concerning the preſent State of the
<hi>Muſcovite</hi> Navy, and their Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim
Affairs; with ſeveral other
moſt Curious Obſervations, relate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his <hi>Czariſh Majeſty's</hi> Perſon,
eſpecially ſince his departure out of
<hi>England,</hi> I ſuppoſe, agree with
me in Opinion, that this Account
is the moſt exact, and perhaps alſo
the mos;t authentick we have had
of this kind for many Years before.
The ſecond being an Abſtract of
ſeveral Letters written by a Perſon
of Quality then Reſiding at the
Imperial Court at <hi>Vienna,</hi> gives us
<pb facs="tcp:57677:3"/>
a faithful Account both of his own
Sentiments and of the whole Imperial
Court concerning the preſent State of
Affairs in <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> with very Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Obſervations upon ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Subjects, relating to the
laſt Peace with the <hi>Turks;</hi> and the
Way by Land through the <hi>Great-Tartary</hi>
into <hi>China.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Any one that will be at the
pains to compare the Maps the
Geographers have been pleaſed to
put upon the World formerly, of
the North Eaſtern Parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi>
with this Account, will ſoon be
convinced of their Ignorance, when
they have repreſented this Part of
the World, which is Stock'd with
vaſt Numbers of Inhabitants, and
Water'd by ſo many great and fair
Rivers, as inhabitable Forreſts and
Deſarts. In the whole, theſe two
Letters may well be conſider'd as a
Supplement of the <hi>Antient and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
State of</hi> Muſcovy, publiſhed
at the time of His Czariſh Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
being in <hi>England;</hi> many things
<pb facs="tcp:57677:4"/>
of Moment which have happened
ſince, being inſerted here, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
upon the Credit of thoſe
Perſons, who had the opportunity
of taking the beſt Information that
can be expected of this kind. I
will not pretend to enlarge much
upon the Hiſtorical Portraicture,
given us by Father <hi>Bouvet,</hi> of the
preſent Emperour of <hi>China,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
that his being an Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of what he relates, and his
offering it to the moſt Chriſtian
King, will be a ſufficient Plea, both
for his Authority and Veracity, to
the unbyaſs'd Reader.</p>

                  <p>ADVERTISEMENT
TO THE
READER.</p>
                  <p>WHen I conſider the Genius
of the Age we live in,
which is ſo much inclined to call in
queſtion every thing that comes
from far Remote Places, I have all
the Reaſon in the World, to fear
that theſe Memories will undergo the
ſame Fate and will not meet with
that favourable interpretation, the
faithfulneſs and exactneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they are written, might juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Challenge from unqualified Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:57677:5"/>
But as I have not inſerted the
leaſt thing, of which I have not
either been an Eye-witneſs my ſelf,
or elſe have received it my ſelf from
unqueſtionable hands, ſo I am apt
to flatter my ſelf, that the Reader
will look upon this Relation with
another Eye, than is commonly
done upon ordinary accounts; I
hope no body will think me ſo Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent,
as to dare to Preſent to the
moſt quick-ſighted and greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
of the World, any thing
which is not in all its circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
agreeable to Truth; which
muſt heeds bring upon me the juſt
Indignation of His Majeſty, and
at the ſame time, be a means to
forfeit the Good Opinion of
the Greateſt Emperour of the
<hi>Orient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whatever the Spirit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
may be able to invent, to
render theſe Memoirs ſuſpected to
the World. I don't queſtion, but that
Truth which is repreſented here
without Contradiction, in its Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
<pb facs="tcp:57677:5"/>
Shape, will protect me both
here and in <hi>China</hi> againſt all gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers;
the only thing which I have
to relent at, being, that I have not
been able to repreſent in their full
Luſtre all ſuch Matters, as muſt
needs be infinitely pleaſing to all,
who are truly Zealous for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
of the Faith.</p>

can furniſh us, but with very few Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
which, If I dare preſume to
ſay ſo, are more worth Your Attention

more than, that it is the Portraicture
of a Monarch, who, having the good
Fortune to Reſemble Your Majeſty in
moſt Reſpects, enjoys the ſame Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages

into</hi> China <hi>ſome years ago,
were not a little ſurpriſed to meet at
the utmoſt corner of the Earth with
what they had never ſeen before but
in</hi> France, <hi>that is to ſay, a Prince,
who, like Your ſelf, has improved his
ſublime Genius by that Greatneſs of
Soul, which alone renders hint worthy
of the greateſt Empire of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe;
who bas the ſame uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Power over his Paſſions, at over his

who, as his Glorious Enterprizes have

more indebted for it to his own Valour

It muſt be confeſs'd that hitherto
be is ſo unhappy as to be a Pagan,
which makes him uncapable of theſe
moſt Eminent Prerogatives, without
which, all the other Royal Qualities
want the moſt ſolid Foundation; yet
it may be truly ſaid of him, that he
has made a conſiderable ſtep towards
it by the High Eſteem he has of our
Religion, by the Satisfaction he takes
in the Converſion of his Subjects to
the Chriſtian Faith, which gives its
no ſmall hopes, that in time by the
Grace fo God, be entirely united to
the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For, conſidering what favourable
Inclinations God has been pleaſed to
inſpire into his Heart for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion, by the means of our
Arts and Sciences we are not beyond
hopes, that one day he may prove the
Destruction of the Pagan Idolatry in</hi>
China; <hi>endeavouring</hi> in this, as in
many other things, to tread in the

                  <p>IN your laſt you deſired me to acquaint
you with what I had been able to learn
concerning the preſent State of <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi>
during the Stay of that moſt ſolemn
Embaſſy of His <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty in this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
I am extreamly well pleaſed, you have

meaſure your Curioſity, having by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Converſation with the ſaid Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
had the opportunity to inform my
ſelf of ſeveral Matters of great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
not commonly known in theſe
Parts. I cannot but be amaz'd at the
ſtrange. Notions the greateſt Part have
form'd to themſelves of the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> being prepoſſeſs'd
with an Opinion, that this Monarchy is of
ſo little Consequence in reſpect of the other
<hi>European</hi> Kingdoms, as ſcarce to be worthy
taking notice of.</p>
                  <p>But whoever will take the trouble to
make a true inſight into the preſent Poſture
of their Affairs, will be forced to confeſs,
that there are few Kingdoms in <hi>Europe,</hi>
which at this time may be look'd upon as a
more proper Object of our Curioſity.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be denied, but that before the
Year 1645, when Czar <hi>Alexis Michaelovitz,</hi>
(his preſent <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty's Father) came
to the Crown, the <hi>Maſcovites</hi> were much
more barbarous, that they cultivated but a
very ſlender Correſpondence, and had but
little Commerce with foreign Nations; and
that being ill vers'd in all manner of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
they were conſequently very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Military Art and Diſcipline, at
leaſt as it is practiſed now a-days in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
which was the true Reaſon of their
ill Succeſs in ſo many Encounters, and that,
tho' naturally fierce and hardy, they were
frequently worſted by their Enemies, tho'
much interior in Number.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:57677:9"/>
The Czar <hi>Alexis Michaelovitz,</hi> a Prince
of a vaſt Underſtanding, and a Great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician,
having immediately after his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
to the Throne, inveſtigated the true
Cauſe of the Diſadvantage, the <hi>Muſcovites</hi>
lay under at that time, in reſpect of other
foreign Nations, applied all his Thoughts
to remove this Obſtacle; The beſt Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
he could pitch upon, was, to draw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Service as many foreign Officers as
poſſibly he could, to inſtruct his Subjects in
the Modern Art of War; And the better
to compaſs his Deſign, he made uſe of all
the Politicks that could have been invented
by the moſt refined Politician. For being
ſenſible, that it would be no eaſie Task to
engage a conſiderable Number of well qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
foreign Officers into his Service, he
inſenſibly brought them over to his Party,
by the Promiſes of great Pay, of entire
Liberty of Conſcience, of what Religion
ſoever; and by taking them into his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
but for a little time: all which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
punctually obſerved on his ſide. Thus
he put his projected Deſign in execution,
with ſo extraordinary Succeſs, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Account given by the Baron of
<hi>Meyerbergh,</hi> who was in the Year 1662,
ſent by his preſent Imperial Majeſty <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pald,</hi>
as his Ambaſſadour into <hi>Muſcovy,</hi>
there were among the foreign Officers in
the Czar <hi>Alexis Michaelovitz</hi>'s Service, two
Generals, two Marſhals de Camp, above a
hundred Collonels, a great Nnmber of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors;
Captains, Lieutenants and Enſigns, in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57677:10"/>
prodigious Numbers, who were all paid
very punctually: This Account coming
from a Perſon, who otherwiſe ſeldom ſpeaks
well of the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> and their Affairs,
deſerves to be particularly taken notice of
in this place.</p>
                  <p>Theſe abovementioned Officers, having
made their Levies in divers parts of the
Country, ſubject-to the Obedience of the
Czars of <hi>Muſchovy,</hi> and brought them under a
regular Martial Diſciplines, did afterwards
in ſeveral Encounters with the <hi>Poles</hi> and
<hi>Swedes,</hi> give ſufficient Proofs, that the
<hi>Muſcovites</hi> don't want Bravery, when
they are led on by good and experienc'd
Officers. But, beſides theſe new Levies, the
Czar had always on foot a certain ſtanding
Number of old Troops, not unlike to the
<hi>Roman</hi> Legions; thoſe the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> call
<hi>Strelitzes,</hi> conſiſting of forty Thouſand
Men, under the Command of the Chiefeſt
of the Nobility of the Empire.</p>
                  <p>It is further to be obſerved, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
of a more regular Diſcipline a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Forces, was not the
only Reaſon which induc'd the Czar <hi>Alexis
Michaelovitz,</hi> to entertain ſo vaſt a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of foreign Officers in his Service, it
having been prov'd by Experience, That
the ſame was in a great meaſure, founded
upon the Security of the Prince's Perſon,
who before that time, having committed
the whole Management of their ſtanding
Forces to the Nobility, thereby gave them
frequent opportunies of abuſing their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57677:10"/>
in oppoſition to the Royal Authority.</p>
                  <p>This Great Prince died in the Year 1676,
much lamented by his People, whoſe Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
he was, as having not once, in all his
Reign, in the leaſt abuſed his Abſolute Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but given them a thouſand Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his Moderation, Juſtice and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
It was he, that firſt changed the face of
Affairs of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Empire, and laid
that Foundation, upon which the
Greatneſs of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> has been built
ſince that time, and which is likely to be
brought to perfection, by the preſent Grand
Czar Peter <hi>Alexiovitz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He left the Succeſſion of the Crown to
his eldeſtt Son, <hi>Fedor Alexiovitz,</hi> who reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but ſix years, his early Loſs was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
much lamented by his Subjects, being
a very Accompliſh'd Perſon, and who had
given extraordinary hopes of a Good and
Great Prince, having exactly followed his
Father's footſteps, especially in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the foreign Officers, and the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of Commerce. He was a great
lover of all Sciences, but eſpecially of the
Mathematicks, and deſign'd to have all
the Houſes of the City of <hi>Muſcon,</hi> new
built of Brick, and the Streets pav'd with
Stones, if he had not been prevented by
Death; It was under his Reign, that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Le Fort,</hi> of whom I ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to ſpeak more anon, entred into the
Service of <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> He was on a ſudden, ſeiz'd
by a violent and continual Feaver, of which
he died in a few days afte; having before
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57677:11"/>
his death appointed his younger Brother
<hi>Peter,</hi> begotten by ſecond Adventure, his
Succeſſour, as judging his own Brother
<hi>Ivan (John)</hi> who was of a weakly Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
uncapable of bearing the Burthen
of ſo Great an Empire.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly <hi>Peter Alexiovitz</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
Czar of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> when he was
ſcarce eleven years of Age. By the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<hi>Sophia,</hi> Daughter of the deceaſed Czar
<hi>Alexis Michaelovitz,</hi> by his firſt Marriage,
being of a very aſpirng Temper, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
diſpoſed to Caballing, could not
brook to ſee her own Brother excluded from
the Succeſſion to the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Throne; for
which Reaſon, ſhe ſet all her Engines at
work, to put the Crown upon her Brother
<hi>Ivan Alexiovitz,</hi> or rather, her own Head.
The better to encompaſs this Deſign, ſhe
took care to have it ſpread abroad, that the
late Czar <hi>Fedor Alexiovitz,</hi> her Brother, had
been poyſoned by the Phyſicians, at the
Inſtigation of ſome of the Chief Men of
the Empire, whoſe Names were induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
publiſhed as the Anchors and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters
of ſo helliſh a Crime. Being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that nothing could ſtrengthen her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
more, than if ſhe, could draw the
<hi>Strelitzes</hi> into her Party; it was rumour'd
abroad, That a Deſign was form'd
againſt them at Court, it being reſolved,
That the Strong Liquor which was to be
given at die Czar's Funeral, ſhould
be mix'd with Poyſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57677:11"/>
This ſucceeded according to the Princeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
Expectation, for the <hi>Strelitzes</hi> being En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by this ſudden and unexpected News,
ran in a moſt Furious manner to the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
where they began the Fray with the
Slaughter of two of the Czar's Phyſicians,
the Chief of whom was a <hi>Jew</hi> by Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
the next were ſome of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Officers of the Crown, ſuch as were
mark'd out by the Princeſs, as being oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to her Intereſt. Their Rage did not
ſtop here, but after they had committed a
thouſand Inſolences and Murthers, they
aſſaulted, and entred the Czar <hi>Peter Alexio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitz's</hi>
Lodgings, where they ſhew many of
his moſt faithful Officers and Friends of
the firſt Quality, in his preſence, and then
proclaimed Prince <hi>Ivan Alexiovitz,</hi> Grand
Czar of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> in conjunction with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Alexiovitz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus a Calm ſucceeded the Storm which
however laſted not long. For the Princeſs
<hi>Sophia,</hi> whoſe Ambition was not ſatisfied
with ſeeing her Brother <hi>Ivan</hi> mounted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Throne, entred into ſecret Cabals
With <hi>Fedor (Theodore) Chikolowitin,</hi> the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the <hi>Strelitzes,</hi> unto whom ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented,
That ſhe only having made uſe
of her Brother, as a Pretext to put the
Crown upon her own Head, ſhe was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to make him her Spouſe, and Aſſociate
in the Empire, if he would join his Power
and Interest with hers; and that it would
be no difficult Matter to compaſs their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Empire being too heavy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57677:12"/>
a Burthen for the Shoulders of two Infants.</p>
                  <p>The General of the <hi>Strelitzes,</hi> not able to
reſiſt ſuch powerful Charms, they left no
ſtone unturn'd to bring their projected Deſign
to maturity, which was to be begun with
the Death of both the Czars, and would in
all humane probability have ſucceed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their wiſh, if the Plot had not
been timely diſcovered to Their Majeſties.</p>
                  <p>The two Czars having all the reaſon in
the World to miſtruſt the <hi>Strelitzes,</hi> retired
thereupon to the Convent of <hi>Troitza,</hi> a
ſtrong and well fortified place, about
twelve Leagues diſtance from the Capital
City of <hi>Muſcow,</hi> where Monſieur <hi>Le Fort</hi>
gave them many ſignal Proofs of his Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and Fidelity. To be ſhort, they drew
the General of the <hi>Strelitzers</hi> into an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh
near <hi>Troitza,</hi> where being taken, he
was carried Priſoner into the Convent, and
had his Head cut off. He was a Perſon of
mean Extraction, who, as he had raiſed
himſelf to that height by his own Valour,
ſo he brought himſelf to a miſerable End
by his Treachery; The Princeſs <hi>Sophia</hi> was
ſhut up in a Convent, where ſhe is very
narrowly watch'd.</p>
                  <p>Quiet being thus recovered in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
by removing the Two Chief
Heads of the Rebellion, theſe Regiments
of the <hi>Strelitzes,</hi> as had ſhew'd themſelves
moſt vigorous againſt the Czars Intereſt,
being divided into many ſmall Bodies, were
ſent into ſeveral parts of the Country un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Guard of ſome other Troops, whoſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57677:12"/>
Officers having received ſecret Inſtructions
to fall upon them at a certain appointed
time, they put their Orders in execution,
with ſo much Exactneſs, that very few eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped
their Hands.</p>
                  <p>It was particularly taken notice of at that
time, and ſook'd upon as a Preſage of the
future Grcatneſs of the preſent Czar <hi>Peter
Alexiovitz,</hi> that, when ſeveral of his neareſt
Friends were maſſacred by the Rebellious
<hi>Strelitzes</hi> in his preſence, he did not ſhew
the leaſt Alteration in his Countenance, which
ſtruck ſuch an Amazement into the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that they durſt not preſume to dethrone
him, but were contented to proclaim his
Brother <hi>Ivan</hi> his Aſſociate in the Empire.
Thoſe who have known his preſent <hi>Czariſh</hi>
Majeſty in his moſt tender Age, do unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
confeſs, That from his very Infancy,
there has been obſerved in him a certain
Greatneſs of Soul, and a piercing Wit,
much above the common Rank. He uſed
to be very ſeldom idle, but always in Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
lively and brisk, and ſhew a great deal
of eagerneſs to be inſtructed in all Matters
of Moment, eſpecially in what had any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Manners and Cuſtoms or fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Nations. He was ſcarce fifteen years
of Age, when he applied himſelf to the
Study of the Mathematicks, his Inclinations
tending more particularly to Navigation,
and other Mcchanick Arts, which he look'd
upon as the moſt Inſtrumental, to promote
theſe Great Deſigns, he has ſince put in
execution with a moſt ſtupendious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and Prudence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57677:13"/>
In the laſt War betwixt the <hi>Turks,</hi> the
<hi>Emperour, Poland</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> the <hi>Czar</hi> was
Engaged in a War againſt the <hi>Chineſes,</hi>
who being, as it was ſuppoſed, encouraged
by ſome Miſſionaries, had upon very frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Pretences attack'd the <hi>Muſcovites;</hi> but
the <hi>Czar</hi> being reſolved not to let ſlip ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
an opportunity to act againſt the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomans,</hi>
in conjunction with the beforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Chriſtian Princes, he choſe rather to
abato ſomething of his Pretenſions to procure
a laſting Peace betwixt him and the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes,</hi>
He had alſo all the Reaſon imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to promiſe himſelf a happy iſſue of
this War on his ſide, the <hi>Turks</hi> being at
that time by their ill Succeſs, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Battels they had in <hi>Hungary;</hi> redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to ſo low a condition, that they were
not in a capacity to make any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
reſiſtance; and he look'd upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of <hi>Aſoph</hi> as a thing of ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
to the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Empire, that it
ought to be attempted at any rate, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſince the Fortifications of that place
were in ſo different a Condition, as to give
him no ſmall hopes of ſucceeding in this
Enterprize</p>
                  <p>Beſides, this, the <hi>Czar</hi> was induced by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
motive, which as it was nearer home, ſo he
look'd upon it as the moſt preſſing in relation
to his own Perſon. He had as yet in freſh me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
the rebellious inclinations of his Guards
he <hi>Strelitzes</hi> and did not queſtion, but that by
this War he ſhould find means to rid himſelf of
them, or at leaſt to repreſs their Inſolence,
by augmenting the number of foreign Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57677:13"/>
well qualified and exerciſed in the
Military Art, whoſe Fortunes depending abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
on him, he might intirely be aſſured
of their Service and Fidelity. Accordingly it
was reſolved to make conſiderable new Levies
to be commanded by foreign Officers whoſe
number was augmented to eight thouſand;
and the Troops under their Command being
in ſome time after, brought by their care
under a very regular Diſcpline in the
year 1695. The City of <hi>Aſoph</hi> and <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſikermeen</hi>
were both beſieged the ſame time,
to render the relief of <hi>Aſoph</hi> the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to the Enemy, this being the place
Chiefly aimed at by the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Geographers do moſt commonly fix
the ſcituation of <hi>Aſoph</hi> to the North of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Tanais</hi> on the ſide of the <hi>Crim Tartary,</hi>
whereas its true ſcituation is to the <hi>South,</hi> on
the ſide of <hi>Circaſſia,</hi> upon a riſing ground ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
near the <hi>Palus Moetis.</hi> Neither is this
City built upon an Iſland, as it is repreſented
in ſome Maps, neither are any other Iſlands
to be ſeen thereabouts, either near the
mouth of the River, or in the <hi>Palus Moetis</hi>
it ſelf, as it is likewiſe expreſſed in theſe
Maps, unleſs it be one very ſmall Iſle
which lies at the very mouth of the River
<hi>Tanais</hi> (now a-days called the <hi>Don</hi>) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the North-weſt, very near the
Coaſtt.</p>
                  <p>About two Leagues above this Fortreſs,
the River <hi>Tanais</hi> emits a branch which
runs towards the North, in the form of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57677:14"/>
a Semy-circle before it enters the <hi>Palus
Moetis,</hi> but it is both very narrow and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
A good way, beyond this, a little above
the Town, iſſues forth another Branch,
which ruuning likewiſe to the North in
the form, approaching, to a Semy-circle,
divides it ſelf into five other Branches, juſt
before it diſembogues into the Sea. But
this Branch is alſo of a very ſlender depth,
and the Ground thereabouts, through which
thoſe ſeveral Channels paſs, very low
and Marſhy, ſo, that at high Water when
the Wind blows ſtrong from the South,
which drives the Waters from the black
Sea, upon that Coaſt, all the Country here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts
lies under Water.</p>
                  <p>You will, I ſuppoſe, be not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed,
when I tell you, that the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
in their Maps put <hi>Aſoph</hi> under the
47th degree of Northern Latitude, and ſo
do likewiſe the <hi>Turks;</hi> whereas in our
Map; we find it under the 51 degree, or
thereabouts. But, what deſerves our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
obſervation is, That, our Maps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
exactly with theirs in the ſcituation
of that part of the Country where the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais</hi>
or <hi>Don,</hi> approaches neareſt to the River
<hi>Wolga,</hi> which both they and we put under
the 49th Degree. I can only thus much
aſſure you, that, the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who are
generally taken for very ignorant and unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd,
have compoſed the moſt exacteſt
Maps of their own Country in the World, I
having ſeen ſome of them my ſelf; and that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57677:14"/>
they exclaim againſt ours, as very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in this point.</p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Aſoph</hi> was formerly no more
than a ſmall Place, fortified only with
one ſingle Wall, after a very irregular
manner; its Form approaching to a <hi>Hexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi>
two of its oppoſite ſides lying near pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
with the River, ſurrounded with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Towers, after the ancient Faſhion. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the middle of that ſide which is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> there was a very large
Tower of a conſiderable heighth, round at
the bottom, running up like a Pyramid, but
flat on the top; within the body of the
Place there was another Retrenchment,
which ſupplied the place of a Cittadel, and
was provided always with a good Garriſon.
The <hi>Turks</hi> afterwards ſurrounded the whole
with new Fortifications of Earth, compos'd
of our large and high Baſtions, but not very
regular, yet is the Ditch both very broad and
deep. Two of theſe Baſtions towards the <hi>South-Eaſt</hi>
Side lie pretty cloſe to one another,
for the better defence of the place, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the nearneſs of ſeveral Hills, which
elſe would command the Town. The third
Baſtion to the <hi>South-Weſt,</hi> is at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from the other two, and the fourth
Baſtion towards the <hi>Weſt</hi> is yet further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from the third. The Courtin betwixt
theſt two laſt Baſtions has in the midſt an
Obtuſe. Angle; the like has alſo the Courtin
towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> which, runs down to the
River; and on the River ſide it is very
well provided with ſtrong Palliſadoes.</p>

                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:57677:15"/>
Beſides this, they had built a little above the
Place two ſtrong Towers of brick-work, and
of a quadrangular figure, one on each ſide
of the River, provided with good ſtore of
Cannon, by which means, and a very ſtrong
Chain, they prevented the <hi>Donaick Coſacks</hi>
from paſſing that way to the black Sea, who
formerly uſed to take the advantage of the
darkneſs of the Night, when they went a
Pyrating upon, the <hi>Turks.</hi> This was the
condition of <hi>Aſoph,</hi> when the <hi>Muſcovites</hi>
firſt laid ſiege to it, in the Year 1695.</p>
                  <p>It may well ſeem ſtrange, that the <hi>Turks</hi>
ſhould either ſo little underſtand the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the Scituation of this Important
Place, or elſe be ſo negligent in providing for
its Security, as not to take away all Hopes
from the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> of ſucceeding in this
Enterpriſe. In my Opinion, it was not
only their higheſt Intereſt to have ſecured
a Place of ſo much Conſequence againſt
any Attempt of this nature, by rendring it
Impregnable, but alſo to have as much as
poſſibly they could, extend their Conqueſts
on that ſide, by making themſelves Maſters
of the Country betwixt the Rivers <hi>Don</hi>
and <hi>Wolga,</hi> which thereabouts approach
within ſeven Leagues diſtance to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Beſides which, there are two other
Rivers betwixt the <hi>Don</hi> and the <hi>Wolga,</hi> one
of which coming from the <hi>North Eaſt,</hi>
is pretty large, and diſcharges it ſelf into
the River <hi>Don.</hi> The other much leſſer co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from the <hi>South Weſt,</hi> diſembogues into
the <hi>Wolga.</hi> Theſe two Rivers carry their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57677:15"/>
Currents within one League and an half
diſtance. Theſe two Rivers, are inviſible
in our. Maps, in lieu of which they have
obtruded upon us a ſuppoſitious River, called
<hi>Camus,</hi> which is not to be found therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts.
The Ground betwixt theſe two
Rivers is very convenient for Building of
Forts and Fortifications, there being but a
few ſmall Rocks, which may be made
paſſable, and convenient enough for ſuch
an Undertaking.</p>
                  <p>The Turks ſhewed themſelves but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Politicians, and who had but a ſlender
inſight in matters of this nature, when
they let ſlip ſo favourable an Opportunity
of extending their Conqueſts on that ſide
during the Inteſtine Troubles, which har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed,
and almoſt deſtroyed the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tovite</hi>
Empire in our Age, at the ſame
time that the <hi>Ottomans</hi> were in a moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
Condition. If they at that time had
joined theſe two Rivers by a Canal, and
ſtrengthened the ſame with ſome Forts; or
if they had built but one conſiderable Fortreſs
upon the River <hi>Wolga,</hi> the whole Kingdom
of <hi>Aſtracan</hi> muſt of neceſſity have fall'n into
their Hands, by which means it would have
been no difficult task for them to render
themſelves Maſters of the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Lake, or
Sea, which is the Inlett into the Heart of
<hi>Perſia,</hi> and at no great diſtance from the
<hi>Indies,</hi> Subject to the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> and for
the reſt it is ſurrounded by a great number of
Petty <hi>Tartarian</hi> Princes, who might either
have been eaſily Conquered, or at leaſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57677:16"/>
brought over to their Party to make
them instrumental in the Conqueſt of
<hi>Aſia,</hi> What would in ſuch a Caſe have
become, of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who would
have been continually allarm'd, and
harraſſed on all ſides by an infinite
number of <hi>Tartars,</hi> by thoſe of the <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mea,</hi>
of <hi>Circaſſa, Bulgaria,</hi> by the <hi>Calmuck</hi>
and <hi>Mogul Tartars,</hi> who like a Torrent
would have over-run this vaſt Empire, and
would have rendred the Conqueſt of all the
Circumjacent Countries as cheap and eaſie
to the <hi>Turks,</hi> as theſe Vagabonds formerly
did, when they took up Arms under thoſe
Renown'd Heroes, <hi>Ginghis Khan,</hi> and <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
Lenek.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These, are two things which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the <hi>Turks</hi> from making uſe of that
critical Juncture to their Advantage. The
firſt was, that they look'd upon the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi>
as too inconſiderable to ſtand ever
in Competition with them, ſeeing they had
not Courage enough to accept of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
of <hi>Aſoph</hi> from the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> who had
taken it by Surpriſe. The ſecond was, That
the were not ſo fully ſatisfied of the
Conſequence and uſe of a good Naval
Strength, by which means they might
moſt conveniently have enlarged their
Dominions on that ſide, and carried the
terror of their Arms not only along the
<hi>Wolga,</hi> but alſo by the way of the <hi>Caſpian</hi>
Sea into the very heart of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Bat to return to the Siege of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoph.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:57677:16"/>
The <hi>Turks</hi> had provided the City of
<hi>Aſoph</hi> with great Stores of Ammunition
and Proviſion, and all other things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for a long and vigorous Defence,
the Garriſon conſiſting of ten Thouſand
choſen <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars;</hi> notwithſtanding
which, the preſent <hi>Czar Peter Atexiovitz,</hi>
reſolved to beſiege it in Perſon. His Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
conſiſted of one Hundred Thouſand
Foot, and twenty Thouſand Horſe, all
choſen Troops, arid among them the
whole Body of his Guards, or <hi>Strelitzes,</hi>
commanded under the <hi>Czar,</hi> by a great
many good and Experienced Generals.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt they were buſy in perſecting the
Lines of Circnmvallation, and Contravalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and carrying on the Trenchcs, the <hi>Czar</hi>
ordered a ſmal1 Fort of four Baſtions to be
made at ſome diſtance above the two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovementioned
brick Towers on the <hi>South</hi>
ſide of the River, upon a piece of Ground
that lies betwixt, and is encompaſſed by
two ſmall branches which ſpring out of
that River, and re-unite themſelves about
half ways diſtance betwixt theſe Towers
and the City. All the Communication
being cut oft betwixt the Place and the
Towers by theſe two branches, it was
hot long before the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Maſters of them, and it, being judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
moſt expedient to Fortifie that, on the
<hi>South</hi> ſide of the River, it was immediately
put in Execution accordingly, by ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it with three good Baſtions, and an
Angle on each of the Courtins on the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57677:17"/>
River ſide. The Fort was called <hi>Calanſa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean while the Trenches were
carried on with the utmoſt Expedition and
Vigour, eſpecially on the <hi>South Eaſt</hi> ſide of
the Place, where the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to the top of the Hills, which in
ſome meaſure command the Town, they
Fired moſt furiouſly out of their Cannon,
and threw a prodigious number of
Bombs into the Place, by which means
they hop'd ſoon to terrifie the Garriſon to
come to a Capitulation; but thoſe within
conſiſting of old and well Diſciplin'd
Troops, who were not to be vanquiſh'd at
a diſtance, the Trenches were carried on to
the body of the Place, but not without
great Slaughter on the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> ſide; the
Enemies by their frequent and vigorous
Sallies diſputing every Inch of Ground
with the utmoſt bravery. The <hi>Muſcovites</hi>
were likewiſe couragiouſly repulſed in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Attacks before they could lodge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon one of the baſtions, where the
Garriſon, like deſperate Men, fell upon
them with ſuch an incredible Fury, that
the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> after a moſt obſtinate Defence,
were forced to quit it at laſt, with the loſs
of a great number of their Men, eſpecially
of the <hi>Strelitzes,</hi> who, as they were moſt
expoſed, ſo they bore moſt commonly the
greateſt Share in the loſs, the <hi>Czar</hi> making
uſe of this Opportunity, both to try their
Valour, and rid his Hands of them in a
handſome way; though at the ſame time
it muſt be confeſs'd to his Immortal Glory,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57677:17"/>
that he was not ſparing of his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but expoſed himſelf to the Enemies
Fire as well in the ſeveral Attacks
that were made, as upon other occaſions,
having had ſeveral Perſons ſlain by his ſide
in the Sallies made by the Beſieged. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Reſolution of the Garriſon thus
protracting the Siege beyond all Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> began to be in want
both of Ammunition and Proviſions, which,
together with the approaching cold and
wet Seaſon, obliged them to change the
Siege into a Blockade.</p>
                  <p>But the Diſgrace received before <hi>Aſoph,</hi>
was in ſome meaſure recompenſed by the
Conqueſt of <hi>Kaſiker meen,</hi> a <hi>Tartarian</hi> City
Scituated on the <hi>South</hi> ſide of the River
<hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> about two Leagues diſtance
from the <hi>Black-Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is encompaſſed by four ſtrong brick
Forts of a quadrangular Figure, and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
bigneſs, adjoining to one another.
Three of them lye upon a ſtrait Line, but
the Fourth makes up a right Angle with
the Second. The firſt of theſe Quadrangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Forts lies upon the very Bank of the
River <hi>Boriſhenes,</hi> being Flancked with
ſeveral good Towers as well as the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which are upon the ſame Line. But
the fourth exceeds the three others in
Strength, being on one ſide provided, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of Towers, with two large, and high
Baſtions, ſurrounded with a good Ditch.</p>
                  <p>Juſt oppoſite to the place you ſee a
ſmall Iſland in the River <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57677:18"/>
in form, a Neats Tongue, called
in their Language <hi>Towan.</hi> Upon this Iſland
the <hi>Tartars</hi> had erected two Forts of four
Baſtions each, which on the upper end of
the Iſland was called <hi>Momberethkermenn;</hi>
as the other on the lower part was named
<hi>Muftritkermeen;</hi> on the oppoſite ſide of the
River belonging to the <hi>Crim Tartars,</hi> there
was alſo another Fort in all reſpects like to
the other two, juſt over againſt <hi>Momba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethkermeen,</hi>
upon the Bank of the before
mentioned River <hi>Boriſthenes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Army of his <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty was
chiefly compos'd of <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> inhabiting
thoſe parts, and who ſome years before had
ſubmitted to the <hi>Czar's</hi> Obedience. To
facilitate the Siege of <hi>Kaſikermeen,</hi> it was
reſolv'd to Attack firſt the ſaid Forts, which
being done, accordingly they were ſoon ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the brave <hi>Coſſacks</hi> who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after laid Siege to the Place it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The train Attack was carried on againſt
the Fort with the two baſtions, the Ground
thereabouts being moſt proper for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on of the Trenches, which were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
with ſo much Expedition, that in
a ſhort time they carried in by Aſſault. The
Enemies however got time to retreat into
the other Forts, where having beat a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
it was agreed that they ſhould March
out of the Place with their Arms and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:57677:18"/>
The <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Army on that ſide was
commanded by the General <hi>Czeremetoff,</hi>
who having contrary to the Capitulation,
connived at ſome diſorders committed by
the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> againſt the Garriſon; his <hi>Czariſh</hi>
Majeſty was ſo much diſſatisfied at it, that
he ſhewed his Reſentment in very hard
Terms to the General. He, who did not
expect ſuch a Reprimand, deſired thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
leave from the <hi>Czar</hi> to lay down his
Commiſſion, which being readily granted
him likewiſe beyond his expectation, he, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
repented atleiſure. The better to divert
himſelf in this Melancholly Diſpoſition, he
reſolved to Travel in Forreign Countries,
and you are not ignorant, how he viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
moſt of the Courts of <hi>Italy,</hi> and had the
Curioſity to go to the Iſle of <hi>Maltha,</hi>
where, as well as in all other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
thro which he Travelled, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
with all imaginable Reſpect due to
his Birth and Merits.</p>
                  <p>The ſucceeding Winter was chiefly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up with vaſt Preparations for the next
enſuing Campaign, which being to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
with the Siege of <hi>Aſoph,</hi> great ſtores
of Ammunition, Bombs, and Proviſions
were got in readineſs for that Enterpriſe
to prevent the <hi>Turks</hi> from ſending any
Relief by Sea; many Gallies and Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines
were order'd to be built near the City of
<hi>Muſcow,</hi> but eſpecilly at <hi>Veranowitz,</hi> a City
Scituate on the River. <hi>Don,</hi> about a Hundred
Leagues diſtant from the Capital City. But
what is moſt remarkable is that the <hi>Czar Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:57677:19"/>
having a particular curioſity to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at the building of ſome of the biggeſt
Gallies, he cauſed them to be ſet upon the
Stock, in the River <hi>Ocea,</hi> at ſome ſmall
diſtance from the City of <hi>Muſcow,</hi> they
being from thence to be Tranſported to
<hi>Veranowitz,</hi> by Land, were ſo artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
contrived, that they might be taken
to pieces without much trouble, and ſo be
joined together again at <hi>Veranomitz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To be ſhort, by the great Vigilancy of
his <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty, all things were got
in ſuch forwardneſs, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wanting to put the projected Deſign
in Execution.</p>
                  <p>'Tis to be obſerv'd that the City of <hi>Aſoph</hi>
had been kept block'd up during the
whole Winter, and that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi>
having maintain'd their Poſt all this while
upon the abovementioned Hills, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlook
the Place, they had been ſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
in guarding all the Avenues, that
the Beſieged had not receiv'd the leaſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of Men, or Proviſions. To cut off all
further hopes of Succours, it was reſolved
to open the Campaign very early in the
Spring, for which purpoſe all the Troops
deſign'd for this Expedition, were order'd
to March to their Rendezvous, and from
thence ſtrait to the Siege of <hi>Aſoph,</hi> which
was begun by throwing a moſt prodigious
quantity of Bombs into the place, with
ſuch extraordinary Succeſs, that the whole
Body of the city was reduced to Aſhes,
and Rubbiſh, and the old Fortifications to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57677:19"/>
one large Stone heap, ſo that there was
ſcarce a place left for the Garriſon to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
themſelves againſt the fury of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Cannon and Bombs, all being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
even to the deepeſt Vaults and
Caves.</p>
                  <p>Beſides which, the Number of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
was reduced to leſs than two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Men capable of bearing of Arms,
both by the furious Attacks made upon
the place in the laſt years Siege, and the
continual firing from the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> Great
Artillery, and throwing in of Bombs; in
this; not withſtanding which, they were
deaf to any propoſals of a ſurrender,
living in hopes of the promiſed Succours.</p>
                  <p>At laſt it appeared, to their great Joy
and Satisfaction, conſiſting of twelve Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
a great number of Saiques laden with
Proviſions and Ammunition, and a good
number of freſh Troops, beſides fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Ducats, to be diſtributed among thoſe
brave Fellows that had ſo Valiantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
their Poſt.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty having before-hand
received Intelligence of the approach of
this Succours, had cauſed ſeven of his
largeſt Gallies, of a hundred foot length
each, beſides ſeveral leſſer, and a great
number of Brigantines to paſs that ſmall
branch of the <hi>Don,</hi> which iſſues forth a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
above the Town As the Water is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſhallow in this Channel, ſo it was not
without a great deal of difficulty, that the
largeſt Gallies could be brought along that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57677:20"/>
way, and would in all likelihood have
ſcarce ſucceeded, if the <hi>Czar</hi> by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
and Encouragement had not anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Workmen to ſurpaſs all Difficulties,
which at laſt they did, to the no ſmall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment
of the beſieged.</p>
                  <p>This Obſtacle being happily ſurrnounted,
his Czariſh Majeſty judged it of very great
conſequence for his purpoſe to plant good
Store of Cannon upon the little Iſland we
have mentioned before, becauſe the Shoar
being very low, the Cannon-ball would
ſtrike even with the ſurface of the Water;
beſides, that the greateſt part of the Iſle
being covered with Wood, did prevent the
Enemy from diſcovering the Deſign.</p>
                  <p>The ſame favourable diſpoſition of this
Iſland furniſhed the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> with an
Opportunity of putting ſome of their
lighteſt Gallies and Brigantines for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
behind the Iſle, unperceiv'd by the
Enemy, whom, they intended thus to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
both in Front and Flank, as they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by that way, which ſucceeded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Expectation.</p>
                  <p>For, all theſe Precautions having been
taken before the Enemies Fleet came in
ſight, ſome of the biggeſt <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
with many Brigantines were ſent out
to meet them, making a Show, as if they
intended to Engage the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet;
but no ſooner were they come within Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
Shot of one another, but the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
feigning to dread the <hi>Ottomaa</hi> Fleet,
ſuperior in Number to them, made a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57677:20"/>
Fight, making the beſt of their way
towards the Shoar, and poſted themſelves
below the Iſland. The <hi>Turks</hi> perceiving
the Enemy to fly before them, and not in
the leaſt forewarn'd of the red that laid
behind the Iſland, thought themſelves, by
the ſmall number of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
that appear'd in ſight, aſſur'd of the
Victory.</p>
                  <p>Fluſh'd with theſe hopes, they made all
the Sail they could to fall in among the
<hi>Muſcovites,</hi> but no ſooner were they come
within reach of the Cannon from the Iſle,
but they receiv'd ſuch a warm Salute from
thence, that they ſaw their Gallies torn to
pieces on all ſides by the Enemies Cannon,
in an inſant, with a great Slaughter of
many of their Men. Bur this was
only the fore-runner of what was to
enſue.</p>
                  <p>For his <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty, who had a
watchful eye on all ſides, and who was
ſometimes upon the Iſle, ſometimes on
board the Fleet of Reſerve, that lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
having ſoon obſerved the Conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the <hi>Turks</hi> were put in by this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Salute, and willing to improve their
Confuſion to his Advantage, got on board
in Perſon one of the lighteſt Gallies, Man'd
only with forty Men, giving the Signal
for the reſt to follow him with all the Oars
they could. Thus the Enemy found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſurrounded on all ſides by the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>
who attack'd them with great bravery;
the <hi>Czar</hi> himſelf boarding the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57677:21"/>
and being ſucceſsfully, ſeconded by
the reſt, the Victory was almoſt as ſoon
completed as begun, the <hi>Turks</hi> being routed
ſo entirely, that not one Gally eſcaped,
but what was either ſunk or taken; and it
muſt be confeſs'd, That the <hi>Czar</hi> ſhew'd
ſo much Conduct during the whole Action,
that no more could have been expected
from the Prudence and Valour of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Captain of our time.</p>
                  <p>So compleat a Victory ſoon decided the
Deſtiny of <hi>Aſoph,</hi> for the Garriſon, who
had been Spectators of their Loſs, being
now bereav'd of all Hopes of Succours,
demanded a capitulation. In confederation
very honourable of their bravery, they had
Conditions granted them, it being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in one of the Articles, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their, marching put of the Place, they
ſhould ſurrender to the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Officer, who had deſearted his <hi>Czariſh</hi>
Majeſty's Service, and diſcovercd what
he knew concerning his Deſigns to the
Enemy. The <hi>Czar</hi> to recompence the
Sea-Officers and others on board his Fleet
for their laſt Service, and to give them
ſome marks of his Liberality, ordered
the Fifty Thouſand Ducats, taken
oil board the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Admiral, to be
diſtributed among them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſoph</hi> was no ſooner ſurrendred, but
the <hi>Czar</hi> made it appear to all the World,
that he was ſufficiently ſenſible of what
Conſequence the Conqueſt of this Place
was to his Affairs. For, the firſt thing he
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57677:21"/>
did, was to give his Orders for the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Fortifications, and bringing them
with all poſſible Speed, to a ſtate of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
and not content with this, he
cauſed the Ancient Walls within the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications,
for the moſt part rain'd by
the Bombs, to be entirely raſed, and in
lieu thereof, the Foundation was laid of
a new City, td extend to the Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
made of Earth.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe were likewiſe conſiderably aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by the Addition of two new
Baſtions in the ſame places where we
mentioned before the two obtuſe Angles
to have been. All the ancient Baſtions
were enlarged, and made regular, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our modern Rules of Fortification;
each of them being ſtrengthened by a
Half-Moon. The Ditch was defended by
a good Counterſcarp, with a cover'd
way, from whence was carried a Line
up to the top of the Hill, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looks
the Town, where a goodly Fore
was erected (or the Defence of the Line,
and to keep a Communication with the
Place.</p>
                  <p>All theſe Precautions, though very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
in themſelves, yet were thought
inſufficient in reſpect of the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty's Deſign, who
was reſolv'd to render <hi>Aſoph</hi> impregnable;
as being the main Frontier place on that
ſide of the Empire. Purſuant to this
Deſign, the Foundation was laid of a new
Fortreſs, juſt oppoſite to <hi>Aſop,</hi> in the marſhy
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57677:22"/>
Grounds, which was to have a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
with that City by a bridge of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Arches to be built over the Marſhes.
This Deſign, of which I have ſeen the
Model, was ſoon put in Execution, the
City which was to be put in the Center of
the place being called <hi>St. Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The whole Body of the Fortifications
conſiſted of ſix Baſtions, the two firſt
facing the River ſide, with a Half-Moon
betwixt them. The other two Baſtions
lying on each ſide are at a ſmall diſtance
from the others; but the two oppoſite to
the <hi>North,</hi> lye at a much greater diſtance,
defended by three Half-Moons The
whole is ſurrounded with a double Ditch,
and a cover'd way. The Ground upon
winch this Fortreſs was built, is raiſed to
that heighth, as to command <hi>Aſoph,</hi> and
when the Wind blows from the <hi>South,</hi>
the Marſhes round about the Fortreſs are
all under Water, ſo that there is but one
way to approach it to wit, by the Bridge.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Fortifications would have been
more than ſufficient, if His Majeſty had
had no other deſign than to defend his Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
to bridle the <hi>trim Tartars,</hi> and to keep
the neighbouruing <hi>Coſacks</hi> inhabiting the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
near the <hi>Don,</hi> in awe, but this Monarch
had matters of greater Conſequnce in view,
which he knew would in a little time
redound to the great benefit of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
His deſign was to make uſe of this
place to ſerve for the conveniency of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down the River the Commodities of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57677:22"/>
the product of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> into the <hi>Palus
Maeotis,</hi> and to tranſport them by the
way of <hi>Caffa,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> into
<hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He wiſely foreſaw that by this means he
might introduce, and ſettle Navigation in
his Dominions, to the great encreaſe of the
Wealth of his Subjects, who thereby
would be uſed to the Sea, ſo that in time
they might render themſelves redoubtable
to their Enemies. But to bring this great
and noble Deſign to Perfection, it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
neceſſary to put the <hi>Muſcovite</hi>
Fleet into ſuch a Condition, as to be able
to coop with the <hi>Turks</hi> in the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> and
to render themſelves ſo formidable, that
the Enemies might be obliged at the next
Peace to allow them a free Commerce, and
the Liberty of their Ports upon thoſe
Coaſts, and of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>By the reſtoring, and ſtrengthning the
Fortifications of <hi>Aſoph,</hi> and laying the
Foundation of the new Fortreſs of St.
<hi>Peter,</hi> the preſent <hi>Czar</hi> had in view three
great Points, each of which, as it tended to
the great benefit of the Empire, ſo it was
ſufficient to Eternalize his Memory.</p>
                  <p>The firſt was the making of a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and ſafe Harbour, capable to contain
a great Fleet.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, the joining of the two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
the <hi>Wolga,</hi> and <hi>Don,</hi> by a Canal, fit
to carry Ships of a great bulk.</p>
                  <p>And Laſtly, the building, and equipping
of fourſcore Men of War, as well Frigats
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57677:23"/>
as Gallies, with a hundred and fifty Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,
to make Head againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they ſhould attempt to diſpute with
him the free Commerce at Sea.</p>
                  <p>It was found quite impracticable to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Aſoph</hi> a good Port; for, tho' the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Don</hi> is the moſt proper in the World
for Shipping betwixt <hi>Veranowitz</hi> and <hi>Aſoph,</hi>
as being very deep, without any Iſlands,
and its Current very ſmooth, being not
interrupted by any Sands; but the Mouth.
of this River is ſo full of Shelves, and
choak'd up with Sands, that at Ebb-Tide
there is not above ſeven Foot Water, ſo
that thoſe Geographers who have deſcrib'd
us the Entrance of this River as very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
and one of the moil famous Ports,
have impoſed their own Inventions upon
the World for Truth.</p>
                  <p>It was for this reaſon His <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty
ordered the Coaſt thereabouts to be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
being willing to find out a convenient
Place to make a Port of, as near as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
could be to the City of <hi>Aſoph.</hi> When
the <hi>Turks</hi> formerly uſed to ſend any Ships
of a conſiderable burthen to that Town,
they were, obliged to unload near the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of the River <hi>Mious,</hi> in the <hi>Crim
Tartary,</hi> about five and twenty Leagues
diſtancc from <hi>Aſoph,</hi> where at Low Water,
it is at leaſt fifteen or ſixteen Foot
deep.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mauſcovites</hi> ſounding along the ſame
Coaſt, came to a certain Cape at about ſeven
Leagues diſteance from the <hi>Don,</hi> where, at
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57677:23"/>
an Ebb Tide there was twelve Foot, Water.
The Coaſt was hereabouts very high, and
ſteep, the Ground Sandy, but ſo hard
that it reſembled both in Subſtance and
Hardneſs a Free-Stone. To the <hi>Eaſt</hi> of the
Cape there was a ſmall Bay, and at about
a Leagues diſtance from thence to the
Weſt there was a ſmall River, whoſe Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
turn'd in form of a Half-Moon, round
that Point of the Land. The Shoar
from the bay was of an eaſie Aſcent.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Czar</hi> having been exactly informed
Concerning the convenient Scituation of this
Place, order'd a Fort of Five baſtions to
be erected, and a City to be built ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
below it, likewiſe defended by a good
Fortification, betwixt vvhich and the Bay
there was a Plain, through vvhich vvas to
be cut the great Channel, which was to
diſſembogue near the Point, of the Land,
into the Sea; and in the midſt of this,
there vvas to iſſue another leſs Channel
tovvards the Bay, for the conveniency, of
Veſſels of leſs burthen. I have ſeen the
Model of the vvhole Deſign. The Port
is to be, Three Thouſand Seven Hundred
and Fifty Foot long, and half as
broad.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Conjunction of the
Rivers, <hi>Wolga</hi> and <hi>Don,</hi> vve have already
mentioned before the advantageous Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the, Grounds betwixt the tvvo Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and the condition of the tvvo leſſer
ones, which come within a much nearer
diſtance of one another, ſo that the whole
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57677:24"/>
deſign being founded upon very good
Grounds, it will ſucceed in all Probability. For
it is propoſed to ſtop the Waters of theſe
two leſſer Rivers, which are to be join'd
in the Grand Canal by many Sluices, to
bring them to ſuch a heighth as ſha11 be
judged ſufficient for the paſſage of Ships of
a considerable burthen; there are daily
above tvventy Thouſand Men Employed to
dig the Ground, beſides others who are
to bring the vvhole to Perfection.</p>
                  <p>As to vvhat relates to the third part to
wit, his Navy, it muſt be confeſſed that the
<hi>Czar</hi> made uſe in this Point of all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
and Prudence that could be e expected
from the molſt refin'd Politician. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
immoveable in his Reſolution of rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his Hands of the <hi>Strelitzes,</hi> that uſed
to ſtand under the Command of the beſt
of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Nobility, he judged not
vvithout Reaſon that at this Juncture
he could not pitch upon a more ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and more glorious Expedient than
this, to Employ them in the Service of their
Country, and at the ſame time to take
away from them all opportunities of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Revolts, Purſuant to this Reſolution;
he iſſued his Declaration, wherein he told
them that the Preſent State of Affairs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch, as required the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
formidable at Sea, and he being
fully convinced, both of their Valour, and
Fidelity, he wiſhed nothing more at this
time, than to ſee them apply themſelves
to the Knowledge of Maritime Affairs,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57677:24"/>
to qualifie themſelves for the beſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
at Sea. That for this purpoſe he
had taken all imaginable care to provide
a ſufficient. number of Sea Officers, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for their Skill in Maritime Affairs,
and the managing of Sea Engagements,
under whoſe Conduct they might be
trained up in this Art, and fitted for the
higheſt Commands. That he being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to try the Foundation of the
preſent Glory of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Monarchy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
its Naval Strength, and rendring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
redoubtable at Sea, would head them
in Perſon, and ſhew them by his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
what Footſteps to tread in. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it was reſolved, that each Subject, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to his Ability, ſhould contribute to
the Equipping, and maintenance of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
number of Men of War, the chief Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Empire, being like wiſe obliged to
bear a proportion in this Tax, By this
means His Majeſty Equipped a good Fleet
without the leaſt impairing his ordinary
Revenue, and engaged at the ſame time
the Nobility, and chief Men in the Cities
to take. Cognizance of Maritime Affairs,
to render themſelves capable of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Service,
which they were to look upon
for the future, as the main and moſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Eſtabliſhment of the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſeveral Projects were no ſooner
ſet on foot with the utmoſt Expedition,
by the moſt admirable Vigilancy, and
indefatigable Care of the <hi>Czar,</hi> put towards
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57677:25"/>
                     <hi>Autumn,</hi> he ſet out on his Journey in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to his return to the Capital City of
<hi>Muſcow,</hi> leaving a great body of his
Troops under the Command of the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſſimo</hi>
of his Armies, the Prince <hi>Alekis
Simoniwitz Schein,</hi> near <hi>Aſoph,</hi> to cover
the Workmen that were Employed in
bringing the Works projected thereabouts
to Perfection. At his Arrival in the City
of <hi>Muſcow,</hi> he was received with all the
Demonſtrations of Honour due to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
Marching along the Streets to the
Cattle in Triumph, with a great many Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots
loaden with the Spoils of the Enemy,
and Priſoners, before him. Among the
reſt was to be ſeen the Officer, who having
Deſerted the <hi>Czar's</hi> Service, was ſurrender'd
to the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> purſuant to the Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
before <hi>Aſoph;</hi> had his Hands tied
behind him, and was ſoon after Executed,
as a Terrour to others. It is paſt Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
with what loud and joyful Acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
this publick Entry was Solemnized by
the People, who flocked thither from all
Parts to adorn the Triumph of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
Prince. Great were the Rejoicings
that were made that Night all over the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but the beſt was reſerved till the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
when a moſt Glorious Firework was
let off upon the Ice.</p>
                  <p>The whole was compoſed of ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
Machines, incloſed in a double Square,
ſurrounded with Rockets of all ſorts and
Sizes, which took up a great ſpace upon
the Ice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:57677:25"/>
His <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty took a particular
Delight to be among the Engineers, and
had himſelf a Hand in making the greateſt
Machine, which was erected in the very
Center of the reſt. It was a double Spread
Eagle, who with his left Paw darted Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
upon an Horrizontal Line at one of the
Horns of a Half-Moon, which ſuccecded
according to Wiſh the Fireworks conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
all the Night long, the whole Deſign
of it being laid by His Majeſty himſelf,
and drawn with his own Hand, which he
did me the Honour to ſhew me in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding that the whole Empire
ſeem'd to take Share in the Glorious Conqueſt
of their Prince, and that nothing but Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and Rejoicings were to be ſeen in all
Parts, during the whole Winter; there
remained nevertheleſs, a certain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented.
Party among the Nobility,
who being encouraged by the ſecret Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals
of the Princeſs <hi>Sophia;</hi> found means,
in ſpight of her Confinement, to keep an
underhand Correſpondence with her, for
the promoting their Deſigns againſt the
<hi>Czar's</hi> Perſon. They were ſo well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for the Undertaking of any Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
of this Nature, that there wanted but
little Fuel to kindle the Flame; They
Could not brook the Loſs of their belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Strelitzes,</hi> whom they had always
looked upon as the Chief Supporters
of, their Authority; which at laſt made
them conceive ſo implacable a Hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57677:26"/>
the Czar, that they entred into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy
againſt his Life. To put their Deſign
in execution, they had brought over to
their Party four Captains of the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of the <hi>Strelitzes;</hi> but the difficulty
was, in what manner the Attempt was to
be made For they look'd upon it as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable,
to declare openly againſt a
Prince, who, beſides that he was much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
by the People, had at his devotion
a good Number or the beſt Troops, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by foreign Officers, who were
quartered in and about the City of <hi>Muſcow,</hi>
and ready upon all Occasions to ſacrifice
their Lives for His Majeſty. It was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
among them, That the Czar was
uſed to go ſometimes abroad with very
ſlender Attendance, and to appear in the
Streets of <hi>Muſcow</hi> without any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Retinue; this was alſo look'd upon as
too dangerous, conſidering the general Love
the People bore to his Perſon.</p>
                  <p>After many Debates, it was at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
That conſidering that Czar, who
takes ſhare in every thing that concerns his
Subjects Welfare, was wont to appear in
Perſon, in caſe of any Accident of Fire,
which frequently happens, and makes a
moſt terrible Havock in the City of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow,</hi>
where moſt of the Houſe are of
Wood; they look'd upon this as the moſt
proper Opportunity to encompaſs their
Deſign; wherefore it was concluded to ſet
Fire to ſome Houſes in the night-time,
when they did not queſtion to draw the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57677:26"/>
Czar thither, and during the Confuſion,
to find means to Aſſaſſinate him. The
next thing to be done was, (according to
their own Confeſſion) to have joyn'd the
<hi>Donaick Coſſacks</hi> with their Party, to have
releaſed the Princeſs <hi>Sophia</hi> from her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement,
recall'd Prince <hi>Waſſily Galizin</hi> out
of <hi>Siberia,</hi> and ſurrendred the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Govevernment into their hands,
who were alſo to reſtore the <hi>Strelitzes</hi> to
their antient Station.</p>
                  <p>But it pleaſed Heaven to touch the hearts
of two of theſe four Captains, that
were Engaged in this Conſpiracy; their
Names were <hi>Largon Giliſarof</hi> and <hi>Gregory
Sileri,</hi> who being ſtruck with Remorſe at
the penetrating of ſo deteſtable a Fact, did
throw themſelves at His Majeſty's feet, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly
confeſſing their Crimes, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
their Accomplices, that very day
preceding the Night which this Tragedy was
to be acted.</p>
                  <p>It was on the 1ſt day of <hi>February,</hi> in
the year 1697, when His Majeſty was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
concerning this Conſpiracy formed
againſt his Life, at the Houſe of General
<hi>Le Fort,</hi> where he happened to dine that
Day, He appear'd very little mov'd at
ſo ſurpriſing a piece of News, but, without
any Change in his Countenance, aroſe from
the Table, and being followed only by a
few Perſons, in whom he confided moſt,
he went directly to the Houſe of the Chief
of the Conſpirators, whoſe Name was <hi>John
Sickler,</hi> and elevated by the Czar to the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57677:27"/>
Dignity of a Councellour of State. When
His Majeſty came to the Houſe of this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Wretch, he commanded the reſt to
remain without doors; He himſelf entred
only with three Gentlemen more, and
pretending he had occaſion to ask his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in ſome Matter of Moment, ordered
he ſhould follow him; But no ſooner was
he come into the Street but he was ſeiz'd,
and immediately carried to Priſon, as were
likewiſe five more that were his Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices
in the Conſpiracy; to wit, The <hi>Boyar
Alexis Sekouin, Fedor Puskin,</hi> Son of the
<hi>Boyar, Matfe Puſkin,</hi> two Captains of the
<hi>Strelitzes,</hi> and a <hi>Donaick Coſſack.</hi> They all
confeſs'd their Crimes, and being condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all the <hi>Boyars,</hi> were executed on
the fifth day of <hi>March,</hi> in the Year 1697,
in the Great Market-place, before the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.
Firſt, their Arms and Legs were cut
off, then they had their Heads ſevered from
their Bodies. Their Heads were fixed on
the top of a Stone Column, erected for
that purpoſe, and their Arms and Legs
ſtruck upon Iron-bars round about it; the
Trunks of their dead Carcaſſes were left
in the Market-place for eight days after;
till the Scent became ſo nauſeous to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
that, they were forced to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
from thence.</p>
                  <p>It having by Confeſſion of ſome of the
Conſpirators been made apparent, That the
<hi>Boyar, Ivan Miloſlaski</hi> was the Chief Head of
the Rebellion which hapned in the year
1682, immediately after preſent Czar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57677:27"/>
Majeſty's Acceſſion to the Crown, his Body
Was diſinterr'd, which being found very
near intire, without any conſiderable decay
(tho' it had lain under ground near twelve
Years,) ſeveral Gibbets were erected, on
which were hung the Quarters of his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs,
which were torn to pieces in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
by the enraged Multitude.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſeveral In-lets contrived and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on againſt his Czariſh Majeſty's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Life, are ſo many inſtances, to
convince the World, how dangerous it is
for a Prince to change the antient form of
a Government, it being unqueſtionable,
that thereby he muſt needs draw upon
himſelf the implacable Hatred of that
Party, who arc Sufferers by that Change.
But it muſt alſo be confeſs'd, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more glorious for a Prince,
than to promote the publick Welfare, at
the peril of his own Life; which may
without the leaſt Contradiction to truth,
be applyed to the preſent Czar <hi>Peter A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexiovitz,</hi>
who had no other Aim in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
the antient eſtabliſh'd Guards of
the <hi>Strelitzes,</hi> from their Station, than
the publick Tranquility; knowing this
arrogant and violent body of Troops, to
have been the Source of the many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts
and Troubles, that have haraſſed the
<hi>Ruſſian</hi> Empire in our Age.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty was graciouſly pleaſed to
pardon ſuch of the Conſpirators, as were
not ſo deeply engaged in the Deſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his Life, being now reſolved to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57677:28"/>
begin his Journey into <hi>Germany,</hi> with all
imaginable Expedition. It is to be taken
Notice of, That this Prince had for a
conſiderable time before premeditated this
Journey, but had only ſuſpended his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
till he ſaw the Succeſs of the
Siege of <hi>Aſoph,</hi> not queſtioning but that
he ſhould then be for ſome time upon
the defenſive, till the beforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Fortifications, and other Works,
which he had projected, could be brought
to perfection.</p>
                  <p>He was ſufficiently ſentible, That, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering,
the preſent State of his Empire
was founded, upon the ſervice of his fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Officers, and a good Naval ſtrength,
whereby he might appear formidable in
the black Sea, nothing could conduce
more towards the prompting and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſo great a Deſign, than, if he ſhould
go hi perſon to viſit ſome of the Courts
of <hi>Europe,</hi> and eſpecially to make ſome
conſiderable ſtay in <hi>Holland.</hi> But, as
if was abſolutely neceſſary to appear with
a moſt ſplendid Equipage and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
beſitting the Greatneſs of ſo Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
a Prince, if he would be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in theſe Parts through which he was
to paſs for the Grand Czar of <hi>Muſcovy;</hi>
and as he wiſely foreſaw that his Rank
would not be a great Obſtacle to his
Deſign, which was to ſee and penetrate
by degrees in ſuch Matters, as he was
deſirous to be informed of himſelf, ſo
he judged it moſt convenient for his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57677:28"/>
preſent Purpoſe, to go in the Quality of
a private Gentleman, under the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of that moſt ſolemn Embaſſy, which
he then reſolved to ſend, and has ſince
appear'd with ſo much ſplendor in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Courts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Purſuant to this Reſolution, he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for his Ambaſſadours, My Lord <hi>Le
Fort,</hi> General of His Majeſty's Armies,
and of the firſt Regiments or his Guards,
Admiral of his Fleet, and Viceroy of
<hi>Alovogorod.</hi> My Lord <hi>Fedor Alexiovitz,
Gollanin,</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Siberia,</hi> and My
Lord <hi>Procofet Bodgnanovitz, Wolnitzin,</hi>
Lord high Chancellor of the Empire.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty by giving the firſt Rank
in this Embaſſy to the General <hi>Le Fort,</hi>
gave the moſt ample Demonſtration that
could be, in what Eſteem the ſaid Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
was with him, in conſideration of
his paſs'd Great and Signal Services;
and to let the World know, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences
he was ready to beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all (the Foreigners) that deſerved well of
him, ſince from a ſimple Captain, he was
mounted in a ſhort time, to the higheſt
Dignities in the Empire, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the difference of his Religion.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Ambaſſadour, is likewiſe
a perſon of Great Wiſdom, and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
parts, well verſed in publick Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations,
having been ſent twice by the
Czar as his Ambaſſadour Extraordinary
into <hi>China;</hi> and it was he that Concluded
the laſt Peace betwixt <hi>Muſcovy</hi> and that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57677:29"/>
Empire, He is in great Eſteem with
the Grind Czar.</p>
                  <p>The third Ambaſſadour has been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
employed with good Succeſs in
thoſe Tranſactions the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> have
been engaged in with the <hi>Ottoman Port.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Czar, before his departure out of
<hi>Muſcovy,</hi> found means under a plauſible
pretext, to ſend abroad ſuch as lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the leaſt Suſpicion of raiſing any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances
in his Abſence. It is to be
obſerved, that for ſeveral years before the
Czar had ſent many of his Subjects, of
all Sorts and Qualities, in whom he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
ſome extraordinary Qualifications,
a travelling in foreign Parts at his Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
the better to inſtruſt themſelves in
ſeveral Arts and Sciences, and to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
themſelves for the Service of their
Country, after their return. He made
uſe of the ſelf-ſame pretext to rid his
hands at this time, of thoſe whom he
ſuſpected to be againſt his Intereſt, and
inclinable to foment any ill Deſigns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, in his Abſence; For ſome of
them were ſent abroad a travelling in
far diſtant Countries, before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the others who lay under more Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion
than the reſt, were ordered to
follow the Embaſſy.</p>
                  <p>The Adminiſtration of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
during his Majeſties Abſence, was
committed to the Care of the three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>Loſſ Kerilvitz. Alariskin, Procorofskoi,</hi>
and <hi>Boris Alexiorvit Gallizin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:57677:29"/>
The firſt is Uncle to His preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
being the Brother of the Empreſs
<hi>Dowager,</hi> his Mother. He is Chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of State.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is the Lord Treaſurer of
the Empire, a perſon advanced in years
and much eſteemed for his great Ability.</p>
                  <p>The third is his Majeſty's Favourite,
being likewiſe Miniſter of State, beſides
many other places, which arc of a great
yearly Value to him. He is a Nephew
of the unfortunate Prince <hi>Waſſily Gallizin,</hi>
Chief Miniſter of State, but ſince baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into <hi>Siberia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Majeſty gave them moſt particular
Charge of the Prince his only Son, being then
ſcarce nine years of Age; This young
Prince is of a very vigorous Conſtitution,
Robuſt, Tall, and well Shaped, having
a great reſemblance, as well in his Face
as his Natural diſpoſition, to the Czar his
Father.</p>
                  <p>General <hi>Gourdon</hi> had orders to Encamp
with twenty Thouſand of the beſt Troops
near the City of <hi>Muſcow,</hi> to keep a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
eye, and to be in readineſs upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
occaſion, that ſhould offer. This Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
is a <hi>Scotchman</hi> by Extraction, who
entred into, the Service of the Czar <hi>Alexis
Michaelovitz,</hi> his preſent Czariſh Majeſty's
Farther. He has given eminent Proofs of
his Valour and Ability upon ſeveral Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
which has deſervedly acquired
him the Eſteem both of his Czariſh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and the whole <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Nation,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57677:30"/>
notwithſtanding he is a Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
                  <p>Things being thus diſpoſed, His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
left the City of <hi>Muſcow, Incognito,</hi>
with his Ambaſſadours, who were attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a moſt numerous and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Train. They took the way of <hi>Pleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow,</hi>
paſſed through the Frontiers of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonia,
Courland</hi> and <hi>Samegitia,</hi> and ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
ſafely at <hi>Coningsbergh,</hi> the Capital
City of the <hi>Ducal Pruſſta,</hi> where they were
received with a great deal of Splendor
by his Electoral Highneſs of <hi>Brandenbyrgh.</hi>
In this City, his Czariſh Majeſty receiv'd
the Poſt-news, by a Meſſenger ſent
for that purpoſe, That the Elector of
<hi>Saxony</hi> was elected King of <hi>Poland;</hi> and,
that the Cardinal Primat, had proteſted
againſt the ſaid Election, under pretext,
That die Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> was legally
choſen. Upon which, immediate orders
were diſpatched to the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour,
then reſiding in <hi>Poland,</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Rights of Election made to the
Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and to aſſure him, in
behalf of his Czariſh Majeſty, That he had
ſixty thouſand Men in readineſs, at his
Service, in order to maintain his juſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
to the Crown of <hi>Poland;</hi> and, That
orders were already ſent into <hi>Muſcovy,</hi>
for the Troops to advance from <hi>Smolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sko,</hi>
towards the Frontiers of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that Great Dutchy in his <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Devotion. It is without all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
the fear of ſo Powerful an Aſſiſtance,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57677:30"/>
had no ſmall Influence over many of the
<hi>Poles,</hi> in the contrary Intereſt; it being
moſt evident, that when the Prince of
<hi>Conti</hi> appear'd in perſon near <hi>Dantzick,</hi>
thoſe of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> though not averſe to
that Prince's Intereſt, durſt not declare
for him.</p>
                  <p>After ſome ſtay at <hi>Coningsbergh,</hi> his
Czariſh Majeſty continued his Journey
towards <hi>Berlix,</hi> the Ordinary Reſidence
of his Electoral Highneſs of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi>
where he was received with all the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
demonſtrations of Honour and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
due to a Prince of ſo Eminent a
Rank. It is moſt certain, That the Grand
Czar was ſo well ſatisfied with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
here, and with the Great Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
he diſcovered in his preſent
Electoral Highneſs, That he has declared
ſeveral times ſince, that as ſoon as the
young Prince his Son ſhould be fit to
Travel, he would ſend him to the Court,
of <hi>Berlix,</hi> to tarry there for ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Time.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner had their High and Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſes,
the States General of the United
Provinces received advice, that this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Embaſſy was on their way towards
their Frontiers, but they ſent ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties,
who were to receive their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
in the name of the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
upon the Frontiers; and orders
were given not only to defray them at the
Charge of the State, but to welcome
them with conſiderable Preſents, and by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57677:31"/>
the diſcharge of the great Cannon of all
the great Towns through which they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
their High and Mightineſſes being
willing upon ſo extaordinary an Occaſion,
to eternalize the Memory of the Honour,
they were going to receive by ſo ſolemn
an Embaſſy, the moſt glorious that ever
was ſeen; in reſpect of Perſonal Apppear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of ſo great a Monarch, with whom
they were Engaged in a moſt ſtrict Tye
of Friendſhip and Commerce. After
they had travelled ſome Leagues in the
Territories of the United Provinces, his
Czariſh Majeſty left the Embaſſy, that
he might with the more ſpeed reach
the City of <hi>Amſteldam;</hi> and that by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
thus in Diſguiſe, he might with
the more freedom, and unperceived, take
a view of every thing he thought worth
his Curioſity. Accordingly he came to
<hi>Amſteldam,</hi> accompanied only by two or
three Gentlemen, ſo diſguiſed, as not to
be known by any body, where he lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
at a Common-Inn for one night on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
The next day he went to <hi>Sordam,</hi> a
large Town on the oppoſite ſide of the
River of <hi>Amſteldam,</hi> and about two Leagues
diſtant, this place being moſt famous
for the great number of Ship-Wrights
and others, who are there employed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
in building of Ships.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty immediately after his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
there, took up with a private lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
at a <hi>Burgher</hi>'s Houſe, which lay much
out of the way, his aim being to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57677:31"/>
from being diſcovered, as much as
Poſſible could be. His Chief and firſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polyment
in this place, was to inform
himſelf in perſon from the Work-mens
own Mouths, and to be an Eye-witneſs
in what manner they built their Ships;
He bought a ſmall Yacht of about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
five or thirty Foot long, which he
took a particular Pleaſure to ſteer
himſelf, and to Sail in the Company on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of thoſe three Gentlemen, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
him up and down the River of
<hi>Amſteldam</hi> (called the <hi>Tey</hi>) where his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
delight was, to make his own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
and to feed his eyes with that
moſt beautiful Proſpect of that vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Ships, which not unlike a Forreſt,
lie cloſe together in the Road of that
City.</p>
                  <p>But it was not many days before he
was robbed of the Satisfaction of paſſing
away his time thus undiſcovered. For a
certain Lock-Smith, who had lived a few
years before in the City of <hi>Muſcow,</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
to take particular. Notice of
him one day, as he paſſed by, knew him
firſt; and having told ſome of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades,
the inhabitant flock'd in ſuch Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
about him, when he appear'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
that being tired with the Crowd,
he reſolved to leave <hi>Sordam,</hi> ſooner than
he intended at firſt.</p>
                  <p>This News being come to Ears of
the Merchants of <hi>Amſteldam,</hi> Trading to
<hi>Muſcovy,</hi> ſome of whom had the Honour
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57677:32"/>
to know His Majeſty, they immediately
went in a Body to pay him all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Reſpeſt, and to pray him to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
them with his Preſence in the City
of <hi>Amſteldam;</hi> where he arrived from <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
ſome days before the Ambaſſadours,
who had received Orders to tarry for ſome
time there, before they went to the <hi>Hague,</hi>
in order to be Admitted to the publick
Audience of Their High and Mightineſſes.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while the Magiſtrates of
<hi>Amſteldam</hi> took effectual Care to provide
every thing for the Magnificent Reception
of the ſaid Embaſſy, great ſtore of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
being planted upon the Baſtions, facing
the River <hi>Amſtell,</hi> which way the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours
were to come. All the young
Men of the City mounted on Horſeback,
with very ſplendid Equipages and thoſe
of the beſt Rank and Quality, went to
meet him in their Coaches. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
deputed ſome of their Members
to Compliment Their Excellencies at
their Landing, which was about a quarter
of a League without the City, whither
they were conducted in the Yatchs of the
State, and received with a Diſcharge of
all the Cannon round the Ramparts.</p>
                  <p>The three Ambaſſadours wire conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Deputies into the Coach of one
of the Chief Magiſtrates of the City; the
Deputies took their Places in the ſecond,
and the reſt of the Coaches were taken up
by the Gentlemen of the Embaſſy, among
whom, as it was reported, was His Czar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57677:32"/>
Majeſty. But firſt of all, rid the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned
Gentlemen on Horſeback,
who leading the Van, were followed by
the Trumpets of the State, and theſe by
ſome <hi>Tartars,</hi> Armed with Bows, and
ſome <hi>Muſcovites</hi> on Horſeback. After theſe
marched on foot twenty Pages belonging
to Their Excellencies the Ambaſſadours,
very richly Clad, their Coats being of
Scarlet Cloth, covered all over with very
rich Gold and Silver Galloons. Theſe
went immediately before the Coach, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſat the three Ambaſſadours, Guarded
on each ſide by twelve Tall and luſty
Fellows, Cloath'd in a <hi>Slavonian</hi> Dreſs, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
each a Silver Ax in their hands, and
Cimmetars with Silver Hilts on their Sides.
They had red Cloaks over their <hi>Caſſacques,</hi>
trimm'd on both ſides with large Silver
Buttons, and large Plated Loops; all which
together, made a very Glorious and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Show. Theſe Coaches were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by a great many Footmen, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
clad in red Scarlet Cloath, trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with Silver Galloons. His Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
the General <hi>Le Fort,</hi> appeared that day
in an <hi>Europian</hi> Habit, and the other two
Ambaſſadours, in a Muſcovite Dreſs, but
their Apparel was extreamly Rich. Thus
they paſſed in very good order through
the Chiefeſt Streets of <hi>Amſteldam,</hi> to the
Lodgings prepared for them, where ſtood
a Company of City Trained-bands in
Arms, to render their Reception the more
Magnificent; All the Streets through which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57677:33"/>
they paſſed, were crowded with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number of People, who were flock'd
to the City to be Spectators of the moſt
ſolemn Entrance that had been ſeen there
for many years before; and for ſeveral
days after, their Excellencies were trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with all the magnificence imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
at the Charge of the City of
<hi>Amſteldam;</hi> all which, though it amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a conſiderable Summ, nevertheleſs
the Magiſtrates being willing upon this
Occaſion to give the moſt ample
Demonſtrations that poſſible could be, of
their Eſteem and Reſpect for His Czariſh
Majeſty's perſon, cauſed a great Fire-Work
to be prepared, repreſenting a Triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al-Arch,
in Honour of his Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>It was erected upon the River <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtel</hi>
(which had communicated, its Name
to the Famous City of <hi>Amſteldam</hi>) in a
place where it might be ſeen at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
being of great height, and having
four Fronts alike to the four principal Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the World; the whole Fabrick being
of the <hi>Corinthian Order,</hi> adorned with the
Arms of His Czariſh Majeſty, with Tritons,
Veſſels, and many other Embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The whole Machine was built
upon many Flat-bottom'd Veſſels, join'd
cloſe together, which being covered
all over with a Linnen Painted Cloth, the
bottom upon which the Fabrick was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
repreſented at a diſtance, a ſmall Iſland.</p>
                  <p>This Fire-work being too remote from
their Excellencies Lodgings, to be ſeen
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57677:33"/>
there in its full Perfection, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
intreated them to go with them
to a noted Tavern of <hi>Amſteldam,</hi> called
the <hi>Doclan,</hi> where they had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of being Spectators of the Succeſs
of the Fire-works, to their entire Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and were regaled with a moſt
magnificent Collation. His Majeſty being
graciouſly pleaſed to appear in perſon at
this Feaſt; it was then the firſt time,
that I had the opportunity of taking a
full view of him, as well as others, at
leiſure. He is a very Tall and Luſty
Perſon, Well ſet, with very good Features
in his Face, and, though there is a great
deal Vivacity in his Eyes, (which are
Black and Sprightly) as well as Activity
in his whole Air, he has certain Marks
of a Sweet Diſpoſition in his Phyſiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
He is very affable in Converſation,
giving frequent opportunities to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with any thing that is Curious.</p>
                  <p>Some Hours after it was Dark, the
Fire-works began to Play, with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Succeſs, to the Admiration of all
the Spectators in General, and His Czar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Majeſty in partiulcar, who could not
ſufficicntly ſpeak praiſe in of it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
publickly the Satisfaction he had
taken in the whole Entertainment. The
Concourſe of People was ſo. great at this
publick Rejoycing, that by the Throng,
ſome of the Iron Rails of the Bridge of
the <hi>Amſtel</hi> being broke down, a great
many of thoſe upon the Bridge, fell into
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57677:34"/>
to the River, ſome of whom were drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the reſt narrowly eſcaping with Life,
by the help of ſome Boats that were near at
hand.</p>
                  <p>But the Deputies of the Admiralty of
<hi>Amſteldam,</hi> bring ſenſible that they could
give no greater ſatisfaction to the <hi>Czar,</hi>
than in what related to the knowledge of
Naval Affairs, took effectual care to ſhew
his Majeſty all their Store-Houſes, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Building and Equipping of their
Men of War.</p>
                  <p>I have it from good Hands, that theſe
Gentlemen who were deputed to attend
him thither, were extremely ſurpriſed to
ſee him with ſo much eagerneſs enquire
after every thing, that had the leaſt rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to theſe Affairs, and with how much
Skill and Judgment he would talk and argue
concerning theſe Matters, into which (as
they were perſwaded before) he had but a
ſlender Inſight.</p>
                  <p>Some Days after, his Majeſty took a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> where he had an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
with his <hi>Britanick</hi> Majeſty; this being
the firſt time theſe two Great Princes, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
for their Virtue and Bravery, met.
They Diſcourſed for ſeveral Hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and parted from one another with all
the marks of a mutual high Eſteem.</p>
                  <p>The Ambaſſadors ſtay'd near two Months
at <hi>Amſteldam,</hi> before they went to the
<hi>Hague,</hi> in order to their Audience: For
his <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty being reſolv'd that they
ſhould make their Appearance there with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57677:34"/>
all the Splendor imaginable, Order'd that
the Number of their Domeſticks ſhould
be conſiderably augmented, that they
ſhould be all new Cloathed, and Richer
than before. They had alſo an addition
to their Equipage three of the richeſt Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
that could be made, with ſo many Sets
of very fine Horſes.</p>
                  <p>Every thing being got ready for their
Departure to the <hi>Hague,</hi> they ſet out on
their Journey, carrying along with them
good ſtore of Sables and other rich Furs,
to be Preſented to their High and Mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
from the <hi>Czar</hi> their Maſter, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant
to the Cuſtom of moſt Eaſtern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Their Excellencies were receiv'd at the
<hi>Hague,</hi> with all the marks of Honour and
Reſpect due to their High Character, and
the Day for their publick Audience being
appointed, his <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty followed
in Perſon in Diſguiſe, wearing a plain
blew Coat, a large white Perriwig, and
white Feather; and being perfectly well
acquainted both with the Perſon, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Merits of the Sieur <hi>Witſen</hi> (who
is this Year Burgo-Maſter of <hi>Amſteldam</hi>)
he borrowed his Coach, and deſired him to
accompany him thither, Which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
with ſo much dexterity and ſecrecy
by the ſaid Sieur <hi>de Witſen,</hi> that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
was not diſcover'd by any body li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:57677:35"/>
It was in the Month of <hi>September</hi> of the
laſt Year, when there was the greateſt
ſhow of Forreign Ambaſſadors, that ever
was ſeen at the <hi>Hague,</hi> occaſion'd by the
Negotiation of Peace at <hi>Reſwick,</hi> whither
moſt Courts of <hi>Europe</hi> had ſent their Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries,
who all ſtriving to outview
one another in Magnificence, it was no
eaſie matter to add any thing to the Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of their Equipages: Yet his <hi>Czariſh</hi>
Majeſty being ſenſible that the Eyes of the
World, would in a moſt peculiar manner
be fixed upon his Embaſſy; and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
by a moſt commendable Emulation;
to maintain upon this, as well as all other
occaſions the Glory and Luſtre of his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Station in the World, as claiming the
Title of an Emperor, and bearing the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Arms, he was fully reſolv'd that
this moſt Solemn Embaſſy, honour'd by his
Preſence, ſhould bear the marks of, and be
anſwerable to his Grandeur.</p>
                  <p>In effect, according to the Teſtimony of
all that were Spectators of this Solemn Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
every thing was manag'd with ſo
much Order, Majeſty and Gravity, and
with ſo much Magnificence, that nothing
could be added to the Luſtre of this Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
which in all Reſpects was ſuitable to
his Majeſty's Deſign and Grandeur.</p>
                  <p>It is confeſs'd by all hands, that never
any Ambaſſador appear'd in a more Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
Attire, than the General <hi>le Fort,</hi> the
firſt Ambaſſador did that Day; he was
Clad after the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Faſhion, in a long
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57677:35"/>
Robe of Cloth of Gold, Lin'd with the
moſt precious Sables that ever were ſeen.
This Robe, as well as the Veſt which he
wore under it, was cover'd before with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amonds
of an ineſtimable Value, and upon
his Bonnet there appear'd a large Jewel of
Diamonds in the ſhape of a Herns Feather,
with ſuch luſtre as dazled the Eyes of the
Beholders: He harangued their High and
Mightineſſes id the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Tongue, with
an Air altogether Majeſtick, ſuitable to the
Character he bore upon ſo Solemn an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
The two other Ambaſſadors, who
appear'd likewiſe in very Rich Apparel,
made alſo their Compliments to their High
and Mightineſſes with a Majeſtick Gravity:
But that which added the greateſt Luſtre to
this Audience, was, that all the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
of moſt Princes in <hi>Europe,</hi> honour'd
theſe Men with their Preſence, and his
<hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty had the ſatisfaction to be
an Eye Witneſs of all what paſſed, from a
Cloſet which had a Window opening into
the Audience Room, without being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by any body, and returned the next
day privately to <hi>Amſteldam,</hi> extreamly
well pleaſed with his Journey. Neither did
their Excellencies make any long ſtay at
the <hi>Hague,</hi> they having no other Matters to
propoſe to the States, but the confirmation
of former Treaties.</p>
                  <p>It is agreed on all hands, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Motive of this <hi>Embaſſy</hi> was, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſpecious Pretence of this Publick
Solemnity, the <hi>Czar</hi> might with the more
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57677:36"/>
conveniency paſs <hi>Incognito,</hi> through ſuch
Places as he intended to viſit; his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
aim in reſpect to his Journey into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
being to have the opportunity of
being undiſcover'd at <hi>Amſteldam,</hi> to take,
with the more conveniency a full view of
ſuch Matters as related to Maritime Affairs,
and without any diſturbance, to take Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
fit for the Sea-Service into his Pay, and
at the ſame time to ſupply himſelf with
ſuch Neceſſaries, as was requiſite for the
carrying on his Grand Deſign.</p>
                  <p>This ſufficiently appear'd after his return
from the <hi>Hague,</hi> by his Requeſt to the
Magiſtrates of <hi>Amſteldam,</hi> to wit, to chuſe
private Lodgings for himſelf, and a few
Gentlemen of his Retinue at one end of
the City. It muſt be confeſs'd the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
were but very indifferent, in reſpect of
the Quality of the Perſon that was to Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
them; but in regard of their Situation,
they were in all Points agreeable to his
Majeſty's Intention, they being juſt adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Houſe, which lying
near a convenient Road for Ships, there
was the moſt agreeable proſpect that could
be to the Water-ſide, of all what paſſed to
or from <hi>Amſteldam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No ſooner hail his Majeſty taken poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of theſe ſmall Lodgings, but he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
all his Thoughts to the knowledge of
two Things: The firſt was to be Inſtructed
in all Particulars; which had any relation
to the Building and Equipping of Ships:
The ſecond, to learn the manner of Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barding
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57677:36"/>
Places by Sea, which being a thing
he was deſirous to be inform'd of, he ſpar'd
no pains to attain to. But as his Genius
was always bent to the Mathematicks, and
as he had been Inſtructed moſt particularly
in the Mechanick part of it, which contains
the Fundamental Principles of both: It was
yet long before he made himſelf Maſter of
theſe Myſterious Arts; eſpecially, ſince his
deſire was ſuch, as not to reſt ſatisfy'd
with being a looker on, but would lay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a hand to the Work ſometimes, with a
great deal of Pleaſure, and finiſh a piece
with his own Hands, which he did with ſo
much dexterity, that one would have
ſwore he had been accuſtomed long ago, to
handle the Axe and the Hammer. I have
my ſelf ſeen two pieces of his own Handy-Work;
one was a ſmall Frigat of three or
four Foot long, the other a little Wind-Mill.</p>
                  <p>What elſe can be gathered from all this,
but that his Conduct in relation to theſe
Matters, is founded upon moſt profound
Reaſons of State? It ſeems evident to me,
that the ſole motive of it, is the Glory
and Greatneſs of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Monarchy;
and that by the eagerneſs he ſhews upon
this occaſion, of advancing the Naval
Strength of his Empire, he intends to give
the moſt evident demonſtratons he is able,
(to his Nobility and People) that on its due
Eſtabliſhment, depends the chief Welfare
of the Realm; and that by diveſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
thus of his Royal Dignity for a time,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57677:37"/>
and applying himſelf in Perſon to the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Ships, he intends to ſerve for an
Example to invite them to follow his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps.
He is too ſenſible that the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
are naturally inclin'd to Pride and
Lazineſs, and he look'd upon it as the beſt
means to correct thoſe Vices in them, and
hinder their further progreſs among them,
if he by his own Example did encourage
them to Labour and Induſtry.</p>
                  <p>At his ſpare Hours, his greateſt delight
uſed
to be, to take a view Of any thing that
was curious, or worth his obſervation in
private Perſons Houſes, where he lay'd hold
of all opportunities, to enter into a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Diſcourſe with them, in ſo obliging a
manner, that the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
taken with familiar Converſation,
were charm'd with his franck Behaviour;
which had this effect upon them, that it is
almoſt incredible, how many voluntarily
offer'd themſelves to ſerve him; I having
been an Eye-witneſs my ſelf, that a great
number of able and well deſerving Perſons
could Hot be admitted into the Service, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the intended Levies were compleated
in much leſs time than was expected.</p>
                  <p>Not long after the Ambaſſadors return
from the <hi>Hague,</hi> his Majeſty receiv'd an
Expreſs from <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> with the agreeable
News of a Battle, fought betwixt the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi>
under the Command of the Prince
<hi>Schein;</hi> and the <hi>Tartars</hi> near <hi>Aſoph.</hi> The
<hi>Cham</hi> of the <hi>Crim Tartary,</hi> had in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Spring, cauſed a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57677:37"/>
of <hi>Crim Tartars</hi> to paſs in many ſmall
Bodies, and at different times thro' <hi>Caffa,</hi>
in order to join them with the <hi>Tartars</hi> of
<hi>Circaſſia;</hi> and eſpecially thoſe Inhabiting
near the River <hi>Cubance.</hi> Knowing that the
<hi>Muſcovite</hi> Army was divided into Vſeveral
Bodies, the better to cover the Workmen,
that were employed in ſeveral Places, in
compleating the before-mentioned Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
he look'd upon this as a fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to ſurpriſe them unawares: For
which purpoſe, he order'd the <hi>Tartars</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by <hi>Sultan Galga,</hi> to advance with
great and ſpeedy Marches toward the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
But the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> General <hi>Schein,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received Intelligence of their approach,
had juſt ſo much leiſure given him, as to
draw together his Troops in an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
place, where he reſolv'd to engage
the Enemy. Theſe perceiving themſelves
ſuperiour in number to the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> and
being encourag'd by that pretended fear
of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Army, which did not
move from their Poſt, fell with great fury
upon them, and were received with great
bravery by the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to defend themſelves in their Poſt,
till their General perceiving the firſt heat
of the <hi>Tartars</hi> ſpent, attack'd them very
briskly, put them firſt into Confuſion, and
ſoon after to the Rout, with a great
Slaughter on the Enemies ſide, whom they
purſued to the River <hi>Hagalinek,</hi> where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them were drowned: This River
runs through <hi>Circaſſia,</hi> about two Leagues
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57677:38"/>
diſtant from <hi>Aſoph.</hi> Our Maps put this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to the North on the other ſide of the
River <hi>Don,</hi> above thirty Leagues from
<hi>Aſoph</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their Excellencies the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
made publick Rejoycings upon
this Occaſion, and invited the Magiſtrates
and other Perſons of Quality to a Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
Entertainment, where they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
with Dancing, Muſick, Fireworks,
and all ſorts of other Divertiſement. His
<hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty was pleas'd to appear there
in Perſon, and in ſo pleaſant a Humour,
that all the Gueſs were extreamly ſatisfy'd
with his Goodneſs, and at parting, made all
the moſt ſincere Proteſtations to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
that they ſhould keep in everlaſting
Remembrance, the extraordinary Favour
be had been pleas'd to beſtow upon them,
in honouring them with his Preſence.</p>
                  <p>Towards the beginning of the Winter,
this Victory was Seconded by the News of
another Advantage, obtain a near the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Boryſthenes.</hi> For the <hi>Crim Tartars</hi> in
conjunction with thoſe of <hi>Budziack</hi> and
<hi>Oczakow</hi> having beſieged <hi>Kaſikermeen,</hi> had
carried on their Trenches to the very Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarp,
and at the ſame time made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Maſters of the Adjacent ſmall Iſle of
<hi>Towam.</hi> But a Body of <hi>Muſcovites</hi> having
joined the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> inhabiting thoſe Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
came time enough to the relief of
the Place, forcing the <hi>Tartars</hi> to abandon
the Siege and the Iſle, with a conſiderable
loſs on their ſide. Upon which his Majeſty
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57677:38"/>
gave Orders, that the ſaid Iſland ſhould
be ſtrengthned by ſome regular Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Expreſs brought likewiſe the
News, that the new Harbour about, ſeven
Leagues from <hi>Aſoph,</hi> (of which mention
has been made before) was brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
the Place being already Inhabited
by Ten Thouſand <hi>Mufcovites,</hi> his Majeſty
having expreſly forbidden any Forreign
Nation to ſettle there. He gave the Name
of <hi>Setruchina Tuba</hi> to this City. In a little
time after, Advice was alſo brought his
Majeſty, that a great number of the <hi>Circaſſian Tarltars</hi>
voluntarily ſubmitted to
his Obedience; and thereupon being joined
by ſome <hi>Muscovite</hi> Troops, they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
their Conqueſts into the <hi>Crim Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi>
to the River <hi>Mious,</hi> about five and
twenty Leagues diſtant from <hi>Aſoph,</hi> where
the <hi>Turks</hi> formerly uſed to unload their
Ships bound to that Place; and that the
<hi>Muſcovites</hi> were then buſie in building a
ſtrong Fort near the Mouth of that River,
thereby to make themſelves Maſters of,
and to command that Road.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Czar</hi> having now taken a reſolution
to paſs over into <hi>England,</hi> before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
out of this Country, gave notice
of his Intention to his <hi>Britanick</hi> Majeſty,
who immediately ſent ſome Yachts and
light Friggots to conduct him thither. He
Embark'd with an Attendance only of
Twelve or Fifteen Perſons, ordering his
Ambaſſadors to ſtay behind at <hi>Amſteldam,</hi>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:57677:39"/>
and to buy up good ſtore of Artillery and
Ammunition: And being happily arriv'd
in <hi>England,</hi> he was received there with all
the Honour and Reſpect due to ſo Great a
Prince; His <hi>Britanick</hi> Majeſty offering him
for his Reſidence the Royal Palace, call'd
<hi>Sommerſet-Houſe,</hi> (which is very Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for its pleaſant Scituation on the River
<hi>Thames,</hi>) and a Guard to attend his Perſon;
but the <hi>Czar</hi> perſiſting in his Reſolution
to paſs his time in <hi>England,</hi> Incognito, he
refuſed to accept of the King of <hi>England's</hi>
Offers.</p>
                  <p>After he had received the Compliments
from his Majeſty and the Royal Family,
and return'd the ſame to them, he ſpent
ſome time in taking a view of the Two
Houſes of Parliament, and what elſe was
worth his Obſervation at Court; and then
retir'd at ſome diſtance from the City of
<hi>London.</hi> for the conveniency of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
upon the River, from whence he
might obſerve the Workmen, that were
Employed thereabouts in the building of
Ships. He ſtay'd above Two Months in
<hi>England,</hi> during which time, he Employ'd
moſt of his ſpare Hours, in viewing all
what was Curious or Remarkable, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
among the beſt Artiſts.</p>
                  <p>Some <hi>London</hi> Merchants having propoſed
to his <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty, the Eſtabliſhment
of a new Commerce of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> to be
Tranſported only by them into <hi>Muſcovy,</hi>
and the other Countries under his Majeſty's
Obedience, he ſent for <hi>Fedor Alexiovitz
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57677:39"/>
Gallavin,</hi> his Second Ambaſſador, to Treat
with them concerning this Point at <hi>London;</hi>
The Treaty was brought to a good iſſue, to
the ſatisfaction of both Parties; and it has
been computed, that the <hi>Czar's</hi> Yearly
Cuſtoms ariſing from that Commodity,
will amount to above a Million of <hi>Livres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what is worth our particular Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
in this Voyage into <hi>England,</hi> and
which moſt of all diſcovers the main De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of his <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty, is, his Progreſs
to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> to be a Spectator of a Sea
Engagement betwixt two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons,
near that Port. I had forgot to tell
you before, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> did Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him near <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> with ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mock-ſight, where a great many Yachts
were drawn up in different Lines, to ſhew
to his <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty the manner of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
one another, and Retiring after
an Engagement at Sea.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty having been preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the King of <hi>England,</hi> with a very
fine Yatch, Richly Guilt, carrying Thirty
Pieces of Cannon, and one of the nimbleſt
for Sailing in the whole Kingdom; he
ſent her to <hi>Archangle,</hi> and he himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
notwithſtanding the badneſs of the
Seaſon into, <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean while that their Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
were gone back to the Hague, in Order
to take their Audience of Leave from their
High and Mightineſſes, the Magiſtrates of
<hi>Amſterdam,</hi> being ſenſible, that immediately
after their Return, the <hi>Czar</hi> would ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57677:40"/>
on his Journey to <hi>Vienna,</hi> made
great preparations to ſignalize their Zeal for
His Majeſty by ſome freſh marks of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
But he no ſooner had notice of their
Deſign, but he ſent to deſire them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
being willing to leave their City with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
noiſe, and undiſcover'd, after a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Teſtimonies of their Eſteem and
Friendſhip to his Perſon, received both
from the Magiſtrates and other Inhabitants,
during the Six Months he had ſtay'd among
them.</p>
                  <p>He was juſt upon his departure, when he
was ſurpriſed by the unwelcome News,
that there had been a Mutiny near the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Muſcow,</hi> among ſome Remainders
of the <hi>Strelitzes,</hi> but that General <hi>Gourdon</hi>
had ſoon diſperſed them, and taken moſt
of their Ringleaders Priſoners; who as
they have thereby haſten'd the entire Ruine
of their Party, ſo they have brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to a miſerable End, having received
ſince that time the due Rewards of their
Treachery. For a great Number of them
were Hang'd on Gibbets, and many of the
Nobility had their Heads cut off.</p>
                  <p>You cannot be ignorant of what has
paſſed ſince his <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty's Departure
out of <hi>Holland;</hi> with what Honour and
Reſpect this Great Prince was received at
the Imperial Court of <hi>Vienna;</hi> with what
extraordinary Splendour and Magnificence
his Embaſſy appear'd there; as likewiſe,
what obliged his Majeſty to return on a
ſudden into <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> It is alſo ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57677:40"/>
known to you, that he left <hi>Procofet
Bogdanovitz Wolnizin,</hi> as his Ambaſſadour
and Plenipotentiary for the Negotiation of
Peace to be ſet on foot upon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of <hi>Hungary,</hi> betwixt the Confederate
Princes and the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Port.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty took the way of <hi>Poland</hi> in
his Return homewards, where he had an
Interview, not far from <hi>Lembergh,</hi> with his
preſent <hi>Poliſh</hi> Majeſty, who aſſured him,
That he was reſolved to continue the
War againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> unleſs Peace might
be obtained upon very good Conditions,
and eſpecially by the Surrender of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minieck</hi>
to the <hi>Poles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whatever the iſſue of this Treaty
may be, you will eaſily grant me, if
you will be pleaſed to reflect ſeriouſly
upon what I have told you before, That,
ſuppoſing the Czar of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> ſhould not
be comprehended in the ſaid Peace, he is
alone capable of waging War againſt the
<hi>Turks,</hi> and not without hopes of Succeſs
on his ſide. For his Frontiers being ſo
well provided and ſtrengthned with good
Fortifications on that ſide where the
<hi>Turks</hi> muſt attack him; he has no more
to do, than to be upon the Defenſive by
Land, and in the mean while to attack them
briskly at Sea. And it is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
That this is the Grand Deſign of
this Prince, who ſeems to have taken
ſuch ſure Meaſures in reſpect to the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of his Maritime Affairs, that
there is all the Reaſon in the World to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57677:41"/>
believe, that he will always Triumph
over the <hi>Turks</hi> at Sea, who never did any
thing Memorable in that Se'rvice; and
who according to all outward Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
are leſs in a Condition than ever
to ſignalize themſelves upon the Watery
Element at a time, when their Empire
appears in a declining State.</p>
                  <p>I will leave it to your own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whether it would not ſhake the
very Foundation of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Monarchy,
conſidering its preſent tottering Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> ſhould chaſe the
<hi>Turks</hi> out of the <hi>Black-Sea,</hi> and make
themſelves Maſters of their Ports on theſe
Coaſts, which from the City of <hi>Caffa,</hi> as
far as to the mouth of the <hi>Boryſthenes,</hi>
muſt thereby be expoſed to the Mercy
of the <hi>Muſcovites?</hi> And it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
that <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> it ſelf might
be hardly put to it, or at leaſt run the
Hazzard of being laid in Aſhes by a
Bombardment. What would in ſuch a
caſe, become of the <hi>Crim-Tartary,</hi> which
being already encloſed on all ſides by a
good number of ſtrong Forteſſes, muſt of
neceſſity fall, without making one Blow,
into the hands of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> if all
Commerce and Correſpondence betwixt
the <hi>Peninſula</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſhould be
cut off, by the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> becoming Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the <hi>Black-Sea;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:57677:41"/>
Beſides, it is to be conſidered, that as
Places are attack'd now a-days, they have
only <hi>Precop</hi> and <hi>Caffa,</hi> which are in a
Condition to make ſome ſlender Defence.</p>
                  <p>But, Sir, being unwilling to tire your
Patience with too long a Letter, I will
come to a Concluſion; I muſt only repeat
to you once more, what I have intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before, That it was the greateſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ſight
the <hi>Turks</hi> could be guilty of, not
to take all the imaginable Precautions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> becoming Maſters
of <hi>Aſoph,</hi> who thereby have opened them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the way into the <hi>Black-Sea,</hi> over
which the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire always claim'd
the Sovereignty in a moſt peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
To make ſome Amends for ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable
an Error, the moſt likely
means they have left, ſeems to be, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
an everlaſting Peace with the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi>
thereby to lull them aſleep, that
they may not lay hold of this Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of rendring themſelves redoubtable in
the <hi>Black-Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ottoman</hi> Port might thus reap a
conſiderable Advantage by the Commerce
with <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> by eſtabliſhing certain Duties
to be paid for the paſſage of Ships through
the Channel leading to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in
the ſame manner as it is practiſed in
<hi>Denmark,</hi> where the King of that Name,
receives Cuſtoms of the Ships that paſs
and repaſs the <hi>Sound,</hi> in their going to,
and coming from the <hi>Baltick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:57677:42"/>
This appears to me the only moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
Means, to plunge them out of that
Misfortune which they have drawn upon
themſelves by their own Neglect, it being
allow'd by all that have any inſight into
the preſent State of Affairs in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi>
That the preſent Czar <hi>Peter Alexiovitz,</hi>
has taken a firm Reſolution, not to reſt
ſatisfied, till he has opened this Paſſage
in order to eſtabliſh a free Commerce
with foreign Nations, and to encourage
them to come into his Ports near the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
Meotis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, Sir, is the preſent Condition of
the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Empire, which was formerly
look'd upon as moſt barbarous, but which
now bids fair for the Priority with any in
<hi>Europe,</hi> by reaſon of the Encreaſe of its
Commerce with moſt Nations of the
World, by the indefatigable Vigilancy of
their preſent Monarch, who being ſcarce
28 Years of Age; what is it that may
not be expected from ſo Great a Prince,
if God pleaſes to bleſs him with a long
Life.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Wolga</hi> is above five hundred
Leagues (to reckon from its firſt Spring)
to the Canal, by which it is join'd with the
River <hi>Don,</hi> and this River, from thence
to the City of <hi>Aſoph,</hi> four hundred Leagues
more, fit for Ships of good Burthen,
and from the Canal of Communication
betwixt theſe two noble Rivers, there is
two hundred Leagues diſtance to <hi>Aſoph</hi>
upon a ſtraight Line, all extream good
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57677:42"/>
Grounds; <hi>Aſoph</hi> and <hi>Aſtracan</hi> being ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
under the moſt happy Climate in
the World. The Weſtern ſide of the
River <hi>Wolga</hi> is very well inhabited al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
and there is no great queſtion,
but that the Conveniency of Commerce,
and Plenty of the Country, will ſoon
invite ſome of the Neighbouring vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond
<hi>Tartars</hi> to follow the footſteps of
other more civiliz'd Nations, when once
they are made ſenſible of the Benefit of
an Induſtrious and ſettled Life. This
is ſufficiently verified by the Example of
many of the <hi>Aſiatick Tartars,</hi> who have
by degrees abandoned their vagabond and
idle Life, and follow'd their Prince into
<hi>China,</hi> where they are become Wealthy
by their Traffick; the like may be ſaid
of many of the <hi>Crim-Tartars,</hi> thoſe of
<hi>Aſtracan, Siberia, Dauria,</hi> and other
parts ſubject to the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we caſt our eyes upon that Part of
<hi>Muſcovy,</hi> whereabouts the Port of <hi>Arch-Angel</hi>
is, and conſider, that not above an
Age ago theſe Patts were as little inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as any of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> being low Grounds,
and ſituate under a very cold Climate;
But ſince the Eſtabliſhment of Commerce
in this Harbour, the Country all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts
is very well ſtock'd with Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
and many goodly Towns and
Villages.</p>
                  <p>In the Southern Parts of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> the
Cities of <hi>Wologda, Jereſla, Roſtof, Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaw,</hi>
and others owe all their Encreaſe of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57677:43"/>
Wealth to traffick. Add to this the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of Commerce betwixt the <hi>Indies,
Perſia</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> by the way of the
<hi>Caſpian</hi> Lake or Sea; all which Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
may for the future be tranſported
by the newly projected Canal betwixt
the two Rivers <hi>Wolga</hi> and <hi>Don,</hi> into all
Parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> what immenſe Profit
and Riches muſt not by this means be
conveyed into <hi>Muſcouy!</hi> which being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſo conſiderable for its vaſt Extent

may in all probability thereby become
the moſt Potent and Redoubtable in the

LETTER
FROM
A Perſon of Quality, Reſiding at
VIENNA,
Concerning
The preſent CONDITION
OF THE
Muſcovite EMPIRE.</head>
                  <p>AS the late Journey of the preſent
Czar <hi>Peter Alexiovitz,</hi> has been
for ſome time paſt, the surprize
of all <hi>Europe;</hi> ſo I thought I could not
make you a more Seaſonable Return at
this time, for the Obligation you were
pleaſed to lay upon me ſome Months ago,
in communicating to me your Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning His <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty's Stay
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57677:45"/>
in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> than to inform you
of what has paſt ſince his coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Court, and his Return into <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy;</hi>
of which I have been partly an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs,
the reſt I ſtand indebted for the
Correſpondence of my Friends, upon,
whoſe Integrity and Judgment, I can
fully rely.</p>
                  <p>I will not pretend to inſiſt upon the
Motives which induced the Czar to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in ſo Extraordinary an Undertaking,
it being agreed on all hands, that as his
Deſign was to build the Frame of the
preſent <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Monarchy upon a much
more ſolid Foundation, than it was in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times, ſo he judged nothing could
more conduce to obtain this Great End,
than if he ſhould take this Opportunity,
of being inform'd in Perſon concerning
theſe Maxims, which have rendred ſome
of the <hi>European</hi> States, ſo flouriſhing in
our Age,</p>
                  <p>For, whereas the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Monarchs uſed
to make the Ignorance of their Subjects
the Main Foundation-ſtone of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
ſo it is obvious to every unbyaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Perſon, that his preſent Majeſty looks
upon the Improvements of all Arts and
Sciences, and the Eſtabliſhment of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Diſcipline, as the Main Pillars of
the Greatneſs of this Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>It was in the Proſecution of this Grand
Deſign he appear'd, though <hi>Incognito,</hi> in
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> and after having
ſatisfy'd himſelf in thoſe Matters which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57677:45"/>
were the Chief Subject of his Curioſity,
he reſolved to viſit likewiſe the Imperial
Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> where he arrived with
the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Embaſſy, towards the latter
end of <hi>June</hi> laſt paſt.</p>
                  <p>He had ſcarce been a few days in this
City, when he received Letters from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoph,</hi>
That part of that Garriſon, to the
Number of betwixt ſeven and eight
Thouſand Men, having receiv'd Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
That the <hi>Tartars</hi> had put a great
Number of their beſt Horſes in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumjacent
Paſtures, under the Guard of
three thouſand Men, were marched out
againſt them, had defeated the Guard,
and brought near thirty thouſand Horſes
into <hi>Aſoph.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Letters were in a few olays after
follow'd by an Expreſs from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Muſcovy</hi>
with an Account, That the Remainders
of the antient <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Guards (whom
they call <hi>Strelitzes</hi>) had Mutiny'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Pretence of Want of Pay; and that
being join'd by ſome others, were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
towards <hi>Muſcow,</hi> the Capital City
of the whole Empire, with an Intention
to Surprize and Ranſack the Place. The
<hi>Strelitzes;</hi> who formerly might be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the Janiſaries of the <hi>Turks,</hi> had
given ſuch frequent proofs of their Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity
and Cruelty againſt the Inhabitants
of this City, upon ſuch like Occaſions,
that many of them being terrified by ſo
unexpected a Revolt in the Czar's Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
left their Habitations, and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57677:46"/>
Conſternation had ſeiſed the whole
Empire, as dreading the Effects of the
Fury of theſe Inſolent Soldiers.</p>
                  <p>The Princes <hi>Loff Kerilvitz, Nariskin
Procorofskoi,</hi> and <hi>Boris Alexiovitz Gallizin,</hi>
who had the Supream Adminiſtration of
the Government during the Czar's Abſence,
were not wanting in their Duty, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Inhabitants both by Words,
and their own Example; and that nothing
might be wanting on their ſide, to reduce
this rebellious Crew to their Duty, ſent
ſome of the Nobility, back'd by a good
number of Troops, to endeavour to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
their Fury; but they were ſo far
from hearkning to the Propoſitions offered
them by the Deputies of the Governours,
that they fired at them, and forced them
to retire to the City.</p>
                  <p>Thus all fair means proving ineffectual,
General <hi>Gourdon</hi> was ſent out with a good
Body of faithful Troops, Commanded for
the moſt part by foreign Officers, who
meeting with the Rebels, as they were
advanced within four Leagues of <hi>Muſcow,</hi>
Attack'd, and totally Routed them, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
many of them upon the Spot, and
carry the reſt Priſoners to the City,
where many of them receiv'd afterwards
the due Reward of their Treachery.</p>
                  <p>The Czar being over-joyed at the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of his Arms againſt theſe Mutineers,
reſolved not only to ſtay for ſome time at
this Court, but alſo to continue his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
from hence to <hi>Vienice,</hi> before his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57677:46"/>
Return into <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> I have hinted to
you before, the Chief Motive which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
His <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty to undertake
ſo long and dangerous a Journey; but
beſides this, there may be alledged ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
having a peculiar Reſpect to the
Imperial Courts. For the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the Conqueſt of <hi>Aſoph,</hi> opened
themſelves a Gate into the <hi>Palus Meotis,</hi>
and conſequently into the <hi>Black-Sea,</hi> had
all the Reaſon in the World to promiſe
themſelves the entire Conqueſt of the
<hi>Crim-Tartary,</hi> and the <hi>Tartarian Peninſula</hi>
it ſelf, if the War ſhould be carried on
but for two years longer by the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
againſt the Infidels, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Cities of <hi>Precop, Crim</hi> and
<hi>Caffa,</hi> places of no great Strength, which
could make any conſiderable Reſiſtance,
and prevent them from making themſelves
Maſters of all the Coaſt from <hi>Aſoph,</hi> to
the mouth of the River <hi>Boryſthenes,</hi> where
they had already got firm footing, by the
Conqueſt of the Fortreſs of <hi>Kaſikermeen,</hi>
in the Year 1695, and the Submiſſion of
many of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> upon the Frontiers,
to the Czar's Obedience. His <hi>Czariſh</hi>
Majeſty, who from the beginning of his
War with the <hi>Turks,</hi> had had no leſs in
view than the reducing of theſe Places,
and making himſelf Maſter of the <hi>Black-Sea,</hi>
had, before his departure out of
<hi>Muſcovy,</hi> made all the neceſſary Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for the promoting of ſo Great a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.
He had not only ſtrengthned the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57677:47"/>
City of <hi>Aſoph</hi> by ſome new Fortifications,
and erected a ſtrong Fortreſs at ſome
ſmall diſtance from thence, but had cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a new Port to be made for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
of his Navy, This Great Prince,
who perfectly underſtands the advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Situations of his Dominions for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
(one of the Main Pillars of the
Proſperity of the Commonwealth,) has,
ever ſince his Acceſſion to the Throne,
left no ſtone unturn'd, to improve it to
the utmoſt Advantage.</p>
                  <p>It is to the <hi>Muſcovites, Europe</hi> ſtands
indebted for the Diſcovery of the Way
by Land into <hi>China;</hi> and by the frequent
Embaſſy ſent by the preſent Czar into that
Country, the Way through the <hi>Great-Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi>
is as well or better known to the
<hi>Ruſſians,</hi> than ſome Provinces of their
own Empire. Several goodly Cities and
Villages have been built for the Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Carevans, And a
vaſt Tract of Ground has been incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Empire.</p>
                  <p>It is incredible of what Conſequences
the <hi>China</hi> Trade by Land, is to the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi>
who by the Help of their Sleds
drawn by <hi>Renes</hi> in the Winter-time, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
this great Journey with much Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
Many of the Vagabond <hi>Tartars,</hi>
incited by the Induſtry of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi>
Merchants trading in theſe parts, have
quitted their Solitudes, and have ſettled
themſelves in <hi>Siberia,</hi> and ſome other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> which were ſcarce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57677:47"/>
within theſe hundred years. The
Communication betwixt <hi>Muſcovy</hi> and
ſome part of the <hi>Indies,</hi> as well as the
<hi>Perſian</hi> Empire, by help of the <hi>Caſpian
Sea,</hi> as it is obvious to every body
that will but caſt an Eye upon the
Maps, ſo it is no leſs advantageous to
the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> than the <hi>China</hi> Trade. The
<hi>Banajans</hi> (the moſt Trading People of
all the <hi>Indies</hi>) have a very conſiderable
Settlement in the City of <hi>Aſtracan</hi> (the
Boundary of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> on that
ſide) from whence they furniſh <hi>Maſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi>
with all the moſt precious Things
the <hi>Indies</hi> afford, and by the continual
paſſage of Merchants and others, trading
from the City of <hi>Muſcow</hi> to <hi>Aſtracan,</hi>
and other places upon the <hi>Wolga,</hi> the
Country betwixt the <hi>Ocea</hi> and <hi>Wolga</hi>
is better ſtor'd with Villages and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
than many of the moſt Fertile Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Czar Peter Alexiovitz</hi> was as
well before, as in his late Journey, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
convinced, that all theſe Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
were but imperfect in reſpect of
what might be hoped for, if by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
his way into the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> he
could ſettle a Communication with <hi>Italy,</hi>
and ſome other provinces of <hi>Europe,</hi>
by which means the Riches of <hi>China,</hi>
of the <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
this way, to the no ſmall Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:57677:48"/>
The Conqueſt of <hi>Aſoph</hi> had opened
him the way to attain this end without
any great difficulty, conſidering the
preſent declining State of the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
Empire, and the flouriſhing Condition
of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> if he could prevail with
his Imperial Majeſty to continue the
War a few years longer againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.
It is agreed on all ſides, That his
Imperial Majeſty ſhew'd as much incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
towards continuing the War with
the <hi>Turks,</hi> than the Czar himſelf, and
would have been as forward as any of
the Confederates to ſecond the lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Zeal of His <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty, if the
preſent conjuncture had not obliged him
to prefer the Intereſt of his Country
before his Inclinations, at a time, when
the Infidels made ſuch conſiderable Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to the Confederates for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Truce or Peace.</p>
                  <p>For, beſides that, by the Animoſities
Reigning in <hi>Poland,</hi> that King was not in a
Condition to give any conſiderable diverſion
to the <hi>Turks,</hi> the Subjects of the Hereditary
Counries of his Imperial Majeſty being
exhauſted by the heavy Taxes, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
for the carrying on ſo chargeable a
War, ſtood in abſolute need of ſome
Reſpite to take breath, and the totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
State of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s health,
was a ſufficient warning to the Imperial
Court to be upon their Guard againſt <hi>France,</hi>
where vaſt Preparations were made to back
their claim to that Crown by Force.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:57677:48"/>
Theſe were the true reaſons that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
his Imperial Majeſty to conſent
ſome Months after, to a Truce of 25
years with the <hi>Ottoman Port,</hi> wherein
the <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> included; but
choſe to accept of the ſame only for
two years, for certain Reaſons of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>
I ſhall have occaſion to mention to you
anon.</p>
                  <p>On the 29th day of <hi>June,</hi> his <hi>Czariſh</hi>
Majeſty had a private Audience from the
Emperour, and deſiring to be <hi>Incognito,</hi>
he was conducted by a pair of Back-ſtairs,
to the Emperour's Antichamber, where he
was received by his Imperial Majeſty in
Perſon at the door; no body was admitted
to be preſent at this Audience beſides the
Count <hi>Wallenſtein,</hi> Lord High Chamberlain,
and the Count of <hi>Dieterichſtein,</hi> Maſter of
the Horſe to the Emperour; the Czar was
accompanied up Stairs only by the General
<hi>Le Fort,</hi> his firſt Ambaſſadour, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the place of an Interpreter betwixt
theſe two Illuſtrious Perſonages at this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview.</p>
                  <p>After the firſt Complements were paſs'd,
the Emperour put on his Hat, but finding
that the <hi>Czar</hi> remain'd uncovered, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
took off his Hat again, and remained
thus till the Interview, which laſted about
half an Hour, was paſs'd.</p>
                  <p>Some-days after, the Czar took an exact
View of the Imperial Armory, Library,
and other Rarities belonging to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Pallace, and the Emperour being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57677:49"/>
of the Czar's Inclinations towards
the Mathematicks, ſent him a Preſent of
the choiceſt Mathematical Inſtruments that
could be found.</p>
                  <p>He likewiſe invited the Czar to a very
ſplendid Entertainment, which began with
a moſt Admirable Conſort of Muſick, and
after a Magnificent Collation, ended with
a certain kind of Maſquerade, call'd in
<hi>Germany,</hi> a <hi>Wirthſhaft,</hi> frequently to be
ſeen in the Courts of the <hi>German</hi> Princes,
where the Maſter of the Feaſt always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
the Perſon of a Hoſt; no body
but perſons of the firſt Rank of both Sexes
being admitted to this Diverſion.</p>
                  <p>In this, each Masker was clad after the
Faſhion of ſome different Nation, with a
Lady in an Habit anſwerable to the ſame
Nation, ſo that the moſt remarkable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the World, being repreſented by
this illuſtrious Company, adorn'd with the
Richeſt Stuffs, and a prodigious quantity
of precious Stones, it afforded a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual,
but at the ſame time, moſt Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
and agreeable Spectacle to the
Czar.</p>
                  <p>To be ſhort, this Court, to ſhew their
utmoſt Reſpect to ſo Extraordinary a
Gueſt, ſtrove to out-vye all the reſt which
His Majeſty had viſited before; There
was nothing but Jollity and Feaſting to
be ſeen, during his Stay at <hi>Vienna;</hi> and
among others, the Count of <hi>Starenbergh,</hi>
General of the Emperour's Armies, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliz'd
himſelf on this Occaſion, having,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57677:49"/>
invited the <hi>Czar</hi> and his Ambaſſadours,
with all the Perſons of Quality of both
Sexes, then at <hi>Vienna,</hi> to a moſt ſplendid
Feaſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Czar</hi> in his Turn, took the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Day, to Entertain the
Principal Lords and Ladies of the Court,
at the Pallace of <hi>Gunterſdorff,</hi> where the
<hi>Muſcovite</hi> Ambaſſadours were lodg'd;
the Emperour ſolemniz'd the ſame by an
Artificial Fire-Work, and a fine Conſort
of Muſick.</p>
                  <p>Towards the latter end of <hi>July,</hi> the
<hi>Muſcovite</hi> Ambaſſadours had their publick
Audience of His Imperial Majeſty, which
was very ſplendid, eſpecially in reſpect of
the rich Preſents deſign'd for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
which conſiſted in the moſt precious
Ermines, and Sables, and Cloths of Gold
and Silver, born by fifty Perſons, Clad all
in black Velvet. They were receiv'd at their
Entrance into the outward Court by the
Guards in Arms, and after being admitted
to the Audience of the Emperour with
the uſual Ceremonies, were moſt ſplendid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Treated at Court, and reconducted
to their own Pallace.</p>
                  <p>It was but a few days after, when the
<hi>Czar,</hi> having taken a Reſolution to go to
<hi>Venice,</hi> in order, as it was ſuppoſed, to
concert Matters with that Republick, how
beſt to annoy the <hi>Turks</hi> at Sea, he ſent
ſome of his Train and Equippage before.
The <hi>Venetians</hi> were no ſooner inform'd of
His Majeſty's Reſolution, but they appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57677:50"/>
four Procurators of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and attend him. They ordered the
neceſſary Carriages to the Frontiers, and
the Pallace of <hi>Toſcari</hi> in the Arſenal, was
to be fitted up for his Receiption. But
when every body expected to hear of the
<hi>Czar</hi>'s Departure for <hi>Venice,</hi> great was
their Surprize when they underſtood, that
he had taken his Leave on a ſudden of the
Emperour, and was return'd with only
thirty of his moſt Truſty Servants, (among
whom were General <hi>Le Fort,</hi> and <hi>Feder
Alexiovitz, Gallowin,</hi> his two Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours)
by the Way of <hi>Polond</hi> into <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi>
leaving <hi>Procofet Bog danovitz Wolnit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin,</hi>
his third Ambaſſadour at <hi>Vienna,</hi> as
his Plenipotentiary, to manage his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
at the approaching Treaty betwixt
the <hi>Confederates</hi> and <hi>Turks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may eaſily ſuppoſe, that the whole
Court was not a little amazed at this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
Change of the <hi>Czar</hi>'s former
Reſolution, every one judging of the
Matter according to his Opinion, but the
Generality attributing it to ſome great
Commotion in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> the Truth of
which was not confirm'd to us, till ſome
time after.</p>
                  <p>I told you before, that ſoon after his
<hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty's arrival at <hi>Vienna,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the News of a Revolt among the
<hi>Strelitzes</hi> in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and of their Defeat
by General <hi>Gourdon,</hi> which made the <hi>Czar</hi>
take a Reſolution to go to <hi>Venice</hi> before his
Return into <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> but the event has
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57677:50"/>
ſhewn ſince, that they were not ſo entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſperſed, but that their Party appear'd
very formidable, notwithſtanding their
laſt Rour. For by the Confeſſion of ſome
of the Rebels that were put to the
Rack, they were back'd in this Enterprize
not only by the Princeſs <hi>Sophia,</hi> the preſent
Czar's Siſter, but alſo by a great many of
the Nobility, who had been diſguſted at
the Czar's Severity againſt ſome of their
Kindred, and by a conſiderable Part of
the Army upon the Frontiers of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Princeſs <hi>Sophia,</hi> with her Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
taking the Advantage of the Czar's
Abſence, left no ſtone unturn'd to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
into the People, that he had over-turn'd
the whole Frame of the Antient
<hi>Ruſſian</hi> Government, by reducing the
Standing Forces of the <hi>Strelitzes</hi> to ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
a Number, and depriving
Them of their moſt antient Priviledges, in
lieu of which, he had ſet over them a
great number of foreign Officers, who
were his abſolute Favourites, and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer'd
over the Natives at pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>That the Chief aim of his Journey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
foreign Parts, was to bring along with
him ſuch a Number of Foreigners, as
ſhould be able ſo entirely to ſubdue the
antient Nobility of the Empire, as to be
paſt all hopes of recovering their former
Priviledges and Dignity.</p>
                  <p>There were alſo ſome among the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
who being jealous of the Czar's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
towards theſe Foreigners, that were
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57677:51"/>
not of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, blew up the
coals, clamouring with great Zeal to their
Auditors, That their Religion was in moſt
imminent Danger, by the Encouragement
given to Foreigners of another Religion,
who, as they were the Inſtruments of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturning
the antient Foundation of the
State, ſo they would in time prove the
utter Ruine of their Religion.</p>
                  <p>To this it was added, That the Czar
being at preſent in far diſtant Countries,
they could not wiſh for a more ſeaſonable
Opportunity to recover their Loſs, by
putting the Government into the hands of
the Princeſs <hi>Sophia,</hi> which of Right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to her in the Czar's Abſence, and
which ſhe had managed with ſo much
Dexterity during her Brother's Minority.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Inſinuations were ſo prevailing
with many, that they had brought over to
their Party, not only the <hi>Strelitzes,</hi> and
other Malecontents of the Nobility, who
were ready at all times to join againſt the
Czar, but alſo ſome of the Head of the
Clergy, many of the Chief of the Army,
and among them the General that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
upon the Frontiers of <hi>Lithuania,</hi>
as likewiſe ſome Lords and Courtiers of the
firſt Rank, who were, always look'd
upon as abſolutely devoted to the Czar's
Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>Notice having been given to the Czar of
theſe Cabals againſt his Perſon and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
when he was juſt upon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
for <hi>Venice,</hi> this obliged him to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57677:51"/>
alter his Reſolution, being ſenſible
that the ſureſt meaſures he could
take at ſuch an extraordinary Juncture,
were to endeavour to divert by his Royal
Preſence, the Storm that threatned the
deſtruction of his Government in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                  <p>According to this to this Reſolution, he took
the neareſt way through <hi>Poland,</hi> with a
few of his faithful Friends, and after a
Stay of three days at <hi>Rava</hi> near <hi>Leopold,</hi>
where he had an Interview with his <hi>Poliſh</hi>
Majeſty about Matters of great Moment,
eſpecially concerning the approaching
Treaty with the <hi>Turks;</hi> he continued his
Journey with ſo much expedition, that he
appear'd in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> when his Enemies
believ'd him to have been at <hi>Venice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His ſo unexpected Appearance, as it
fill'd all his faithful Subjects with Joy,
ſo it ſtruck ſuch a Terrour into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
Party, that being thereby bereav'd
of all hopes of Succeſs, they, durſt
not as much as make any Attempt to put
their projected Deſign in execution.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty having in the mean
while, taken a firm Reſolution, to ſtrike
at the Root of this Rebellion, and to era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
Root and Branch this Factious
Crew of the <hi>Strelitzes,</hi> above two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
of them were executed in ſight of
the Princeſs <hi>Sophia,</hi> all the reſt being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
into <hi>Siberia,</hi> and ſome other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Provinces; Mary of the Nobility,
of which number were prince <hi>Colorin,</hi> and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57677:52"/>
the General <hi>Romanodokowski,</hi> with ſeveral
Ladies of Quality, ſome Fryers, and other
Prieſts of the firſt Rank, were ſome Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal'd,
ſome broken upon the Wheel, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
buried alive.</p>
                  <p>I don't queſtion but that you will look
upon theſe Tranſactions of the Czar, as
favouring of too much Severity, both in
reſpect of the Number and Quality of
thoſe on whom theſe Rigorous Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were inflicted; but if you will
call to mind the reiterated Conſpiracies,
carried on by this Party ever ſince his
<hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty's Acceſſion to the
Crown,
both againſt his Perſon and Government,
you will, I am apt to believe, be obliged
to own, that what was done upon this
Account by the Czar, was not an Effect
of his Natural Diſpoſition, which is in no
wiſe inclinable to Cruelty, but muſt be
attributed to the preſent Urgency of the
Affairs of the State, which required, that
thoſe Members, who after all the Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
had been made uſe of in vain, to
allay their malignant Humours, were now
to be treated with Corroſives, and ſuch as
were quite degenerated into an incurable
Gangrene, muſt be ſeparated from the
reſt, by cutting off the infected Parts.</p>
                  <p>You cannot be ignorant that ſince his
Majeſty's return into <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> a Truce has
been concluded with the <hi>Turks</hi> for 25
years, in reſpect of his Imperial Majeſty
and the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> but for two
years only with his <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty. The
Treaty betwixt his <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty and the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57677:52"/>
                     <hi>Turkiſh Sultan,</hi> was ſign'd under the Tents
near <hi>Carlowitz,, December</hi> the 25th, 1698,
by <hi>Procofet Bogdanovitz Wolnitzin,</hi> as
Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiary
and Ambaſſadour Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
of the Czar of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemed
Rami,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Mauro Corda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti
de Scarlati,</hi> as Plenipotentiaries of the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Port, conſiſting in theſe three
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Articles.</p>
                  <p>1. That by Vertue of this Treaty, a
Truce is concluded betwixt theſe two
Potent Empire for two years, to begin
from the 15th day of <hi>December,</hi> S. N.
1698. And that in the mean while, all
poſſible Endeavours ſhall be uſed on both
ſides, to re-ſettle a perfect Amity and
good Underſtanding betwixt both Parties,
either by a firm and perpetual Peace, or
the prolongation of this Truce for a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſpace of Years.</p>
                  <p>2. That in the mean time all Acts of
Hoſtility under what Pretence ſoever, ſhall
be forborn, and all Animoſities laid aſide
betwixt both Parties.</p>
                  <p>3. That the <hi>Chan</hi> of <hi>Crim-Tartary</hi>
ſhall
be comprehended in this Truce, who in
the mean while, ſhall be obliged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all Excurſions on his ſide. And ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
Care is to be taken on both ſides,
that none of the other <hi>Tartarian Hords,</hi>
or any of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> as well thoſe under
the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> as <hi>Ottoman</hi> Juriſdiction,
may
commit any Hoſtilities or Depredations,
ſuch of the beforementioned <hi>Tartars</hi> or
<hi>Coſſacks</hi> (whether <hi>Muſcovites</hi> or
<hi>Turks</hi>)
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57677:53"/>
that ſhall in any wiſe violate or act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to this Article, being to be exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
puniſhed by their reſpective So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns.</p>
                  <p>I am apt to imagine, that conſidering
the ſmall Space of Time concluded in
this Treaty for the Truce betwixt theſe two
Potent Princes, it will be look'd upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, who live at ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
as a Politick Contrivance of this
Court and that of <hi>Poland,</hi> to wipe off the
Blemiſh of deſerting ſo Potent an Ally,
who has given ſo conſiderable a Diverſion
to the <hi>Turks,</hi> during ſome Years of this
War; but I do not queſtion before I come
to the Concluſion of this Letter, to make
it apparent, that as the whole was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
by his <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty's Orders and
good liking, ſo the ſame is founded upon
a moſt ſolid and refined Reaſons of State,
on die ſide of the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I told you before, That the Czar of
<hi>Muſcovy,</hi> having by the Conqueſt of the
City of <hi>Aſoph,</hi> ſituate ſo near the <hi>Palus
Miotis,</hi> not only opened his Way into the
<hi>Black-Sea,</hi> but alſo to the entire Conqueſt
of the <hi>Crim-Tartary,</hi> and the whole <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nirſula,</hi>
as far as to the <hi>Boryſthenes</hi> it ſelf,
had all the Reaſon in the World, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of the Continuance of the War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Turks;</hi> and that this was one of
the Chief Motives of his Journey to the
Come of <hi>Venna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:57677:53"/>
But his <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty being made ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
ſenſible, that at this juncture of
time, the Confederates, without great
Prejudice to their own Intereſt, could
not refuſe the Advantageous Propoſitions
offered by the <hi>Turks,</hi> he could not pitch
upon a better Expedient than this Truce
of two years, to accompliſh his Great,
Deſign of either making himſelf Maſter
of the <hi>Black-Sea,</hi> or at leaſt to oblige
the <hi>Turks</hi> to grant his Subjects a free
Trade in their Ports, for the Conveniency
of Tranſporting the <hi>China, Indian, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi>
and <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Commodities into <hi>Italy,</hi>
and other Parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This will be manifeſt, if we make a
due compariſon betwixt the preſent po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of Affairs, betwixt the <hi>Turks</hi> and
<hi>Muſcovites</hi> on that ſide. For, not to
mention here the preſent flouriſhing State
of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Empire, and the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Condition of the <hi>Turks</hi> in general,
it is moſt evident, that the <hi>Ottomans</hi> lie
under no ſmall Diſadvantages, in reſpect
of the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> on that ſide.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> by the late Conqueſts
upon the <hi>Boryſthenes</hi> and <hi>Palus Miotis,</hi> by
the Submiſſion of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and <hi>Circaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian
Tartars,</hi> by ſtrengthning the old, and
erecting ſeveral new Fortreſſes in theſe
Parts, have ſo ſtrengthned their Frontiers
thereabouts, that they ſeem to be inpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable,
conſidering the powerful
Succours, they are able to ſend to the
Relief of any place that ſhall be attack'd
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57677:54"/>
by the <hi>Turks;</hi> the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Armies by
the introduction of a regular Martial
Diſcipline among them, and the vaſt
Number of well qualified foreign Officers,
who command them, being at leaſt equal,
if, not ſuperiour to the <hi>Turkiſh Janiſaries</hi>
themſelves, the Flower and Main ſtrength
of their Armies, which alſo has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to a much leſs number, by the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
they have ſuffered in the laſt
War againſt the Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>It is furthermore to be conſidered, that
the <hi>Turks</hi> having hitherto look'd upon the
<hi>Muſcovites</hi> as ſo inconſiderable, that the
<hi>Crim-Tartary</hi> was thought a ſufficient Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark
againſt them, their Fortreſſes and
Maritime Towns, though of the greateſt
Conſequence to them, in reſpect of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Dominion of the <hi>Black-Sea,</hi>
have been neglected; whereas by the Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy
of his preſent <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty, the
<hi>Muſcovite</hi> Frontiers are in a better State
than any of his other Dominions, by the
Addition of ſeveral regular Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>The Naval Strength of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> tho'
ſcarce worth mentioning a few years ago,
has by the indefatigable Care of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Czar Peter <hi>Alexiovitz,</hi> been eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon ſo good and firm a Foundation,
that the ſame is incomparably ſuperior to
the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet (which has been batter'd
ſo often by the <hi>Venetians</hi> of late) both in
reſpect of number of Ships, and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Seamen and Commanders,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57677:54"/>
of which laſt, the <hi>Czar</hi> has taken a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
number into his Service, during
his ſtay in theſe Parts.</p>
                  <p>The Treaty betwixt the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and
<hi>Turks</hi> being chiefly built upon this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
that Matters ſhould remain among
all Parties in <hi>Statuo-quo,</hi> his <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty
had little proſpect of obtaining thy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over the <hi>Black-Sea,</hi> or a free Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ports by a long Truce,
which would have given the <hi>Turks</hi> leiſure
to recover Breath, and to ſtrengthen their
Fortreſſes and Maritime Places on that
ſide; whereas two years cannot be judged
in any wiſe a proportionable time requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
for to put themſelves in a State of
defence againſt ſo Potent a Neighbour as
the <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> is at preſent; ſo
that at the expiration of theſe two years,
his <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty has all the Probability
on his ſide to obtain his aim, either by
the prolongation of this Truce, or force of
Arms.</p>
                  <p>That this is his Czariſh Majeſty's deſign,
ſeems ſufficiently probable to me from his
vaſt Preparations at Sea, being informed
from very good hands, that he has at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roniza</hi>
only near fourty ſtout Men of War,
ready to put to Sea, moſt of which carry
betwixt fifty and ſixty Guns beſides
thirty more which are to be ready and fit
for Service againſt the next Spring, and
a proportionable number of Great and
ſmall Gillies, Man'd for the moſt part
with foreign Mariners, very Expert in the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57677:55"/>
Sea-ſervice. What Force are the <hi>Turks</hi>
able to oppoſe at this time againſt ſuch a
Naval Strength, when they have not been
able to cope with the <hi>Venetians</hi> at Sea in
this laſt War? I am not ignorant that
ſome of our Politicians in this Court are
of Opinion, that when, by the intended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Canal betwixt the two Rivers, <hi>Wolga</hi> and
<hi>Don,</hi> a Communication is made with the
<hi>Caſpian-Sea,</hi> the <hi>Czar</hi> may with more
Conveniency extend his Conqueſts that
way; but conſidering, that the <hi>Caſpian-Sea</hi>
has few good Ports, and that the
<hi>Muſcovite</hi> Territories are ſeparated by
Land by vaſt Deſarts from <hi>Perſia,</hi> and
that there is a ſtrict Correſpondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
theſe two vaſt neighbouring Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires,
founded upon the Conveniency of
their mutual Commerce, I ſee no great
Reaſon why it may not be more reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſuppoſed, that, in caſe the <hi>Turks</hi> do
not by granting free Commerce to the
<hi>Muſcovites,</hi> after the expiration of this,
two Years Truce, prevent the Storm, his
<hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty ſhould not turn his Arms,
againſt them, eſpecially in the <hi>Black-Sea,</hi>
where every thing ſeems to flatter him
with hopes of Succeſs and great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
on his ſide.</p>
                  <p>I am afraid I have been too tedious
in theſe Reflections, wherefore I would
not tire your Patience, if I had not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to add, before I come to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of this Letter, concerning the
<hi>Grand-Tartary,</hi> and other Northern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57677:55"/>
betwixt the River <hi>Oby</hi> and the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi>
Wall; in the Deſcription of which,
as the antient Geographers have labour'd
with ſuch ill Succeſs, and given us their
own Inventions for Truth; and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Hiſtorians for the moſt part, have
deſcribed us inacceſſible Deſarts in lieu of
a well inhabited Country; ſo, I reckon
it will not be diſagreeable to you, if I give
you ſome Account of what I have been
able to learn concerning this Point, from
ſomld of the moſt open-hearted and moſt
ingenious among the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> during
the Stay of the late Great Embaſſy in this
Court.</p>
                  <p>I have told you before that the World was
beholding to the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the Way by Land through the
<hi>Great-Tartary</hi> into <hi>China.</hi> For the Way
by Land through <hi>India,</hi> and the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> being found al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
impracticable by reaſon of the vaſt
Deſarts; the Inhabitants of <hi>Siberia,</hi> after,
they had ſubmitted to the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi>
furniſhed them with ſufficient Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

by the Advantages of vending their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Martins to the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> at ſo exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive

                  </p>
                  <p>After the firſt diſcovery of theſe Roads,
the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> did leave no ſtone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
to make themſelves acquainted
with the Countries that lie betwixt them
and the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Wall; for which purpoſe
they uſed, under ſome pretence or other,
to ſend frequent Meſſengers into <hi>China,</hi>
who have taken divers Roads, and many
times making great Circumferences in
their Journeys, they by this means, in
proceſs of Time, made all the diſcoveries
they could wiſh for. They discovered
beſides the <hi>Oſtiakoi, Bratskoi,</hi> and <hi>Tungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſes,</hi>
who have their Habitations near the

Their Country is of a vaſt extent, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed

Rivers <hi>Chingala</hi> and <hi>Yamour.</hi> They were
the firſt that many Ages ago, entred
<hi>China,</hi> but now are Tributaries to that
Empire; which makes them much more
civiliz'd than the reſt of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> by
reaſon of their great Commerce with the

affording great ſtore of Rubies and
Pearls, which ſupply the defect of their
Cattle, which is very ſmall. They are
in their Bodies not unlike to the <hi>Crim-Tartars,</hi>
and both their Language and
Characters not unlike the <hi>Perſian,</hi> but they
write like the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> from the top down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
Though they are not altogether
ignorant of Guns and Gun-powder, yet
not being well inform'd of all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
belonging to them, they make
but ſeldom uſe of them, they are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd

Country, betwixt the River <hi>Yamour,
China, Turqueſtan,</hi> and the <hi>Calmucks,</hi> from
whom they are divided by vaſt Deſarts.
They are Govern'd by three Princes,
who have each of them ſeveral other

call'd by the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> the <hi>Weſtern-Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi>
and acknowledge in ſome meaſure,
the Authority of the Czars of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi>
by reaſon of the Neighbourhood of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beria,</hi>
and ſome other Countries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
Subject to the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Empire,
with whom they keep Traffick in Cattle,
of which they have a great Plenty, this
Country being very full of Rivers, good
Meadows and Paſtorages. They are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted
with the uſe of Fire-Arms,
and inhabit neither Towns nor Villages.</p>

The <hi>Calmuck Tartars</hi> poſſeſs that vaſt

the Command of a particular <hi>Chan,</hi> yet
they acknowledge one Principal <hi>Chan,</hi>
who deduces his Pedigree from the Great
<hi>Tamerlan,</hi> and keeps a very Noble Court
after the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Manner; They have
no fixed Habitations no more than the
<hi>Monguls,</hi> but live in Tents very Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly
contrived As they never, ſtay
long in a place, ſo they are the quickeſt
in the World at Encamping and Decam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
which is the reaſon the Czars of
<hi>Muſcovy</hi> ſeek for their Alliance, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
yearly Preſents; and theſe are very
ready to keep a good Correſpondence with
the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> for the Conveniency of
vending their Horſes and Slaves, which
they take from the other Neighbouring
<hi>Tartars.</hi> They are all inclining to an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
colour, their Eyes ſmall but ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
their Noſes ſhort and ſomewhat
flat. Their Habits are for the moſt part
the ſame, being diſtinguiſhed only from
one another, by a Tuft of Silk upon their
round Bonnets, according to the colour
of the <hi>Horde</hi> to, whom they belong.
They wear only Sheep-Skins, ſew'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the nature of Veſts, with a Cord
round their Waſte, whereon they faſten
their Bows and Quivers.</p>

                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:57677:57"/>
You may eaſily imagine, that when the
<hi>Muſcovites</hi> had once opened their Paſſage
into thoſe Parts, it was no difficult Task
for them, to ſubdue thoſe inhabiting near
their Frontiers by force of Arms, and by
the Terror of their Strength, to ſettle a
fair Correſpondence with the reſt; ſo
that following firſt the Tracts of the Rivers
<hi>Oby, Schelinga, Geneſſai</hi> and <hi>Yamour,</hi> they
built ſeveral Fortreſſes upon the ſaid Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
both to ſecure their Conqueſts, and for
the more convenient Paſſage of their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravans</hi>
to <hi>China.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt Fortreſs, which the <hi>Muſcovites</hi>
built upon the River <hi>Yumour,</hi> is called
<hi>Albazin,</hi> which, as it is not above a Months
Journey from <hi>Peking,</hi> the Capital of the
<hi>Chineſe</hi> Empire, ſo it prov'd the occaſion
of the late War betwixt the <hi>Chineſes</hi> and
<hi>Muſcovites,</hi> which was carried on for ſome
time with equal Vigour on both ſides, till
at laſt, the preſent Czar <hi>Peter Alexiovitz,</hi>
being made ſenſible by Experience of the
great Inconveniences that attended this
War on his ſide, in reference to the vaſt
diſtance of Frontiers, which are five
or ſix Months March from the City of
<hi>Muſcow;</hi> whereas on the other hand, the
<hi>Chineſes</hi> ſend their Supplies with much
more Eaſe, and infinite leſs Charge, by
reaſon of the nearneſs of the <hi>Eaſtern-Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi>
their Subjects; and the <hi>Czar</hi> having
at the ſame time a ſtrong Inclination to
come to a Rupture with the <hi>Turks,</hi> at a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57677:58"/>
Juncture when their Affairs were but in
an ill poſture, reſolved to come to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
with the <hi>Chineſes,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt meeting of the Ambaſſadours
of theſe two Potent Empires upon the
Frontiers near <hi>Albazin,</hi> proved unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> according to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Cuſtoms; inſiſting upon ſome Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
that would not in any wiſe be
granted by the <hi>Muſeovites;</hi> But the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Treaty ſucceeded according to wiſh,
the <hi>Chineſes</hi> being forced to abate of their
Pride, and to Treat the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
from that time, with all the
Reſpect due to their Character.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> having not till very
lately applied themſelves to the Sea, it is
no great wonder, if they have not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
the Paſſage by Water into <hi>China,</hi>
by the Way of the Rivers <hi>Oby, Geneſſai,</hi>
and <hi>Yamour;</hi> and in lieu thereof, have
left nothing unattempted to open their
Paſſage thither by Land. 'Tis true, the
Heaps of Ice, which for the greateſt part
of the Year are to be met with at the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of the River <hi>Oby,</hi> the many Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls
of the River <hi>Geneſſai,</hi> and the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſhes
which choak almoſt up the mouth
of the River <hi>Yamour,</hi> are Obſtacles,
which though they might have been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
by induſtrious and expert. Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
yet were ſo terrifying to the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi>
as to bereave them of all hopes of
Succeſs.</p>

                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:57677:58"/>
And to confeſs the Truth, conſidering
the Method uſed by the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Merchants
and <hi>Caravans,</hi> and the good Order taken
for their convenient Paſſge through theſe
Parts, the ſame contribute not a little to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
mitigating both the Trouble and
Charge of ſo long a Journey.</p>
                  <p>They ſet forward moſt commonly
from the City of <hi>Muſcow</hi> in <hi>February,</hi>
when the Snow being well beaten, they
travel in nineteen or twenty days, as far
as <hi>Tobolskoy,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Siberia,</hi>
eight hundred <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from the City of <hi>Muſcow.</hi> If it
happens to thaw about that time (which
is very ſeldom) they take the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of the Rivers on this and the other
ſide of the River <hi>Oby,</hi> by which means
they croſs the Country till they come
to the <hi>Oſtiakoi,</hi> the firſt of the <hi>Eaſtern-Tartars,</hi>
Subject to the <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Muſcovy.</hi>
But if the Froſt continue, they go on by
Land the ſame way, where they change
their Horſes for <hi>Renes</hi> or <hi>Rain-deers,</hi>
which carry them with incredible ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
over the Snow and Ice to the City
of <hi>Geneſſai,</hi> built by the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> upon
the River of the fame Name, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
of their Merchants traveling
in thoſe Parts; Here it is they take Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
which carry them upon the Rivers
<hi>Tonguſi</hi> and <hi>Augara,</hi> againſt the Stream,
to the Lake of <hi>Baikala.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:57677:59"/>
From this Lake, they either take
Shipping upon the River <hi>Schelinga,</hi> as
far as to a City of the ſame Name,
owing likewiſe its foundation to the
<hi>Muſcovites;</hi> or elſe proceed in their
Way by Land, immediately after they
